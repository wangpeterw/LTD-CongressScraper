Although the pathway of ObamaCare has been paved with good intentions, it has led to a series of disastrous, unintendedconsequences. To use a medical analogy, ObamaCare has made America sick; and when America is sick, rural America is in the  I represent 29 rural counties in west Texas, ag producers, oil and gas and renewable energy operators, community bankers,and community hospitals. Like many rural areas throughout the country, my district is feeding and clothing the American people,bolstering our economy, and strengthening our national security.  While large hospitals also suffer under ObamaCare, community hospitals are simply unable to handle the crushing weight ofACA's shrinking reimbursements, regulatory burden, and unfunded mandates. Since ObamaCare was implemented, 80 rural hospitalshave closed and 600 more are in danger of closing. Without access to quality health care, our hardworking families in middleAmerica are left high and dry.  The The time of the gentleman has expired.

6719,topic-id,79,"Mr.Chairman, one of the greatest travesties of ObamaCare is not just the damage that it has done to oureconomy, but the destruction of a way of life of over 60 million Americans who call small town America their home. Whether it isproducing reliable and affordable energy or a safe and abundant supply of food, people from all over the country rely on ruralcommunities to make America great.  We must repeal ObamaCare, restore market forces, and return to patient-centered care.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE                          It is the sense of Congress that--[[Page H1554]]       (1) honoring current national space commitments and      building upon investments in space across successive      Administrations demonstrates clear continuity of purpose by      the United States, in collaboration with its international,      academic, and industry partners, to extend humanity's reach      into deep space, including cis-lunar space, the Moon, the      surface and moons of Mars, and beyond;       (2) NASA leaders can best leverage investments in the      United States space program by continuing to develop a      balanced portfolio for space exploration and space science,      including continued development of the Space Launch System,      Orion, Commercial Crew Program, space and planetary science      missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope, Wide-Field      Infrared Survey Telescope, and Europa mission, and ongoing      operations of the ISS and Commercial Resupply Services      Program;       (3) a national, government-led space program that builds on      current science and exploration programs, advances human      knowledge and capabilities, and opens the frontier beyond      Earth for ourselves, commercial enterprise, and science, and      with our international partners, is of critical importance to      our national destiny and to a future guided by United States      values and freedoms;       (4) continuity of purpose and effective execution of core      NASA programs are essential for efficient use of resources in      pursuit of timely and tangible accomplishments;       (5) NASA could improve its efficiency and effectiveness by      working with industry to streamline existing programs and      requirements, procurement practices, institutional footprint,      and bureaucracy while preserving effective program oversight,      accountability, and safety;       (6) it is imperative that the United States maintain and      enhance its leadership in space exploration and space      science, and continue to expand freedom and economic      opportunities in space for all Americans that are consistent      with the Constitution of the United States; and       (7) NASA should be a multi-mission space agency, and should      have a balanced and robust set of core missions in space      science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight      and exploration, and education.     202.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Returns on the Nation's investments in science,      technology, and exploration accrue over decades-long      timeframes, and a disruption of such investments could      prevent returns from being fully realized.       (2) Past challenges to the continuity of such investments,      particularly threats regarding the cancellation of authorized      programs with bipartisan and bicameral support, have      disrupted completion of major space systems thereby--       (A) impeding planning and pursuit of national objectives in      space science and human space exploration;       (B) placing such investments in space science and space      exploration at risk; and       (C) degrading the aerospace industrial base.       (3) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration      Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155; 119      2895), National Aeronautics and Space Administration      Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-422; 122      4779), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration      Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.18301 et seq.) reflect a      broad, bipartisan agreement on the path forward for NASA's      core missions in science, space technology, aeronautics,      human space flight and exploration, and education, that      serves as the foundation for the policy updates by this       (4) Sufficient investment and maximum utilization of the      ISS and ISS National Laboratory with our international and      industry partners is--       (A) consistent with the goals and objectives of the United      States space program; and       (B) imperative to continuing United States global      leadership in human space exploration, science, research,      technology development, and education opportunities that      contribute to development of the next generation of American      scientists, engineers, and leaders, and to creating the      opportunity for economic development of low-Earth orbit.       (5) NASA has made measurable progress in the development      and testing of the Space Launch System and Orion exploration      systems with the near-term objectives of the initial      integrated test flight and launch in 2018, a human mission in      2021, and continued missions with an annual cadence in cis-     lunar space and eventually to the surface of       (6) The Commercial Crew Program has made measurable      progress toward reestablishing the capability to launch      United States government astronauts from United States soil      into low-Earth orbit by the end of 2018.       (7) The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, in its 2015 Annual      Report, urged continuity of purpose noting concerns over the      potential for cost overruns and schedule slips that could      accompany significant changes to core NASA programs.    TITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT     301. OPERATION OF THE       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) after 15 years of continuous human presence in low-     Earth orbit, the ISS continues to overcome challenges and      operate safely;       (2) the ISS is a unique testbed for future space      exploration systems development, including long-duration      space travel;       (3) the expansion of partnerships, scientific research, and      commercial applications of the ISS is essential to ensuring      the greatest return on investments made by the United States      and its international space partners in the development,      assembly, and operations of that unique facility;       (4) utilization of the ISS will sustain United States      leadership and progress in human space exploration by--       (A) facilitating the commercialization and economic      development of low-Earth orbit;       (B) serving as a testbed for technologies and a platform      for scientific research and development; and       (C) serving as an orbital facility enabling research upon--       (i) the health, well-being, and performance of humans in      space; and       (ii) the development of in-space systems enabling human      space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and       (5) the ISS provides a platform for fundamental,      microgravity, discovery-based space life and physical      sciences research that is critical for enabling space      exploration, protecting humans in space, increasing pathways      for commercial space development that depend on advances in      basic research, and contributes to advancing science,      technology, engineering, and mathematics research.       (b) Objectives.--The primary objectives of the ISS program      shall be--       (1) to achieve the long term goal and objectives under      section 202 of the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.18312);      and       (2) to pursue a research program that advances knowledge      and provides other benefits to the       (c) Continuation of the ISS.--Section 501 of the National      Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of      2010 (42 U.S.18351) is amended to read as follows:     ``501. CONTINUATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE       ``(a) Policy of the United States.--It shall be the policy      of the United States, in consultation with its international      partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete      utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.       ``(b) NASA Action.--In furtherance of the policy set forth      in subsection (a), NASA shall--       ``(1) pursue international, commercial, and      intragovernmental means to maximize ISS logistics supply,      maintenance, and operational capabilities, reduce risks to      ISS systems sustainability, and offset and minimize United      States operations costs relating to the ISS;       ``(2) utilize, to the extent practicable, the ISS for the      development of capabilities and technologies needed for the      future of human space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit; and       ``(3) utilize, if practical and cost effective, the ISS for      Science Mission Directorate missions in low-Earth orbit.''.     302. TRANSPORTATION TO       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that reliance on foreign      carriers for United States crew transfer is unacceptable, and      the Nation's human space flight program must acquire the      capability to launch United States government astronauts on      vehicles using United States rockets from United States soil      as soon as is safe, reliable, and affordable to do so.       (b) Sense of Congress on Commercial Crew Program and      Commercial Resupply Services Program.--It is the sense of      Congress that--       (1) once developed and certified to meet the      Administration's safety and reliability requirements, United      States commercially provided crew transportation systems can      serve as the primary means of transporting United States      government astronauts and international partner astronauts to      and from the ISS and serving as ISS crew rescue vehicles;       (2) previous budgetary assumptions used by the      Administration in its planning for the Commercial Crew      Program assumed significantly higher funding levels than were      authorized and appropriated by Congress;       (3) credibility in the Administration's budgetary estimates      for the Commercial Crew Program can be enhanced by an      independently developed cost estimate;       (4) such credibility in budgetary estimates is an important      factor in understanding program risk;       (5) United States access to low-Earth orbit is paramount to      the continued success of the ISS and ISS National Laboratory;       (6) a stable and successful Commercial Resupply Services      Program and Commercial Crew Program are critical to ensuring      timely provisioning of the ISS and to reestablishing the      capability to launch United States government astronauts from      United States soil into orbit, ending reliance upon Russian      transport of United States government astronauts to the ISS      which has not been possible since the retirement of the Space      Shuttle program in 2011;       (7) NASA should build upon the success of the Commercial      Orbital Transportation Services Program and Commercial      Resupply Services Program that have allowed private sector      companies to partner with NASA to[[Page H1555]]     deliver cargo and scientific experiments to the ISS since      2012;       (8) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program has enabled      significant modernization and infrastructure improvements at      launch sites across the United States to support NASA's      Commercial Resupply Services Program and other civil and      commercial space flight missions; and       (9) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should be      continued in a manner that leverages State and private      investments to achieve the goals of that program.       (c) Reaffirmation.--Congress reaffirms--       (1) its commitment to the use of a commercially developed,      private sector launch and delivery system to the ISS for crew      missions as expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155;      119 2895), the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-422;      122 4779), and the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.18301 et      seq.); and       (2) the requirement under section 50111(b)(1)(A) of title      51, United States Code, that the Administration shall make      use of United States commercially provided ISS crew transfer      and crew rescue services to the maximum extent practicable.

FINDINGS ON HUMAN SPACE       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) In accordance with section 204 of the National      Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of      2010 (124 2813), the National Academies of Sciences,      Engineering, and Medicine, through its Committee on Human      Spaceflight, conducted a review of the goals, core      capabilities, and direction of human space flight, and      published the findings and recommendations in a 2014 report      entitled, ``Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and      Approaches for a U.Program of Human Space Exploration''.       (2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders      from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy      communities.       (3) With input from the public, the Committee on Human      Spaceflight concluded that many practical and aspirational      rationales for human space flight together constitute a      compelling case for continued national investment and pursuit      of human space exploration toward the horizon goal of       (4) According to the Committee on Human Spaceflight, the      rationales include economic benefits, national security,      national prestige, inspiring students and other citizens,      scientific discovery, human survival, and a sense of shared      destiny.       (5) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars      is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space flight      program.       (6) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that      NASA define a series of sustainable steps and conduct mission      planning and technology development as needed to achieve the      long-term goal of placing humans on the surface of       (7) Expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and      advancing toward human missions to Mars requires early      planning and timely decisions to be made in the near-term on      the necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve      short-term and long-term goals and objectives.       (8) In addition to the 2014 report described in paragraph      (1), there are several independently developed reports or      concepts that describe potential Mars architectures or      concepts and identify Mars as the long-term goal for human      space exploration, including NASA's ``The Global Exploration      Roadmap'' of 2013, ``NASA's Journey to Mars-Pioneering Next      Steps in Space Exploration'' of 2015, NASA Jet Propulsion      Laboratory's ``Minimal Architecture for Human Journeys to      Mars'' of 2015, and Explore Mars' ``The Humans to Mars Report      2016''.     432. HUMAN EXPLORATION       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and      advancing toward human missions to Mars in the 2030s requires      early strategic planning and timely decisions to be made in      the near-term on the necessary courses of action for      commitments to achieve short-term and long-term goals and      objectives;[[Page H1559]]       (2) for strong and sustained United States leadership, a      need exists to advance a human exploration roadmap,      addressing exploration objectives in collaboration with      international, academic, and industry partners;       (3) an approach that incrementally advances toward a long-     term goal is one in which nearer-term developments and      implementation would influence future development and      implementation; and       (4) a human exploration roadmap should begin with low-Earth      orbit, then address in greater detail progress beyond low-     Earth orbit to cis-lunar space, and then address future      missions aimed at human arrival and activities near and then      on the surface of       (b) Human Exploration Roadmap.--       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall develop a human      exploration roadmap, including a critical decision plan, to      expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit to the surface      of Mars and beyond, considering potential interim      destinations such as cis-lunar space and the moons of       (2) Scope.--The human exploration roadmap shall include--       (A) an integrated set of exploration, science, and other      goals and objectives of a United States human space      exploration program to achieve the long-term goal of human      missions near or on the surface of Mars in the 2030s;       (B) opportunities for international, academic, and industry      partnerships for exploration-related systems, services,      research, and technology if those opportunities provide cost-     savings, accelerate program schedules, or otherwise benefit      the goals and objectives developed under subparagraph (A);       (C) sets and sequences of precursor missions in cis-lunar      space and other missions or activities necessary--       (i) to demonstrate the proficiency of the capabilities and      technologies identified under subparagraph (D); and       (ii) to meet the goals and objectives developed under      subparagraph (A), including anticipated timelines and      missions for the Space Launch System and Orion;       (D) an identification of the specific capabilities and      technologies, including the Space Launch System, Orion, a      deep space habitat, and other capabilities, that facilitate      the goals and objectives developed under subparagraph (A);       (E) a description of how cis-lunar elements, objectives,      and activities advance the human exploration of Mars;       (F) an assessment of potential human health and other      risks, including radiation exposure;       (G) mitigation plans, whenever possible, to address the      risks identified in subparagraph (F);       (H) a description of those technologies already under      development across the Federal Government or by other      entities that facilitate the goals and objectives developed      under subparagraph (A);       (I) a specific process for the evolution of the      capabilities of the fully integrated Orion with the Space      Launch System and a description of how these systems      facilitate the goals and objectives developed under      subparagraph (A) and demonstrate the capabilities and      technologies described in subparagraph (D);       (J) a description of the capabilities and technologies that      need to be demonstrated or research data that could be gained      through the utilization of the ISS and the status of the      development of such capabilities and technologies;       (K) a framework for international cooperation in the      development of all capabilities and technologies identified      under this section, including an assessment of the risks      posed by relying on international partners for capabilities      and technologies on the critical path of development;       (L) a process for partnering with nongovernmental entities      using Space Act Agreements or other acquisition instruments      for future human space exploration; and       (M) include information on the phasing of planned      intermediate destinations, Mars mission risk areas and      potential risk mitigation approaches, technology requirements      and phasing of required technology development activities,      the management strategy to be followed, related ISS      activities, planned international collaborative activities,      potential commercial contributions, and other activities      relevant to the achievement of the goal established in this      section.       (3) Considerations.--In developing the human exploration      roadmap, the Administrator shall consider--       (A) using key exploration capabilities, namely the Space      Launch System and Orion;       (B) using existing commercially available technologies and      capabilities or those technologies and capabilities being      developed by industry for commercial purposes;       (C) establishing an organizational approach to ensure      collaboration and coordination among NASA's Mission      Directorates under section 821, when appropriate, including      to collect and return to Earth a sample from the Martian      surface;       (D) building upon the initial uncrewed mission, EM-1, and      first crewed mission, EM-2, of the Space Launch System and      Orion to establish a sustainable cadence of missions      extending human exploration missions into cis-lunar space,      including anticipated timelines and milestones;       (E) developing the robotic and precursor missions and      activities that will demonstrate, test, and develop key      technologies and capabilities essential for achieving human      missions to Mars, including long-duration human operations      beyond low-Earth orbit, space suits, solar electric      propulsion, deep space habitats, environmental control life      support systems, Mars lander and ascent vehicle, entry,      descent, landing, ascent, Mars surface systems, and in-situ      resource utilization;       (F) demonstrating and testing 1 or more habitat modules in      cis-lunar space to prepare for Mars missions;       (G) using public-private, firm fixed-price partnerships,      where practicable;       (H) collaborating with international, academic, and      industry partners, when appropriate;       (I) any risks to human health and sensitive onboard      technologies, including radiation exposure;       (J) any risks identified through research outcomes under      the NASA Human Research Program's Behavioral Health Element;      and       (K) the recommendations and ideas of several independently      developed reports or concepts that describe potential Mars      architectures or concepts and identify Mars as the long-term      goal for human space exploration, including the reports      described under section 431.       (4) Critical decision plan on human space exploration.--As      part of the human exploration roadmap, the Administrator      shall include a critical decision plan--       (A) identifying and defining key decisions guiding human      space exploration priorities and plans that need to be made      before June 30, 2020, including decisions that may guide      human space exploration capability development, precursor      missions, long-term missions, and activities;       (B) defining decisions needed to maximize efficiencies and      resources for reaching the near, intermediate, and long-term      goals and objectives of human space exploration; and       (C) identifying and defining timelines and milestones for a      sustainable cadence of missions beginning with EM-3 for the      Space Launch System and Orion to extend human exploration      from cis-lunar space to the surface of       (5) Reports.--       (A) Initial human exploration roadmap.--The Administrator      shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress--       (i) an initial human exploration roadmap, including a      critical decision plan, before December 1, 2017; and       (ii) an updated human exploration roadmap periodically as      the Administrator considers necessary but not less than      biennially.       (B) Contents.--Each human exploration roadmap under this      paragraph shall include a description of--       (i) the achievements and goals accomplished in the process      of developing such capabilities and technologies during the      2-year period prior to the submission of the human      exploration roadmap; and       (ii) the expected goals and achievements in the following      2- year period.       (C) Submission with budget.--Each human exploration roadmap      under this section shall be included in the budget for that      fiscal year transmitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of      title 31, United States     433. ADVANCED SPACE SUIT       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this      Act, the Administrator shall submit to the appropriate      committees of Congress a detailed plan for achieving an      advanced space suit capability that aligns with the crew      needs for exploration enabled by the Space Launch System and      Orion, including an evaluation of the merit of delivering the      planned suit system for use on the     434. ASTEROID ROBOTIC REDIRECT       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) NASA initially estimated that the Asteroid Robotic      Redirect Mission would launch in December 2020 and cost no      more than $1,250,000,000, excluding launch and operations.       (2) On July 15, 2016, NASA conducted its Key Decision      Point-B review of the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission or      approval for Phase B in mission formulation.       (3) During the Key Decision Point-B review, NASA estimated      that costs have grown to $1,400,000,000 excluding launch and      operations for a launch in December 2021 and the agency must      evaluate whether to accept the increase or reduce the      Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission's scope to stay within the      cost cap set by the       (4) In April 2015, the NASA Advisory Council--       (A) issued a finding that--       (i) high-performance solar electric propulsion will likely      be an important part of an architecture to send humans to      Mars; and       (ii) maneuvering a large test mass is not necessary to      provide a valid in-space test of a new solar electric      propulsion stage;       (B) determined that a solar electric propulsion mission      will contribute more directly to the goal of sending humans      to Mars if the mission is focused entirely on development and      validation of the solar electric propulsion stage; and       (C) determined that other possible motivations for      acquiring and maneuvering a boulder, such as asteroid science      and planetary defense, do not have value commensurate with      their probable cost.       (5) The Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission is competing for      resources with other critical exploration development      programs, including the Space Launch System, Orion,      commercial crew, and a habitation module.[[Page H1560]]       (6) In 2014, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that      NASA conduct an independent cost and technical assessment of      the Asteroid Robotic Redirect       (7) In 2015, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that      NASA preserve the following key objectives if the program      needed to be descoped:       (A) Development of high power solar electric propulsion.       (B) Ability to maneuver in a low gravity environment in      deep space.       (8) In January 2015 and July 2015, the NASA Advisory      Council expressed its concern to NASA about the potential for      growing costs for the program and highlighted that choices      would need to be made about the program's content.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the technological and scientific goals of the Asteroid      Robotic Redirect Mission have not been demonstrated to      Congress to be commensurate with the cost; and       (2) alternative missions may provide a more cost effective      and scientifically beneficial means to demonstrate the      technologies needed for a human mission to Mars that would      otherwise be demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect            (c) Evaluation and Report.--Not later than 180 days after      the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall--       (1) conduct an evaluation of--       (A) alternative approaches to the Asteroid Robotic Redirect      Mission for demonstrating the technologies and capabilities      needed for a human mission to Mars that would otherwise be      demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission;       (B) the scientific and technical benefits of the      alternative approaches under subparagraph (A) to future human      space exploration compared to scientific and technical      benefits of the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission;       (C) the commercial benefits of the alternative approaches      identified in subparagraph (A), including the impact on the      development of domestic solar electric propulsion technology      to bolster United States competitiveness in the global      marketplace; and       (D) a comparison of the estimated costs of the alternative      approaches identified in subparagraph (A); and       (2) submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a      report on the evaluation under paragraph (1), including any      recommendations.     435. MARS 2033       (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall contract with      an independent, non-governmental systems engineering and      technical assistance organization to study a Mars human space      flight mission to be launched in 2033.       (b) Contents.--The study shall include--       (1) a technical development, test, fielding, and operations      plan using the Space Launch System, Orion, and other systems      to successfully launch such a Mars human space flight mission      by 2033;       (2) an annual budget profile, including cost estimates, for      the technical development, test, fielding, and operations      plan to carry out a Mars human space flight mission by 2033;      and       (3) a comparison of the annual budget profile to the 5-year      budget profile contained in the President's budget request      for fiscal year 2017 under section 1105 of title 31, United      States       (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the      appropriate committees of Congress a report on the study,      including findings and recommendations regarding the Mars      2033 human space flight mission described in subsection (a).       (d) Assessment.--Not later than 60 days after the date the      report is submitted under subsection (c), the Administrator      shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress an      assessment by the NASA Advisory Council of whether the      proposal for a Mars human space flight mission to be launched      in 2033 is in the strategic interests of the United States in      space exploration.                    Subtitle D--TREAT Astronauts Act     441. SHORT       This subtitle may be cited as the ``To Research, Evaluate,      Assess, and Treat Astronauts Act'' or the ``TREAT Astronauts      Act''.     442. FINDINGS; SENSE OF       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Human space exploration can pose significant challenges      and is full of substantial risk, which has ultimately claimed      the lives of 24 NASA astronauts serving in the line of duty.       (2) As United States government astronauts participate in      long-duration and exploration space flight missions they may      experience increased health risks, such as vision impairment,      bone demineralization, and behavioral health and performance      risks, and may be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation.      Exposure to high levels of radiation and microgravity can      result in acute and long-term health consequences that can      increase the risk of cancer and tissue degeneration and have      potential effects on the musculoskeletal system, central      nervous system, cardiovascular system, immune function, and      vision.       (3) To advance the goal of long-duration and exploration      space flight missions, United States government astronaut      Scott Kelly participated in a 1-year twins study in space      while his identical twin brother, former United States      government astronaut Mark Kelly, acted as a human control      specimen on Earth, providing an understanding of the      physical, behavioral, microbiological, and molecular reaction      of the human body to an extended period of time in space.       (4) Since the Administration currently provides medical      monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment for United States      government astronauts during their active employment, given      the unknown long-term health consequences of long-duration      space exploration, the Administration has requested statutory      authority from Congress to provide medical monitoring,      diagnosis, and treatment to former United States government      astronauts for psychological and medical conditions      associated with human space flight.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the United States should continue to seek the unknown      and lead the world in space exploration and scientific      discovery as the Administration prepares for long-duration      and exploration space flight in deep space and an eventual      mission to Mars;       (2) data relating to the health of astronauts will become      increasingly valuable to improving our understanding of many      diseases humans face on Earth;       (3) the Administration should provide the type of      monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment described in subsection      (a) only for conditions the Administration considers unique      to the training or exposure to the space flight environment      of United States government astronauts and should not require      any former United States Government astronauts to participate      in the Administration's monitoring;       (4) such monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment should not      replace a former United States government astronaut's private      health insurance;       (5) expanded data acquired from such monitoring, diagnosis,      and treatment should be used to tailor treatment, inform the      requirements for new space flight medical hardware, and      develop controls in order to prevent disease occurrence in      the astronaut corps; and       (6) the 340-day space mission of Scott Kelly aboard the      ISS--       (A) was pivotal for the goal of the United States for      humans to explore deep space and Mars as the mission      generated new insight into how the human body adjusts to      weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and the stress of long-     duration space flight; and       (B) will help support the physical and mental well-being of      astronauts during longer space exploration missions in the      future.     443.

6819,topic-id,596,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017. This bipartisan and bicameral bill grew to maturity through many long and serious discussions about the future of our Nation's space program.  I am encouraged by the bill's persistent emphasis on the continuity of purpose and stability. It is crucial that we continue to support NASA's ongoing human exploration efforts.  I am proud to note the inclusion of the To Research Evaluate, Assess, and Treat Astronauts Act, better known as the TREAT Astronauts Act, which will ensure that our Nation's astronauts receive support for medical issues associated with their service. The language of this bill is exactly the same as the TREAT Astronauts Act that was passed in the House on December 7, 2016.  As a medical professional myself, I care deeply about this issue. I am honored to have sponsored the original legislation, and am proud to contribute to an important program that will support the brave men and women of our astronaut corps. Outer space poses many medical challenges. The human body simply is not designed to thrive in microgravity, or weightlessness. We know that spending time in space is risky. We want to understand the reasons why the TREAT Astronauts Act will ensure the retention of our astronauts' medical data and help to continue our research in aerospace medicine, while also providing our astronauts with the medical care that they need and deserve after risking so much in service to our country.  This bill continues support for the important work on the Space Launch System, the Orion crew vehicle, and commercial cargo and crew programs.[[Page H1569]]                                {time}  1815  The future of the International Space Station is another key topic addressed in this legislation. We are committed to operating the ISS until 2024. Beyond that date, however, maintaining NASA's current level of support for the ISS will dramatically affect the rest of NASA's portfolio, particularly in human spaceflight.  This bill opens the debate about how and under what circumstances NASA's presence in low-Earth orbit can and should be continued beyond 2024. Balancing NASA's presence and low Earth orbit and beyond low Earth orbit will require thoughtful and informed decisionmaking. My hope is that NASA will explore unique partnerships that will maintain NASA's ability to utilize low Earth orbit in an efficient manner by leveraging private sector investment. This bill will help inform and frame that imminent debate.  This bill also addresses NASA's facilities and infrastructure here on NASA must develop a plan so that its labs, tools, facilities, and infrastructure can support a robust exploration agenda. Right-sizing NASA's footprint is a longstanding challenge. We must maintain critical capabilities but also find efficiencies where they may exist.  The bill before us would call on NASA to develop a policy to ensure that NASA maintains infrastructure to support bold exploration. If NASA determines that facilities are not necessary or could be transferred to the private sector, the bill calls on NASA to do so in accordance with a transparent and equitable process.  The bill also urges the administration to pursue a sensible policy on termination liability so that NASA makes the best possible use of taxpayer dollars rather than the inefficient policy implemented by the previous administration.  This bill sets out clear intentions for NASA as we move forward into the next chapter of American space exploration. I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

6666,topic-id,1743,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to join my colleagues--Democrats, Independents--to fight together to protect the health and economic security of the American people.  In 2012, when I was elected to the Senate, I can assure you that the people of Wisconsin did not send me here to take their health care away.  We are barely into the second week of the new Congress, and the Republican establishment is already wielding its power to accomplish just one thing, making America sick again.  The budget resolution that we are considering this week will repeal the Affordable Care Act, put insurance companies back in charge of people's health care, strip health care away from millions of Americans, and raise premiums. It will take us from affordable coverage to chaos.  This is the first step toward higher costs, fewer people with health insurance, and more uncertainty for American families. In short, the Republicans believe they have a mandate to make America sick. By repealing the law and taking away the health care that families already have, Republicans are forcing 30 million Americans to lose their insurance.  Republicans are putting the health care coverage of over 200,000 Wisconsinites at risk, and they are raising taxes on more than 190,000 Wisconsinites who rely on and receive premium tax credits to help them afford high quality health insurance.  Instead, they are giving tax breaks to big corporations and handing over control to the insurance companies, which will be free, once again, to deny coverage if you have a preexisting condition, to jack up premiums simply because you are a woman, and to drop your coverage if you get sick or have a baby.  I could continue to list some very disturbing facts and statistics of what this Republican repeal of health care reform will do to our working class and what it will mean to rip away protections from families struggling with cancer or other serious illnesses, but these facts seem to fall flat on the other side of the aisle. So, instead, I am demanding that my Republican colleagues listen--not to me but to the calls from the real people who we are here to represent and fight for, our constituents back home.  I demand that they listen to Randy is from Rhinelander, Randy told me that the Affordable Care Act has been a ``savior'' for his wife, who was diagnosed with kidney failure more than 2 years ago as a result of an autoimmune disease. She has to have dialysis three times a week.  The law eliminated her lifetime maximum limit, and that helps them afford her lifesaving care, and it prevents her from being denied coverage because of her preexisting condition.  Randy said that repealing the law will force them to face the harsh reality of not only losing insurance but also declaring bankruptcy.  I also heard from Sheila, from Neenah, Sheila is a small business owner who relies on the premium tax credits that helped her purchase her health plan through the marketplace. She writes:       I just wanted to let you know how devastating it will be      for my family if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. To take      away the subsidies would pretty much turn the plan into the      Unaffordable Care  Sheila has owned a small hair salon for 35 years and said that the premium tax credits under the law have made it possible for her to buy decent health insurance for the first time in her whole career.  I want my Republican colleagues to listen to Joel is a physician from He is on the frontlines of delivering high quality health care, and he told me that he had witnessed tremendous good that has occurred as a result of the health care law. He has been able to provide his patients with better care because they have increased coverage. He is especially aware of the positive impact of allowing children to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26.  But Joel remembers the days before the Affordable Care He said that he has seen firsthand the insurance companies callously denying or dropping coverage for families with preexisting conditions or those struggling with a new diagnosis. He doesn't want to go back to the days when insurance companies were in charge and literally dictated his patients' health.  I want my Republican colleagues to listen to Chelsea from Shelby, When Chelsea was pregnant with her daughter Zoe, she learned that Zoe would be born with a congenital heart defect. At just 5 days old, Zoe had to have open heart surgery. She had it at Children's Hospital in Wauwatosa, WI, and was fighting for her life. Thankfully, she is recovering, and she is living a healthy life.  Chelsea wrote to me:       The Affordable Care Act protects my daughter, it allows her      to have health care access and not be denied. I'm pleading to      you as a mother to fight for that and follow through on that      promise. There are so many kids in Wisconsin with heart      defects (as well as other kids with pre-existing conditions)      that are counting on you to protect that right.  So for Zoe, I want to call on my Republican colleagues to stand with me--with all of us--to protect these health care rights and benefits for all of our families.  These are our families who are benefitting right now from the protections in the law and the quality, affordable health care options it provides. They are calling on Congress, calling on the Republican majority to stop their plot that is going to take this all away.  I could continue to share stories of real Wisconsinites whose coverage is at risk today, but I want to take a moment to illustrate what life was like before the Affordable Care Act was the law of the land, before these sweeping reforms and protections had been put in place.  Now, during my time in the House of Representatives, Sue from Beloit, WI, reached out to me. She told me:       My husband was diagnosed with lung cancer. After treatment      began, we found out that the insurance company had a small      loophole. Under our insurance, they have a $13,000 limit per      year on radiation and chemotherapy.       That amount did not even cover the first treatment of      either radiation or chemo.[[Page S171]]       I was not going to have my husband die for lack of      treatment, so we started to use our savings and our available      credit to pay for medical expenses.       My husband later died.  She told me:       After having completely depleted our savings and facing      insurmountable credit card debt, I had no choice but to file      bankruptcy. . . .  Sue's devastating ordeal was a common story all across our country, almost 8 years ago, before health care reform was enacted to prohibit lifetime caps and to restrict annual limits on care.  Before the health law, I heard from too many working Wisconsin families that went bankrupt, sold their homes, and even spent their entire life's savings just to get the health care that they needed. This was when America was sick and when lawmakers prioritized the health of insurance companies over the health of the American people. Republicans will take us back to those days when they vote to make America sick again.  I want to share one last story about life before the Affordable Care Act, and that is my own. As many of you may know, I was raised by my maternal grandparents in Madison, When I was just 9 years old, I was diagnosed with a serious childhood illness similar to spinal meningitis, and I spent 3 months at the age of 9 years old in the hospital. My grandparents had health insurance but learned that their plan didn't cover me. Since their insurance didn't cover me, they made incredible sacrifices to pay for the care that I needed. When I got better, my grandparents did what any responsible parent or grandparent would do: They looked for an insurance policy that would cover me into the future, but look as they might, they discovered that because of my previous illness, they couldn't find a policy. They couldn't find it from any insurer at any price, and at 9 years old I had been branded with those magic words: preexisting condition.  Well, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, children today have new protections, and no one can be denied insurance coverage because of a preexisting condition. My family experience helped inspire me to enter public service and to fight to ensure that every American has quality, affordable health care as a right, not a privilege. This is what I fought for and will continue to fight with my colleagues to protect, these vital benefits that the health care law guarantees to all Wisconsinites and families across this great country.  But we cannot fight alone. Republicans are hard at work making America sick again, taking us back from affordable care to chaos, handing over the reins to insurance companies and driving up health care costs for all I call on them to stand accountable to our families. It is the American people that we are charged to represent. I call on them to join us to fight for Sue who was forced into medical bankruptcy. I call on them to fight to protect Zoe from predatory insurance companies who want to deny her coverage because of her heart condition, to fight for Sheila and other entrepreneurs like her, and to fight for our health care professionals, nurse's aides, occupational therapists, physical therapists like Joel, and to fight for Randy and his wife as they battle her kidney failure.  We have been ready for over 6 years to work together to keep all that works with the Affordable Care Act and to fix what doesn't, but instead of working on bipartisan reforms to improve the Affordable Care Act, this Republican plan to repeal historic health care reforms will create nothing short of chaos. I know I speak for my colleagues, my Democratic colleagues and Independent colleagues, in saying that we are here and we will stay here on the floor because we are ready. We are ready to work across the aisle to protect coverage and to improve the Affordable Care Act, but we will not help you make America sick again and we will not help you take away people's health care.

We have dropped from 14 percent to 7 percent, really importantly from the point of view of saving money. The amount of uncompensated care has gone down by 30 percent. So those are at the hospital. Those are statistics, but the letters tell the human dimension, the human story that so often is lost in the Chambers of this  A letter from Kathryn from Denver who wrote:       The Affordable Care Act has been crucial to my family the      last several years. . . . My sister, a Type 1 diabetic since      age 10, is now a Colorado business owner.       The Affordable Care Act allowed her to pursue business      ownership because--for the first time in her life--she could      get individual health insurance coverage without being denied      due to her preexisting condition. ACA allowed her to leave      her full-time job and start a part-time business and get      benefits through       I truly believe so much good has begun to come from this      legislation and repealing it will have catastrophic      consequences for my family and for so many others.  Terry from Denver writes:       I am writing concerning the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In      2010, I left my conventional job and took a risk, forming a      company to perform engineering consulting services. Since      that time, I have helped multiple organizations improve the      safety and reliability of their products and consider my      efforts to be quite successful.       However, I would not have taken the chance to go off on my      own if it had not been for the Affordable Care Act (ACA).       The ACA gave me options in health insurance that I would      not have had prior to its passage. There are millions of      people like me who count on the security of the These      people are entrepreneurs, freelancers, the self-employed,      early retirees, and the like who would not have health      insurance if not for the       Therefore, I am asking you to continue your support for the       Catherine, a nurse from Aurora:       I want to tell you a personal story, in the hopes that you      will think about the people in your state who might be      affected if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.

When we had to bring her home from college, we were      terrified about what might happen to her and where she would      find treatment.       Because of the Affordable Care Act, she was able to stay on      our insurance for the next 3 years, even though she was no      longer a student.  That is one of the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care       Although it was a long process and not easy, we were able      to help find quality mental health care providers and her      care was covered because of provisions in the law that      provided for mental health coverage.  Provisions that I know the Senator from Michigan worked on.       She is now doing very well. She is married and able to work      part time and function as an active member of society.       As a nurse, I have cared for many people over the years who      had chronic conditions through no fault of their own. Before      this law was passed, many would not get insurance, or if they      did, the cost was beyond their reach.  Nicholas from Denver:       My wife was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer at the age      of 38, almost 4 years ago. We have been living with it as a      chronic disease and she is in stable condition.       Health care costs have been about $15,000 a year for us out      of pocket, but we've been able to manage because of the      protections afforded by the ACA, specifically no caps on      annual or lifetime benefits and no denials for preexisting      conditions. . . .       Please assure me you will do all you can to keep those      protections we so desperately rely on from disappearing.  Sarah writes:       On June 20, 2016, my second child, my daughter Emma, was      born. . . . She was born six weeks early and weighed 3 lbs.      10 oz. At birth. We knew prior to her birth that she had a      heart defect (a hole in her heart) that would need to be      repaired through open-heart surgery during the first year of      her life.       We also knew that she wasn't growing properly and she might      have other issues. . . . During the past five months, Emma      has undergone more surgeries and procedures than most people      will undergo in their entire lives. . . . I haven't recently      tallied the cost of Emma's medical care, but I believe she      will easily reach $1 million (or much) in medical expenses      before she turns 1.       I have become extremely anxious about how my family will      meet Emma's ongoing needs if the ACA is repealed and      insurance companies are allowed to reinstate lifetime      maximums and to discriminate against preexisting conditions.      . . .       I beseech you to do everything you can to preserve the      provisions that will help my family--and to do everything      possible to ensure that the millions who have finally been      able to acquire health insurance since the ACA was passed      don't lose their insurance.  People have received probably hundreds of thousands of these letters in the It seems to me--I mean, yes, we should be having a conversation about how to make the law better. I have said from the very beginning that I don't think it is perfect. I think there were big problems with our health care system before we passed the Affordable Care I think there are big health care problems with our health care system today. That is a fact that anybody in America ought to be able to notice. And the Senate ought to be able to notice that and say: Why don't we make it better? Why don't we improve it? We should improve it.  I would love to meet with colleagues here to talk about how we deal with the fact that in rural Colorado, there is not enough competition in health insurance for people. I would love to be able to have a conversation here about how to drive the cost of insurance down in rural Colorado, rather than continue to see those costs increase.  I would say this. If there is somebody here with a solution to that problem, on either side of the aisle, I would be happy to write that amendment with them. But the problem I have with where we are in this debate--and I will close with this--is that we are talking about throwing out all the protections that all of these people have come to rely upon, that all of these people have come to count on in America with our health care system. We are going to throw them out, but we are not going to tell you what we are going to put in its place. In fact, for all you know, we are not going to put anything in its place because what we have heard is that there is no consensus on the other side about how we should move forward.  Part of the problem I have had with this legislation since the beginning is that we have been unable to forge a bipartisan consensus on how to deal with the fact that this country is spending 16 percent of its GDP on health care when every other industrialized country in the world is spending about half that or, in some cases, less than half that and delivering better results. I would love to see a bipartisan consensus. But what we have come to understand in the days leading up to this debate is that there is not a consensus on the Republican side about how we should go forward.  After 7 or 8 years, you would think we would have the opportunity to see a plan. It is not hard to think about what the values would be underlying a plan--the values that would say: Let's[[Page S170]]try to maximize coverage where we can. Let's try to increase quality where we can. Let's try to drive prices down where we can. Let's try to spend less, as a country, on health care where we can.  Those are not Democratic or Republican ideals. It would seem to me that those values would have the virtue of being able to inform Democratic pieces of legislation and Republican pieces of legislation. But in 8 years, we haven't seen a plan.  Here we are tonight, talking about repealing the protections that Coloradans are counting on every single day for their peace of mind and so they can plan for the sake of putting nothing in its place. It reminds me--and, colleagues, I will close with this--of the complaints that I have had in my office and as I travel the State of Colorado, where people say: Michael, we paid into our health insurance company. Month after month after month, we paid our premiums. Then, when my kid got sick and I called them up, their response was to keep me on the phone as long as possible without an answer in the hope that I would give up and go home and that the claim wouldn't have to be paid.  To be honest, colleagues, I have heard that before we passed the Affordable Care Act, and I have heard that since we have passed the Affordable Care We have more to do. That is the honest thing to say here.  But for us to talk about repealing this, taking away the benefits that people have, the protections that people have, the security and peace of mind that people have, and replacing it with the equivalent of leaving the American people on hold so they will give up, so they will move on to the next thing is beneath the dignity of this place and is not worthy of the Members of the  I want to close by saying what I have always said. I will work with anybody--Democrat or Republican--to make sure that we really do have affordable health care in this country for the American people, for the people whom I represent in Colorado, and I look forward to our getting to a place where that is the politics we are pursuing in this Chamber, instead of the politics we have seen over the past number of years.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgS161-3.txt,1965,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCALYEAR 2017,2017.0,9.0,January
6821,topic-id,269,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member and the chairman for this bill.  This bicameral and bipartisan bill that we are considering today, the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017, authorizes NASA's appropriations for the fiscal year 2017.  If enacted, the bill's provisions will provide important stability and funding and consistent vision that we need for NASA to succeed as they continue to make progress across disciplines of space and earth science, in human exploration and spaceflight, innovative technologies, biomedical research, and in aeronautics.  Mr.Speaker, NASA truly is a symbol of American excellence and ingenuity. For NASA to continue doing the great things that it does, including preparation for flying SLS and Orion, launching the James Webb Space Telescope, and landing humans on Mars, it is critical that 442 be enacted.  And while I would have preferred a more comprehensive outlook of NASA's science discipline--namely, in earth science, planetary science, astrophysics, and heliophysics--I am pleased the bill provides the consistent policy direction our Nation's space and aeronautics programs require and deserve. Notably, the bill sets the long-term course of sending humans to the surface of Mars and directs NASA to provide a human exploration roadmap outlining the capabilities and milestones needed to achieve the goal.  In closing, Mr.Speaker, NASA's space and aeronautics programs help maintain our competitiveness, stimulate innovation and economic growth, and inspire the next generation to dream big and garner the skills to turn those dreams into action.  NASA and our space program have a long history of bipartisan support. I urge Members of the House to pass 442, the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017.

6778,topic-id,304,"Mr.Chair, I rise with my Joint Economic Committee Democratic colleagues to address the terrible effects that theRepublican budget will have on this country's health.  I listened with rapt astonishment to Speaker Ryan's recitation of the percentage increases in the premium costs forinsurance, for insurers on the Obama exchanges. But the Speaker omitted important facts.  Number one, more than 80 percent of ObamaCare customers get subsidies to help them pay the cost of these premiums. They donot pay the full cost and will not feel the brunt of these increases.  Number two, these increases are uneven. Yes, Arizona is up, but Rhode Island will decrease 14 percent. The Speaker cherry-picked the highest ones, omitting the overall increase.  But most importantly, number three, most people are unaffected because most people get their insurance through theiremployer, Medicare, Medicaid, or the Only a small fraction of Americans actually buy insurance on the individual market.Premiums, for the average single person through the employer market last year, were exactly the same as those for families; onlyup 3 percent.  As an employer myself who offers health insurance to more than 300 people, and someone who is very concerned about the debt,my great concern is that the Republicans seem willing to throw out our total commitment to managing our debt for this repeal.[[Page H507]]  I have listened to my friends in the Freedom Caucus lament about our national debt and together we have made significantprogress on the budget deficits.  But blowing up ObamaCare will blow up our national debt, the most fiscally irresponsible act since we waged two wars withoutpaying for them.  A study by the Commonwealth Fund projects that repealing ObamaCare will cause the State of Virginia to lose up to 100,000jobs and $50 billion in business output.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this most fiscally irresponsible plan.  ",CREC-2017-01-13-pt1-PgH490.txt,2272,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCALYEAR 2017,2017.0,13.0,January

The Bible says: ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''  Mr.Speaker, the American veteran truly has great love for his fellow man. Because of the great sacrifices of our veterans, we must see to their care and well-being. We have often failed in this obligation. We have left our veterans helpless, suffering through bureaucratic nightmares to get care they desperately need.  The Phoenix Veterans Administration has worked hard to improve its care for veterans, and the newly-opened Southeast Veterans Affairs Health Care Clinic in Gilbert is intent on providing the best possible care for our Nation's finest.  While conditions have been improving in Phoenix and around the Nation, there is still much work to be done. I have made it a priority to provide excellent service to the veterans in my district.

6686,topic-id,680,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I would like to inform my colleagues that I intend to reserve 5 minutes of debate time to use after the JointEconomic Committee debate has concluded.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today to speak on behalf of Americans everywhere who are hurting because of They are callingout for relief from this disastrous law, and Republicans are here today to begin delivering on our promise to provide relief.  We hear plenty of claims from the other side of the aisle during this debate, but let's be clear: ObamaCare has failed andit is only going to get worse.                              {time}  1100  Patients have seen skyrocketing premiums and deductibles, lost access to the doctors they preferred, had fewer coverageoptions, while others have had their plans canceled outright. It is no wonder so many people have rejected this law.  In 2015, roughly 8 million Americans paid the ObamaCare penalty, and more than 12 million Americans claimed an exemptionfrom the penalty. That is 20 million What does that say about this law that 20 million Americans want nothing to dowith it, many preferring to pay a penalty rather than to be subjected to its higher costs and fewer choices? If you ask me, itis strong evidence that the American people are tired of paying more and getting less.  Of course, the destruction that ObamaCare has caused extends beyond discouraging individuals to purchase coverage. It hasbeen a direct attack on those who had insurance already.  In my home State of Tennessee, 28,000 people lost coverage on a single day when the CoverTN program lapsed after the Obamaadministration decreed that it ran afoul of the Federal Government's top-down requirements. Now premiums in our State are risingby an average of 63 percent, and three-quarters of our counties only have one coverage option to choose from on the  In five other States around the country--Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming--patients only have oneinsurer in the marketplace to choose from. That makes it pretty difficult for someone to find a plan that meets their uniqueneeds or that of their family.  President Obama promised that this law would lower premiums by $2,500 per year for the average family. The exact oppositehas happened. Average family premiums have gone up by $4,300, and deductibles have gone up by 60 percent. This is hittinghardworking Americans, many of whom are already struggling to make ends meet.  Folks in Tennessee and all across the country are spending more and more money on their health insurance because ofObamaCare, when they would rather be saving for a new house or for their children's college. The last thing working men andwomen need right now is the Federal Government making their life harder with more expensive health insurance by continuing tosupport this failed law.  That is why we are here today. The Senate successfully passed this resolution yesterday, and now it is time for the House todeliver on our promise, by kick-starting the reconciliation process so that we can repeal ObamaCare and provide relief for thefolks who are hurting because of this law.  While our friends on the other side of the aisle always claim that Republicans have no ideas or no plans to replaceObamaCare, that simply isn't[[Page H491]]true, and they know it. I have with me here today a few examples, including A Better Way, the37-page proposal that will provide access to care for all Americans and increase choice and competition.  I would like to also reference that Pete Sessions has a healthcare bill that he has filed. The RSC, with Phil Roe,has a replacement bill that has been filed.

Another: ``In my mind the Affordable Care Act has been a huge success, but it's got real problems.'' This came from JonathanChait, ``Five Days That Shaped a Presidency,'' on October 2, 2016.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: I write to      share the support of the National Retail Federation(NRF) for      3, the fiscal year 2017 budget resolution.      Please note that NRF may consider votes on 3      andrelated procedural motions as Opportunity Index Votes for      our annual voting scorecard.       The Affordable Care Act (ACA) remainsa great concern for      NRF and the greater retail community. The ACA adversely      influences staffing patterns, discourages full-timeemployment      and adds to the cost of goods in retail stores. NRF opposed      enactment of the ACA in 2010 but has also workedsteadfastly      to change the law since its enactment. We have supported      reasonable bipartisan efforts to reduce the ACA's costburdens      and ease compliance concerns. The ACA remains a heavy burden      for the retail community despite all of our efforts to fixand      adjust to the law.       This budget resolution is the first step toward the      eventual repeal of the We support this firststep but      will be closely watching the ensuing reconciliation      legislation to help keep employment-based coverage as stable      andpredictable as possible. We strongly urge that the process      of replacing the ACA be both bipartisan as well as      deliberate.Consensus reform will build on the employment      based system, which covers 178 million Americans, but not      threaten this coveragein the effort to help others.       For all of these reasons, NRF supports 3 and      ask for your vote insupport.           Sincerely,                                                     David French,                      Senior Vice President, Government Relations.[[Page H509]]                                       ____                                           National Association of                                      Wholesaler-Distributors,                                  Washington, DC, January 12,2017.

It has become painfully apparent that the ACA has not and      will not achievethe affordability, competition and choice      goals promised by its sponsors. Looking forward, NAW members      are deeply concernedabout the ACA's potential to do harm to      the employment-based health insurance system through which      some 170 million Americansacquire their health coverage,      particularly as two ill-advised ACA financing components--the      excise tax on high-cost health plans(the ``Cadillac Tax'')      and the annual fee on health insurance providers (the      ``Health Insurance Tax'' or ``HIT'')--takehold.       NAW looks forward to working with Members of both houses of      Congress on both sides of the aisle in what we hope will bea      collaborative effort to find common legislative ground on      marketplace-driven, patient-centered ways to achieve shared      access,cost-containment, and quality goals.

Dear Representatives: The National Association of      Manufacturers (NAM), the largest manufacturing association in      theUnited States, representing manufacturers in every      industrial sector and in all 50 states, urges you to support      3the Obamacare Repeal       The Budget Resolution takes the first step towards      repealing the mandates and taxesresulting from the Patient      Protection and Affordable Care Act that are driving up the      costs of healthcare for manufacturers.Manufacturers believe      that repeal of the 40 percent excise tax on high cost plans,      the Health Insurance Tax, the Medical DeviceTax, and other      fees and taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act will      help employers contain rising health carecosts.       Manufacturers historically have led the business community      in providing health benefits to their employees and      arecommitted to continuing this tradition in the future. At      the same time, providing health coverage in an environment      where costsare consistently rising represents a major      challenge for the industry.       The NAM's Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicatedthat      votes on 3, including podural motions, may be      considered for designation as Key Manufacturing Votes in      the115th       Thank you for your consideration.

U.House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: You will soon have the opportunity to      vote on 3, a budget resolution that will      beginthe long-awaited process of repealing the Patient      Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as      On behalfof the more than one million members and      supporters of the Council for Citizens Against Government      Waste (CCAGW), I urge you tosupport this important      legislation.       Obamacare, which has been a disaster for patients and      taxpayers since it was passed in2010, cannot be fixed.      Premiums have dramatically increased, co-ops and state      exchanges have failed, and medical costs continueto      skyrocket. Conservative estimates suggest that, by its sixth      birthday in early 2016, Obamacare had wasted $55 billion,      whileits onerous regulations and taxes have stifled economic      growth and job creation.       Over the past year, more co-ops havecollapsed; health      insurers have abandoned numerous exchanges; and premiums have      increased an average of 25 percent for 2017.Even worse,      Obamacare has allowed overzealous Washington bureaucrats to      meddle in Americans' most personal and private      decisionsconcerning their health. At the same time, patients      are getting less care for their plans due to fewer healthcare      options andincreasing medical costs; some counties have only      one or even no healthcare insurance options (and have to pay      a fine, as aresult).       Obamacare must be repealed before it further damages      consumers and the slow-growing economy. Passage of      the``Obamacare repeal resolution'' is the first step to      accomplishing that critical objective. All votes on      3 will beamong those considered for CCAGW's 2017      Congressional           Sincerely,                                                       Tom Schatz,                                      ____                        Americans for Tax Reform       Congress is expected to soon vote on 3, a      budget resolutionproviding for repeal of The      ``repeal resolution'' is step one in undoing the legacy of      broken promises under theBarack Obama presidency which have      led to higher healthcare costs, cancelled plans, lost      doctors, and more than $1 trillion intax increases which hit      millions of middle class families.       All members of the House and Senate should vote ``yes'' on      therepeal resolution. The record of Obamacare is one of      broken promises and failed policies. Poll after poll has      shown the law isunpopular with the American people.      Republicans campaigned on repealing Obamacare and this      resolution will allow them to fulfillthat promise       Members of the Senate should also vote ``no'' on the      numerous amendments expected to be offered      duringconsideration of the repeal resolution. The purpose of      this budget resolution is to allow for an expedited process      to repealObamacare through budget reconciliation. These      amendments will slow down the process and are largely an      attempt for members toplay political games.       Passing the repeal resolution will allow members of      Congress to pass the first of many tax cuts overthe next four      years by repealing the more than $1 trillion in higher taxes      over a decade. Obamacare's tax hikes directly hitmiddle class      families, in violation of President Obama's ``firm pledge''      not to raise any tax on any family earning less than$250,000      per year. Passing the repeal resolution will allow members of      Congress the opportunity to pass the first of many taxcuts      over the next four years by repealing these taxes.       The Obamacare law imposed taxes on Health Savings Accounts      andFlexible Spending Accounts and imposed an income tax      increase on Americans with high medical bills. Obamacare      levied a new taxon health insurance, a tax on medical      devices, a tax on employer provided care, a steep ``indoor      tanning tax'' and even a taxfor not buying ``qualifying''      government-mandated insurance.       Passing the repeal resolution will also allow Congress to      undo along list of wasteful subsidies including the risk      corridor and reinsurance programs as well as the Prevention      and Public Healthslush fund. Each of these programs and      agencies have seen billions in taxpayer dollars wasted on      partisan activities at a timewhen the federal government      already spends far too much. Support for 3 is      the first step toward enacting aconservative, patient-     centered, fiscally responsible healthcare system and      eliminating the broken promises, wasteful spending,and higher      taxes of the Obama years.                        Americans for Prosperity       For years, our lawmakers inCongress have vowed to get rid      of Now, they have their best chance yet to make      good on their word.       Barack Obama'ssignature health-care law has failed to      deliver on its promises, and continues to leave Americans      with cancelled insuranceplans, reduced access to doctors, and      premium increases in the double digits--or worse.       Using a process called budgetreconciliation, Obamacare's      opponents in our new Senate can repeal large portions of the      law with a simple majority, whileleaving no possibility of a      filibuster by lawmakers who want to keep it. Then, the      resolution would just need to be passed inthe House of      Representatives and signed by President Trump after he takes      office.       We can't let our lawmakers pass up thisopportunity to turn      back years of terrible policy and free Americans from      Obamacare's burdensome mandates and costs.

It ignores the 20 million Americans who have either paid theObamaCare penalty or sought an exemption from it because the cost of complying with the law is either too costly or not worththeir trouble.  This amendment tells those families who have seen their premiums go up dramatically--many, who are paying more and gettingless--that there is no relief in sight for you. What is more, the substitute does not include any reconciliation instructions,and it lacks the savings we achieve through our instructions.  The bottom line is this: ObamaCare is collapsing.

No Cabinet member is more powerful or has more impact on the day-to-day lives of Americans than theAttorney General of the United  The Attorney General is, indeed, a general, in command of an army of thousands oflawyers whose words carry enormous weight and power. It is the weight and power of the people of the United He speaksfor us. He charges defendants in our name. He has sweeping authority to bring criminal charges in all Federal offenses, enormousunreviewable discretion in cases ranging from minor misdemeanors to the most serious felonies. In every sense, as capitalpenalties can be sought for some of these crimes, he wields the power of life and death.  The Attorney General's authority isnot only sweeping, it is uniquely independent of the President's His decisions must supersede partisan politics. Inmost cases, there is no recourse to overrule his decisions unless there is political interference. He is not just anothergovernment lawyer or even just another member of the President's He is the Nation's lawyer, and he must be the Nation'slegal counsel and conscience.  The job of U.Attorney General at stake here is one that I know pretty well. Like some of mycolleagues in this body, I served as U.attorney, the chief Federal prosecutor in  I reported to the U.S.Attorney For years afterward as a private litigator and then as attorney general of the State of Connecticut for 20years, I fought alongside and sometimes against the U.Attorney General and the legal forces at his disposal. I have seen hispower, or hers, firsthand. The power of this Attorney General is awesome, as is that of any Attorney  In the best ofcases, they are inspiring too. Even as he protects the public from vicious and violent criminal offenders, his role is also toprotect the innocent from unfounded charges that could shatter their lives even if they are acquitted. As Justice RobertJackson, a former Attorney General himself, once said: His job is not to convict, but to assure justice is done.  So this jobrequires a singular level of intellect and integrity and nonpartisan but passionate devotion to the rule of law and anextraordinary sense of conscience. That is because he is responsible for so much more than prosecuting and preventing crime andensuring public safety. He is responsible for aggressively upholding our Nation's sacred constitutional commitment to protectingindividual rights and liberties and preventing infringement on them, even by the government itself, maybe especially by thegovernment.[[Page S300]]  This responsibility for safeguarding equal justice under the law is particularly important today, at atime when those civil rights and freedoms are so much in peril. This historic moment demands a personwhose life work, professional career, and record shows that he will make the guarantee under our Constitution of equal justiceunder law a core mandate of his tenure.  Having reviewed the full record and recent testimony, regrettably and respectfully,I cannot support the President-elect's nominee, our colleague and friend Jeff Sessions, for this job.  At hisconfirmation hearing, Senator Sessions simply said he would follow the law and he would obey it, but the Attorney Generalof the United States must be more than a follower. He must be a leader in protecting the essential constitutional rights andliberties. He must be a champion, a zealous advocate. He must actively pursue justice, not just passively follow or obey thelaw.  Senator Sessions' record reflects a hostility and antipathy--in fact, downright opposition--to civil rights andvoting rights, women's health care and privacy rights, antidiscrimination measures, and religious freedom safeguards. He hasprided himself on his vociferous opposition to immigration reform legislation, a measure that passed this body with 68bipartisan votes, and a criminal justice reform bill that has attracted a group of 25 cosponsors, Democrats and Heeven split with the majority of his own party to vote against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women He opposed hatecrime prohibitions. Senator Sessions' views and positions on these issues and others, which are critical to protecting andchampioning rights and liberties under our Constitution, are simply out of the mainstream. There is nothing in SenatorSessions' record, including his testimony before the Judiciary Committee this week, that indicates he will be theconstitutional champion the Nation needs at this point in its history.  Equally important, the Attorney General must speaktruth to power. He must be ready, willing, and able to say no to the President of the United States and ensure that thePresident is never above the law. Senator Sessions' record and testimony give me no confidence that he will fulfill thiscore task.  When I asked him about enforcement of cases against illegal conflicts of interest involving the President and hisfamily, such as violations of the emoluments clause or the STOCK Act, he equivocated. When I asked him about appointing aspecial counsel to investigate criminal wrongdoing at Deutsche Bank, owed more than $300 million by Donald Trump, heequivocated. When I asked him about abstaining from voting on other Presidential nominees while he is in the Senate, heequivocated. Those answers give me no confidence that he will be the independent, nonpolitical law enforcer against conflicts ofinterest and official self-enrichment that the Nation needs now more than ever--at a moment when the incoming administrationfaces ethical and legal controversies that are unprecedented in scope and scale.  SenatorSessions' record over many years and his recent testimony fail to demonstrate the core commitments and convictionsnecessary in our next Attorney  Back in 1986, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected Senator Sessions'nomination to a Federal judgeship due to remarks he made and actions he took in a position of public trust as U.attorney inHowever, my position on his nomination is primarily based on his record since those hearings and less on what wasconsidered at that time.  On voting rights, Senator Sessions has often condoned barriers to Americans exercising theirfranchise. He has been a leading opponent of provisions in the Voting Rights Act designed to ensure that African Americans canvote in places, such as his home State of Alabama, which have a unique history of racial segregation. He has advocated forneedlessly restrictive and draconian voter ID laws, citing utterly debunked threats of rampant voter fraud as an excuse forcurtailing the real and legitimate rights of entire groups of voters.  On privacy--very important--Senator Sessions haspassionately opposed this longstanding American right, which is enshrined in five decades of Supreme Court precedent. Itprotects women's health care and personal decisions involving reproductive rights. At a time when these rights are facing anunprecedented assault, he has continued to condemn Roe v. Wade and the many court decisions upholding that case.  He is alsosupported by extremist groups like Operation Rescue that defend the murder of doctors and the vilification and criminalizationof women. With him as Attorney General, American women would understandably feel less secure about those rights.  Onreligious freedom, Senator Sessions has advocated for using a religious test to determine which immigrants can enter thiscountry. When this issue arose in committee, Senator Sessions was the only Senator--the only Senator--to argue forcefully forreligious tests and against principles of religious liberty that have animated our Republic since its founding. With SenatorSessions as Attorney General, a Trump administration would enjoy a permanent green light for any racially or religiouslydiscriminatory immigration policy that might appeal to him.  On citizenship, Senator Sessions has called for abolishinga time-honored tradition that dates back to reconstruction. Birthright citizenship is the distinctly American concept thatanyone born on our soil is a citizen of our country. We do not exclude people from citizenship based on the nationality of theirparents or grandparents. Senator Sessions disagrees, a position that most other Republicans think is extreme.  WithSenator Sessions as Attorney General, the Trump administration would be encouraged in attempting to deport Americancitizens--who have raised families and spent their entire lives here--from the only country they have ever known.  SenatorSessions declined my invitation at his nomination hearing to exercise moral and legal leadership and demonstrate hisresolve to serve as the Nation's legal conscience. He refused to reject the possibility of using information voluntarilyprovided by DACA applicants to deport them and their families. As a matter of fundamental fairness and due process, when aDREAMer has provided information to our government after being invited to come out of the shadows, this information should neverbe used to deport that person. With Senator Sessions as Attorney General, that sense of legal conscience would be lacking.  On issues of discrimination and equal protection, Senator Sessions has publicly opposed marriage equality, claiming it``weakens marriage'' and even tried to eliminate protections for LGBT Americans contained in the Runaway and Homeless Youth andTrafficking Prevention He has repeatedly voted against steps to enhance enforcement against hate crimes--violent assaultsinvolving bigotry or bias based on race, religion, and sexual orientation. He even defended President-Elect Trump's shockingadmission on video of his pattern of engaging in sexual assault.  Senator Sessions himself has said that publicofficials can be fairly judged by assessing who their supporters are. Senator Sessions is backed by groups with ties toWhite supremacists.  He has even accepted an award and repeated campaign donations from groups whose founder openly promotesthe goal of maintaining a ``European American majority'' in our society. Neither award, nor many other important parts ofSenator Sessions' record, was reported on the questionnaire he prepared for the Judiciary  I gave SenatorSessions an opportunity at the hearing earlier this week to repudiate these hate groups and racist individuals who haveendorsed his nomination and supported him in the past. In fact, instead he doubled down, saying that a man who has accusedAfrican Americans of excessive criminality and American Muslims of extensive ties to terrorism was ``a most brilliantindividual.''  So I reach my decision to oppose this nomination with regret because Jeff Sessions is a colleague and afriend to all of us. Indeed, he and I have a rapport. I have come to like and respect[[Page S301]]him through a number of sharedexperiences in this building, traveling abroad, and outside.  We have common causes. He and I both support law enforcementprofessionals who serve our communities and the Nation with dedication and courage. They are never given sufficient thanks andappreciation.  He and I both believe that individual corporate criminal culpability should be pursued more vigorously.Individual corporate executives should be held accountable for the wrongdoing of corporations when they are criminally involved.  This job, this decision, this responsibility is different. Here, my disagreements stem from bedrock constitutionalprinciples. While I could envision deferring to Presidential authority and supporting him for other positions, my objections tohis nomination here relate specifically to this particular, essential, all-powerful job.  At this historic moment, there mustbe no doubt about the ironclad commitment of the Attorney General of the United States to the bedrock principle of equal justiceunder law, his resolve to be an independent voice, assuring that the President is never above the law, his determination to be achampion for all people of America and our constitutional principles that protect all people, and to be a legal conscience forthe  Reviewing his record, I cannot assure the people of Connecticut or the country that Jeff Sessions would bea vigorous champion of these rights and liberties.

6673,topic-id,1644,"Mr.President, the hour is late, even though you look like you have a lot of work there to do, sir. I think I am going to be merciful and keep this short. I want to thank the Senator from Hawaii, the senior Senator from Hawaii, for his remarks.  I just want to wrap up. We have had multiple speakers now driving home a number of points. Two of them I just want to reiterate, which is the fact that as I look at a lot of more moderate and conservative outlets, from the American Enterprise Institute all the way to the American Medical Association, that did not support ObamaCare in the first place, you have this chorus growing of responsible, thoughtful people who said: Hey, we may want to repeal ObamaCare, but to do it without putting up a plan and showing the American public what you are going to replace it with is not only contrary, obviously, to a lot of the political rhetoric we heard during the campaign season, but it is against the logic, it is not prudent, it is actually reckless, and it is going to hurt a lot of people.  This is what we have to understand. I say it is akin to pushing someone off a ledge and telling them, as they are falling down, that, hey, we are going to get a plan, don't worry. The problem is, people are going to get hurt in the interim. The cost of medical care, not having that kind of business certainty that you need, it is going to spike markets and make things very difficult.  I just want to say that this body, which I respect--and I am happy to hear voices like Senator Rand Paul and others on the Republican side begin to come out and say that we should not be repealing this without replacing it. I want to offer my gratitude to them because I think there are a lot of people--I even heard Chuck[[Page S179]]Schumer say himself that he is ready to roll up his sleeves and talk about ways to improve this.  We have heard from the President-elect, saying that he is going to have a health care system that is better and that costs less. I think he used the word ``terrific'' to describe what he is going to bring to the American people.  Well, where is it? Where is the plan? What is the idea? Because there are too many people right now in our country who are fearful of what might happen. When I say ``fearful,'' it is a base fear; for example, some people from my State of New This is Martha, who lives in a town called Montclair--not quite the same town that the Senator from Hawaii was speaking of before, which I cannot pronounce yet. I hope he will help me with that. Mahalo; is that right? I am doing all right.  But this young lady from Montclair very dramatically writes:       I want to take a moment to thank you for fighting as hard      as you have to protect those of us who are disabled and      vulnerable to financial ruin, medical crisis, and debt if the      ACA is repealed. I am a psychotherapist in private practice      for over 20 years. I have served my community by keeping one-     third of my caseload no fee or low fee for those who have had      no insurance.       For over 20 years, I have purchased my insurance privately      and paid dearly for my medical coverage. Two months ago, I      was diagnosed with an extremely rare cancer in my central      nervous system. I am fortunate that doctors believe that it      can be controlled, but not cured, by my taking a low dose of      oral chemotherapy for life. I now, as a result of this      condition, have zero chance of being able to afford      reasonable medical coverage purchased from an unregulated      open market.       My life, literally without hyperbole, depends on my being      able to maintain continuity of care and insurance regulations      that eliminate exclusions for preexisting conditions. My      energies are limited due to my illness. So I thank you for      doing all you can to fight for my life and my family. The      idea that people with preexisting conditions aren't      contributing to the economic health of our country is a      distortion. I personally address gaps in our health care      system as a provider by sliding my scale.       The safety net is us, and if I lose my health coverage and      can no longer afford it, I will no longer be able to afford      to devote one-third of my caseload to those who cannot afford      it. It becomes a profound domino effect.  That is where we are right now. I have heard so many of my colleagues, Republican and Democratic, speak to the things they like about ObamaCare or at least they like in the abstract, not giving ObamaCare any credit. They like the fact that people with preexisting conditions can get insurance. They like this idea that there will be no lifetime caps. That means that a child who might have leukemia and beats it and then becomes an adult can't find insurance because nobody wants to insure him because they have exceeded these ideas of lifetime caps. They have gotten rid of this idea that you cannot stay on your parent's insurance just because you have turned 23, 24. Now you can do it until you are 26. There are so many aspects of ObamaCare that people say they like. One thing that even Republican Governors talk about liking is just the idea of Medicaid expansions that have occurred in 32 States and have enabled millions of Americans, hard-working families, their children, people living in nursing homes, those who suffer from addiction, and the poor and the underserved, to get access to quality health care.  That is what is incredible. We have people who are coal miners and sick who have benefited from this. We have folks who are in nursing homes who have benefited from this. We have folks who are suffering in this opioid crisis with addictions who have been able to get access to coverage and access to care. More than this, we have now created a system that equates and understands that mental illness and physical illness is in parity--that insurance companies have to offer that as well.  In addition to all of that, we now have a system that says to anybody that you cannot be denied for the kind of reasons you were denied before and find yourself falling into the trap that so many Americans did; that the 1 reason--or at least one of the top reasons people were declaring bankruptcy was because they could not afford their medical bills. These are all things that are universally--or at least the overwhelming majority of Americans want.  So we all agree on many of the basic goals. The question is, How do get there? It has been indicated by the President-elect and others that they have a plan to get there, to preserve all of these things that are now being savored by Americans, that are literally, as Martha from Montclair points out, saving people's lives. The question is, How are you going to get there? By the way, if you try to shortcut it and don't tell us how you are going to get there and just repeal ObamaCare, then you introduce uncertainty to the market. Insurance companies are speaking up. The American Medical Association is speaking up. The American Diabetes Association is speaking up. The American Cancer Society is speaking up. All of these nonpartisan or maybe even conservative folks are speaking up, saying: You can't do the repeal unless you put forward what you are going to replace it with.  Free market folks know you don't introduce uncertainty into the markets without consequences, and those consequences would be a disruption to the individual marketplace, the spiking of prices, people pulling out, and that death spiral.  I believe in the prudence of this body. I have seen it from people on both sides of the aisle--the thoughtfulness that they won't rush to embrace a pure political victory at the expense of real people. Well, this is one of those moments.  What are we going to do as a body? Are we going to repeal and not replace? Or are we going to have a great discussion about what that replacement will be?  So tonight we have heard from a lot of my colleagues. I am really proud that folks have taken to the floor. I am even more proud that, from my office, we are hearing from people on both sides of the political aisle. Not everybody likes Not everybody voted It is people from both sides of the aisle. They do not understand why we would rush forward doing the repeal without the replace.  I want to thank everybody who has spoken tonight. The hour is late, and I just want to thank a lot of the folks who don't normally keep these kinds of hours. There are some pretty incredible people who work up around the President's desk.  We have a lot of pages here who do not get enough thanks on both sides--Republican pages and Democratic pages. I want to thank them, as well, for staying late, even though, technically--and I hate to call them out on this--if they have to stay up past 10 p.m., they don't have to necessarily do their homework and show up for school the next day. That is what I hear. So we might have done you a favor. But either way, I want to thank everybody tonight.  Mr.President, I want to suggest the absence of a quorum.  Oh, I am sorry. I want to--what do I want to do? I want to just drop the mic.  ",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgS161-3.txt,2194,REPUBLICANS SHOULD JOIN DEMOCRATS IN REJECTING TRUMPCARE,2017.0,9.0,March

6846,topic-id,479,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  Our veterans have paid a high price. Dispatched to foreign lands to fight for our freedom, many returned injured, grief-stricken over lost friends, and torn apart by the violence of war.  We owe them our time, our energy, our gratitude, and our protection. That is why we are here on the floor today: to protect the constitutional rights of our heroes and to make sure we are taking care of them like we promised we would.  H.1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, ensures that government cannot strip our heroes of their constitutional rights without due process. Under current law, if the VA determines that a veteran needs a guardian or fiduciary to help manage their benefits, then that veteran's name must be sent to the NICS database, prohibiting them from purchasing a firearm.  The decision to strip any constitutional right from anyone, most importantly our veterans who have put their lives on the line to defend our Constitution, needs to be made with due process. The VA was never designed to adjudicate the removal of constitutional rights. This decision should be made by a judge or judicial authority.  Instead of stripping veterans of constitutional rights, our VA should be focused on protecting veterans. That is exactly what the other two bills under consideration do.  H.1259 gives the Department of Veterans Affairs greater ability to discipline employees for misconduct or poor performance.  We entrust our VA employees with the health and well-being of our veterans. Most of these employees do a great job, working hard to make sure our heroes are cared for; but, occasionally, a VA employee engages in misconduct, behavior that can endanger the very lives of our veterans.  These men and women sacrificed to serve our The least we can do is enable them to receive the best care possible at the That is why we need H.1259, to allow the VA, under an expedited process, to fire or suspend or demote employees who are putting our veterans at risk.  The legislation also allows the VA to recoup the money paid in bonuses or relocation grants to employees convicted of a felony.  Mr.Speaker, our veterans deserve the best. They deserve the best employees. They deserve the best medical staff. That is what the third bill under consideration, H.1367, will achieve. This legislation improves the VA's ability to recruit the best medical staff, offering the agency direct hiring authority to fill key positions with critical staffing needs.  It also creates a fellowship program to train up VA management for the best performance. It is time to improve the personnel practices at the Veterans  Mr.Speaker, the resolution on the floor today is vital for our Nation's veterans.

6848,topic-id,367,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My friend from Florida and I were in committee yesterday and heard testimony from one of our colleagues that this bill, as it pertains to veterans' gun rights, is not reactive. It does not go back to those individuals who have been denied their due process rights, who have been denied their Second Amendment rights.  This bill is prospective only. It will only affect those who in the future have been denied those rights. And I think it is absolutely important that we understand the Republican Party in the House of Representatives is committed to make sure that those individuals who have been denied their due process rights, their Second Amendment rights in the past, we will find a solution. We will help those individuals.  Right now, we are focused on making sure that others have the ability to a fair, open hearing where they can present their side of the story before they are denied their constitutional rights.  My friend and colleague from Florida (Mr.Hastings) also talks about the fact that H.1259 will do more harm than good; that somehow disciplining those who are delivering poor services to our veterans is unfair to unions. The truth is that 35 percent of the VA's workforce is made up of veterans.                              {time}  1300  But the fact is that veteran employees believe employees that are not meeting acceptable standards for their fellow veterans should be removed, period, regardless of their service while on Active  Are opponents of removing poor-performing employees and those whose misconduct warrant removal saying that a veteran employee who cannot do the job or is guilty of misconduct be kept on the job?  On the contrary, veterans know that the strictest accountability standards apply to them during their military service, and millions of hardworking Americans in the private sector do not enjoy anything close to the protections enjoyed by Federal employees.  The only employees who need to be concerned with reasonable reform that would be made by this legislation are those who aren't doing their jobs on behalf of the veterans who they serve.[[Page H2097]]  Mr.Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Mast).

6860,topic-id,287,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My friend from Florida talked about the specificity that he used in describing the conditions of these veterans, but that is not what the rule says.  What the rule says, Mr.Speaker, is that if someone--if a veteran needs a fiduciary, they will be denied the ability to own, possess, purchase a firearm. It doesn't say if they are schizophrenic. It doesn't say if they have It doesn't say if they have depression, and if they have PTSD or depression that is somehow linked to further violent behavior. It doesn't say that.  What it says is, if you can't balance your bank account, you can't have a gun to protect yourself. There is no relationship between those two.  Now, if the gentleman from Florida would go to the Veterans Administration and talk to them about the need to link that finding of a fiduciary with future violent behavior, we may not be here today.  But so many people have been trapped in this overbroad rule that we are going to make sure that those people that have a fiduciary and are listed by the VA have a due process right to show that they are nonviolent; that they don't have a propensity to commit a crime with a weapon; that they are not a harm to themselves or to others.  And if the VA or an independent judicial officer finds that they are, then yes, list them on the NICS report, but give them that due process right.

6868,topic-id,1360,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to draw your attention and the attention of my colleague from Florida to a letter dated January 26, 2017, from the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, U.House of Representatives, Representative Roe, and the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, U.Senate, Chairman Isakson, to the President in which they asked for various positions to be exempted from the President's executive order concerning a hiring freeze.

I would exceed my time limitations, Mr.Speaker, if I were to read all of these. But let me assure you there are dozens and dozens of positions at the Veterans Administration that have been exempted from the President's hiring freeze. They include social worker, science lab technician, practical nurse, nursing assistant, dietician, nutritionist, occupational therapist, on and on and on. And the need for the amendment that the gentleman presents is unnecessary.  I would also like to talk very briefly about the gentleman's argument that somehow those at the Veterans Administration are being harmed, and we are attacking a union in some way rather than trying to deal with real situations and improving the quality of care at the  I want to give a few examples of VA employees and just the time that it took to remove people. A VA employee was a willing participant in an armed robbery several years ago, and after a lengthy legal and administrative battle where the employee was supported by the Public Employees Union, the employee was reinstated in their previous position without any discipline.  A VA nurse showed up to work intoxicated and participated in a veteran's surgery while under the influence of alcohol. Although the employee eventually resigned, to date, no other employees were disciplined for allowing the employee to participate in the veteran's surgery.  In 2013, a vocational rehab specialist out of the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System crashed a government car, and a passenger ended up dying. He was later indicted for a The VA confirmed that the employee was not removed from payroll until January of this year--almost 4 years.  In 2014, a VA employee at the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System took a veteran who was a recovering drug addict to a crack house where he purchased illegal drugs for the veteran, as well as purchased a prostitute for him, though the employee was still employed at the VA well over a year later after the incident until they were finally able to remove him.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues to stand up now for our veterans. They have performed their duty, and it is time for us to perform for them.  Our duty is to take care of them. A ``yes'' vote restores their Constitutional rights and improves their quality of care.  I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution, vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill.

Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.696.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

6638,topic-id,229,"Mr.President, civilian control of our military is one of the bedrockprinciples of American self-government. The National Security Act of 1947, U.S.Title 10 Section 113(a), stipulates that anindividual ``may not be appointed as Secretary of Defense within seven years after relief from active duty as a commissionedofficer of a regular component of an armed force.'' President-Elect Donald Trump's choice of retired U.Marine Corps GeneralJames Mattis violates that provision since he has only been out of the uniform for 3 years; thus, Congress will need to passa waiver so that he can serve if confirmed.  I have considered this issue carefully, and I have listened to Mattis'stestimony earlier today before the Senate Armed Services I believe Mattis is committed to the principle ofcivilian control of the military. I was reassured by his testimony this morning, and I will vote to grant the waiver.

Former Secretaries of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Robert Gates, and Leon Panetta haveexpressed bipartisan support for I am willing to vote for the waiver, as long as one nomination does not turn intoa trend.

6951,topic-id,783,"Mr.President, I will vote against confirming Representative Ryan Zinke as Secretary of the Interior, and I would like to take this opportunity to explain why. To put the matter succinctly, Representative Zinke--if he is confirmed--will be charged with implementing the Trump administration's ``energy independence plan,'' which includes maximizing energy production on Federal lands, including the outer continental shelf,[[Page S1512]]I oppose oil and gas drilling off the coast of Maryland and the entrance to the Chesapeake There is too little to gain and too much to lose.  Last November, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, wisely did not include any parcels in the Atlantic in the 2017 to 2022 plan to lease offshore land the Federal Government controls. In December, then-President Obama used his authority under section 12(a) of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 to withdraw unleased OCS lands from future lease sales, too.  This makes sense. According to BOEM, the entire Atlantic OCS, from Maine all the way to Florida, has 1.15 billion barrels of ``undiscovered technically recoverable'' oil and 12.80 trillion cubic feet of ``undiscovered technically recoverable'' natural gas. These sums sound large, but let's put them in context. The Gulf of Mexico OCS has more than 40 times as much oil and 10 times as much natural gas.  Meanwhile, the U.Geological Survey, USGS, recently determined that the midland basin of the Wolfcamp Shale area in the Permian Basin has 20 billion barrels of oil and the natural gas equivalent of another 1.6 billion barrels. The oilfield stretches over 118 miles from Lubbock to It is the largest ``continuous oil'' discovery in the United States, according to the USGS, three times larger than the assessment of the oil in the mammoth Bakken formation in North  It doesn't make any sense to jeopardize the marine life and the fishing and tourism industries along the Maryland coast and Chesapeake Bay when there is so much more oil and gas in other parts of the country.  Deepwater Horizon was a state-of-the-art rig, but it failed, causing the largest oil spill in U.waters. Eleven crewman were killed. An oil spill entering the Chesapeake Bay would be a disaster.  An even bigger threat to Maryland and other coastal States is climate change and rising sea levels. We need to accelerate our transition from fossil fuels, not our dependence on them. Two years ago, Oceana concluded that modest levels of offshore wind development over the next 20 years could produce about twice the amount of energy along coastal Atlantic States as offshore drillings and create more than 1.5 times the number of jobs.  There is no provision in the 1953 law that permits President Trump to reverse the Obama administration's section 12(a) OCS withdrawals, but he is determined to try. When Representative Zinke was first asked about lifting the moratoria, he responded, ``If I am confirmed, I will work to implement President-elect Trump's policy.''  That is the problem right there.  I appreciate Representative Zinke's honorable service to our country, both in uniform as a Navy SEAL and as an elected official in the Montana State Senate and the U.House of He has called himself a ``Theodore Roosevelt conservationist'' and supports a permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation  It is possible Representative Zinke will try to resist the Republicans' zeal for transferring ownership of precious public lands from the Federal Government, although he supported a House rule change at the beginning of this Congress to make it easier. Representative Zinke is an avid sportsman who appears to appreciate the unique role the Federal Government has in managing these resources for multiple uses--not just energy production--and preserving them for future generations.  While these are all positive factors, I am troubled that Representative Zinke has received a 3 percent rating from the League of Conservation He has vacillated on the issue of climate change: in 2010, he was one of nearly 1,200 State legislators who signed a letter to President Obama and Congress calling for ``comprehensive clean energy jobs and climate change legislation.'' Since then, however, he has repeatedly expressed doubt about anthropogenic climate change. In an October 2014 debate, Representative Zinke stated: ``it's not a hoax, but it's not proven science either.'' During his confirmation hearing, Representative Zinke said that humans ``influence'' climate change, but did not acknowledge the scientific consensus that human activity is a dominant cause of climate change. He also supports using the Congressional Review Act to overturn rules agencies have spent months and even years to develop.

6663,topic-id,2650,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to speak about the Republican effort in the Senate, by way of a budget resolution, which includes so-called reconciliation instructions to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in this case, unfortunately, without any replacement for that legislation we passed a number of years ago.  In a word, I think this is a plan for chaos--chaos certainly for insurance markets but more particularly chaos and damage done to middle-class families whose costs will go up. Of course, their coverage will be affected adversely. A repeal act without replacement would raise the price of prescription drugs for older Americans across our country, put insurance companies back in charge of health care, cost our economy millions of jobs, and devastate funding for rural hospitals and rural communities in Pennsylvania and across the country.  I think, on a night like tonight, where we are just beginning a long debate about how to bring affordable care to Americans and how to continue that, we should reflect back on where things were before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Over 50 million Americans were uninsured in 2009--50 million people. People with any sort of medical condition were routinely denied health insurance or were charged exorbitant rates because of their health histories. Women in the United States were routinely charged more than men for their health insurance. This is not an exhaustive list. Finally, individuals who were ill were routinely dropped from their health care coverage because they had reached arbitrary caps on the amount of care an insurer would pay for a given year.  So let us talk about what has happened since then. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, we have come a long way. More than 20 million Americans, including almost 1 million in Pennsylvania, have received health insurance as a result of this one piece of legislation. One hundred five million Americans are protected from discrimination due to preexisting conditions. Those are 105 million Americans with preexisting conditions who are no longer barred from treatment or coverage as they were before. Nine million Americans have received tax credits to help them cover the cost of their insurance. Eleven million seniors have saved over $23 billion from closing the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan's so-called doughnut hole. Doughnut hole is a benign way of saying burn a hole--costs that were burning a hole in the pockets of America's seniors.  Finally, hospitals in States like Pennsylvania are getting a lot of help due to the legislation. In Pennsylvania, our hospitals have saved $680 million due to reductions in uncompensated care. I think, in the end, most of this is about real people and real families and their real lives and, unfortunately, the real consequences that would adversely impact their lives.  Among the 3 million Pennsylvanians with preexisting conditions, there are two remarkable young women whose mother first contacted me in 2009--Stacie Ritter, from Manheim, Stacie is a mother of four children, including twin girls, Hannah and That is a picture of Hannah and Madeline a number of years ago. Hannah and Madeline were diagnosed at the age of 4 with a rare and dangerous type of leukemia, at such a young age.  Stacie and her husband went bankrupt. They literally went bankrupt trying to pay for their daughters' medical bills. She wrote to me at the time, saying that without health care reform ``my girls will be unable to afford care, that is if they are eligible for care that is critically necessary to maintain this chronic condition. Punished and rejected because they had the misfortune of developing cancer as a child.''  So said Stacie Ritter, one mother in one community in Pennsylvania in 2009. She was talking about her daughters being punished and rejected, as if they had any control over the cancer they were diagnosed with. Fortunately, Hannah and Madeline are healthy young women today. Madeline and Hannah are freshmen at Arcadia University and are doing well. The Affordable Care Act protects them by assuring they will have access to affordable coverage, whether on their parents' plan or on a plan in the market. Because of their medical histories, they have ongoing health care needs, and they don't know what they would do without the Affordable Care  Here is a picture of them today, and you can see what a difference health care makes in the life of a child--in this case, the life of two children who are now young women and in college. I don't even want to think about it, but we should think about what would have happened without this legislation. We should not ever put children and their families in that circumstance.  If you are talking about a new plan, you better have a plan that would cover children like Hannah and Madeline, and you better be able to pay for it. You can't just talk about it. You can't just promise it. You have to be able to pay for it, as we did in this legislation.[[Page S166]]  While we are on the question of costs, let's talk about it in human terms--human terms meaning young women like Hannah and We have heard an awful lot from Republican Members of the Senate and Republican Members of the House of They have been promising to come up with a ``better plan'' than the Affordable Care Act since 2010. Since March of 2010, when this passed, you would think that by now they would have a plan--a plan that would replace what they had repealed. That is part one. Part two is a plan that is better, because that is what they promised. They used other words to describe it as well.  Now almost 7 years later--and it will be 7 years in March--where is their plan? I don't think anyone has been able to find their plan. Some Members of the Senate on the Republican side of the aisle have said recently that they have a plan but they haven't released it yet, or they have parts of a plan or different plans but they are putting them together, and we will see them soon. Others don't seem to know whether there is a plan or not. So they promised to replace the Affordable Care Act only after they repealed it and only after millions of Americans would lose their insurance.  Where is the plan after 7 years? You would think, if you were serious about a matter of public policy--something as substantial and as consequential in the lives of families--that after 6-plus, almost 7 years you would have a plan ready to go, and that plan would be comprehensive, and that plan would cover at least 20 million people, maybe more.  That plan would have all the protections that I spoke of earlier. Young women like that, when they were children, would not have their treatment capped. Someone with a preexisting condition would be protected. Women would not be discriminated against. All of those protections, including the coverage, would be part of that plan--you would think.  It seems as if to find the Republican plan here in Washington, you would need to hire a really good private investigator to look in every corner of Maybe it is in some of the desks here. Maybe we just haven't found it yet. So far, there is no plan--no plan. There is a lot of talk and a lot of hot air about repeal but no plan.  What does the Brookings Institution say? They say that the number of uninsured Americans would double if the act is repealed. To be precise, that would leave 29.8 million people without insurance. It would go from 28.9 to 58.7 million people. I started tonight talking about 50 million uninsured in 2009. If you repeal this legislation and you don't replace it with something that is very close to comparable, that means you no longer have 50 million uninsured like we did in 2009, you have 58.7 million--let's round it off to 59 million Americans without insurance--despite all the gains we have made in the last number of years.  What does that mean for Pennsylvania? Since the bill was passed, 956,000 Pennsylvanians stand to lose their coverage because that is how many have gained it. The Congressional Budget Office, which is the Congress's referee or scorecard, estimates that insurance premiums would rise by 20 percent if the act is repealed without a replacement.  The Commonwealth Fund, in a recent report, estimated that repealing the act would cost our economy 2.5 million jobs per year--not over 5 years or 10 years but 2.5 million jobs per year.  Pennsylvania is a State where, despite having huge urban areas in both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and a lot of cities in between, we have millions of people literally that live in so-called rural communities, rural counties. By one estimate of our 67 counties, 48 of them could be categorized as rural counties. We have a lot of people who live in, make their living in, and work very hard in rural communities.  One of the headlines that caught my attention last week was from the Fiscal This is from January 5. You can't see it from a distance, but the headline reads: ``Obamacare Repeal Could Push Rural Hospitals to the Brink.'' It is all focusing on rural hospitals and the cost of repeal.  We know that a couple of years ago there was a report by First Focus that focused specifically on rural children and their health care. Here is what the conclusion of that report was. As of 2012, the year they examined, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program covered 47 percent of rural children, compared with 38 percent of urban children. Almost half of rural children, as of this report, received their health care from Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Both would be adversely impacted by both the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the implementation of the House Republican budget, which I think is the most extreme budget ever proposed in  That is the reality just for rural children and their health care and, also, the predictions about what will happen to rural hospitals. A lot of people employed in Pennsylvania--tens of thousands--are employed in rural hospitals in our  One of the individuals who contacted us to talk about this issue in the context of being in a somewhat rural community but someone who is actually doing farming--and, of course, farming does not occur just in rural areas--is Julia Inslee, from Coatesville, That is in Southeastern Pennsylvania, where we have a lot of farms, as well, just like we do in the middle of the State and in the western, northeastern, and northwestern part of the Julia turned her family's hobby farm into a full-time operation. Here is what she wrote to her office in       I am one of the millions of people who have benefited      greatly from affordable access to health care. I work part      time as a tutor at a community college and nearly full time      as a farmer. Neither one of these jobs provides me with      health care, nor do I make enough to pay several hundred      dollars in premiums per month. The government subsidy is what      makes it possible for me to have healthcare. If Obamacare is      taken away, I will most likely have to give up farming, and      if anything, we need more farmers, not fewer.  That is what she says. ``If Obamacare is taken away, I will most likely have to give up farming.''  Why would we do that? Why would we say that to someone who has achieved success in any profession or any job or any career--but especially something as fundamental to the economy of Pennsylvania? By one estimate, our largest industry is agriculture in Why would we say to that farmer: They have this idea to get rid of legislation in You are just going to have to come up with a new profession. Why would we force people to give up farming in order to meet the demands of some people in Washington?  Julia is facing the likelihood, if the act is repealed, of losing her ability to support herself because her insurance would be too expensive.  I have to ask: Is this a ``better plan''? Is this what Republicans have come up with? We shall see.  Rebecca Seidel is a dairy farmer as well. She is from Douglassville, Rebecca co-owns a herd of dairy cows, and she talked with me just last week about how dangerous farming can be and how scary it is not to have insurance. She says:       As the daughter, granddaughter, and great-granddaughter of      Pennsylvania dairy farmers, I've seen my share of      agricultural catastrophes. Between equipment and large      animals, every day comes with potential hazards. Will I break      a rib getting between two cows who are fighting? Will a blade      come loose from the bedding chopper and hit me? Will my hand      be broken through miscommunication with someone operating the      skidloader? These are realities with which I live every day      and I am able to go about my job bravely because I know none      of these events would financially destroy my family.  She said the Affordable Care Act allowed her to work, and she wrote:       Threats to the ACA are threats to our future, Senator, and      to the future of small businesses, agriculture, and families.  Rebecca and her husband don't know what to expect with repeal of the law. They want to start their own business, allowing their current employer to hire more people, but they don't know what they will be able to afford in such an environment of uncertainty. Rebecca and her husband don't know if they will be able to realize their plans to start a new business. How is this a better result for them, we would have to ask.  Finally, we have a story of a businessman, Anthony Anthony is a small business owner who has been successful with the hard work of one employee who purchases an affordable[[Page S167]]and comprehensive plan through Pennsylvania's health insurance marketplace. This is what Anthony said as a small business person:       It is my opinion that the Affordable Care Act is the best      thing the federal government has ever done for a real small      business like mine. This bill paved the way for entrepreneurs      to strike out on their own, knowing that they have a way to      get health insurance. The bill allowed these entrepreneurs to      attract professional employees who would otherwise have never      left a corporate job to join a small startup.  His business relies on his one employee--in this case, he has one who is central to his business--being able to purchase affordable health insurance, since, with only one employee, he cannot get her on employer-sponsored coverage. He said, ``Looking forward, we plan to do even bigger and better things, but she still needs health insurance to do it, and if we lose the Marketplace, iQ Product Design will likely lose its key employee and will be unable to create the next big market-changing product.''  He is asking: What is going to happen? Is there a replacement plan? What happens to his employee? What happens to his business? We have a long way to go to debate these issues. But I have to ask again, if there is such a better idea here after almost 7 years now, where is this replacement plan? We haven't heard one word about the details of it. Where is it? I think that is what a lot of Americans are asking. We know what Republicans want to do: Repeal the Affordable Care Act or patient protections in the Affordable Care Act for all those people with insurance who had much better protections solely because of this legislation.

They say it leaves it patient-centered and for the people to deal with it, not the government--because the people will haveto deal with the insurance companies in the future.

6637,topic-id,957,"Mr.President, today I wish to support the legislative waiver required forretired General James Mattis to become the next Secretary of  The principle of civilian control of the military hasbeen fundamental to the concept of American Government since the inception of our It was the Continental Congress thatgranted General George Washington his commission, and General Washington reported to that legislative body throughout the entirewar.[[Page S302]]  At the conclusion of the war, General Washington was the most popular and important figure in He easilycould have positioned himself as the leader of the American government and, in fact, was urged to do so by many. Instead,General Washington famously resigned his commission on December 23, 1783, thus firmly establishing the principle that, in thisnew country, ultimate authority over the Armed Forces would rest with democratically elected civilians. General Washington'snoble act was the foundation of such an important tenet of our democracy that the scene is depicted in a magnificent painting byJohn Trumbull, which occupies a prominent position in the rotunda of the United States  The principle of civiliancontrol of the military was at the center of the debate when the structure of our Armed Forces was dramatically reorganizedafter World War A congressional consensus emerged from the military readiness failures of Pearl Harbor that the modern worldrequired a more significant standing military force with a more centralized command structure. But harkening back to theprecedent established by George Washington, it was imperative that this new structure have civilian leadership. This wasespecially concerning at the time, given the number of remarkable generals who had deservedly attained heroic status in the eyesof the American public and the free world. Thus, in 1947, Congress passed section 202 of the National Security Act, whichprovided that the Secretary of Defense needed to have at least a 10-year gap, later reduced to 7, from any militaryservice.  Since that time, 16 of the past 24 Defense Secretaries have had some prior military service. If approved, however,Mattis would only be the second Defense Secretary to receive a congressional waiver of the law--the other being GeneralGeorge Marshall in 1950.  In order to examine this important history and review the wisdom of granting a waiver for Gen.Mattis, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing exploring the issue of civilian control of the Armed Aftercarefully reviewing the testimony from those hearings, I do support making an additional, one-time exception to the law in thespecific case of James  In 1950, the world was a tumultuous place, with a hot war in Korea coupled with theextraordinary risks associated with a growing cold war in the nuclear age. President Truman turned to General Marshall to serveas Secretary of Defense because his noted character and competence, combined with his experience and ability, made him an idealfit for the unique challenges presented at that time.  Today the world is again a tumultuous place. The combination of thethreat from terrorist organizations like ISIS and al Qaeda, as well as the threats emanating from countries such as Iran, NorthKorea, Russia, and China, has heightened tensions around the globe. And all our international challenges today take placeagainst the backdrop of the knowledge that the world has a large and aging nuclear arsenal that could quickly create chaos inthe wrong hands.  As was the case with Marshall, Mattis, with his exceptional character and competence and hisremarkable skills and ability, is a fit for these dangerous times.  Over the course of his 44-year career in the Marine Corps,Mattis has earned a reputation as a warrior and commander who is beloved by soldiers and veterans alike. The ``warriormonk,'' as he is known in military circles, is a voracious reader and a student of history. He has served as a militarycommander at all levels and all over the world. His assignments have included a combat deployment during the Persian Gulf Warsand difficult leadership posts in both Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom, where Mattiscommanded the 1St Marine Division in the city of  His work over the past decade has demonstrated a deep appreciationfor the challenges our country faces today. In 2006, Mattis coauthored the military's counterinsurgency manual with then-ArmyGeneral David As an expert in counterinsurgency, Mattis understands the crucial role military power plays inconjunction with other civil instruments of national power, including diplomatic and economic efforts.  Between 2007 and 2010,while serving as commander of the now disestablished U.Joint Forces Command, Mattis gained experience in broad DOD policy andmanagement at an organization focused on the transformation of U.military capabilities.  In 2010, I supported Mattis'snomination to serve as commander of U.Central Command, where he oversaw the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and was responsiblefor an area which includes Syria, Iran, and His experience at CENTCOM is a tremendous asset in developing a coherentstrategy to address the threats posed by state actors and terrorist networks in the region and elsewhere around the world.  In2015, he testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the United States' global challenges and offered insight to thecommittee on crafting a coherent, bipartisan national security strategy with an eye towards international diplomacy andalliances, defense budgeting, and military force size and capabilities.  Last year, he coedited a book on civil-militaryrelations that explored the growing cultural gap between civilian society and the military, as well as the impact this lack ofunderstanding may have on the civilian-military relationship.  Finally,I would note that Mattis has the support of threevery capable and successful former Secretaries of Defense whose careers were either largely or entirely in the civilianworkforce. Secretaries Cohen, Panetta, and Gates know as well as anyone what it takes to succeed in that position and theimportance of civilian leadership of the military. Their unqualified support of Mattis carries considerable weight with meand further convinces me that, in this particular circumstance, a waiver is warranted.

6668,topic-id,2339,"Mr.President, I rise to join my colleagues in raising the alarm about the possible impact for all of us in America and, in particular, for my constituents in my home State of Delaware should we indeed as a body proceed with barreling forward and repealing the Affordable Care Act without a plan to replace it, as seems to be the intention of the majority.  When I was first elected to the Senate back in 2010, the Affordable Care Act wasn't even a year old. Yet Republicans were already trying to repeal it, without offering any comprehensive plan with which to replace it. Now, more than 6 years and 60 repeal attempts later, it is truly disheartening to see that when it comes to plans for the American health care system, seemingly nothing has changed. Instead of working across the aisle to find constructive fixes to this Affordable Care Act that could win bipartisan support, instead of finding new ways to invest in infrastructure or strengthen American manufacturing or coming together to respond to the Russian attack on American democracy or even waiting a week to take this upcoming vote so we Senators can give our full focus to vetting the President-elect's Cabinet nominees, instead of pursuing any of these priorities, it seems we are once again spending--even wasting--the American people's time to fulfill a misguided and, in my view, mean-spirited promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act at all costs, without a clear plan to replace it. Sadly, in that sense, nothing has changed since I first came here in 2010, not so for the American people, as plenty has changed for them and for my home State of  More than 20 million Americans now have gained access to high-quality health insurance across our whole country, including 38,000 more Now, 38,000 is not a big number of people, but in my little State of 900,000, 38,000 more people who couldn't get access to health insurance before and can now is a big deal. Across the whole country, the rate of uninsured Americans is at a record low of just 11 percent, and in Delaware fewer than 8 percent, and this is well down below pre-ACA levels.  Let me focus on what I think is the biggest, broadest, and most important benefit of the Affordable Care Act, not just those tens of thousands in my State who have gotten coverage on the exchanges, but in my little State of 900,000, 560,000 Delawareans get their health insurance through their employer, as the vast majority of Americans do. For those half a million or more Delawareans, they have gained lifetime improvements to the quality of the health insurance they have through the ACA: no discrimination against preexisting conditions, young people can stay on their parents' health insurance until they turn 26, free preventive care, no lifetime limits on coverage and recovery, and a requirement that insurance companies spend 80 cents of every dollar on health care versus overhead. These five key consumer protections have been the center of the best of what the Affordable Care Act has delivered to Delawareans and Americans no longer have to make the phone calls they used to make to their Senators, their Congressmen, their local representatives, pleading that they could somehow find access to quality and affordable coverage. These reforms have made a real and tangible impact on Americans across the country.  I have also come to this floor, on a number of occasions over many years, and recognized the challenges of the Affordable Care Act, the ways in my home State that it has fallen short of our hopes and goals when it was initially passed, and I have offered, with an open hand, to work across the aisle[[Page S173]]to find vehicles to repair and improve elements of it that haven't worked as had been hoped.  Before I turn to that, though, let us focus for a few minutes on hearing the stories of Delawareans who have reached out to me because at the end of the day, my passionate defense of the Affordable Care Act is rooted in individuals I have met and heard from, people whose lives have been changed by access to quality, affordable, accessible health care.  As Republicans move us forward to a repeal vote, it is my hope that they will listen to these and other stories and think about what possible alternative pathway there might be that would save the opportunity for them to have access to decent, quality health care.  I grew up in this tiny town of about 1,500 called Hockessin, DE, and Nicole is also from She reached out to me to tell me her 2-year-old daughter has cystic fibrosis. She spends at least an hour every day administering her daughter's breathing treatments and at least $5,000 a month. Her medications aren't cheap. Nicole is confident that without the Affordable Care Act, she would have exceeded her annual cap on medical expenses well before the end of each year.  Nicole makes it pretty clear to me that without the consumer protections put in place by so-called ObamaCare--the ACA--she would have one of three choices, choices tragically faced by many Delawareans and Americans before the Affordable Care One, hope she somehow qualifies for Medicaid, which she probably doesn't because she is hard-working enough and successful enough that her income makes her ineligible for Option 2, go into deep debt to pay for her daughter's needed and lifesaving treatment. Option 3, stop giving her daughter some of the medication she depends on and just hope and pray that she will not suffer needlessly. That is all assuming that her daughter's cystic fibrosis was not a preexisting condition, preventing her from getting any insurance at all.  Let me review that because Nicole's story starkly outlines the reality that millions of Americans could face if we continue barreling down this misguided path of repealing the Affordable Care Act wholesale without coming together around a plan for replacement. That reality for so many sick Americans or Americans with sick children is this: First, hope you don't get sick. If that fails and you don't qualify for some other form of government assistance, either go into debt or try to get by without health care. That is it. That is what it was before the Affordable Care Act, and following its repeal, that may sadly be what it is again.  Over the last few weeks, I have heard many other stories, and I will cover a few quickly, if I may. Kim, from Wilmington, DE, is a thyroid cancer survivor who was able to get insurance because her cancer is no longer considered a preexisting condition. Will her ability to access affordable, quality health care be repealed?  There is Sue from Frankford, DE, whose husband got sick a decade ago--desperately sick--and hasn't been able to work since. They are retired but not quite eligible for Yet, despite his illness, they have been able to find coverage now on the individual market. Will repeal of the Affordable Care Act deny Sue and her husband access to quality health insurance?  There is Carla from Odessa, DE, whose son was able to stay on her health insurance when his employer didn't cover it. Not only that, but Carla's sister--a self-employed gardener with a 40-year history of insulin-dependent diabetes, also known as a preexisting condition, was able to get health insurance when she tragically divorced at age 63 and lost coverage through her husband's employer.  There is Matthew from Wilmington, whose son was diagnosed with brain cancer. The year before his son's diagnosis, Matthew and his family were on a non-ACA-compliant health insurance plan. As Matthew wrote me, ``Our family was all young and healthy, and we thought this plan was right for us. Then, my 11-year-old got sick right out of the blue. It can happen to anyone at any time.''  Matthew is right. Illness can strike any one of us at any time--and not just the flu, not just a cold, but tragic, expensive, terminal illnesses can strike any family in America at any time.  Just listen to the story of Kerry from Wilmington, DE, a massage therapist who considers the Affordable Care Act, as she puts it, ``nothing short of miraculous.'' Here is why. Kerry signed up for health insurance in 2014 thanks to the subsidies, the tax credits provided through the Affordable Care She had long had nagging abdominal and lower back pain. She didn't think much of it considering she had no family history of terrible diseases and had never even had a stitch before. Fast forward to January of 2015, when a routine diagnostic procedure covered by her new health insurance revealed that Kerry had stage III colon cancer. She had surgery a week later, followed by 6 months of chemotherapy, and ended up facing no out-of-pocket expenses besides her annual deductible. Kerry's cancer has now been in remission since September of 2015, and as she writes, ``The ACA came along at the last possible moment to save my life. I am certain that without it, I would have just continued to live and work with the discomfort and try to self-treat until the cancer was so advanced it could not have been successfully treated.''  I have many more, but stories like Kerry's and Matthew's and Carla's and Sue's and Kim's have been pouring into the inboxes of my colleagues in States around the country.  My Democratic colleagues and I know, and have known since the day it was signed into law, that the ACA is not perfect. I have talked to small businesses that want to offer health insurance for their employees but have struggled to find affordable options in I have met plenty of Delawareans whose deductibles or premiums are higher than they would like to see, and I have heard from economists and budget forecasters who know our country's fiscal health depends on doing even more to control health care costs.  That is exactly why 2 years ago I came to this floor with a simple, commonsense request of my Republican colleagues: work with us to make the Affordable Care Act better. A colleague, a physician from the State of Louisiana, happened to be listening that day, and we have had a number of constructive and positive conversations since. Sadly, despite many attempts over many years, I so far have been unable to find a Republican partner willing to actually cosponsor meaningful, constructive fixes to the law.  In my view, and as I said 2 years ago, no conversation about the Affordable Care Act and how to improve it can be complete without reconciling the reality of the millions of Americans it has helped and the many others for whom it has fallen short.  I have sought to address the affordability of health care coverage for all families. I have cosponsored bills to increase tax credits to make it more affordable for small businesses, looked for ways to make sure there is more competition in the marketplace, especially in small States like Delaware, and pursued commonsense regulatory reforms and cost-containment efforts to further slow the growth in health care costs. For years, my colleagues and I have asked our Republican friends to put aside their rhetoric and focus on pursuing bipartisan fixes like these.  Today, the bottom line is still this: I know the Affordable Care Act has helped millions of Americans just like the Delawareans whose stories I have read. Kerry, Carla, Matthew, Sue, and Kim today live healthier, safer, and more secure lives.  Let's take a look at the alternative. There is no single proposed plan. There are dozens of bills in the House and Senate that would do lots of different things, but it would be very hard to predict with precision what the alternative really is. We know what repeal will do. As of today, the alternative--let's call it TrumpCare--is nothing more than a wholesale repeal with no clear plan to replace.  TrumpCare, a simple repeal, by one estimate would kick 26 million Americans--more than 50,000 Delawareans--off their health insurance. Even for those who don't lose their insurance, those hundreds of thousands of Delawareans who get their insurance through their employer, it would be much lower quality because it would[[Page S174]]remove all the consumer protections that we have all come to embrace. It would give a nearly $350 billion tax cut to the wealthiest 1 percent of our country and a nearly $250 billion tax cut to big corporations. While tax cuts have their day and their reason, pushing aside all of that revenue with no plan for how to replace the Affordable Care Act and how to pay for it will become a desperate and dangerous move. TrumpCare, a simple repeal of the Affordable Care Act, would cut 3 million jobs and trigger negative economic impacts well beyond the health care sector by creating profound uncertainty. Lastly, it would burden State and local governments, which would lose nearly $50 billion in tax revenue.  That is the reality. Describing a repeal of the Affordable Care Act as anything other than the injection of wild uncertainty into our daily lives, into the health insurance and health care markets is just not square. That is the reality. Describing it any other way is political rhetoric, and that is, sadly, what this debate is about. It is repeal without replace.  Matthew from Wilmington, whose 11-year-old son was diagnosed unexpectedly with brain cancer, concluded his note to me with one last thought. He wrote of his son: ``He's my hero and I will fight for him and all others who continue to suffer similarly every day.''  Thank you, Thank you for sharing your story and continuing the fight. I promise you and all the Delawareans who have reached out to me to do my level best to stand with you and fight for you every step of the way every day until we find a better path together.

It is misguided, leaving the States and the tribes to be reliant on mineral royalties, to lose out on these revenues, and lose out on the good-paying jobs that coal supports. Ryan Zinke will take a fresh look at our coal programs and see how we can access these untapped resources in an environmentally responsible way.  Let me remind my colleagues that Ryan Zinke was born and raised in It is a State where we like to say we get to work where we also like to play. He will restore that balance to the Department so Montanans can gain better access to our public lands.  He will also ensure our public lands work for those who live closest to them, and that means our States and our tribes. Ryan is a He grew up in America's public lands. He grew up in the shadows of Glacier National I grew up in the shadows of Yellowstone National He knows we must strike this balance between conservation and responsible energy development, and he understands better than anybody I know that one-size-fits-all policies of Washington, DC, never work for real  I look forward to voting for my friend, my colleague, a Navy SEAL for 23 years, and our next Secretary of the Interior, Ryan   ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgS1511-4.txt,2138,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1259, VA ACCOUNTABILITY FIRST ACT",2017.0,1.0,January

6780,topic-id,383,"Mr.Chair, we all know that hard-edged partisan politics has not only eroded the confidence that the Americanpeople have in our government, but it has caused government to function to a very low standard.  In my 4 years that I have been in this Congress, I have never seen a better example of that than what we have here today.Because today, we are considering a budget that is not only fiscally irresponsible, it doubles our deficits across 10 years,increases the national debt by $10 trillion, but its sole purpose is to repeal the Affordable Care  The purpose of today's budget is not to amend the Affordable Care Act to preserve its strengths and tackle it weaknesses,nor is the purpose of today's budget to repeal the Affordable Care Act and put something in place that has been well thoughtthrough and shared with the American public. The purpose of today's bill is to repeal the Affordable Care Act in a cold, hardway and let the chips fall where they fall. And this is not being done because it is good policy.  Anyone who is serious about healthcare policy--even people who oppose the Affordable Care Act--who has looked at this issue,has concluded, by any measure, the Affordable Care Act should not be repealed without a replacement. It is being done forpolitical reasons because my colleagues, unfortunately, for years, have told their supporters that they would repeal this billat all cost, without having the courage or convictions to explain to them the consequences of repeal without replacement; norwithout the determination to do the work to come up with an alternative.  The Affordable Care Act was passed 8 years ago. It was passed on a straight party-line basis, which was unfortunate. It hadthree important goals, which it has achieved: to expand health care in over 20 million people; to lower the overall cost ofhealth care in this country, which is the most important number in our fiscal health; and to improve the quality of health care.  Is it perfect? Are we addressing its problems today? Are we repealing it without any replacement? By anymeasure, will that be bad for the public health and potentially cause a public health crisis in the United States of America?The answer to that is yes.  I urge my colleagues to reject the budget proposal.  ",CREC-2017-01-13-pt1-PgH490.txt,2133,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1259, VA ACCOUNTABILITY FIRST ACT",2017.0,13.0,January

Dick Bernick, the patriarch of the third generation to run family-owned Bernick's Companies, passed away after an incredible life.  Bernick's Companies is a Minnesota success story. This past year, Bernick's and the Bernick family reached an amazing milestone with the 100th anniversary celebration of the business. Dick played a huge role in that success by guiding and growing the family business through good and financially difficult times.  Dick Bernick's life was an American success not just because of his business, but because his life was filled with family, friends, and service to the community he so loved. Dick gave so much to the Cloud community. In fact, his company continues to donate a percentage of its profits back to different charities and organizations in the communities that Bernick serves.  We send our sincere condolences to Dick's wife, Lila; his children; and the rest of his family. We hope that you will find comfort in the fact that Dick's life and his legacy of generosity have left an indelible mark on the community that he loved, and that he will always be remembered.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgH617.txt,2253,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1259, VA ACCOUNTABILITY FIRST ACT",2017.0,24.0,January

It makes no sense to start fixing up my house until I can get the goat out. Voting for thefiscal year `17 budget resolution gets this goat out of my house.

No more 32 percent increase in Georgia premiums; no more having your doctor pulled away fromyou; and no more government mandates.

After ObamaCare was signed into law, these problems only got worse. I saw my patients, friends, and neighbors forced away from their doctors that they trusted. Instead of decreasing costs, patients saw their premiums skyrocket, their deductibles skyrocket, and their access to care limited. As a healthcare provider, I want to do what is best for my patients. I committed to them that I would come to Congress to repeal ObamaCare and undo the damage that it has done to our healthcare system.  The legislation we are currently considering in the House, the American Health Care Act, is just the first step toward keeping that promise. By passing this legislation, we begin to move the ball down the field and gain yardage rather than continuing to lose ground. This is not our only play. It is the first step in beginning to drive down costs and increasing access to care for patients.  This legislation will keep our promise to repeal ObamaCare and eliminate the government mandates that force people to purchase a product that they don't want.

Wehave all heard from constituents and families who are struggling to get by as they suffer the consequences of the fatally flawedhealthcare law.  In my home State of North Carolina, the average ObamaCare premium has increased by a staggering 40 percent. Terry fromAdvance, North Carolina, is a 70-year-old retiree, but now he is working part time just to help pay for his wife's healthcarepremiums, which jumped from $300 a month to more than $887 a month.  On top of higher premiums, deductibles have skyrocketed, too. Patricia from Kernersville now has a whopping $6,550deductible, and her premiums increased by 80 percent this year. Like so many Americans, Patricia is paying more for lesscoverage.  Despite being promised, ``if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it,'' millions of Americans have been kicked offtheir plans. Scott from Hickory has had his health insurance canceled three times now; disrupting his continuity of care.  We have also heard from countless small-business owners who can no longer afford coverage for their employees because oflimited resources and soaring costs. Facing similar challenges, school leaders and college administrators have spoken out abouthow ObamaCare is exacerbating tight budgets--hurting teachers, faculty members, and, ultimately, the students they serve.  The current situation is not sustainable; so Republicans are here on a rescue mission by providing the American peoplerelief. It is time to repeal President Obama's government takeover of health care. It is time to advance patient-centeredreforms that lower costs, provide more choices, and put working families--not government bureaucrats--in control of their healthcare.

A child born today in this country will inherit a crushing burden of debt, part of an intergenerational crime without consequence.  Meanwhile, the middle class is being hollowed out, if not disappearing entirely. We have a 7-million-man strong army that simply opted out of the labor force entirely.

Now we are left in a position where we need to pass this resolution to get rid of what we found.  Liberty and self-determination are the lifeblood of this Nation, and the Nation is terminally ill. Our debt is a cancer thatcontinues to grow; and like a cancer, it doesn't discriminate. It is colorblind, it is gender neutral, and it doesn't care aboutyour political affiliation or what State you are from. It is here, and it continues to grow.[[Page H500]]  Our children are being encumbered, packaged, and sold to the gallows by way of unprecedented debt. This is an unprecedentedtreatment, but if we continue down the ObamaCare unaffordable care act path that we are on, the results are guaranteed.  Today's resolution provides treatment for some of the symptoms, but it is about time that we started getting to the rootcauses of the disease. The more government encroaches on the lives of its citizens, the more debt grows, the less our libertiescan breathe, and the sicker we become.

6636,topic-id,960,"Mr.President, Irise to strongly oppose this legislation concerning a waiver for General  I know that all of my colleagues on theArmed Services Committee who just left the hearing on this very topic with General Mattis and this entire body take theoversight role of our committee very seriously. We take civilian control of the military as a fundamental constitutionalprinciple of the Founding Even George Washington put aside his commission 5 years before he became our Commander inChief and became the President of the United When Congress in 1947 debated the National Security Act to create theDepartment of Defense and create the Secretary of Defense, they decided to imbue this idea of civilian control into theSecretary of Defense by law, by mandating that he had to be separated from the military at least 10 years before taking on therole of Secretary of Defense, enshrining again this notion that civilian control is so important to our democracy and ourAmerican values.  On Tuesday, the Armed Services Committee had a very compelling hearing. We had two experts testify aboutthe reasons for civilian control and why they are still so important today. The importance of having a Secretary of Defense whobrings a civilian perspective to this position and brings with him or her a breadth of views and experience--those views comingfrom a civilian are very important.  Second, they said it is very important not to politicize our officer ranks, meaning oursenior, top military advisers jockeying for the next job as a political appointee. That undermines the functioning of themilitary, and they testified about countries where it has had such deleterious effects.  The third reason is concern aboutbias toward one service or another. Arguably, if one comes from a particular service, one may have preferences innately for thatbranch of service, which could undermine the strength of our military.  The fourth reason, which is really important intoday's world, is the desire to model civilian control for other countries around the world that are struggling to become moredemocratic, less autocratic, and less militarily run.  Those are the four reasons given as to why civilian control of themilitary is so important. Cohen and Hicks both agreed--despite those four reasons--that from their perspective, it shouldbe abrogated. Cohen said it was because the characteristics of the incoming administration gave him such concern that heneeded to have someone like General Mattis and thought the qualities of General Mattis were important. Even Hicks said itwas the qualities of General Mattis that were so unique and important, but she very importantly said: Never, though, should wesay that it is time for a general to be the Secretary of In her perspective, it should never be that you need ageneral. So for her it was not the exigencies of circumstances; it was the specific characteristics of General  Overwhelmingly, the Senators and the Members of the Armed Services Committee, myself included, have expressed enormousgratitude for the extraordinary service of General That is not in debate. But if there is no civilian in all the worldas of today at this moment who could meet the needs of the incoming administration, then who is to say that there will be nocivilian in the future who could meet the needs of this administration, should they need another Secretary of Defense, or thenext administration?  What we are doing today, inadvertently, because of a cherished notion we have toward this one nominee,is subverting the standard, and, in fact, this exception now can swallow the whole rule. If we are literally saying an exceptioncould be made because of the nature of an administration and the nature of a nominee, we have literally swallowed the rule.  I think it is a historic mistake. I truly believe we are about to unwind something that has served this country well for thepast 50 years. We are about to unwind it. Interestingly, the last time the Congress unwound it, they said: Never again.  Theydidn't say: If you have an urgency as we have now, which was the concern, according to these experts, that World War III waslooming, the concern that we needed a well-known, well-loved general because of all the foreign policy worries of the momentwith North Korea; they said: Never again.  I don't know why we are here. I really don't know why--because it is not thestandard.  Now this is the world we are going to live in. President-Elect Trump will mainly have his foreign policy inputfrom two four-star generals and a three-star general. So where is the diversity of opinion coming from? Where is that balancegoing to come from, the 1 reason the experts gave for why we have civilian control of the military--Tillerson?  EvenGeneral Marshall, if we remember history correctly, had the experience of being a former Secretary of State and head of the RedCross, so he had civilian experience in addition to his military experience. Civilian control has very important constitutionalreasons based on our democratic values, the balance of power, and how our democracy runs. Those principles are being gutted andignored. We are not using the right standards, and I think it is a historic mistake.  As I stated, this has nothing to dowith our particular nominee. These principles exist for a reason. It has enabled our country's success for decades and has keptour democracy safe. If we take this change in our laws lightly, as we are about to do today, when future Congresses--or even thissame Congress 2 or 3 year from now--look at this and want to make the same exception, it will be much easier to do.  I willcontinue to oppose this waiver for any nominee who is not a civilian or who has not met the waiting period that is required bylaw, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same. I urge them to vote no.  ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgS299-2.txt,1866,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCALYEAR 2017,2017.0,12.0,January

Mr.Chairman, it is not a surprise, when you try to take over such a sizable chunk of America's economy, that you have allsorts of unintended bad consequences. I am going to focus on two consequences that are true of so many programs that thegovernment puts out there.  First of all, ObamaCare is one more program that discourages work. If you talk to your accountants again and again, theywill tell you stories of people who are very conscious of the fact that, as they get a raise, as they work more overtime, theylose big subsidies. If I were to lose my next election, ObamaCare would continue. As my income would go up from $49,000 to$50,000, I would get hammered with a $4,500 loss. So it wouldn't be surprising that people in my position would be very carefulnot to get a raise or not to work overtime.  Even worse, this is one more government program that discourages marriage. If you have a single parent who is making $20,000and if he decided to marry somebody making $30,000 or $40,000, he would be hammered with a $3,500 loss. Combined with theFoodShare program, the low-income housing subsidies, Pell grants, and various TANF programs, this is just one more step that theAmerican Government has taken to discourage work and to discourage marriage.

6847,topic-id,1854,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman, my friend from Colorado, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate, and I rise to debate the rule providing for consideration of the three bills related to the Department of Veterans Affairs--interestingly, all under one rule. We have been doing two bills under one rule. We are now headed to three. I recommend we just put all of our bills under a rule and save us a lot of time.  The first bill under today's rule, to improve the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire and retain physicians and other employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the bipartisanship reflected in this bill is certainly a rarity in this body and, frankly, could have easily come before us under the suspension of the rules.  There are nearly 47,000 job vacancies for doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals throughout the Veterans Administration's healthcare system. The VA is consistently rated as one of the worst Federal agencies in terms of pay and leadership, and since 2009, the number of VA employees resigning or retiring has risen every year.                              {time}  1245  As of the new year, 547,000 patients were waiting more than 30 days for care at a VA hospital. It is clear that we must act to improve the VA on a holistic level, and this bill is a good start.  This legislation establishes staffing, recruitment, and retention programs to enable the VA to build a stronger workforce.  However, I am disappointed that the Rules Committee majority did not make in order an amendment that I offered to this measure, which would have allowed the Secretary of the VA to fill any existing vacant positions within the Veterans Administration, regardless of whether the position was vacated before or after the reckless hiring freeze imposed by Donald John  I would also note that Representatives Schrader and Moulton offered an amendment that would fully lift the hiring freeze, but the Rules Committee blocked this amendment as well from receiving a vote on the House floor. I remain disheartened at the way the majority continues to operate the business of the House of  The bipartisanship this bill enjoys dissipates when we move to another bill wrapped in today's three-rule measure, and that is H.1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Before I launch into all of my remarks regarding this, I want to make it very clear that I and most Members of the House of Representatives will do everything we can to protect the Second Amendment rights of U.citizens and veterans especially.  This legislation, however, if enacted, would immediately enable approximately 174,000 veterans currently deemed mentally unfit by the VA to purchase firearms. At its core, this bill assumes that all veterans with mental illness should have unfettered access to guns, regardless of whether they will turn the weapon on themselves or their loved ones, and that any determination otherwise is simply wrong. The broadly reaching bill arbitrarily removes every veteran flagged by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System from its rolls, literally putting tens of thousands of lives at risk.  Let's look at the facts. Under procedures currently in place by the VA and the Department of Justice, an individual who lacks the mental capacity to contract or to manage his or her own affairs can be prevented from purchasing a gun. This term applies to veterans with severe mental illnesses who require a fiduciary to help manage their VA benefits. If the veteran thinks there was an error or that he or she was unfairly disqualified, the veteran can utilize the same due process and appeals procedures that are available for other VA decisions.  Under the current process, which was codified in the 21st Century Cures Act just a few months ago, the veteran is allowed a hearing before the Board of Veterans Appeals and given several opportunities for judicial review and appeal in Federal court.  Mr.Speaker, this bill turns this sensible and humane approach on its head. It is time that we acknowledge where we are as a country. It is time that we deal with the fact that we are in the midst of a veterans' suicide epidemic. Twenty veterans kill themselves every day. That is 7,300 of our finest and bravest persons in our society. Two-thirds of these suicides are carried out using firearms.  A Department of Veterans Affairs report, provided to Congress in 2015, revealed that nearly 20,000 veterans diagnosed with schizophrenia, 15,000 diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and thousands more diagnosed with dementia, Alzheimer's, and serious depression were on the NICS rolls. Under this bill, these individuals and many more would be given immediate[[Page H2096]]access to guns, putting themselves and others in danger.  Even as our Nation suffers shooting after shooting, Congress has not acted. Democrats held a sit-in in this very room in that well in this last Congress to protest the callousness of the House Republican leadership in preventing us from even considering legislation to protect our citizens with reference to guns. Rather than act to address gun violence, we instead considered legislation like this, which will actually lead to more gun violence, Mr.The logic and lack of compassion in such an approach absolutely escapes me.  Our country has witnessed horrific shootings in the past few years. Dozens of children were murdered at Sandy Nearly 50 people were killed at the Pulse nightclub in One of our very own from this Congress was nearly assassinated while holding a townhall event in 2011. We continue to ignore the ramifications of shootings at Oak Creek, Aurora, Virginia Tech--I could go on and on--The list just continues. 32,000 Americans lose their lives every year from gun violence.  We have grieved together. And I, along with several of my colleagues, have stopped standing down here in the well for a moment of silence and then going back to our regular business after hundreds of our people are killed throughout this society. We have demanded change together, and we have been shocked by the paralysis that has gripped this institution when it comes to taking commonsense steps to end our country's gun violence epidemic.  Today, we see in this bill another measure coming out of Republican leadership that sprints toward the goal set by this country's powerful gun lobby. Listen up, NRA, there are people like me that aspire to have a zero rating by you every year. And it is not just the gun lobbyists, it is gun manufacturers as well. It may be great for the gun manufacturers' bottom line and the NRA's bottom line, but it is terrible for those brave men and women who have served this country so fully, those brave men and women who suffer wounds that may not be visible to the naked eye, but are no less real and worthy of our attention.  With each new tragedy that occurs, whether it be a mass shooting or the 20 servicemembers we lose every day to suicide, those who stand in the way of legislation to address our country's gun violence epidemic are increasingly culpable for its continuation. I am disgusted with this morally bankrupt obfuscation, and I think the American people are, too.  Let me lay down a marker. Of the 435, plus six Members of the House of Representatives and the 100 U.Senators, I want to see the first person when this measure goes into effect, if it does, and 174,000 veterans are taken off of the NICS rolls and can access guns, the first one that dies--and I hope we track it--I want everybody to stand up and remember that we had a chance to stop it here. Don't tell me, if 20 veterans are killing themselves every day and if 7,000-plus of them are killing themselves every year--and we won't even mention domestic violence and the horror that comes from those guns--if we continue this effort, we will allow more deaths along those lines.  Before concluding, Mr.Speaker, I want to say a few words about the final bill encompassed in this rule, H.1259, the VA Accountability First Act of 2017, and the Republicans' continued assault on the working people of this country.  At its core, this bill is an attack on workers' rights, plain and simple, and will do more harm than good in our efforts to improve care at the Veterans This legislation would strip the collective bargaining rights of VA workers. It weakens an employee's right to appeal. It weakens protections for VA workers who speak up against mismanagement and patient harm.  Republicans claim they want to help fix our VA system, yet, with this bill, they do that by insulting, undermining, and attacking the very employees who serve and care for our veterans, including the over 120,000 veterans who work for the Yesterday, one of our colleagues presented at the Rules Committee a statistic that I didn't know. Of the 2 million Federal employees in this great Nation of ours, 640,000 of them are veterans. So when we get ready to pare back this government that somehow or another people have targeted for all sorts of cuts, if you read today's budget proposal by Donald John Trump, you will see that lots of these veterans will be losing their jobs, in addition to all of the things that we have already discussed.  We need to make improvements at the Everybody knows that. That is clear. But singling out VA employees and their protections is counterproductive, to say the least, and only compounds manpower shortages plaguing the agency.  This legislation will exacerbate recruitment problems and impair retention at the agency. It threatens the agency's ability to build a robust clinical workforce by threatening the quality of care that the VA will be able to provide.  I don't know what the pique is by my Republican colleagues with reference to workers in this country. They talk a very good game about protecting workers and we are going to bring back jobs and we are going to do all of these things that are going to protect the middle class.  I will get a chance to talk about this a little bit more, but I am very proud of the unions in this They are the unions that people like my father and countless of us who served in the House of Representatives worked in and helped build this They are the people that our veterans from the Second World War, the Korean conflict, and Vietnam who became union members and went on to do things for collective bargaining that made workers' rights be better for people in And I don't see tearing them down--let alone in the VA administration--is something that we need to do.  Mr.Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle know exactly where their priorities lie with this bill, and it is certainly not with improving the quality of care of our veterans, but rather in exploiting yet another opportunity to attack the rights of working men and women across our country.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2094-3.txt,511,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCALYEAR 2017,2017.0,16.0,February

That may be good policy for the powerful gun lobby and gun manufacturers, but it is horrendous policy for the American people.  We have before us legislation that will gut workers' rights for VA employees while also making it easier to reprimand those who are brave enough to speak out against the ills they see occurring at the VA--ills that have and will continue to undermine the quality of service our veterans are able to receive.  All of this moral ineptitude is set against the backdrop of a healthcare plan recently put forth by Republicans that will raise the number of uninsured in this country to 24 million in under 10 years. This includes 14 million folks being unceremoniously kicked off of Medicaid and 7 million Americans kicked off of the health insurance plans they receive through their employers.  This is a plan that will increase premiums for individual policyholders by up to 29 percent. This is a plan that will increase, particularly for older Americans, out-of-pocket healthcare expenses.  Mr.Speaker, in the final analysis, this is no plan at all but rather a shameful and cynical massive giveaway to the ultrawealthy at the expense of the middle class that will result in hardworking Americans paying far more for far, far less.

Quite simply, it was one ofthe most blatant exercises in pure partisanship in our Nation's history. It deepened partisan divides in Washington and aroundthe country and contributed to the cynicism many have about whether their government is actually paying attention to theirneeds. Worst of all, in the years since the passage of ObamaCare, the American people have been paying the price in the form ofskyrocketing costs, fewer choices, burdensome mandates, and unfair taxes.  For 7 years, many of us in Congress--virtually allof us on the Republican side--have been working to right what has gone wrong under the Affordable Care We have pledged toour constituents that, given the opportunity, we would repeal ObamaCare and replace it with reforms more worthy of the Those promises are among the biggest reasons why we Republicans are now fortunate enough to find ourselves in control ofCongress and, very soon, the White  Last night we took a big step in the effort to repeal and replace Withthe budget resolution passed, many in Washington and in the media are talking about what happens next. We are hearing a lot ofdiscussion about the timing of our repeal-and-replace efforts, with some arguing that we should hit the brakes and solve everyproblem in advance of taking another vote. My view is that the repeal of ObamaCare cannot wait. The American people need us toact now. While there is still some debate as to what our replacement plan should look like, a majority of Senators voted lastnight to give us the tools to take the next steps to repeal and replace The American people have entrusted us withthe power to do just that.  We could spend the next several months coming up with more slogans and analogies, but this is nota campaign. The elections have been won, and it is time to do what our constituents have sent us here to do. I am not saying weneed to put off the replacement effort. On the contrary, I think it is important that the legislation we draft pursuant to thebudget reconciliation instructions include as many sensible health reforms as possible, keeping in mind the limitations thatexist with our rules and the necessary vote count.  We should definitely work on making the largest possible downpayment onthe ObamaCare replacement with the budget reconciliation bill. That downpayment should include measures that give individualsand families more control over their health care decisions and empower States to do more of the heavy lifting when it comes toregulating health care. In addition, we need to provide for a smooth transition period so we can maintain some stability in thehealth insurance markets and ensure that we are not leaving Americans who have insurance under the current system out in thecold.  As chairman of one of the primary committees with jurisdiction over these matters, I have been working closely with myHouse counterparts--Chairman Kevin Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee and Chairman Greg Walden of the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee--to develop proposals on the matters that fall within our purviews. We have been talking withstakeholders throughout the country and working through the various problems that exist. That work will continue unabated as wework on the immediate repeal effort and into the future. I am quite certain that my friend who chairs the Senate HELP Committeehas been similarly engaged in addressing the draconian insurance regulations that were imposed under ObamaCare, as well as theother parts of the law that are within that committee's jurisdiction.  In other words, the work to replace ObamaCare isongoing, and we hope to have some initial elements ready to include in the budget reconciliation package. That work willcontinue once the repeal has been passed and signed into law so that we can help ensure that affordable health care optionsexist for We do not need to wait until every single replacement measure is drafted and agreed upon before movingforward. Instead, we need the incoming administration to add to our current efforts and work with us to produce a fullreplacement plan and then to execute it. I look forward to continuing to work with President-Elect Trump and his team.  Thepath forward on replacing ObamaCare could end up taking many forms. We could draft and pass a series of limited reforms toreplace ObamaCare piece by piece or we could pull together a full and comprehensive replacement package that puts all thenecessary changes into law at once. I think there are merits and potential pitfalls with either approach. That is something weneed to consider as we move forward, but it is not a decision that needs to be made before we can keep the promises we all madeto our constituents to repeal  To be sure, replacing ObamaCare is going to be a difficult process; however, with anew and more cooperative administration in place, I have every confidence we can accomplish these important objectives withoutimposing artificial deadlines or goalposts or putting the repeal process on hold. All of this is possible so long as we remaincommitted to the principles that have guided most of our efforts thus far. For example, in my view, the new reforms need to bepatient-centered, not government-driven. They need to recognize the reality of the marketplace and the benefits of competition.Perhaps most importantly, any suitable reforms need to put the States back in charge of regulating and overseeing health carepolicy. If the ObamaCare experience has taught us anything, it is that when the Federal Government gets a hold of something thatis as consequential as health care, it will overpromise results, overstep its authority, and overregulate the subject matter.  As I have said a number of times, Utah is not California or Massachusetts, and California and Massachusetts are not Utah.All of our States face different challenges and have different needs. There is no reason to begin with the premise that anysingle approach to health care policy is what is best for the entire country. That is why I, along with several of mycolleagues, have been engaging with stakeholders at the State level for quite some time as we work to craft reforms and to putthem in place. For example, next week the Senate Finance[[Page S304]]Committee is hosting a roundtable discussion on Medicaid withsome of the most prominent Governors in the country. I am pleased that Energy and Commerce chairman Greg Walden will joinus for the discussion as well. This meeting and others like it will give States the opportunity to detail the challenges theyface and how we can empower them to meet those challenges instead of dictating solutions from offices here in Washington,  I believe all of my colleagues want to be judicious and methodical with this undertaking. No one wants to act recklessly anddo even more damage to our Nation's health care system. Discussions and debates over the substance of our ObamaCare replacementshould continue. As I said, they have been going on for some time now, and they are not going to stop. But after last night, wehave the tools we need to take the first major step in this effort by repealing In my view, we need to take that stepnow.  Republicans are united in our desire to repeal We have the support of the American people to do just that,and I personally will do all I can to deliver on that promise. I hope our friends on the other side will work with us. If theywill, I think we can come up with an approach toward health care that not only will work but will be better for our country butmost importantly, better for our citizens, better for the States that will manage a lot better than we will here, and better forour citizens within those  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

6730,topic-id,516,"Mr.Chairman, every American will be affected by this vote, not just the 20 million people who will lose theirinsurance immediately. Thirty million, in total, will lose their insurance. Everybody's premium will ultimately go up.Preexisting conditions will not be available. Seniors will pay more for prescription drugs. 25-, 24-, 23-year-olds will bedropped from the insurance of their families.  The fact of the matter is--the gentleman from Florida that just spoke--there is not a better way that has been proposed. Thereis some discussion about across State lines. There is some other discussion about health savings accounts, which is great if youhave the kind of salaries we have; but if you are an average American trying to support your family, getting additional funds toput into a health savings account is not available to you.  Mr.Chairman, this budget resolution is an abdication of responsibility and duty. Rather than showing Republican spendingand revenue priorities, it is nothing more than a vehicle for expediting a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and takinginsurance coverage away from 30 million people.                              {time}  1200  Again, let me remind you it is hundreds of millions of people that will be adversely affected.  Since taking the House majority, Republicans have held 65 votes on this floor to undo healthcare reforms that have broughtthe uninsured rate to its lowest in recorded history and banned discrimination and discriminatory practices, such as denyingcoverage to Americans with preexisting conditions or charging women higher rates than men simply because of their gender.  Now our Republican colleagues want to repeal the Affordable Care Act without immediately replacing it, contrary to at least12 of their colleagues in the United States Senate--Republicans--saying that is not the right way to go. That is what thisresolution would do.  By the way, they should have adopted this resolution last Congress by April 15. They didn't do so.  This is not a real budget resolution. This is simply a device so that they can jam through repeal of the Affordable Care Actin the United States Senate contrary to the existing rules. It would come at a severe cost to our economy and our budgetsustainability.  In addition to the 30 million who would lose their insurance, tens of millions more, as I have said, would see their costsgo up. A report by the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund and Milken Institute found that the repeal would lead to the loss of 3million jobs, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found it would add $350 billion to deficits over the next 10years.  Let us be clear, Mr.Chairman, a vote for this budget resolution is a vote to take health insurance away from 30 millionAmericans and adversely impact the health care of millions more.  I urge my Republican colleagues who have serious concerns about our fiscal path and misgivings about repealing theAffordable Care Act without replacing it: let's lay down a marker that Congress should not rush headlong into this costly repealnot only in terms of dollars, but in terms of health security consequences for the American people.  Mr.Chairman, I urge the House to vote ``no'' on this dangerous and destructive resolution.

6826,topic-id,903,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday President Trump issued an executive order. He imposed a hiring freeze on the Federal workforce. It was not only a freeze, but an attack on those serving our country and a misguided action that will achieve the opposite of what is intended.  For those who are listening in the Chamber, Mr.Speaker, let me say that I am proud to represent 62,000 Federal employees. Hopefully, all of us refer to them as working people. We all say we want to be supportive of working people. Some people, however, in this body and down the avenue exempt Federal employees as working people.  They are not only working people, but they are working for the American people. Let's not forget that two-thirds of Federal employees live and work outside the Greater Washington area. It is very nice to say ``all of those bureaucrats in Washington,'' but two-thirds of our Federal employees serve in every community around our country, serve in protecting them: FBI agents; agents around the world who work for the Central Intelligence Agency--117 of whom died in service, and the President spoke in front of their memorial the other day--employees of the Centers for Disease Control keeping us healthy as communities and as a country, protecting our children and our families from diseases that would attack us; Federal employees at the National Institutes of Health studying how we prevent and cure cancer, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, autism, other afflictions that confront our country, both health care from a physical and mental standpoint; and, yes, nurses at our veterans hospitals. A freeze so that if a nurse leaves, you can't replace her or him; a doctor at a veterans hospital leaves, you can't replace that doctor, apparently; even at the IRS where we talk about making sure our tax system is fair and making sure that everybody pays their fair share, we undermine the ability to make that a reality; our Border Patrol to keep our borders safe; homeland security to keep our homeland safe--they serve the public in every State and every congressional district in the country.  This hiring freeze will not save us money or do anything to make the government more efficient. Should we do both? Will this policy do it? Its effect will be a reduction in the level of service benefiting the American people, greater difficulty in recruiting and retaining the most talented Americans to public service, and increased costs as a result of having to hire more expensive private contractors to do the work that still needs to be done.  That is something that the public doesn't understand, that, frankly, we exploded, in the early part of this century, the contracting out, which gave us less control and more cost. It is more expensive to contract out.                              {time}  1015  Already, our Federal employees have made significant sacrifices toward achieving a greater fiscal sustainability in this country. Now, let me give you the magnitude of that. Federal employees, over the last 10 years, have given up $159 billion in pay and benefits to which they would otherwise have been entitled, but we withdrew those resources from them.  Instead of continuing to vilify Federal civilian employees, as they have done for years--and when I say they, the politicians have done it, mostly on the Republican side of the aisle, but perhaps not exclusively--vilified our Federal employees. Republicans in Congress and in the White House ought to be thanking them for their hard work. I can't imagine any of us would treat our own employees, Mr.Speaker, in a fashion that said we are going to lay you off, we are going to undercut[[Page H613]]your pay, we are not going to give you the benefits which we promised you, and think that they were going to keep personnel on board with high morale and highly motivated to do the job, not only for us Members but for the American people. No employer would think that they can mistreat their employees and expect the highest performance out of them. And certainly no employer would think that if I treat my employees the way we have been treating Federal employees that we could recruit and retain the best and the brightest to serve our country.  Mr.Speaker, I urge the President to rescind his order. That is not to say that executives in all of these agencies should not look at making sure that we have the proper number of employees on board and are acting efficiently and effectively and working hard to accomplish the objectives that we as a Congress, on behalf of the American people, have given them. That is the issue.  I urge my Republican friends, in this House and in the Senate, to speak out against it. And I urge all Federal employees and their families to speak up in their communities across our country to remind their fellow Americans of the important work they do and why this hiring freeze would be so harmful to our country.  Giving one another respect in America is not political correctness. It is the way we ought to treat one another. And we ought to treat our public employees who work for us and our country with the same kind of respect that we would want for ourselves. Frankly, respect of one another was a victim in this last campaign, but it should not be and must not be the norm.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgH612-2.txt,566,NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION TRANSITION AUTHORIZATION,2017.0,24.0,March

6661,topic-id,1962,"Mr.President, I rise with my colleagues, and I am thrilled to be here with them, to save our health care and to try to convince our colleagues that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act would be health care malpractice, and because health care is one-sixth of the American economy, it would be economic malpractice as well.  What I thought I would do basically is just tell two stories. I am going to tell a Virginia story from before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and I am going to tell a Virginia story since the passage of the act.  I was first elected to statewide office in 2001, and I became the Lieutenant Governor of Shortly after, I started to attend, on a fairly regular basis, a most amazing annual event. It is called the Remote Area Medical clinic in Wise County, It is in the heart of Appalachia, in a community on the border of Kentucky where my wife's family is from. This was an annual medical clinic that was set up by some Catholic nuns who were driving a van around trying to offer medical care to people who didn't have it, and they decided they would recruit volunteers. They would set up at a dusty county fairground, the Virginia-Kentucky fairground in Wise, VA, and open the doors on Saturday to people who didn't have health care. It had been going for many years when I first went as Lieutenant I had heard so much about it, and I was anxious to go see it.  Here is what I saw when I first went there. People start to come on about Tuesday of the week when it is going to open on Friday, and they come in groups of three or four families, and then they come in groups of ten or dozens, and then hundreds, and then thousands, to this dusty county fairground in late July--hot in Southwestern They gather so that on Friday morning, at about 7 o'clock when it opens, they have gotten a number, they know where they are in the line, and sometime over the course of Friday and Saturday, they will be able to see a doctor, in some instances for the first time in their lives. There are doctors, dentists, medical students, the Lions Club volunteers to give vision screenings, hundreds of volunteers, and thousands of people seeking medical care.  The first year I went to this, I was overwhelmed at the magnitude of the philanthropic spirit of the volunteers, and I was also overwhelmed at the depth of the need. Something made it more palpable by walking around the parking lot to see where people had come from.  This is a community that is on the border of Virginia and Kentucky so I wasn't surprised to see Virginia license plates and Kentucky license plates. It is kind of near West Virginia so I wasn't surprised to see West Virginia license plates. It is near I saw Tennessee license plates. I saw North Carolina license plates. What struck me as I went through the parking lot was to see license plates from Georgia and license plates from Alabama and license plates from as far away as  We are the richest Nation on We are the most compassionate Nation on Yet, in order to get medical care, people would get in their cars and drive for days, and then camp for days, for the chance to see a doctor or a dentist.  It reminded me that first year, and it reminds me still, of the way health care was delivered in the poor country of Honduras where I served as a missionary in 1980 and 1981. There wasn't really a health care network. Occasionally, missionaries or others would set up a clinic in a mountain community once a year--maybe less than that--and people would gather, and that was the way we were delivering health care in a successful State, in the most compassionate and wealthiest Nation on It is just not right. It is just not right.  The RAM clinic still goes on. It hasn't gone away, but I will tell my colleagues what has happened since the passage of the Affordable Care The percentage of Americans without health insurance has dropped from over 16 percent to about 8 percent. It has almost been cut in half, and the uninsurance rate in this country is at its nearly lowest percentage since we have been able to record that number. That means there is less of a need for the RAM clinics because more people can have a medical home and can seek care. That decline has also been significant because in Virginia, we were about 14 percent uninsured in 2010, and that number has now come down to about 9 percent.  So that first story--the story of this RAM clinic, pre-Affordable Care Act, with one in six Americans not having health insurance--we have done a good thing as a Congress to provide access to dramatically reduce that number.  Let me tell my colleagues a second story. The second story is just about a family, a story in a letter that I received just a few days ago. It is a different aspect of the Affordable Care It is not so much about the reduction in the uninsured, but it is about more peace of mind and security for the majority of Americans who do have health insurance.       Dear Senator Kaine,       As a Senator, you have been charged with an immense task.      Your constituents rely on you to work on our behalf to uphold      and protect the freedoms we enjoy as Virginians and      We also rely on you to safeguard the legislation      that exists to keep our family and so many of our friends and      neighbors healthy and safe.       When I graduated from the University of Virginia, I was      fortunate to enter a career through which I received      excellent benefits. I taught second grade and kindergarten in      both Chesterfield and Albemarle My health insurance      was comprehensive and affordable. I didn't know how good I      had it.       After years in the classroom, I put my career on hold while      I stayed at home with our children. We were so lucky to have      been in a position to be able to make that choice. I know      that being able to rely on a single income is not a reality      for many We enrolled in a private health      insurance plan through my husband's company, a small business      based out of Richmond,       Our new plan came at a higher cost than my excellent      public-school teachers' insurance, but it was comprehensive      and it allowed my husband and me, and especially our      children, access to outstanding health care. Just this past      year, my husband, who was by then a part-owner in the      company, left his position to open his own Financial Advisory      firm. It was a move that was made easier because we had the      option of enrolling in a health insurance plan through the      Affordable Care Act, which we did in July of 2016.       In addition to well checkups, sick visits, prescriptions      for antibiotics, and vaccinations, we rely on our health      insurance made affordable through ``ObamaCare'' to, quite      literally, save our children's lives.       Our oldest son is ``medically complex.'' He was diagnosed      with multiple and severe food allergies when he was just 10      months old. Though he was initially highly reactive to over      13 foods, with the help of a vigilant pediatric allergist,      multiple blood draws, tens of skin prick tests, and four in-     office, hours-long oral food challenges, my son can now      safely eat all foods except for nuts, peanuts, milk, and      shellfish. Still, we pay a premium for life-saving      prescriptions that we hope he'll never need: Epi-pens. He      needs one at school and one that travels with him from home      to extracurricular activities. Even after insurance, we pay      nearly $1,000 each year for these prescriptions.       In addition to his pediatrician and allergist, we have been      to a psychologist for his anxiety and a cardiologist for a      detected heart murmur. More recently, after his pediatrician      became concerned about his stagnation on his growth chart, my      nine-year old has been subjected to more blood draws, weight      checks, countless hemoglobin level checks, and a consultation      with a gastroenterologist. Next week he will undergo an      endoscopy and a colonoscopy to, hopefully, diagnose a      treatable condition that, once known and treated, will enable      him to get back on that weight chart and thriving.       Because of our health insurance, we have the peace of mind      of being able to afford these doctors' visits, lab work, and      medical procedures for our son. Our medical insurance through      the Affordable Care Act allows us access to the best medical      care and professionals in our area.       Please do what is right for our family. Please do what is      right for your constituents. Please do what is right for our      country. Please save the Affordable Care       Thank you for taking the time to read one little piece of      our family's story.       Sarah Harris, Crozet,  My first story was about people who didn't have health insurance. My second story is about people who do have[[Page S164]]health insurance, but the health insurance is now affordable and comprehensive. My second story about the Harris family is also about something else important. Her husband was able to leave a job with health benefits to start his own company, which we want to encourage in this country. We want to encourage entrepreneurs. We want to encourage innovators. Before the Affordable Care Act, somebody like Mr.Harris couldn't leave his job and start a company because he wouldn't have been able to buy insurance that would have covered a child with a preexisting condition. Imagine being a parent with a dream, like so many have, of starting your own business, and realizing you could not achieve that dream and you would have to put it on hold because if you changed your job, you would not be able to get health insurance for your child.  I gave a speech about this on the floor last week. I will just conclude and say this. Health insurance is to provide a protection for you when you are ill or injured, but that is not all it is about because if you are a parent, even if your child is healthy, but you do not have health insurance, you go to bed at night wondering what is going to happen to my family if my child gets sick tomorrow or if I am in an accident tomorrow. Who is going to be there? How is my family going to be taken care of?  So what the Affordable Care Act is about is, as Sarah Harris said, peace of mind. It is about coverage, but it is also about the peace of mind that you need as a parent to know that your child will be protected if you are ill or if your child is injured. That is what the Affordable Care Act has done for the Harris family of Crozet, That is what it has done for tens of millions of  The Urban Institute indicated that if the Affordable Care Act is repealed without a replacement, or even a delayed replacement, it could cause 30 million Americans to lose their health insurance--and 30 million Americans is the combined population of 19 States in this country. This is not a game. This is very, very serious, life and death, that we are grappling with in this body. My strong hope is that our colleagues will join together and decide that we want to fix and improve the health care system of our Nation but not break it.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

6669,topic-id,1688,"Mr.President, my colleagues have spoken tonight eloquently about a number of consequences that would follow from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act: increasing drug costs for seniors, a devastating impact on rural hospitals, elimination of consumer protection in everybody's health insurance--not just those on the Affordable Care Act--and limitations on mental health coverage and substance abuse. All of those issues have been presented eloquently and passionately.  I want to do something a little different. This isn't easy for me, but I want to tell my own story and why I feel so strongly about the issue of health insurance for all of our people.  Forty-three years ago--I think it was just about this week--I was a young staff member here in the I was a junior staff member who was covered by health insurance provided by my employer, the U.I paid a share, and the Senate paid a share. The health insurance that I had, as part of it, had free preventive care--exactly like that required by the Affordable Care  The other thing the plan I chose had was a Wednesday night doctor's session. So because I had a free checkup and because it was on Wednesday night and I didn't have to miss any work, in late January or early February of 1974, I went in for a checkup--the first one I had had in 8 or 9 years. Everything looked fine. As I was putting my shirt back on, the doctor said: Well, you have a mole on your back, Angus, and I think you ought to keep an eye on it.  That night, I went home and mentioned it to my wife. The next morning, she said: I don't like the looks of that thing. Let's have it taken off.  I went back in the following Wednesday night because they had Wednesday night hours and I didn't have to take off from work. I had coverage so I didn't have to worry about what it was going to cost me, and the mole was removed. When they called me to come back in--I will never forget this moment as long as I live--the doctor said: Angus, I think you had better sit down. He told me that I had what was called malignant melanoma.  At the time, I didn't know what it meant. I thought it was simply a skin cancer. You hear about those all the time. You have them taken off, and it is no big deal. No, malignant melanoma is one of the most virulent forms of cancer. One of its characteristics is that it starts with a mole, but if you don't treat it, it then gets into your system and goes somewhere else. If you don't catch it in time, you will die.  I caught it in time. I had surgery. They took out a big hunk of my back in surgery and up under my arm. To this day, my shoulder is still numb from that surgery, but here I am.  It has haunted me since that day that I was treated and my life saved because I had health insurance. I know to a certainty that had I not had that coverage, had I not had that free checkup, I would not be here today. It has always stayed with me that somewhere in America that week, that month, that year, there was a young man or a young woman who had a mole on their arm or their back or their neck, couldn't do anything about it, didn't really think about it, didn't do anything about it until it was too late, and they are gone. And I am here. I don't know why I was saved. Maybe I was saved in order to be here tonight. But for the life of me, I cannot figure out why anyone would want to take health insurance away from millions of people. It is a death sentence for some significant percentage of those people.  In 2009, the American Journal of Public Health did a study--a comprehensive study. What they concluded was that for every million people who are uninsured, you can predict about 1,000 premature unnecessary deaths. So the math is pretty simple. Right now, we are talking about over 20 million people who have been afforded health insurance, either through the exchanges or through the expansion of Medicaid, who didn't have it before. If we take that away, that is 22,000 deaths a year. How can we do that with good conscience? How can we sentence people to death? We are talking about bankruptcies. We are talking about all the kinds of stories we have heard. They are all valid. They are all important. But for me, this is personal. This is about life itself. It is about our ethics, our morality, and our obligation to our fellow citizens.  Like all the other speakers, I know there are lots of problems with the Affordable Care I wasn't here when it passed. It isn't exactly the way I would have worked on it or written it. I am ready to sit down with anybody who wants to talk about finding a solution, but let's not talk about the solution being ripping coverage away from people who desperately need it. It is just wrong.  I understand the political impulse. Folks on the other side of the aisle have been talking about this for 6 years, and, by golly, they are going to repeal it and get rid of it, and people cheer and all of that kind of thing. But now it is real. This isn't rhetoric anymore. This isn't a bumper sticker anymore. This isn't a rally anymore. This is real people's lives.  So let's just slow down. If people want to come up with a different solution, if they want to modify the current system, if they want to try to make changes that make it easier for small businesses and change the hours of work and the definition of full time--all of those things can be discussed. I don't care who leads it. I don't care whether we call it TrumpCare, McConnellCare, or We can call it whatever we want, but the fundamental principle here is that health insurance is a life or death matter, and we should honor the commitment that has been made to those millions of people--including over 80,000 people in Maine--who have taken advantage of this program, many of whom have never had health care before, many of whom have had tragic stories that we have heard all night about children born with birth defects or children that had some disease at a young age or an adult who, as we just heard a few minutes ago, finds they had cancer and if they hadn't had the coverage and gone in, they wouldn't be here.  This isn't politics. This is people's lives. I can't believe that the good people that I know in this body on both sides of the aisle can't figure out a way to say: Let's slow down. Let's slow down and talk about how to fix it, how to change it, how to replace it. But put that before repeal because once repeal occurs, there are all kinds of bad results, even if they are grandfathered.  People say we are going to repeal and delay. That is repeal and chaos. The insurance industry is going to start to pull back. The health care industry is going to say: Well, we don't know what the situation is going to be. We are going to have to slow down. We are going to stop hiring. We are going to lay people off.[[Page S175]]  All those changes are going to start happening right away. They can't be prevented. To tell people don't worry, we are going to cover you--that is cruel. I don't think my colleagues intend to be cruel. There is not a mean-spirited person in this body. We just have a different view of how to achieve these results. But the fundamental results should be people have health insurance so they don't have to risk their lives every day and live under that threat. That is what this discussion is all about. That is why I am here.  I view this as much more than a political issue. I understand the differences, I understand the history, and I understand the politics of it, but I just think that now that it is real, let's slow down and find another way to solve this problem that protects the gains that have been made and sands off the rough edges of the law but allows us to protect the fundamental idea of helping people to find health insurance they can afford and keep them from being denied health insurance for reasons through no fault of their own.  I think this is a moral and ethical issue, and I go back and I feel so strongly about this because of my own experience. I feel I owe it to that young man in 1974 who didn't have insurance, who didn't have the checkup, who had melanoma, and who died. I have an obligation to that young man to see that doesn't continue to happen in the wealthiest, most developed society on  This is something we have within our power to do. I deeply hope that we can take a deep breath, back away from this idea that we have to repeal, and talk about fundamental principles of helping people to cope with this most serious and personal of issues.  I have confidence in this body. I have confidence in the good will of this body and of the American people. If we can get away from talking about it in the abstract as a political issue, we can talk about real people. That is what I hope we can do over the next weeks and months, and I am convinced we can come to a solution--not that will make everybody happy but that will save lives and make our country a better place.

6662,topic-id,376,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his leadership. He recently led a letter which a number of us joined in on to suggest that we make reforms to this bill. I said the day it passed that the Affordable Care Act was not an end but a beginning.  But we have not had opportunity, save for just a few examples where we changed some tax-reporting provisions under 1099. I was one of the people who led the successful efforts to suspend the medical device tax--something the Presiding Officer cares a lot about in his home State--but in truth, we have not had the opportunity that Senator Kaine suggested to make changes to this bill. Instead, we have been faced with the thought of just simply repealing this bill, with no replacement, with no plan in place. So we would all say to our colleagues across the aisle: Show us the plan. Show me the plan. Once we see that, we can start talking, but that is not what is happening today.  Additional changes could be made to the act, including increasing the amount of subsidies available to exchange enrollees, something important in my State; establishing perhaps State-based reinsurance programs; doing something about the pharmaceutical prices, something I have long advocated for. I have been ready and willing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and to find additional commonsense improvements to the law, but repealing without a replacement plan is simply unacceptable. It is chaos.  As my colleague from Virginia reminded us with a touching letter that he read from his constituent, let's remember what health care reform means to families across this country, why we have this bill in the first place. Americans with preexisting conditions, like asthma, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, can no longer be denied access to health insurance coverage. Children can stay on their parents' plans until they are 26, a dramatic change that helps so many families across Women are no longer charged more than men for health insurance.  We had a lot of issues when we debated this bill, making sure that being a woman or being a victim of domestic violence was not a preexisting condition.

6676,topic-id,1709,"Mr.President, we have heard a lot about President Trump's admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom most objective observers regard as a murderous thug and a kleptocrat. As we consider the President's statements lauding Putin for being a ``strong leader'' and his silence about the imprisonment and assassinations of Putin's critics and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, and atrocities in Syria, I am reminded of the remarks delivered on December 13 by Samantha Power, former Permanent Representative to the United Nations, at the U.Security  Ambassador Power delivered a passionate appeal to the Security Council to take action to protect civilians under assault in Aleppo, including to hold in contempt the governments of Syria, Russia, and Iran for their war crimes in Her remarks stand as a stark contrast to what we are hearing from the White House today. This is a time to condemn Vladmir Putin's aggressions against the people of Russia, of Ukraine, and of Syria--not to regard him as an example of a leader to emmulate.  It is also a time for Republicans to stand up for our own democracy, after the Russian Government, at Putin's direction, actively sought to sway the outcome of the U.Presidential election. The unanimous conclusion of U.intelligence agencies is that Putin, a former KGB agent, ordered a cyber attack on our electoral system in favor of Donald Russia's goals ``were to undermine public faith in the U.democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.'' Yet the White House and Republican leaders in Congress have been silent, apparently unconcerned about a foreign assault on our electoral system, refusing to even support an independent investigation. Imagine what they would be saying if their candidate had lost. They would be demanding a new election and trying to shut down the government.  I ask unanmious consent that Ambassador Power's remarks be printed in the Record to serve as a reminder of the scale of the humanitarian disaster in Syria perpetrated by Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin and our moral obligation to pursue accountability for those responsible.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Remarks at a UN Security Council Emergency Briefing on      Syria       Ambassador Samantha Power       U.Permanent Representative to the United Nations       U.Mission to the United Nations       New York City       December 13, 2016                              AS DELIVERED       Thank you. Here is what is happening right now in eastern      Syrians trapped by the fighting are sending out their      final appeals for help, or they are saying their goodbyes. A      doctor named Mohammad Abu Rajab left a voice message: ``This      is a final distress call to the world. Save the lives of      these children and women and old men. Save them. Nobody is      left. You might not hear our voice after this.'' A      photographer named Ameen Al-Halabi wrote on Facebook: ``I am      waiting to die or be captured by the Assad regime. Pray for      me and always remember us.'' A teacher named Abdulkafi Al-     Hamdo said: ``I can tweet now but I might not do it forever.      Please save my daughter's life and others. This is a call      from a father.'' Another doctor told a journalist: ``Remember      that there was a city called Aleppo that the world erased      from the map and history.''       This is what is happening in eastern This is what      is being done by Member States of the United Nations who are      sitting around this horseshoe table today. This is what is      being done to the people of eastern[[Page S1158]]     Aleppo, to fathers, and mothers, and sons, and daughters,      brothers, and sisters like each of us here.       It is extremely hard to get information, of course, out of      the small area still held by the opposition. You will hear      this as an alibi as a way of papering over what video      testimony, phone calls, and others are bringing us live. You      will hear this invoked--that it is hard to verify. It is      deliberate. The Assad regime and Russia backed by Iran using      militia on the ground have done everything they can to cut      off the city. So you will hear, ``well, we don't really know,      maybe it's made up''--but they are hiding what is happening      from the world. It would be easy for independent      investigators to get in along with food, health workers, and      others; but instead, the perpetrators are hiding their brutal      assault from the world willfully. But consider the accounts      that have made it out--so many of them--first responders      describing children's voices from beneath the rubble of      collapsed buildings. There are no first responders or      equipment left to dig them out, and no doctors left to treat      them. Bodies lying in the streets of eastern Aleppo, but no      one dares collect them, for fear of getting bombed or shot to      death in the process. Up to a hundred children are reportedly      trapped right now, in a building under heavy fire.      Clearly--young children--they must be terrorists      because everybody being executed, everybody being barrel      bombed, everybody who's been chlorine attacked, you're going      to be told they are all terrorists--every last one of them,      even the infants.       The regime of Bashar Al-Assad, Russia, Iran, and their      affiliated militia are the ones responsible for what the UN      called ``a complete meltdown of humanity.'' And they are      showing no mercy:       No mercy despite their territorial conquests--even now, no      mercy. In the last 24 hours alone, pro-Assad forces      reportedly killed at least 82 civilians, including 11 women      and 13 children.       These forces are reportedly entering homes and executing      civilians on the spot, as we have heard. And according to the      Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, foreign      militias like Iraqi Harakat Al-Nujaba organization are      involved in these killings. Where civilians are able to run      the gauntlet and make it across the frontlines, Syrian      intelligence agencies are pulling people aside and sending      them away, perhaps to be gang-pressed to the front lines,      likely to the same prisons where we know the Assad regime      tortures and executes those in its custody.       In light of these reports, we join others, especially the      Secretary-General, in one of his final appeals, reiterating      our call to the Assad regime and Russia to stop their assault      on Aleppo, to protect civilians. We call on Russia and Assad      to allow impartial, international observers into the city to      oversee the safe evacuation of the people who wish to leave,      but who justifiably fear that if they try, they will be shot      in the street or carted off to one of Assad's gulags.       The Assad regime and Russia appear dead set on seizing      every last square inch of Aleppo by force, no matter how many      innocent bodies pile up in their wake. But we keep insisting      on answering the UN call for access, for safe and orderly      evacuation, because we are not willing to accept that      innocent men, women, and children can be butchered simply      because they happen to live in a conflict area. Our shared      humanity and security demands that certain rules of war hold,      the most basic. And it is up to each and every one of us here      to defend those rules.       To the Assad regime, Russia, and Iran--three Member States      behind the conquest of and carnage in Aleppo--you bear      responsibility for these atrocities. By rejecting UN-ICRC      evacuation efforts, you are signaling to those militia who      are massacring innocents to keep doing what they are doing.      Denying or obfuscating the facts--as you will do today--     saying up is down, black is white, will not absolve you. When      one day there is a full accounting of the horrors committed      in this assault of Aleppo--and that day will come, sooner or      later--you will not be able to say you did not know what was      happening. You will not be able to say you were not involved.      We all know what is happening. And we all know you are      involved.       Aleppo will join the ranks of those events in world history      that define modern evil, that stain our conscience decades      later. Halabja, Rwanda, Srebrenica, and, now, To the      Assad regime, Russia, and Iran, your forces and proxies are      carrying out these crimes. Your barrel bombs and mortars and      airstrikes have allowed the militia in Aleppo to encircle      tens of thousands of civilians in your ever-tightening noose.      It is your noose. Three Member States of the UN contributing      to a noose around civilians. It should shame you. Instead, by      all appearances, it is emboldening you. You are plotting your      next assault. Are you truly incapable of shame? Is there      literally nothing that can shame you? Is there no act of      barbarism against civilians, no execution of a child that      gets under your skin, that just creeps you out a little bit?      Is there nothing you will not lie about or justify?       To the members of this Council, and all Member States of      the United Nations: Know that the ghastly tactics we are      witnessing in Aleppo will not stop if the city falls. The      regime and its Russian allies will only be emboldened to      replicate their starve-and-surrender-and-slaughter tactics      elsewhere. This will be their model for attempting to retake      cities and towns across       It will not end with And it will not focus on      terrorists. It never has, and there is no evidence that it      will.       This is why it is so essential that each of us right here--     no matter how small a country you are, no matter what your      view of sovereignty, if you share our view that terrorism is      one of the singular causes on earth worth fighting, it      doesn't matter--you have a responsibility to denounce these      atrocities. We have just heard the Secretary-General state it      plainly. You have to tell those responsible that they must      stop. This isn't the time for more equivocation, for self-     censoring, for avoiding naming names, for diplomatic niceties      of the kind that are so well-practiced here on the      Say who is responsible. Appeal to Moscow, to Damascus, to      Tehran, that they have to stop. Use every channel you have--     public, private, bankshot, through someone who knows someone.      The lives of tens of thousands of Syrians still in eastern      Aleppo--between 30,000-60,000 people--and hundreds of      thousands more across the country who are besieged, depend on      it.       I thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgS1157-2.txt,1383,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCALYEAR 2017,2017.0,14.0,March
6838,topic-id,1017,"Mr.President, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has reported that more than 65 million people have been forcibly displaced around the globe by the end of 2015. In the face of such staggering human suffering, we must not shutter our doors and abandon our foundational principle of religious freedom. Yet that is exactly what our new President would have us do with the Executive order he signed 2 weeks ago. This is not something I support, and for good reasons.  Our freedom of religion was enshrined in the Constitution 225 years ago. Since forging this promise, we have been a confident Nation welcoming those of all faiths. The Executive order issued by the new Republican President threatens these founding ideals and the very freedoms we enjoy as It singles out Muslim refugees and those fleeing violence in Syria, and it suspends the refugee program as a whole. This is not the America I know. It is contrary to our values and contrary to the example America needs to set for the world.  The ongoing conflict in Syria makes clear the enormity of the humanitarian crisis we face. The terror inflicted by both Bashar Al-Assad's regime and ISIS has forced more than half of Syria's 23 million people from their homes and claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians. Currently, there are more than 4.8 million registered[[Page S872]]Syrian refugees, the overwhelming majority of whom are women and children. Communities across the country, including some in Vermont, started the process to welcome these refugees who have undergone years of security screenings and vetting. Rutland, VT, is prepared to welcome 100 refugees, but to date only two families have arrived. One of these families shared that their own children ``were exposed to a lot of terror, and the sound of bombs and the sound of bullets and gunshots all day long.'' This is no way to live. That is why I strongly agree with Rutland's mayor Christopher Louras, who said accepting refugees ``is just the right thing to do from a compassionate, humanitarian perspective.'' We must do more.  There are other humanitarian crises impacting the world. Closer to home, ruthless armed gangs in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala continue to brutalize women and children with near impunity. We have a moral obligation to respond, and it is in our national interest to do that.  National security leaders agree that anti-Muslim rhetoric is not only contrary to our values, it also makes us less safe. FBI Director Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee in November 2015 that part of ISIL's narrative is to depict the United States as anti-The Defense Department has made a similar point. House Speaker Ryan has also denounced a ban on Muslims, noting that it is ``not conservatism'' to impose a religious test. A bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee agreed in December 2015 when it passed my amendment confirming that ``the United States must not bar individuals from entering into the United States based on their religion.''  The chaos and confusion caused by this Executive order at our airports in the United States as well as around the world highlights the recklessness of this administration's attempt to bar people based on their religion and national origin. The devastation this is causing to lawful immigrants and refugees fleeing violence is immeasurable. I fear for my constituents who are lawful permanent residents of the United States who also happen to be nationals of one of the seven targeted countries. Due to the widespread outrage expressed by thousands of concerned citizens and legal challenges across the country, the Trump administration has now clarified that the Executive order should not apply to legal permanent residents. But there continues to be an understandable fear that the Trump administration may again attempt to bar them from this country. Like them, I fear that the Trump administration may again seek to bar lawful immigrants from returning to their homes, work, and families in I also fear for the young Somali refugee in Vermont who has been patiently waiting for the completion of the resettlement process so that his pregnant wife and young son will be saved from the squalor of a refugee camp and reunited with him in And the man from Sudan who has been waiting for his two young sons to finally be granted their visas to join him and the rest of their family. And the husband whose Libyan wife was recently granted a visa and has been waiting for the International Organization for Migration to arrange her flight to the United I am concerned for these families and for so many others in Vermont and around the country.  Americans are bound together by our shared ideals. Among those ideals are tolerance and diversity. They unite us as a nation; they make us stronger. That is the message we should be embracing--one of inclusion, not one of exclusion and division. Federal District Court Judge Geoffrey Crawford perfectly encapsulated this sentiment at a naturalization ceremony for 31 new Americans in Rutland, VT, last week. The summary of his powerful remarks, which he directed particularly to our new Muslim citizens, was this: ``You are equal in the eyes of the law.'' This simple message is clear, and unequivocal: You are welcome, you are equal, you are protected.  That is why I am introducing a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that no one should be blocked from entering the United States because of their nationality, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender. Adoption of this resolution simply reaffirms the basic principle that this country does not have a litmus test. It will also show that the Senate will not allow fear to undermine the very principles and values that we cherish and that we have sworn to defend. The resolution is consistent with the strong bipartisan actions taken by the Senate less than 4 years ago when we passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation that included protections for refugees and asylum seekers. I urge Senators to come together once again in support of my resolution.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-06-pt2-PgS871.txt,1383,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCALYEAR 2017,2017.0,6.0,January

This resolution would wipe away health care from 30 million Americans and raise premiums for millions more.It would also create chaos through our community and our economy and our It would put the insurance companies back incharge.  It is not just the Affordable Care Act that is on the chopping block. Republicans also want to cut women's reproductivehealth care.

Women would be denied breast cancer screenings and preventive health care.Community clinics in rural and urban communities would be devastated.  We know that Planned Parenthood is one of the Nation's leading providers of high-quality, affordable health care for womenand their families. Denying access to healthcare providers such as Planned Parenthood will hurt women who need these servicesthe most: low-income women and women of color.

6740,topic-id,229,"Mr.Chairman, I just want to say to my colleague from Michigan: Hundreds of thousands of people are going to losetheir insurance under a plan that was agreed to by the Republican Governor, and I will send you the numbers in your district.  Mr.Chairman, the Republican effort to repeal the ACA, causing 30 million Americans to lose their health insurance, is builton a foundation of misrepresentations and falsehoods. Yesterday, the Speaker said the Affordable Care Act is collapsing. It isnot. Nationwide, enrollment is higher than it is has ever been, and the percentage of Americans without health insurance is atthe lowest level on record.  What is collapsing is the time for Republicans to move beyond their rhetoric and come up with a plan. They say they willproduce a comprehensive replacement, but they have been saying that for 7 years.  Mr.Neal is here. Seven years, Mr.Neal, we have been hearing that.  Those files on the Republican desk--I wish you would raise them again--aren't a plan. They are a ploy.  Republicans say repealing the Affordable Care Act will help people, and there is at least a sliver of truth to that claim.The GOP repeal bill will help millionaires, providing them an average tax cut of over $50,000 a year. At the same time, it willactually raise taxes on millions of moderate and middle-income families who will lose tax credits for purchasing healthinsurance.

So we are here again.  This is a promise that was made since 1946. These are men who have worked hard. They paid through the hard work they have accomplished through their own sweat, and we are trying to make sure they have their permanent fix to their health care and to their pensions. This is something that has a pay-for. It is back up again. It should have been done last year. We had an extension at the end until April is going to come and go again, and then we are going to start playing politics with this.

SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Helping Ensure Long-Term      Protection for Coal Miners Health Care Act of 2017'' or the      ``HELP for Coal Miners Health Care Act of 2017''.     2.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Over the 8 years preceding the date of the introduction      of this Act, the coal industry and the communities supported      by that industry have struggled, in large part due to      overregulation.       (2) Excessive regulation has, in large part, made coal more      expensive to mine and use and has put it at an unfair      disadvantage in the marketplace.       (3) Because of these struggles--       (A) the coal mining industry has lost over 30,000 jobs      since President Obama's inauguration;       (B) over 600 coal mines have shuttered since President      Obama's inauguration;       (C) more than 25 coal mining companies have filed for      bankruptcy since President Obama's inauguration;       (D) Kentucky alone has lost over 10,000 coal mining jobs      since President Obama's inauguration; and       (E) the total number of operating coal mines has hit its      lowest point on record.       (4) Because of the health risks often associated with      mining, robust health benefits are vital to coal miner      retirees; however, coal company bankruptcies, job cuts, and      closures have exhausted the ability of many coal companies to      continue providing health benefits to retirees and their      dependents.       (5) Congress has stepped in twice before, in 1992 and in      2006, to assist retired miners and to secure their health      benefits. When thousands more were at risk of losing their      benefits at the end of 2016, Congress intervened again to      provide a 4-month extension in health benefits for orphaned      retired miners and their dependents.       (6) While this extension helped prevent the loss of health      benefits for thousands of miners, it did not provide a long-     term solution.[[Page S344]]       (7) It is necessary to provide a permanent extension of      health care benefits for the orphaned retirees who are at      risk of losing their retirement health benefits at the end of      April 2017.     3.

6660,topic-id,1512,"Thank you, Mr. I just want to follow up on the statements made by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr.Blumenthal, and the Senator from Hawaii, Mr.They have laid out in eye-watering detail the problems that the Republicans are creating by their attempt to repeal the Affordable Care What Senator Schatz and Senator Blumenthal did was just get to the heart of this matter.  What the United States did for 100 years was to not run a health care system but to run a sick care system--a system that spent 97 cents on what happens after people got sick and only 3 cents of every dollar on trying to prevent people from getting sick. For the first time in American history, that changed in the Affordable Care  What President Obama did, what America did was to create a Prevention and Public Health Fund, and that fund in the Affordable Care Act is spent on prevention programs. It is spent on looking at people who could get asthma, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, stroke, or die from too much smoking and just say for the first time, in a comprehensive way, that the United States was going to put programs in place that would prevent people from getting the diseases that every preceding generation of Americans have suffered from. That is what the prevention fund is all about. That is what the Republicans are going to repeal, take off the books--this fundamental change to the direction toward prevention, toward wellness that all Americans of all generations want to see remain on the books.  In Massachusetts, if you are in New Bedford or Fall River or if you are in Springfield, those programs target racial minorities, they target low-income families, they target seniors who would otherwise be vulnerable to diseases that these programs can help to prevent. That money is just going to be sliced out of the Federal budget. What will be the consequences? Well, quite clearly, it will cost America a lot more money.  For example, my father died from lung cancer, smoking two packs of Camels a day. How many other fathers, mothers, sisters, and brothers die from a totally preventable disease? Well, ladies and gentlemen, this prevention fund put into place the kind of funding on a consistent basis not just for antismoking programs but for all programs across the books.  I will give you a good example. Back in the 1930s, no women, for the most part, died from lung cancer in the United But in the 1950s and 1960s, the tobacco industry hired the smartest PR person in This campaign basically said: ``You've come a long way, baby.'' You have an equal right to get cancer, as your husband, boyfriend, father, or brother has, and 20 years later, unbelievably, women began to die in the United States from lung cancer at a rate that was higher than the number of women who were dying from breast cancer.  Now that is a public relations success of the first and highest magnitude. We didn't have prevention programs in place. We didn't have a warning system to say to women, to say to kids: This is dangerous to your health. What did we see? We saw just about every family in America with somebody who died from lung cancer--pretty much every family--and it was totally preventable.  Well, inside of the Affordable Care Act we have this huge, great, innovative breakthrough--a health and prevention program that could be used in every city, every town, and every State across the whole country, targeting the most vulnerable, the most likely to be targeted, the ones most likely to be engaging in dangerous behaviors that are otherwise preventable. We have cured most of the diseases that our grandparents died from. The diseases that people die from today are the diseases that they give to themselves. They are behavioral choices. They are environmental situations into which they are placed that then result in them, unfortunately, contracting the chronic diseases that wind up first harming them and ultimately killing them.  What is a good example? Well, a good example is opioids. Opioids are now a killer of a magnitude that is almost incomprehensible. In Massachusetts, 2,000 people died in 2016 from opioid overdoses. Now, we are only 2 percent of the population of the United States of If you multiply that by 50, it is 100,000 people dying from opioid overdoses if they die at the same rate as the people who are dying in Massachusetts--100,000 a year, two Vietnam wars of deaths every single year from opioid overdoses. If ever there was a preventable disease, if ever there was something that was completely and totally subject to having programs put in place that could help people avoid ever getting into that addiction situation--or, once they did, giving them the program money which they need--then opioid addiction is it.  Well, what the Republicans are doing here is just wiping it out. They are wiping out that prevention fund. Moreover, just for the sake of understanding how incredible everything they are considering is going to be in terms of prevention of opioid disease, Medicaid right now pays $1 out of every $5 for substance use disorder treatment in the United States of In other words, without these prevention funds, without Medicaid funding, the only choice for these families is either getting help or getting buried. That is the bottom line. What the Republicans are doing is just wiping out the help.  So the option is going to be not just 2,000 in Massachusetts multiplied by 50,000, 100,000 deaths a year, we are just going to see this number skyrocket because without public health, without prevention programs, this is an inexorability, it is an inevitability. This is the future. This is just a repetition of everything America did for the preceding 100 years before we put the Affordable Care Act on the books. It doesn't make any difference whether you come from Connecticut or Hawaii, from Virginia or Michigan, from Massachusetts or from any other State in the Union, there are no barriers to opioid overdose, tobacco deaths, obesity, all of these preventable diseases. It is all coming as a preview of coming attractions to families all across the country. Here it is. This is what the Republicans are promising you: your family, once again, exposed.  Listen to this number. When the Affordable Care Act gets repealed by the Republicans, if they are successful--listen to this number: 1.6 million people who right now are covered for substance use disorders will no longer have coverage. Let me say that again: 1.6 million people who have coverage for substance use disorders will no longer be covered. So we have the prevention fund over here, we have the insurance over here--both gone.  I say to my colleagues, these Republicans--it is almost unbelievable. If you kick them in the heart, you are going to break their toe. We are talking about the most vulnerable people in our country. We are looking at the children. We are looking at people who have substance abuse disorders. We are looking at people who otherwise would never have smoked a day in their life if prevention programs were in place. We are looking at people who would never have to suffer through a life of obesity because the programs were put in place.  What are they saying? They are saying we are going to substitute and create a new program. When? Maybe soon. Maybe just around the corner. Maybe next year. Maybe whenever we get to it. What do you say to those families? What do we say to them?  This isn't just health care; this is also hope. This is also hope for these families who have chronic diseases, these families who have diseases that were otherwise preventable.  What the Republicans are saying is, we are just going to pull a bait and switch on you. We are going to repeal right now and replace at some point of our choosing in the future, even though we have harbored an ancient animosity toward the creation of a national law in the first place, and the American people are supposed to gullibly accept that argument. Well, we know what they have always wanted to do: leave all of these health care programs, from Medicare to Medicaid, to Social Security, as death-soaked relics of the programs as they have been created by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, by Lyndon Johnson, by Bill Clinton, by Barack They have always harbored[[Page S163]]that animosity toward those programs. This is just the beginning of an assault upon generations of promises to American families who have been transformed by these programs.  Let us fight hard, I say to my colleagues, to make sure these prevention funds are not taken off the books. It is the transformative way of looking at health care which the Affordable Care Act introduced into our society. I thank my friend Senator Blumenthal for leading us on this charge and Senator  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

6849,topic-id,544,"Mr.Speaker, I want to start by saying this. I was prompted to say this by the remarks from my colleague from Florida just now.  I believe that there is absolutely nothing that is common sense about preventing those who defend America from having the opportunity to defend themselves. There is no common sense in that whatsoever.  I listened to your emotional remarks here, and I listened as you gave zero specifics on the mental illness that my colleague specifically talked about being worried about.  Specifically, what mental illnesses is it that had you concerned?  I would encourage you to have the courage to be specific and say exactly what it is that you mean so that there is no confusion.  Now, the true intent of my remarks today are to talk about my favorite part of going to the VA, and that is sitting next to my fellow veterans when I sit down at one of the clinics at my local VA hospital. Whether it is a marine from Iraq, whether it is a sailor from World War II, a soldier from Vietnam, an airman from Korea, whenever we sit down next to each other, there is a camaraderie that exists immediately.  One of the first things that is said is usually some sort of off-topic joke about the branch that the other person comes from. It is that camaraderie of shared service that unites us in a way that half a century of age can't divide. I can tell you, we have common experiences, and we have common healthcare challenges as well.  It is important for veterans to come together and for the VA to establish and maintain expertise in providing for our unique healthcare needs. Unfortunately, too many VA facilities have lost their hunger to provide care. They have lost the passion to meet the individual needs of veterans, and it has become way too much of a rarity that a veteran's needs are truly met when they enter the VA facility.  You cobble that together with enough bad experiences from underperforming employees, and it forces veterans to ask: Where else can I go for my care?  That is why I am excited to see the House bring forward two bills this week that get at the crux of the matter: authority to hire the best employees and the ability to remove underperforming employees.  Today we will debate the VA Accountability First We will provide the VA Secretary the flexibility to either remove, demote, or suspend an employee for misconduct. It can be very little that is more important to go on at the  Tomorrow we will debate H.1367 that will bolster the Secretary's situational awareness to recruit and retain the very best employees.  You know, when a veteran like myself or my peers goes to the VA, we are not given a choice in our provider. We go there, and they look at a person like me and they say: Your last name is We are going to assign you to Alpha clinic. This is your provider, and there is no choice.  The veterans deserve nothing less than the kind of care and accountability that these bills endeavor to provide.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

6861,topic-id,259,"Mr.Speaker, I take issue with a term that was thrown around far too loosely twice in just the last couple of minutes by my colleagues from the other side of the aisle here where each of them used the term ``crazy.'' They used the term ``crazy'' twice. I take serious issue with that.  This is the reality: our servicemembers that endeavor onto the battlefield, they face snipers that are targeting them. They face mortars being dropped on their head. They face improvised explosive devices like the ones that took my legs and so many of my friends. There are aviators that fly beyond the lines of our enemy. They face the threat of being shot down or captured. There are marines, there are sailors. And all of us--you know, the reality is we do come home with demons that are associated with a life that is surrounded by death. That is certainly the truth.  But to say for one moment that that is something that allows the term ``crazy'' to be layered upon any one of these heroes that goes out there and serves in defense of this country, that goes out there and has the willingness to have their uniform stained with the blood of their friends, I find that to be a disgusting use of that word.

One hundred years ago, Jeannette Rankin was sworn in as a Member of the United States House of She was the first woman elected to Congress, and was elected before passage of the 19th amendment which granted women the right to vote.  Jeannette Rankin was a trailblazer her entire life. In 1902, she graduated from the University of Montana with a degree in biology. Afterward, she became active in the women's suffrage movement, moving to New York City and assisting in the founding of the New York Women's Suffrage Party and working for the National American Woman Suffrage  Rankin would eventually return to her home State of Montana, and was elected to office in the congressional election of 1916. Upon winning, she declared: ``I may be the first woman Member of Congress, but I won't be the last.''  I am happy to say that she was right.  In recognition of Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin's many accomplishments, and in celebration of the centennial anniversary of her service in Congress, Secretary Zinke and I introduced the 100 Years of Women in Congress  Because Jeannette Rankin was a woman of science more than 100 years before our current push to have more women enter STEM fields, we felt it appropriate to rename the Department of Agriculture's Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program after her.  This program currently supports collaborative research projects at institutions of higher education, and seeks to increase the participation of women and minorities from rural areas in STEM fields. It will continue to do so in the future, but now it will also recognize the many contributions Jeannette Rankin made to American life.

6619,topic-id,9337,"Mr.President, I rise to address the nomination of Neil I will start by noting that just moments ago the majority leader was on the floor and did something that has never before been done in U.history; that is, on the first day--indeed, in the first hours of debate on a Supreme Court Justice on this floor, the majority leader filed a petition, called a cloture petition, to close debate. So here we are on the first day, just hours into the debate, and the majority leader has said: We do not want to hear any more about this topic. We are going to shut down debate.  The rules provide some protection for this, and that is that it cannot be voted on until So there is time between now and Thursday for us to air our views. Historically, often debates went on for a substantial amount of time--a week, some for many weeks--with no cloture petition being filed, with no closing of the debate. Certainly, never before has the majority leader shut down debate, filed that petition on day one in his trying to ram this nomination through.  This is just a continuation of firsts--first events that do absolutely no credit to this institution, no credit to the Supreme Court, no credit to our In fact, they pose a substantial danger.  It was February 13, a little over a year ago, that Supreme Court Justice Scalia died. Almost immediately, the majority leader indicated that when the nomination came down from President Obama, this Chamber would not exercise its responsibility of advice and consent under the Constitution in that it would not provide an opportunity for Merrick Garland to be able to appear before a committee and answer the questions of the committee members, the questions of Republicans and the questions of Democrats, so that they could assess whether that individual was appropriate to serve in a Supreme Court seat.  The majority leader made it clear that there would be no committee hearing and no committee vote and no opportunity to come here directly to the floor, bypassing the committee. In other words, he closed off every opportunity for the President's nominee to be considered. This is the first time--this is the only time that has happened in our Nation's history when there was a vacancy in an election year.  What is the essence of this extraordinary and unusual action when this Chamber fails to exercise its advice and consent responsibility under the Constitution? Were we at a time of war, like the Civil War, in which the Capitol at times was under assault? Were we at a moment in which the building was aflame and we had to flee or there was some other significant threat to the functioning of this body? Was there some extraordinary set of circumstances--perhaps a massive storm headed for the Nation's Capital--that led the Senate for the first time in U.history to say that it could not take the time to exercise its constitutional advice and consent responsibility? There was no storm. There was no fire. There was no threat. There was no earthquake. There was nothing that would have prevented this Chamber from doing its responsibility.  The President has a responsibility under the Constitution when there is an open seat, and that is to nominate. He proceeded to consult with Members on both sides of the aisle, and he nominated an individual, Merrick Garland, who had an extraordinary reputation and who essentially was considered to come straight down the Main Street of judicial thought, with opinions that were neither labeled ``progressive'' nor ``conservative.'' They were straight down the middle.  The President made that nomination on March 16, which was a month and 3 days after the seat became vacant, but that was the last action to occur, the last action this Chamber took. A few individuals did courtesy interviews, knowing that it would lead to no committee hearing and no committee vote because the majority team in this Chamber decided to steal a Supreme Court seat. Again, such a theft never, ever has happened in the history of our  There have been a substantial number of seats that have come open during an election year--16. There have been a substantial number of individuals who were confirmed to those 16[[Page S2223]]seats, and there were individuals who were turned down by this Yet, in all of the 15 cases that preceded the death of Justice Scalia, the Senate acted. The Senate exercised its responsibility.  But this time was different. This time, the majority said: We intend to pack the Court of the United States of America--not by adding seats to it; that would not work under a Democratic President who could then nominate more individuals--to pack the Court by taking a seat, failing to exercise the responsibility that each of us has under our oath of office of advice and consent, and send it in a time capsule into the next administration, hoping that time capsule would be opened by a conservative President who would nominate someone who was very conservative, indeed, to create a 5-to-4 bias. What was that bias the majority was looking for? It was not a bias toward ``we the people''; it was a bias toward the powerful and the privileged.  If you take a look at our Constitution, that initial opening of our Constitution, it does not say ``we the privileged'' and ``we the powerful.'' It lays out a vision of a form of government with checks and balances to be designed to function of, by, and for the people. The majority was afraid that Merrick Garland would be just that kind of judge, one who would call the balls and strikes under the Constitution in support of the constitutional vision of ``we the people.'' They did not want a judge who would call the balls and strikes under our Constitution; they wanted someone who would find a way to twist a case in favor of the privileged and the powerful.  Tonight, I will lay out a lot of how they knew that was important both from the perspective of the decisions of the 5-to-4 Court that preceded the death of Justice Scalia and also Merrick Garland's writings and decisions, who found every opportunity to take a case and find some word, find some phrase, find some idea--``to operate is not to operate,'' ``to drive is not to drive,'' which is just language from one case--in order to find some way to find in favor of the powerful over the people. Merrick Garland's nomination lasted 293 days. That is the longest time in Supreme Court history.  Now I am going to turn and go through the election-year vacancies because I do not want folks to take my word for the case that the Senate has always done its job. For more than 200 years, it has done its job--until now. Let's take a look at those vacancies.  There were a couple of cases--three cases in which there was an election-year nominee and the vacancy occurred after the general election. This happened when President Adams was in office, when President Grant was in office, and when President Hayes was in office. So there was very little time left in the Presidents' terms. In a number of these cases--all three--the President did not change office until March of the following year, but the Senate did not even need those extra 2 months that it had before we amended the  President Adams nominated John He nominated him 3 days after the vacancy occurred in the year 1800, and the Senate confirmed the nominee. Here is an interesting twist: The nominee then declined the position. You do not see that very often in the history of the Supreme  Then you go to 1872 when President Grant was He had a vacancy occur on November 28, which was just a month before the end of the year and a few months before the Presidency would turn over. It was following the election. He nominated Ward The Senate acted in a little more than a week, and they confirmed him. They vetted him. They exercised their advice and consent responsibility, and they said: Yes, this individual is appropriate to serve on the  Then there was President A vacancy occurred in December 1880, and he nominated William Here we have a nominee being put forward very shortly afterwards and confirmed.  Those were the first three. That is the set of cases in which the vacancies occurred after the November elections in election years.  Let's look at the next set of vacancies. In these cases, the vacancy occurred before the elections, but the nominees were not nominated by the Presidents until after the elections. So, again, the Senate had a relatively short period of time in which to act.  We have the August 25 vacancy of 1828 with President He nominated quite a few months later--almost 4 months later--John In this case, the Senate acted, but they acted to table the nomination, so he was turned down.  Then we have President Buchanan in 1861, who nominated Jeremiah This is a little strange to us because we think of the Presidency as changing in January, but the Presidency did not change until The nomination occurred in February, and the motion to proceed was rejected by the entire body. So that nominee was rejected.  Then we turn to President The vacancy occurred in the month preceding the election. President Lincoln nominated Salmon Chase just after the election, and the Senate said: There is plenty of time. We will review that. And he was confirmed.  Then we can turn to Once again, the vacancy occurred in the month before the election, just 3 weeks before the election. Eisenhower didn't put a nomination to the Senate until January, but the Senate said: We have a responsibility of advice and consent. We will review it, we will vet the nominee, and we will vote. And they voted to confirm.  That is the second set of nominations. Those are 7 of the 16 nominations, so there are still 9 to go. Let's take a look at those.  In this case, the Senate had more time to act. The vacancy occurred before the general election. The nomination occurred before the general election.  Before I go through them, let me just note that of these nine, the Senate acted to confirm in 1804, to table in 1844, to table in 1852, to confirm in 1888, to confirm in 1892, to confirm in 1916, to confirm again 6 months later--still before the election; two in the same year--and then finally, in 1932, the Senate confirmed a nomination made in On February 15, the Senate acted.  Of these nine individuals, we have six who were confirmed and two were tabled. But I have left one out. There is one more nomination that occurred in an election year--just one more--and that happened last year. President Obama--we go back to Antonin Scalia dying on February 13 and Merrick Garland being nominated on March 16. So of those 16 we have looked at, the previous 15, the Senate acted each and every time because they had taken an oath of office to uphold the Constitution that has a requirement that the Senate participate in advice and consent. But this time, no action. No action. No committee hearing, not a set of committee hearings, not even one. No vote in committee. No effort or acceptance of moving the nomination to the committee of the whole, which would be here on the Senate floor. For the first time in U.history, the Senate stole a seat from one President in order to pack the  I have to tell my colleagues that it isn't just a clever new tactic. It isn't just an excessive exercise of partisanship. This is a crime against our Constitution and the responsibilities of this body. This effort to pack the Court is a major assault on the integrity of the  For every 5-to-4 decision that we see in the future, everybody is going to look and say: Five-four. How would that be different? And it will always be different if the stolen seat and the judge who fills it is on the right side because that side would otherwise have lost. The tie goes to the lower court's decision.  So what this does is not only change the trajectory of our Constitution from one where it is designed for ``we the people'' to a different vision of government by and for the people--it doesn't just change that trajectory, but it draws into question everything the Court does in the future.  Wouldn't it have been incredible if President Trump's nominee--knowing the constitutional responsibility for the Senate to act, knowing that the Senate seat had been stolen from a previous President, knowing that it would bias all the outcomes of the Court in the future--had stood up and said ``I will not participate in this crime against the Constitution'' and declined the nomination? Wouldn't that have been an act of integrity? Well, we[[Page S2224]]didn't get that act of integrity from President Trump's nominee, so here we are today, on the first day of the Senate deliberation on this nominee, and just moments ago was the first time in U.history that the majority has exercised a petition to close debate on the first day of a Senate debate on a Supreme Court Why is the majority in such a rush? Why is the Senate majority determined to push this through so quickly, in contravention of the tradition of due deliberation on this floor?  I know that if the circumstances were reversed and the Democrats had participated in stealing a seat from a Republican President, my colleagues would be screaming on this floor, and they would be fully justified. I am proud that my colleagues on this side of the aisle have never participated in such an assault on our Constitution or a failure to exercise our responsibilities under our oath of office or a theft of a Supreme Court seat or an effort to pack the Court, but if we had, my colleagues across the aisle would absolutely be standing and saying what I am saying tonight--that this is wrong, this is destructive, this is damaging, and we should stop and rethink this.  There is really only one nominee who would be a legitimate nominee for President Trump to make--only one way to heal this massive wound, this massive tear and rip in the heart of our Constitution, this massive failure of this Senate body to do its job. There is only one way to heal that, and that is for President Trump to nominate Merrick Garland and for him to get that committee hearing, for him to get that committee vote, for him to get that deliberation here on the floor. Maybe he would be approved and maybe he wouldn't, because that is what we see every time the Senate has acted. It has not always been to confirm a nominee, but it has acted and deliberated and voted and decided, as the Constitution calls upon it to do. That would be a healing of the wound. It would be a healing of the wound if the Senators were to vote the same way they would have voted last year had there been a completely legitimate, ordinary consideration. Then we could go forward without this damage.  So I call upon my colleagues, who I know have--each and every one of them--considered that it is their responsibility to build up and strengthen our institutions of government, not to tear them down. Therefore, I call upon them to reverse this deed before the dark act is completed of stealing a seat and packing the  I wish to turn to consider another piece of this puzzle. If the seat had not been stolen and we were simply considering President Trump's nominee under ordinary circumstances, what would we find? We would find a far-rightwing judge completely outside of the mainstream.  Why is it that throughout its history, this body has honored the rule of having a supermajority needed to close debate on a Supreme Court Justice? It has been to send a message to the President that you must nominate someone who is in the judicial mainstream, not way out in one direction or another, with bizarre findings that would undermine the integrity of the Court, not a pattern of attempting to twist the law so that we the people lose and we the powerful win time after time after time--no, someone in the middle of the judicial mainstream.  Well, that is certainly where Merrick Garland was, but that is not where Neil Gorsuch is. He is a lifelong conservative activist, rewriting the law to make it something that was never intended to be. A Washington Post analysis of his decisions that have been considered by the Supreme Court found that he would be, by far, the most conservative member of the Court--not where Scalia was, not where Justice Thomas is, not where Justice Alito is; he would be the most conservative member of the Court, to the right of Justices Alito, Thomas, and  Quote:       The magnitude of the gap between Gorsuch and Thomas is      roughly the same as the gap between Justice Sotomayor and      Justice In fact, our results suggest that Gorsuch      and Scalia would be as far apart as Justice Breyer and      Justice  That is the Washington It is a pretty big gap, way to the right.  Let's take a look at some of the cases that lead to this conclusion. There is a case known simply as the frozen trucker case. Alphonse Maddin, the trucker, was fired for refusing to freeze to death. After waiting more than 3 hours with a disabled trailer on the side of the road, he unhooked the trailer and he started up the cab and he went to get warm before he could return to meet the repairman for the truck. Now, why couldn't he just carry the trailer with him? The brakes were frozen. Why was he himself freezing? Because the heater on the truck was broken. He fell asleep for some hours, woke up, and his body was numb. He became concerned about his life, so he unhooked the trailer, went to get warm, and came back to meet the repairman.  The Labor Department determined that under the Surface Transportation Assistance Act, he was wrongly fired because that act is designed to say that if you refuse to operate a truck in a fashion that is unsafe for you, the driver, or unsafe for others, you can't be fired for that. Safety comes first. The whole message of the act: Safety comes first. But in this case, Neil Gorsuch dissented. He wasn't writing the majority opinion. He went out of his way to write the minority opinion.  The Tenth Circuit upheld the fact that he was correctly operating the truck, leaving the trailer behind. You could ask, Was he operating the full truck or part of the truck? The point is that the Tenth Circuit said yes; the firing was wrong. They upheld the Labor Department under the surface transportation act, and said: He did exactly what the act had intended. You have to restore his job. The Tenth Circuit said yes, absolutely. But Judge Gorsuch went out of his way to write a dissent, saying no. It is completely taking words out of context and twisting them. I encourage others to read it for themselves because it is truly a bizarre opinion, an effort to find a way--some way, some path--to find for the company instead of the trucker, who was protected by the laws written and passed in this Chamber and the House and signed by the That is how far out of common sense and theory of the law Neil Gorsuch is.  Let's turn to a case often referred to as the autism case, Thompson R2-J School District v. Luke This case says a great deal because in this case Judge Gorsuch tried to rewrite a law referred to as the IDEA law--Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--to effectively invalidate the law. The law written here was to ensure that individuals with disabilities were provided an education by the school district, not babysitting but an education. Neil Gorsuch rewrote that law to say that babysitting is  Despite years of special education in a public school, Luke wasn't showing any progress at home. His parents enrolled him in a private school that specializes in autistic children, where he made advances--because the school district was only babysitting him. They fought to get the school district to reimburse them. Gorsuch ruled in favor of the school district. The standard he put forward was the standard that babysitting is OK, even though the law was written to do the opposite.  This decision that Gorsuch wrote is so far out of the mainstream, it is so far out of common sense, it is so contrary to the law written here in this Chamber that the Supreme Court--yes, our Supreme Court, our eight-member Supreme Court--proceeded to say, 8 to 0: That is absurd and wrong, Neil And they reversed him.  When have we had a nominee reversed 8 to 0? When have we had cases like the frozen trucker case and the autistic child case, where he went to great lengths to find for the powerful over the individual?  We can turn to the Utah en banc request in a case called Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. ``En banc'' means that the entire bench hears a case. Neil Gorsuch was such an activist, so committed to undermining an organization--Planned Parenthood--that he took the extreme step of initiating, himself, an en banc review of a decision to block a Utah defunding effort. Governor Herbert of that State had used the cover of false and misleading videos to strip Utah's clinics of their funding. The Governor later made clear in testimony that he was in fact punishing Planned Parenthood for its constitutionally protected advocacy and services and that the organization had not done anything wrong.[[Page S2225]]  The Tenth Circuit granted a preliminary injunction against Utah for violating the organization's--Planned Parenthood's--constitutional rights. The Tenth Circuit decided this, but Neil Gorsuch--ever the activist judge, rewriting law to make it say the opposite of what was intended--sought to have a review by the entire bench. Let me explain, that is not normal. Other people may call for an en banc review because they don't like the outcome, but to have a participating judge on the Tenth Circuit initiate it is unusual. It is a message to the world: Everyone, pay attention to me. I am an activist, far-right judge, and if you like that--someone who is going to find for the powerful and the privileged over ordinary people--pay attention. That is who I am. It is kind of like trying out for a future Supreme Court opening.  Gorsuch's entire adult life has been a mission to revoke a lot of the norms we have come to embrace in our pursuit of the transitions in our society and in our government as we pursue that constitutional vision of equality under the law, protections to vulnerable populations, to workers and to kids and to women and to minorities. But Neil Gorsuch doesn't like that arc of seeking to provide the protections our constitutional vision laid out. As far back as college, he was an ideological warrior who championed a severely reactionary worldview.  In a conservative newspaper article, he characterized efforts to fight racism as ``more a demand for the overthrow of American society than a forum for the peaceable and rational discussion of these people and events.'' That is a very strange way to characterize efforts to fight racism. Racism, discrimination, is to slam the door of opportunity on American citizens because of their gender, because of their race, because of their ethnicity, because of their sexual identity--slam the door and disrupt that opportunity for each and every citizen to be treated equally under the law.  He also used the opportunity to advocate for social inequality, saying that ``men . . . of different abilities and talents to distinguish themselves as they wish, without devaluing their innate human worth as members of society,'' and arguing that a responsible system required a governing class of men of exceptional political ability to make the big decisions for society. Well, there is not much equality and opportunity in that statement.  As a judge, in case after case, he finds expansive rights for corporations at the expense of their employees, consumers, and the public interest. We have talked about the frozen trucker case and the autistic child case. There is also the electrocuted mine construction worker case. A worker started at a project a week after it begun and wasn't trained on how this should be done. It was a training that was really required because of the highly dangerous circumstances. When you are operating equipment near power lines, that is just a setting that everyone in the construction industry knows is extraordinarily dangerous. If you connect that equipment to the power line, perhaps somebody has their hand on the side of the equipment, and the next thing you know, they are electrocuted. The worker mistakenly brought a piece of equipment too close to that overhead power line, and it was the worker himself who was electrocuted and killed. The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission fined the employer for not properly training the worker under these dangerous circumstances. The Tenth Circuit took a look at it and said: Yes, the company failed to do the proper training, and the result was that someone lost their life. But Judge Gorsuch dissented. He said that there was no evidence the company had been negligent. Really? Failure to train in a highly dangerous situation that results in loss of life--there is no problem there. Why should we require companies to train people in dangerous circumstances? Again, there was a complete lack of common sense, a determination to overturn what a review board had found, what the circuit court had found.  We can turn to the Hobby Lobby case. In this case, Neil Gorsuch found that closely held, for-profit corporations have the right to choose the contraception coverage, or lack thereof, for their employees if doing so conflicted with the corporation's religious beliefs. Now, we didn't actually have corporations--in the sense that we have them now--when our Nation was founded. There were some charters, but not the modern corporation in the sense that we have. Yet Neil Gorsuch said: We will just give this corporation personhood, and we will let the corporation exercise religious beliefs that overrule the religious beliefs of the individuals. But it was the individuals the Constitution was written to defend. It was the individuals' religious beliefs the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were laid out to protect--not a corporation. But in a never-ending quest to find for the corporation, to find for the powerful, to find for the privileged, Neil Gorsuch twisted the law, found that path, and laid it out.  In writing a brief as a lawyer in 2005, Neil Gorsuch urged the court to ignore the statutory and legislative history of the Securities Exchange Act, advocating that the court limit the ability of those defrauded by corporations to band together to seek redress. This really goes to the difference between ``we the people'' and ``we the powerful.''  We have a nominee before us right now who doesn't like the idea of individuals being able to operate with a class action suit against the predatory actions of a powerful corporation. In an article about the case, he launched into an attack on the lawyers for providing the ability for individuals to challenge the very powerful corporation, and he said these are frivolous claims--frivolous claims--that take an enormous toll on the economy. They put a burden on every public corporation in I will quote: ``frivolous claims that impose an enormous toll on the economy, affecting virtually every public corporation in America at one time or another and costing business billions of dollars in settlements every year.'' He didn't like this burden on corporations to respond when they were challenged for predatory practices.  Often, the transactions between a company and an individual are quite small. Maybe they involve a monthly fee to access telecommunications services. Maybe they involve a purchase of a single consumer item that costs $50. But the corporation misrepresented what that item was or didn't disclose that it had dangerous paint on it or some other feature. The only way that ordinary people, ``we the people,'' can challenge the predatory practice of a powerful corporation is to put their cases together in a class action suit so that everybody--the thousands of people who bought that $50 item--can say: You are doing something wrong. You are selling something dangerous and not telling us. You are selling something our children will choke on and not telling us. You are defrauding us in any of a whole series of possibilities. Perhaps it is in stock cases or other financial transactions. Perhaps it is the way mortgages are constructed. But the individual couldn't possibly take on the powerful companies' roomful of top-notch lawyers to reclaim that $50 or that small modest sum, so a class action is the tool through which the people, ``we the people,'' proceed to take on the powerful, and Neil Gorsuch doesn't like that.  He doesn't like workers having the chance to confront corporations on the issues of sexual harassment.  In Pinkerton v. Colorado Department of Transportation, Judge Gorsuch joined an opinion discounting Pinkerton's evidence of discrimination and concluding that Pinkerton's performance--not discrimination--resulted in her termination. Judge Gorsuch dissented from an opinion--by its very nature saying dissent--where the majority found a different path, holding that Pinkerton provided ample evidence that she was regularly outperforming her male colleagues yet was treated less favorably than them. The list goes on and on--removing Federal Government protections in a variety of cases.  But there is a third big problem with the fact that we are here tonight considering this nomination. The first big problem was that the seat was stolen by the Republican majority. That is the first time a theft like that has happened in the history of our Nation in an effort to pack the That is a big deal. The second is that Trump nominated somebody completely outside the judicial mainstream. The third is something that should give every American pause, and that is that at this very moment, investigations are taking place into the conversations, into the meetings between the Trump campaign and the  Now, we know it is very public that the Russians conspired to affect the outcome of our Presidential election. We know the tactics they used. They wrote false news stories. They proceeded to have a building with hundreds--I am told a thousand people in a[[Page S2226]]building--doing social media commentating to try to have people in America see those comments and go: Oh, my goodness, isn't that Democratic nominee terrible? Look at what happened. It was an effort to give, in other words, some sort of validation to the false news stories that they were creating and to spread those false news stories via social media.  We know that Russia used a series of bots--basically, computers--around the world designed to reply automatically on social media and Facebook and to do so in order to make it look like there were more than a thousand--millions of people out there--commenting on how terrible the Democratic nominee was.  So they amplified this message with the goal of causing the algorithms used by companies like Facebook--affecting those algorithms so Facebook would start streaming the false news on their Facebook site. You see that and go: Oh, my goodness, it must be true; it is on That was the core strategy the Russians used.  I am not sharing with you anything that is classified. I am also on the Intelligence All of this is in the public realm, the FBI is investigating not whether all that took place--they continue to look to see what else there is and the details of that--but whether there was coordination or collusion with the Trump campaign in how they did this.  Let's be clear. The investigation is not concluded. We don't know the answer. We don't know if the Trump campaign coordinated with the But let's also be clear about this: Anyone on that campaign who collaborated with the Russians to affect the outcome of the U.elections has committed a treasonous act.  So we have this cloud of this investigation over us right now. We find out in a few weeks if there were treasonous acts that completely delegitimize the election that put Donald Trump in the Oval Will we find that? We don't know. We don't know the answer to that.  What we do know is that we have a risk of being in a situation where a swing vote on the Supreme Court is coming from a team that is being investigated. Let's get to the bottom of that and, therefore, know whether there is an issue of illegitimacy before we complete this conversation about filling this Supreme Court seat.  There is an enormous amount of evidence that the Trump campaign was familiar with the efforts of a foreign power to alter the outcome of the election. The names have come up with the press. Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, and other figures in the Trump orbit are under scrutiny for that--several of them. The communications have been articulated where and how, and that cloud is very real.  We had the unusual event a week ago Monday in which the Director of the FBI came here to Capitol Hill to talk to the House and to say that it is not normal to confirm that our investigations are under way but that he thought, under this circumstance, it was appropriate that he do so.  So those are the three big issues that we are facing. It is why every Senator who values this institution, each Senator who has pondered their responsibility under advice and consent and the theft of the Supreme Court seat last year recognizes that the administration is under a big cloud and that cloud has not been resolved in terms of the legitimacy of the election or whether there was collusion with a foreign power.  I said that if there was collusion, it was a traitorous act. Here is why. Attacking the integrity of our elections, as Russia did, is an act of war on the United States of It is attacking the fundamental institutions of our democracy, of our democratic We must never let this happen again. We must work with other democratic republics to make sure that Russia isn't able to do it in other countries, which we know they are attempting to do in other elections. But we should absolutely get to the bottom of it before this Chamber takes a vote on whether to close this debate or before it takes a vote on whether to confirm the  So that is the very broad presentation of the three big reasons we should pull the plug on this nomination or at least put it in deep freeze until such a time as the Russia investigation is completed. And we have already considered Merrick That is what we should do.  I am going to spend considerable time going into more detail about these three issues because in my time in the Senate, there has not been an issue that has had such grave consequences for the integrity of our Nation, the integrity of our Senate, the integrity of the Supreme Court, and, quite frankly, the integrity of the Presidency, as well. It affects all three branches because this crime of stealing a seat couldn't be completed without the direct involvement of the executive branch's nominating Neil So I will go back over each of these in much greater detail.  I was pondering why I feel so strongly about this--apart from the reasons I have already laid out--and it is that for generations to come, this Chamber will be compromised. For generations to come, the Supreme Court will be compromised. If we act together, if we hit the pause button, perhaps we can prevent that.  So I feel more compelled to be here, to raise my voice, and to call for those who care about our Nation to stop the insanity of this judicial nomination discussion here on the floor of the That is why I am going to go on for some time exploring this.  I think back to when I came here in 2009. When I came to the Senate, my memories were of the Senate from the 1970's and 1980's, which now makes me really an old guy. I was able to come here as a 19-year-old, as an intern for Senator At that point in time, there wasn't a camera on the floor of the Senate and there wasn't email, and it wasn't easy to get a document across Capitol Hill in a short time. Interns were put to work running paperwork around the But I will tell you that the institution was in a very different place.  So I came here. I was the third of three interns to arrive that summer of 1976, our bicentennial summer. The most recent intern is put to work opening the mail each morning.  So I came in early. We had about 100 letters in envelopes. You would run them through a machine that sliced the envelopes opened. You would stack up all the letters, start going through them, and say: This one is on this topic, and this goes to this legislative correspondent. This one is on this topic, and it goes to that legislative correspondent. I think there were three or four in the office of Senator You would go through those 100 letters and put them on the desk of the legislative correspondent.  Those correspondents had the newly developed electronic memory typewriters. They had written paragraphs to respond to different topics, and they would mark on the letter the different paragraphs that should go here. This is the introductory paragraph we will use. We need to address this issue in this letter and use paragraph 56 from the memory bank, and we use number 84 to address another issue.  Then, those letters, all marked up, would go to the typing team that would run those memory typewriters, and get responses out before the day was over. I saw a lot of it that summer. It was possible to actually get mail to come directly in because we didn't worry about white powder being inside the envelopes.  Now if you write an actual physical letter to a Senator in this Chamber, it goes through a warehouse. It goes through a warehouse where they have to examine it and check it for poisons before it can be delivered to Capitol It will take weeks. People knowing this often choose to write by email. So a lot of the mail--most of the mail--comes in electronically.  But that summer, one of the legislative assistants was leaving for an extended period for a vacation in South He was looking to have someone take over the Tax Reform Act of 1976. I was asked to take over working on that act. So what that involved was that you would look at all the mail that came in on that tax topic. You would research those issues and you would draft responses. Those draft responses would go up and be approved or modified by the legislative director and by the Then you would make sure those got into the database and people got their questions answered.  I learned a lot about taxes that summer of 1976. I must say, when I was[[Page S2227]]first asked to work on taxes, I was kind of disappointed because I thought: Well, it will be really interesting to work on education; it will be really interesting to work on healthcare; it will be really interesting to work on the environment; it will be really interesting to work on jobs policy. Taxes? Not so interesting.  So the next few days, as I threw myself into responding, drafting responses to these issues being raised in letters, I was transformed in my opinion about working on tax issues because the taxes affect everything in our body of law. Taxes have environmental consequences, or they may be an environmental incentive, such as the provisions we have in the Tax Code to encourage people to insulate their homes or to drive a non-fossil-fuel burning car. They affect health, such as the provisions we have in the Tax Code that proceed to say that if your employer provides health insurance, it is not considered taxable income. It affects job incentives. It affects everything.  There were farmers writing in about tax issues that were being raised. There were teachers writing in. The teachers were concerned that there was a home office deduction that was on the chopping block. What this means is if you used a bedroom in your home or a study in your home as your office to work as an elementary teacher or a high school teacher, you could deduct the cost or the value of that portion of your house as a work expense.  Well, often, when there is an opportunity like that, some people expand the definition of the office to a point in which it is ridiculous, and there were some individuals who were saying: Well, now my entire home is my office. I will deduct the entire cost of my home, which was never the intention.  But teachers were concerned that, in the course of correcting that, that they might lose the deduction that was a legitimate work expense. There are dozens and dozens of these things. So the bill happened to come up on the floor of the Senate, in this Chamber right here. Because I was working that bill, I was assigned to come over and follow the debate. I was up in the seats up above. We considered amendment after amendment after amendment. Now, there was no negotiation between the two sides over what amendment would come up next.  Once one amendment was finished, there would be a group of Senators trying to get the attention of the Presiding Whoever got that attention first, whoever was fastest or loudest and was called on, their amendment was next. They presented it, and the staff hovered around following it and tried to get a copy of it and tried to analyze it. Then we would run down when the vote was called and meet our respective Senators coming out of those elevators that are just through those doors right there--those beautiful double doors of the  I would stand there, and out would come Senator Church, and out would come Senator Goldwater, and out would come Senator Humphrey, and out would come Senator Kennedy and Senator Inouye, and then my Senator could come out. I would say: OK, here is the story. Here is the amendment. Here is what it does. Here is what people have said about it. He would come in here and vote.  That was a very lucky set of circumstances that I had, but it allowed me to sit up in the Chamber and watch this You did not have a cloture petition on anything--a cloture petition meaning a petition to close debate. Now, there was mutual respect. There was a determination of this body to give people a chance to say what they wanted to say, but very rarely did people go on at length, and more rare than that would be a case where a petition was filed to shut down debate.  You know, the principle, the idea that originated with our original Senate, was that there is time for everyone to make their views known to each other so we can benefit from their insights, so that we can benefit from their life experience, and then we can make the decision. So it was a mutual courtesy among Senators at the very start of our democratic I saw that courtesy here on the floor as an intern 41 years ago.  What a difference it is today, where today, for the first time in U.history, the majority filed a petition to shut down debate on the first day of a debate over a U.Supreme Court seat, under circumstances that are more complex and more disturbing than virtually any circumstances we have seen in more than 200 years over the nomination of a Supreme Court justice.  It is the first time in U.history that a nominee in an election year was not accorded any consideration, the first time a seat was stolen, perhaps the first time that a cloud hung over a nominating President--President Trump and his team--because of the way the campaign was conducted and the possible collaboration with Certainly, it one of the first times.  Since the analysts have found that the views of Neil Gorsuch are to the extraordinary far right, that too adds a certain change from the tradition of the supermajority of the President nominating from the judicial mainstream.  So we have these complex sets of circumstances that should be thoroughly vetted. This should be a situation where no Member of this Chamber would even think about filing a petition to close debate and would not even consider the possibility of trying to cut off debate.  Debate has gone on for Supreme Court folks for weeks and weeks and weeks without a petition being filed. Sometimes, that nominee was confirmed and sometimes the nomination was withdrawn, and in the course of it, the American people learned a great deal, and they were riveted to that conversation.  But this time, the majority said that 200 years of history--that 200 years of developed comity here in the Senate Chamber, the traditions that were still here when I was an intern 4 decades ago--we are going to wipe that away. Well, that is a great concern. After I was here for a summer, I was very intrigued by the beauty of what we do on Capitol Hill, the profoundness of what we do on Capitol  We can make a policy that can destroy home ownership for literally millions of families, or we can make a policy that creates the opportunity of fair home ownership for millions of families. That is the power of the discussions that take place on this floor of the Senate, of this Chamber, and the Chamber on the other side of Capitol  So, during that summer, I was wrestling with a question, and that question was: My talents are in math and science. But is there a way to pursue a career dedicated to making the world a better place? Is there a way to actually pursue public policy as a career? I didn't know the answer to that question. I went back to college for 1 trimester out in  At the end of that trimester, President Carter was going to be inaugurated in January of 1977. I thought: You know, it will be very interesting to see what a new President does. Let's see what policies he puts forward, how he builds his Executive team, how he delivers his ideas to Capitol Hill, how he works with Capitol  So in January, I took a Greyhound bus across the I arrived here and proceeded to work on a variety of internships while also waiting tables and washing dishes. I worked as a hotel desk clerk up on 14th Street on Thomas I worked washing dishes and waiting tables for a Lums Restaurant, which is kind of a sit-down hamburger joint.  But it was all so I could be here and see the magic of public policy and the work done that could affect millions of lives here in this Chamber, the work done on the far side of Capitol Hill that would affect millions of families--to the better or to the worse. In the course of that year, I interned for a group called New It was an environmental nonprofit working on the Law of the  There was a question on the outside of our territorial boundaries: Will the nations cooperate so that we don't destroy the resources in the international space of the oceans? How far should our national space extend? How do we write those rules so that our Continental Shelf is clearly under our control? These are the sorts of questions considered. That treaty, the Law of the Sea Treaty, has never made it here to Capitol Every time there is a new Presidency coming in, someone says: Hey, remember that treaty[[Page S2228]]from four decades ago? It might really strengthen U.control of our offshore areas, and maybe we should bring it up for discussion. It still hasn't been discussed here.  But I also went door to door for a group called Virginia Consumer They were working to create attention to consumer protection issues in the State capitol in They would go door to door. They would have a team go door to door. You would proceed to explain the issue that you were working on--the bill you were working on, that the organization was working on--and ask ordinary citizens to sign a petition in support of that bill being considered at the State capitol.  You would ask: Would you like to support the work of this organization so we can keep doing it? If they made a donation, that helped strengthen the organization. This was the model that became the Public Interest Research Group model, or the PIRG model.  Specifically, the issue we were working on as we went door to door was to say: We can save consumers a huge amount of money if we can simply implement peak-load pricing.  Now, what is peak-load pricing? What it means is that you have a meter so that when there is a huge demand for electricity, it charges a higher price. By so doing, it alerts the consumer: Hey, don't use electricity now; use it at another time.  Now, why would that save consumers millions of dollars? Well, here is why. The electric power company wanted to build a nuclear powerplant to meet just the peak load. So they wanted to build a very, very expensive nuclear powerplant, which they would then charge all the utility customers for, and a lot of utilities--it is kind of written in the law--receive an automatic 8-percent return on whatever they invest. So there is an incentive for them to invest more. The more they invest, the bigger their revenue stream is. That revenue stream is paid for by the citizens who buy electricity.  So few could convince the utility, instead of building a nuclear powerplant, to put in meters that would tell people: Hey, don't use your dryer now because it is more expensive, and shift that peak load. Then everybody benefitted. You did not have to have the risk of a nuclear powerplant.  At that point we had a lot of concerns. We had had a lot of difficulties in some of our plants with near meltdowns. The idea that you could have a radioactive cloud or a China syndrome occur somewhere near a metropolitan area was a very scary thing. So you simultaneously greatly improved public safety while saving people a huge amount of money.  So that is what we were petitioning people for door to door. It was my first introduction to a legislative process that was happening outside the national legislative process. I must say, when you go to door to door, you have so many interesting experiences. You never know what is going to happen when you walk through that door and start to explain to people what you are fighting for and they start sharing their stories.  The president of the board of VEPCO, Virginia Electric Power Company--I went to his and his wife's house. I did not know it was their house at the time--a huge, huge house in suburban The wife greeted me. She talked with me about these issues. She said: You know, my husband is president of the board of VEPCO, but, as to the issues you are raising, I never hear them raising those issues, and these are good points you are making. So I want to buy the Virginia Consumer Congress newsletter. It was a $15 donation. That was the biggest donation at the door I ever had while I was working there. There were many, many other conversations.  But the reason I came back to be here for those first 9 months of the Carter administration was to continue to see: How does Capitol Hill work? How do nonprofit advocacy groups work? How does a new administration work? How does the Senate work? The Senate was so near and dear to my heart after the internship with Senator  In the course of that year, I came to believe that there was a path to work on public policy. Specifically, I decided to work on third-world economic development. Part of the reason that I choose that area was that, when I was in high school, I had a chance to be an AFS exchange student in Ghana, West There were only six exchange students sent to Africa outside of apartheid South  Of those six, five went to cities and one went to a modest town with a family of very modest means. I was the student who was sent to that very modest town to the family of modest means. The experience was such that I was surrounded by people barely able to afford to eat or sometimes not able to afford to eat.  My host family was middle class. My host father was a schoolteacher, and my host mother was also a schoolteacher. One was in a public school, and one was in a private school. Because of the connection to the public school, my host father, who, if I recall right, had a sixth grade or ninth grade education--that was enough to be a teacher because they didn't have enough people who were high school graduates or college graduates.  He was afforded a government-built house that had three concrete rooms and screens over the windows to keep out the mosquitoes. There was electricity in the house, an outlet. The family had one appliance, and that appliance was an iron to iron clothes. Every night, my host father would take the clothing that had been washed that day and he would iron the clothing. Nobody else could touch that iron because that was an incredibly valued appliance.  They had one other thing that was considered a real amazing thing for a family to have, and that was a bicycle. They had a bicycle. I wanted to borrow the bicycle to go outside this town and visit some very tiny villages. My host father was so afraid that I was going to break this bicycle, that I wasn't going to be careful, that I was going to go through potholes, that I was going to dent the rim, because it was such a valued commodity to the family.  I decided in college, after my time here in 1976 and 1977, that I would work on economic development overseas because I had seen the families who surrounded my host family often earning just a dollar a day and trying to feed a family of six or seven. The children couldn't go to school because they had to go down to the main street, running through town to try to sell things through the windows. The only way for the family to eat was for every child to be working.  (",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2222.txt,1900,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCALYEAR 2017,2017.0,4.0,March

6648,topic-id,1509,"Mr.President, we have a longstanding tradition in ourcountry of civilian control of government and civilian control of the military. This was first symbolized by George Washingtonthrough his act of resigning as Commander in Chief for all of the Continental Army on December 23, 1783. It is a tradition, or amoment in time, that is preserved on the walls of the Rotunda where a mural depicts Washington's noble and selfless act.  Ourearly days were full of the warnings of a standing Army and of ongoing military control at high levels, and those ideas camefrom Thomas Jefferson and from Alexander Hamilton and from Samuel When we came to the point in our history where werealized that a continuing military force was necessary, we preserved the importance of civilian control.  We did so for ahost of important reasons, which others have pointed out on this floor but I think are worth restating. It is important to havea Secretary of Defense who brings a broad world view that includes a civilian perspective to the position.  Second, it isimportant not to politicize our officer ranks and have them essentially competing to position themselves to hold this positionof Secretary of  Third, we do not want the services competing against each other in order to hold this position.This is why the Joint Chiefs of Staff position is rotated on a specific schedule. And if we have a Secretary of Defense comefrom one military service, then another branch of service is going to say: Next time it should be our turn. The Marine Corpstoday, the Air Force tomorrow, the Army after that, and then the That is not the position we want to end up in.  Wealso know that across the world, countries wrestle with preserving civilian control; that is, preserving democratic republics inthe face of the power of military machinery in their country, military organizations, and we see military coups and we seemassive military influence.  It has been the desire of our country to model a republic that isof the people, by the people, and for the people, not a nation that becomes controlled by a massive concentration of power inthe military. Now my colleagues--many of whom are very learned in the history of our country--have arisen to say that there is aset of special circumstances, a unique set of circumstances, that merit an exception, and they note that there was an exceptiononce before in our history. That exception was the appointment of George Marshall to become Secretary of Defense in the timefollowing[[Page S306]]World War But think about how many circumstances we face in the world that can be put forward to be anexceptional time. It was exceptional when terrorists used planes to attack the Twin Towers in New York City and our Pentagon,and had not one plane gone down, the additional target may have been the Capitol or the White That was an exceptionalmoment. It is an exceptional moment when we are fighting Al It is an exceptional moment when we are fighting It isan exceptional moment when Russia invades Ukraine and takes over There is an exceptional moment almost continuously inthe face of a complex and changing world.  So I stand on the side of maintaining the principle of civilian control. Each timewe violate this principle, it is easier next time to say: It has been done before. But the conversation will not be ``We did itonce half a century ago, and so we should do it again,'' it will be ``We did it twice, once quite recently when we weren'tfacing a world crisis. Nobody had invaded the United We had not just lost a couple hundred thousand folks fighting forour country in a world war.'' So the conversation will get easier and more fragile, and that is not the direction we should go.  It was Eisenhower who warned about the overreach of a military enterprise--the ``military industrial complex,'' as hereferred to it. But one piece of our structure of government that has held back is to maintain that principle of civiliancontrol. Can anyone in this room rise up and say that out of the thousands of experienced individuals who have both nationalsecurity experience and civilian experience, there isn't one who currently meets either the 10- or 7-year standard ofseparation? I am sure there are hundreds who could meet that standard.  So here we are. If we could send a message to thePresident-elect: We reject your effort to eviscerate civilian control. Send us someone who is qualified. And if we feel thatperson is so far out of the reach of reason--which is what I have been hearing from my colleagues in private conversation,terrified that this President-elect will nominate somebody who basically is unhinged, that we have to seize on this moment totake this individual because this body won't have the courage to turn down and reject an unhinged individual nominated by thisPresident-elect. That is a sad commentary on the leadership of this body. It is a sad commentary on what has become of the U.S.Senate that we wouldn't have the courage under our advice and consent power to turn down someone we saw as unfit. That is, infact, how we are charged under this Constitution, under the advice and consent clause. It was Hamilton who laid out that it isour responsibility to determine whether an individual is of fit character or unfit character, and we would retain that power forany nomination that, in the collective judgment of this body, did not meet that standard.  So let's sustain the principle ofcivilian control and reject this change.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  Mr.Mr.President, in response to the Senator from Oregon who asked if there werenot any people who were qualified to serve as Secretary of Defense, I am absolutely certain there are. Is there anyone asqualified as General Mattis? My answer to the Senator from Oregon is no. I have watched General Mattis for years. I have seenthe way that enlisted and officers react to his leadership. I have seen the scholarly approach he has taken to war and toconflict.  I hope the Senator from Oregon will have at some point a chance to get to know him, and he will then appreciatethe unique qualities of leadership that are much needed in these times where the outgoing President of the United States hasleft the world in a state of chaos because of an absolute failure of leadership, which is disgraceful. We now see an outgoingPresident of the United States who in 2009 inherited a world that was not being torn apart in the Middle The Chinese werenot acting assertively in the South China The Russians had not dismembered Ukraine and taken Crimea, in gross violation ofinternational law. All of those things have come about because of his presidency.  So now he comes to the floor and objectsto one of the most highly qualified individuals and leaders in military history. I say to the Senator from Oregon: You arewrong.  I believe the overwhelming majority of this body will repudiate and cancel out his uninformed remarks.  Mr.President, in a few minutes we will vote on a historic piece of legislation. For just the second time in seven decades, thelegislation before us would provide an exception to the law preventing any person from serving as Secretary of Defense within 7years of Active-Duty service as a regular commissioned officer of the Armed This legislation would allow JamesMattis--the President-elect's selection for Secretary of Defense, who retired from the Marine Corps 3 years ago--to serve in thatoffice.  Earlier today, the Senate Armed Services Committee received testimony from General Once again, hedemonstrated exceptional command of the issues confronting the United States, the Department of Defense, and our militaryservicemembers, but he also showed something else--that his understanding of civil-military relations is deep and that hiscommitment to civilian control of the Armed Forces is ironclad.  General Mattis's character, judgment, and commitment todefending our Nation and its Constitution have earned him the trust of our next Commander in Chief, Members of Congress on bothsides of the aisle, and so many who are serving in our Armed General Mattis is an exceptional public servant worthy ofthe exceptional consideration. That is why, directly following the conclusion of today's hearing, the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee reported this legislation to the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 24 to 3--I repeat: with an overwhelmingvote of 24 to 3.  I am not saying that members of the Armed Services Committee are smarter than the Senator from Oregon, butI am saying that members of the Armed Services Committee have scrutinized--both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democrat,including the ranking member--have looked at General Many of us have known him for years and years, as he has shown theoutstanding characteristics of leadership that he has had the opportunity to display in his service to the country, and he wasvoted out by an overwhelming vote of 24 to 3. So obviously there are 24 people on the Armed Services Committee who believe inGeneral Mattis and believe that this exception should be made, as opposed to 3 who share the view of the Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgS299-2.txt,1900,PROVIDING FOR ANEXCEPTION TO A LIMITATION AGAINST APPOINTMENT OF,2017.0,12.0,January
6649,topic-id,733,"I ask my colleague from Arizona if he will yield for a question.  Mr.That is why, directly following the conclusion of today's hearing, the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee reported this legislation to the Senate with a vote of 24 to 3. I urge this body to follow suit.  That said, it isimportant for future Senators to understand the context of our action here today. Civilian control of the Armed Forces has beena bedrock principle of American Government since our A painting hanging in the Capitol Rotunda not far from thisfloor celebrates the legacy of George Washington, who voluntarily resigned his commission as commander of the Continental Armyto the This principle is enshrined in our Constitution, which divides control of the Armed Forces among the Presidentas Commander in Chief and the Congress as coequal branches of government.  Since then, Congress has adopted variousprovisions separating military and civilian positions. In the 19th century, for example, Congress prohibited an Army officerfrom accepting a civil office, more recently, in the National Security Act of 1947, and subsequent revisions, Congress's 7-year``cooling off'' period for any person to serve as Secretary of It was only 3 years later, in 1950, that Congressgranted GEN George Marshall an exemption to that law and the Senate confirmed him to be Secretary of  Indeed, theseparation between civilian and military positions has not always been so clear. Twelve of our Nation's Presidents previouslyserved as generals in the Armed Forces, and over the years, numerous high-ranking civilian officials in the Department of[[Page S307]]Defense have had long careers in military service.  The basic responsibilities of civilian and military leaders aresimple enough--for civilian leaders: to seek the best professional military advice while under no obligation to follow it; formilitary leaders: to provide candid counsel while recognizing civilians have the final say or, as General Mattis once observed,to insist on being heard and never insist on being obeyed. But the fact is that the relationship between civilian and militaryleaders is inherently and endlessly complex. It is a relationship of unequals who nonetheless share responsibility for thedefense of the The stakes could not be higher. The gaps in mutual understanding are sometimes wide. Personalities oftenclash. And the unique features of the profession of arms and the peculiarities of service cultures often prove daunting forcivilians who have never served in uniform.  Ultimately, the key to healthy civil-military relations and civilian control ofthe military is the oath that soldiers and statesmen share in common ``to protect and defend the Constitution.'' It is about thetrust they have in one another to perform their respective duties in accordance with our republican system of government. It isabout the candid exchange of views engendered by that trust and which is vital to effective decisionmaking. And it is aboutmutual respect and understanding. The proper balance of civil-military relations is difficult to achieve, and, as history hastaught us, achieving that balance requires different leaders at different times.  I believe that in the dangerous times inwhich we live, General Mattis is the leader our Nation needs as Secretary of That is why, although I believe we mustmaintain safeguards of civilian leadership at the Department of Defense, I will support this legislation today and GeneralMattis' nomination to serve this Nation again as Secretary of  I want to assure my friend from Rhode Island, theranking member of the Armed Services Committee, who has very serious concerns--I want to assure him that this is a one-time deal.I know the Senator from Rhode Island had deep concerns about this whole process we have been through. Yet I think he has put theinterests of the Nation and placed his confidence in General Mattis as being so exceptional that the law that was passed back in1947--there can be made one single exception to it.

6667,topic-id,1633,"Mr.President, the Hippocratic Oath that guides health care practitioners begins with these powerful words: ``First, do no harm.'' This is certainly good guidance for our doctors and other health care practitioners, but isn't it good guidance also for those who are in the realm of health care policy, for those who are health care policy practitioners, as well as the doctors themselves? ``First, do no harm.''  Those powerful first words of the Hippocratic Oath, very relevant to this discussion, are being ignored by my colleagues across the aisle, by the Republicans who have come to power and said: We are going to dismantle health care across this Nation for millions of Americans, and we don't know what we are going to do next. We are going to repeal this plan, and we are going to run away, and in a few years we might figure out how to replace these health care provisions. This is an irresponsible perspective. We hold in our hands the health care challenges of America, and to repeal and run will do a tremendous amount of harm.  The irresponsibility of it is terrifying families across They are scared of what the future holds, of the uncertainty that awaits them under this strategy of making America sick again. Folks are afraid that if they have ever been sick or injured they will soon be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition. They are afraid that they may be one of the more than 20 million Americans who will lose insurance, having gained insurance and access to affordable quality health care through the They are scared that premium hikes will make health care unaffordable to lower and middle-income They are afraid of an unforeseen emergency wiping them out financially, driving them into bankruptcy.  Our seniors are afraid as well. They remember the situation that existed before they reached 65 or if they had health care needs and didn't have insurance, they had to wrestle between paying for their prescriptions or paying their heating bills. They don't want to be in that position again. They know how much progress we have made by filling the doughnut hole that paid for prescriptions throughout the continuum, and they don't want us to go backward.  From so many different directions, Americans are terrified of the Republican repeal-and-run strategy threatening to do harm to their lives. How do I know this? I know this because they are writing to me and to my colleagues, and we are sharing those stories tonight.  The letter I have from a young woman in Portland starts out:       I must implore you to protect the Its existence saves      the lives of millions, including mine.

I am only 26, I have so much more to      do.  Cameron of Beaver Creek writes:       My wife and daughter both have chronic health conditions,      and the ACA has allowed us to have them covered by health      insurance despite having preexisting conditions. If the ACA      is repealed, we will lose this protection and I don't know      how we could afford to pay for their medical costs directly.  Lisa in Wilsonville wrote to me about the impact that repealing the ACA will have on her special needs daughter. Lisa says: ``If the ACA is repealed, we lose funding that directly impacts her programs, her respite care, her Medicaid, and I will no longer get support to take care of my daughter.''  Just before Christmas I got a message from Nick in Nick wrote to share his story of a recent medical emergency that threatened his life. He said:       Without notice this past March, my heart suffered a      debilitating viral infection which resulted in congestive      heart failure. As things stand, I require a new heart, and      await that occurrence with patience and resolve. Thanks to      the ACA, I was able to purchase health insurance the month      prior to that diagnosis. Without it, I don't know how I could      have paid for my initial three-week hospitalization. . . .      Without it, my ability to obtain a replacement organ would be      uncertain. And without it, I envision a bankruptcy filing as      the only viable financial option.  Those individuals are writing about their challenges as patients, but doctors are also writing to share their observations as folks who see hundreds of patients in the course of a year.  Meg writes:[[Page S172]]         I have practiced both before and after the Affordable Care      Act, and witness the sense of hope and relief the expansion      of Medicaid in Oregon brought to my patients who are facing      serious illnesses. We have been able to participate in      community and state level innovations to help transform      health care delivery, lowering costs, improving outcomes, and      making people's lives better.  Isn't that what we should be about? Not a strategy of doing harm to millions of Americans but a strategy to make these people's lives better.  A physician from Roseburg, a hand surgeon, wrote about the challenges that he and his wife face, the serious medical challenges, and says:       Prior to the Affordable Care Act, we were uninsurable due      to these preexisting conditions. It seems clear that the ACA      will be repealed, and we, among millions of other Americans,      will again be uninsurable. This will not simply be a matter      of insurance being expensive; it will be a matter of the      insurance not being available at any cost.  And he continues:       So I am pleading to you to enact legislation prohibiting      insurers from denying the ability to sell policies to      individuals with prior medical conditions. The health of      millions of Americans rests on your shoulders.  And I might add that the health of millions of Americans rests on the debate and the discussion and the decision of the U. Angela, another doctor in Portland, wrote about her work with the LGBTQ community, saying:       The loss of the affordable care act will be devastating to      my community. We have only just won the right for patients to      access medical care, hormones and surgery in the last year. I      have seen a great improvement in my patients' well-being and      mental health over the last year with these new privileges.      With the loss of the affordable care act many of my patients      will be devastated. There is a 50 percent suicide rate in the      transgender community already.

There is enormous stress connected with a faulty health care system, and what we have achieved with the Affordable Care Act is peace of mind for millions of Americans--peace of mind that there will be the care in place when they need it, that they will be able to afford it and they won't be bankrupt, that their loved ones will be able to have their health care challenges addressed.  Folks used to come to my townhalls and say: Senator, I am just trying to stay alive till I reach 65 because I have a preexisting condition and I can't get medical care. Can you imagine the stress involved with that? Folks would say: I would love to get insurance and address the health care issues I have, but I can't because I can't afford it. And now they can afford it because of the subsidies provided through the  There was a woman who came up to me at a multiple sclerosis fundraising march and she said: Senator, things are so different this year.

She said: If you did have insurance, it is a mysterious and expensive disease, and because of annual limits or lifetime limits, you would probably run out of health care. Now we have the peace of mind to know our loved ones will get the care they need.

Americans have now seen the truth: massive increases in premiums, constantly rising deductibles and copays, andfewer plans with fewer providers.  Just because an individual or a family has insurance does not mean they can access and afford health care. Health insurancemeans little if they cannot find a participating doctor or afford the deductible. In Michigan, premiums have risen over 17percent this year, and deductibles are up an average of $492.  There is a plan. I will hand carry it over for you to read it.

6671,topic-id,2124,"Mr.President, once again, congratulations on your election. I haven't gotten a chance to talk with the Presiding Officer in detail about his path to the U.Senate, but I have had a chance to talk to a lot of my colleagues about how they got here, and I think we can all agree it is not often a real pleasant experience. You get your name dragged through the mud. You get called all sorts of names. You have to call lots of friends and strangers and ask them for money. It is no walk in the park to run for political office or to put your name out there and be the subject of both praise and a lot of ridicule.  It is not surprising the reason that people do this. The reason that the 100 of us have decided to run for office and to put ourselves out there in the public spotlight is because we deeply care about our neighbors, about the people who live in our We are doing this job, to a man and woman, because we want to make life better for people; in particular, people who have been just thrown big curveballs by life.  I grew up in a pretty economically secure house, but I understand a lot of kids don't have that opportunity, and I feel like both Republicans and Democrats are here because we want to lift those kids up. I have had a pretty healthy life, a few bumps and bruises along the way, but I feel like both Republicans and Democrats are here because we get that other people aren't as fortunate. They got sick. They got diagnosed with something terrible. Our role should be to try to help get them some cures or some treatments.  We are here not because we think it is fun to run elections, we are not here because we like the look of our name on the door, we are here because we care desperately about people. I think this is what Senator King was getting at in his remarks. All of the tabloids and the TV news shows, they spend 80 percent of their time focusing on politics, and we end up chasing our tail off in here because if the daily political rags and the cable news shows are talking about politics, then maybe we should be talking and thinking about politics as well, but that is not why we decided to do this. We decided to run for the Senate because we care about people.  Why we are here tonight is pretty simple. Ultimately, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, with no replacement, with no plan for what comes next, will hurt millions of real people in very real ways. In the end, I don't believe that my Republican colleagues want to cast a vote that will do that.  This tall guy right here is Josh He lives in He is from He is standing next to his bone marrow donor and her boyfriend. This is Josh's wife. Josh was diagnosed with stage IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2012.  Here is what Josh says. He will tell you the unvarnished truth. Josh says: ``The ACA is entirely responsible for me still being alive.''  He relapsed after an additional diagnosis before he turned 26, and the only way he was able to get insurance was because of the Affordable Care Act, which allowed him to stay on his mother's insurance up until he turned 26. During the course of his treatments, he underwent stem cell transplants, which could be up to $200,000 each. Because of those transplants, he needed ongoing weekly treatments at a cost of $10,000 per treatment.  He recalled how he was getting his first stem cell transplant and he was in the hospital during the Supreme Court deliberations on the Affordable Care He said, ``I was in a hospital bed watching the TV, when the Supreme Court approved the ACA, and just the feeling I had in my body was a feeling that I had never experienced before because I knew that I was going to be taken care of.''  Josh is in remission. In a few more years of being cancer-free, the doctors tell him he might be out of the woods. He says, ``I'm more fearful for other people in my position. . . . Because there's no way I would have been able to afford any of those treatments'' if it wasn't for the Affordable Care  This little guy, his name is This is his mother Rylan was born with a congenital heart defect. One day he had to be rushed to Connecticut Children's Medical Center for emergency open-heart surgery to keep him alive. Isabelle says that she never really thought about health insurance. She knew she had it, but she didn't really think about it until Rylan went for that emergency surgery. She thought: Oh, no, is our insurance going to cover it? Will they cover all the treatments he needs going forward now that he will have had a preexisting condition? She found out that the Affordable Care Act protected her because it eliminated a common practice of insurance companies to cap the amount of coverage you get in any one given year or over the course of your lifetime.  Isabelle tells it plainly. She says:       Without the Affordable Care Act, we would have never been      able to afford the care for We would have had to make      awful decisions--decisions about whether we kept our house,      kept our car, whether we could still afford to work.  It was the Affordable Care Act that protected her and her family.  Finally, this is John is a hero in my book. John was born with cystic fibrosis. John tells the story about how health care is the most important thing to him in the world. It is more important than salary. It is more important than his job. It is more important than friends. He struggles every day to live. The only way he lives is that he is able to take medications that allow him to continue to breathe and that allow his lungs to continue to function amidst this crippling disease and diagnosis.  John is on the Affordable Care Act, and John will tell you, just as plainly as Josh and Isabelle, that without the Affordable Care Act, he would die--not 2 years from now, not 3 years from now. John would die within a matter of weeks because without his medications, he cannot live.  It is not hyperbole to suggest that the absence of the Affordable Care Act is a matter of life and death. John will tell you that without the Affordable Care Act, he doesn't have insurance. Without insurance, he cannot afford the medications to keep him alive. Without the medications to keep him alive, John disappears from this  These are real people. I care about them because I know them, and I have had the chance to meet John and Isabelle and But you have these people in your State as well. My Republican colleagues have just as many of them. Some of the biggest numbers of enrollment in the Affordable Care Act aren't in States represented by Democrats; they are in States represented by And this mythology that the Affordable Care Act hasn't worked or that it is in some death spiral is just political rhetoric. It is not true.  This is an AP fact check story from today, I believe. Here is the beginning of it. It says:       President-elect Donald Trump says that President Barack      Obama's health care law ``will fall of its own weight.''       House speaker Paul Ryan says the law is ``in what the      actuaries call a death spiral.''       And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says that ``by      nearly any measure, ObamaCare has failed.''  The AP says:       The problem with all these claims: They are exaggerated, if      not downright false.  The Affordable Care Act has not failed for the 20 million Americans who have insurance now because of it. The Affordable Care Act has not failed for the millions more who are paying less because insurance companies can no longer discriminate against them if they have a preexisting condition. The Affordable Care Act has not failed for seniors all across this country who are on Medicare and are paying less for prescription drugs.  There is no doubt that the Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. Medicare wasn't perfect when it was passed. We amended it 18 different times. The Affordable Care Act needs to be amended and perfected, as well, but if you really care about people instead of political headlines, then the prescription here is simple: Take a step back. Don't[[Page S177]]lurch the entire health care economy into chaos when you don't have to.  I am pretty sure that Donald Trump is going to be President for the next 2 years. I am pretty sure that Republicans are going to control the Senate and the House of Representatives for the next 24 months. You have time. You don't need to prove some point to the political talk show hosts and the conservative radio commentators. You can step back and rescue these real people from the fate that you are about to subject them to by--instead of engaging in a partisan repeal with no replacement for what comes next--reaching out across the aisle and working with Democrats to try to fix this law.  I have been here the last 6 years. I was part of the passage of this law when I was in the House of I have listened to my colleagues say, literally tens of thousands of times in Washington and across the country, that their priority was to repeal and replace this law. I watched on TV our President-elect say in response to a question about the process for health care repeal going forward:       No, we are going to do it simultaneously [repeal and      replace the law]. It'll be just fine. We are not going to      have, like, a two-day period and we are not going to have a      two-year period where there is nothing. It will be repealed      and replaced.  There will not be a 2-day period in between repeal and replace. And that is what I heard from my Republican colleagues: Put your vote where your mouth has been because the alternative is a death spiral.  The Associated Press calls the mistruths out and says: No, the Affordable Care Act is not in a death spiral. But those same health care economists who are quoted in that story will tell you that if you repeal this bill without any replacement for what happens next, that is what creates the death spiral. Why? Because when you put a clock ticking on the life of the Affordable Care Act, then a couple of things happen. First, people who need some procedure done rush into those exchanges and they drive up the actuarial cost, and insurers just look at themselves and say: Why would you hang around for that? And they bolt. So the Affordable Care Act falls apart if you telegraph to people that you have only 1 year or 2 years left.  You don't have to do this. You don't have to visit that kind of harm on real people. I know that is not why Republicans ran for office. I know we have philosophical differences on how to get health care to people, about how to insure more people, but let us sit down and figure out a middle ground so we can save the lives of all these people who are relying on us.  What we are doing right now is extraordinary. This is absolutely extraordinary. We were sworn in less than a week ago. The new President has not even been inaugurated. There isn't even a conceptual plan for what will replace the Affordable Care Act, and we are rushing forward with repeal. There is an enthusiasm to this cruelty that is hard to understand.  I hope that some of the Republicans who just in the last 24 hours have called for a delay in this debate are heard by Republican leadership. I know that Democrats will continue to be on this floor to make this case. I guess I am still optimistic enough about what is still a pretty broken town that, in the end, my Republican friends aren't so cold-hearted, aren't so barbaric as to take away insurance from people like those we have been talking about here today when there is an alternative, when there is another way, when there is no political imperative to do this kind of damage to people right now.

Well, my Democratic colleagues and I care about the health of the American people, about American jobs and about That is why we will vote against this absurd budget resolution; that, and the ACA repeal.  I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.  Mr.Chair, this budget resolution is primarily a vehicle to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to defund Planned Parenthood,steps the Republicans are taking without putting any plans in place to ensure that millions of men, women, and children willcontinue to have access to health care they need. They are proposing to let Americans get sick, even die, to score cheappolitical points.  Repeal of the Affordable Care Act will be a disaster for the American public. In New York State alone, it will result in 2.7million people losing health insurance and will create a $3 billion hole in the state budget. It will also result in the loss ofthousands of health care jobs across the state. Republicans will send America back to the days when people went bankrupt tryingto pay medical bills. It will mean that people with private insurance--from their employers or the individual market--will havetheir insurance cancelled for pre-existing conditions. It will mean that people once again will be subject to annual or lifetimelimits--in other words, if you get an expensive illness, a heart attack or cancer, your insurance will run out just when you needit the most. And people on Medicare will have to pay an average of $3,000 a year for prescription drugs.  Adding insult to very serious injury, this bill would defund Planned Parenthood because of debunked accusations. If membershave real evidence that Planned Parenthood broke the law, they should send it to federal law enforcement agencies. Instead, theyare asking us to pass legislation that will punish an invaluable organization without any evidence or due process because theydon't agree with them. My colleagues who love to cloak themselves in the Constitution should know Congress is not the lawenforcement body this bill asks us to be--it smacks of a clearly unconstitutional bill of attainder.  If we do pass this bill, we will leave millions of women with no access to health care. Republicans may claim that women cango elsewhere for the services provided by Planned Parenthood--they've even gone so far as to provide additional funding forCommunity Health Centers to fill the gaps they clearly know this bill will leave behind. But did they check to see if theexisting Community Health Centers or Medicaid networks can fill these gaps? Did they ask HHS to confirm that Community HealthCenters even employ enough OB/GYNs and other specialists to actually take on the patients currently treated by PlannedParenthood? Of course not.  Republicans know HHS would never be able to make that determination. More than half of Planned Parenthood patients rely onMost states do not have enough Medicaid providers, particularly specialists like OB/GYNs, to absorb PlannedParenthood's patients. By voting to defund Planned Parenthood today, you are leaving 2.7 million women, men, and families withno access to health care.

6761,topic-id,310,"Mr.Chair, I have listened to every Republican who spoke during this budget debate, and I am convinced theywill repeal the ACA and run. There will never be a replacement because they don't have the votes for it. The Republicans areideologues. They don't believe we should regulate insurance companies or help people pay for their premiums, so they can neversupport a replacement plan that would do these things.  The ACA is a market-based plan to deal with the healthcare crisis that we faced 8 years ago. More and more people didn'thave health insurance. Insurance companies wouldn't sell them health insurance if they had a preexisting condition like cancer.People were paying more and more out of pocket, and the fact of the matter is that we stepped in in a practical way, not becausewe were ideologues, because we were looking at the situation practically to help people.  What did we do? We provided 20 or 30 million people who didn't have insurance with insurance. For those who had healthinsurance through their employer, we guaranteed them a good benefit package, and we limited their out-of-pocket costs. We lookedat this practically because we are trying to help the American people. We were not ideologues. We didn't care about whether youwere on the left or the right.  But what the Republicans are doing today is really a farce. They don't care about the average They don't careabout all these people who have insurance now who didn't have it before, about the benefits that they are getting, that theirout-of-pocket costs have been limited. They are just ideologues. They want to repeal this. They have no intention of everreplacing it, in my opinion, and they want to go back to the good old days when the insurance companies controlled the market.That is what we are going to have. Repeal and run, that is what you are doing.  ",CREC-2017-01-13-pt1-PgH490.txt,887,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017--Continued",2017.0,13.0,January
6753,topic-id,1565,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am so proud of him and his leadership as the ranking memberon the Budget  I am so sorry that the Speaker left the floor because I have some very good news for him. Clearly, he does not understandwhat the Affordable Care Act has brought to our country in terms of expanding benefits, lowering costs, and expanding the accessof many more people to the promise of our founders, of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, a healthier life, and thefreedom to pursue their happiness.  I understand why the Speaker may want to concentrate on some mythology that he presented about the Affordable Care Act,because he is not going to focus on what this bill on the floor does today, and the Republican budget. It does not create moregood-paying jobs, or raise wages. It does not invest in infrastructure to rebuild our  The Republican plan does not invest in the education of our children or the lifetime learning of working people. It does nothelp Americans find balance between work and family. It does not reduce the deficit. In fact, it increases the deficit. And itdoes not seek to drain the swamp of secret money from our elections.  Instead, the Republicans are feeding their ideological obsession with repealing the ACA and dismantling the health andeconomic security of hardworking families.  We all know that a budget should be a statement of our values. What is important to us as a nation should be reflected inour budget proposals. I always say: Show me your values, show me your budget.  Well, you heard me say some of what this budget does not do. As we get further into the next stage of the budget, we willsee that what their budget does is just broaden, widen the disparity in income in our country, give tax breaks to the high end.And part of their tax breaks for the high end is to repeal the Affordable Care Act so they can eliminate the tax on those whoare helping to fund the Affordable Care  So let me just talk about the Affordable Care Act for a while, because one of the things that the public should know is thatthe ACA, Medicare, and Medicaid, are now wed. If you mess with the ACA, it directly impacts these other important initiatives,Medicare and  The Republicans have never supported They opposed it at its origin and, over time, continued to oppose it.                              {time}  1230  In the nineties, their Speaker, Newt Gingrich, said Medicare should wither on the vine. Their Speaker, Paul Ryan, hasin his budget removing the guarantee of Medicare for our seniors. Remove the guarantee. That means you get a voucher and you goshop for Medicare in this nonexistent health plan that they put forth.  Republicans talk about how they are going to repeal and replace. It is interesting illustratively, but not realistic interms of the fact that, for 6 years, they have had a chance to propose an alternative. We have seen nothing.  What we have seen is cut and run. They want to cut benefits and run. They want to cut savings and run. They want to cutaccess and run. They want to cut Medicare and run. They want to cut Medicaid and run. The list goes on and on. They want to cutjobs. We will lose 3 million jobs if they have their way with their nonexistent cut-and-run plan on the Affordable Care  Let's talk about the relationship between ACA and Medicare and Hospitals will be devastated under the ACA repealbecause they will be left with uncompensated care.  One of the challenges to hospitals was that they must care for people who come in and don't have the ability to pay. Withthe Affordable Care Act, we now take care of that. That alleviates the cost to corporate America or those who are providinghealth benefits to their workers, adding between $1,000 and $3,000 a year per policy because they are carrying the uncompensatedcare cost. The Affordable Care Act alleviates that.  The reality is, as Mr.Neal, our new ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, has said, Medicaid is now a healthprogram that crosses the economic spectrum. It is not just for the poor. People think of Medicaid as a poor peopleinitiative--no. It enables mothers to work their way out of poverty by providing affordable coverage for their children--yes.  It enables people with disabilities to get the care needed to live and work in the community, and it provides criticalnursing home care for middle class elderly who have spent down their savings and have no other alternatives. As Mr.Nealsays, Grandma is going to be living in the guest room or in the attic or in the basement if you cannot have nursing home care.  This is very important to families because we want a budget that enables people to have good-paying jobs, increase theirpaycheck so that they can afford their home, address the aspirations of their children, and have a dignified retirement. If theyhave to care for their aging parents, they do less for[[Page H502]]their children. This assault on Medicaid is an assault on thefinancial stability of families across the board, whatever their age.  Furthermore, Medicaid is one of best tools to fight addiction. We made a big deal about our opioid legislation. Americanswho previously did not have access to health care and, therefore, self-medicated with opioids and other painkillers are able toaccess diagnosis, treatment, and pain management. Medicaid provides real care for the addiction and underlying condition to turnfor the better for individuals and their families and the community. The list goes on and on.  The jobs issue. In most of your communities, healthcare providers, hospitals, et cetera, are the biggest employers. Theywon't be anymore. Millions of jobs will be lost.  Mr.Pallone, our ranking member on Energy and Commerce, another committee of jurisdiction, keeps making that point. Whyare you being, he says, ideological about this when the practical effect is about the economic security of our families? I thankMr.Pallone for that.  Mr.Bobby Scott, the ranking member on the Education and the Workforce Committee shows what happens to States if youoverturn the Affordable Care In his own State of Virginia, he can give testimony to the increased cost to the State or lackof meeting the healthcare needs of constituents.  The ACA guards and strengthens the health care and economic security of every American, no matter where he or she getshealth insurance. It delivers transformational progress in terms of coverage, quality, and cost.  Much has been said about the fact that more than 20 million people now have access to affordable health care. This is awonderful and remarkable thing, but that is only part of the story.  Every American who has access to health care benefits from this. Most Americans receive their health benefits in theworkplace. If you do, you now cannot be discriminated against because of a preexisting medical condition.  You cannot be discriminated against if you are a woman. No longer is being a woman a preexisting medical condition, whichmeans you paid more if you are a woman.  No longer can the insurance companies levy lifetime limits for a preexisting condition that you may have or even for thecare that you are getting on a new basis. The list goes on and on.  Do you know how many people have a preexisting medical condition? There are 100 million families affected by preexistingconditions, such as if your child is born prematurely.  I, myself, have five children. Long ago, insurance companies said to me: You are a poor risk because you have had fivechildren. I said: I thought that was a sign of my strength. I didn't know that you were measuring it as a weakness.  Any excuse would have done, but not with the Affordable Care It stands there as a pillar of economic and healthsecurity. It stands there as a pillar of economic security like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which, again, theRepublicans and Newt Gingrich opposed in the 1990s and said would wither on the vine. In his budget, Paul Ryan takes awaythe guarantee. But it is a pillar of economic and health security.  So the proposal today increases the deficit, does not create jobs,undermines the health security of the American people, and does not do much in any regard to address the challenges I posed inthe beginning. It is no wonder they want to talk about the Affordable Care They have nothing to recommend in their budgetresolution.  The GOP's repeal plan will raise premiums. Mr.Chairman, the rate of growth of healthcare costs in our country has beengreatly diminished by the Affordable Care In the more than 50 years that they have been measuring the rate of growth, ithas never been slower than now.  Repeal will create chaos that will echo in the health coverage and costs of every Chaos is the order of the dayfor them.  The American people will not be dragged back to the days when an illness or injury meant financial ruin, that you might notget a job because someone in your family was ill and was going to raise the cost of health care in a company that might hireyou, that you could lose your home. Most bankruptcies spring because of not being able to pay medical bills.  In short, we will not allow the Republicans to make America sick again. I urge a ``no'' vote on this unfortunate resolution.

6835,topic-id,774,"Mr.Speaker, a strong, safe, reliable, and efficient infrastructure system is vital for robust and sustainedeconomic growth. Comprehensive infrastructure reform is all-inclusive and requires an ongoing investment by the FederalGovernment in not just our roads and bridges but in all of the vital systems that support our way of life.  Currently, the United States needs around $3.6 trillion in infrastructure investment by 2020, just to keep our country in astate of good repair. By contrast, China, perhaps our greatest international rival, spends nearly four times of its GDP oninfrastructure than we do and announced nearly a trillion dollars more infrastructure spending just last year.  Put simply, our national infrastructure system is an embarrassment, earning a D-plus grade from the American Society ofCivil It is a threat to our economy, to American jobs, to our national security, and to our environment.  We need a public transportation system that gets people where they need to be, keeps our roads clear, and makes our citiesbetter places to live. We need a freight system that moves products and raw materials quickly, safely, and efficiently. We needairways that reliably move people and cargo around the country and the world in a timely manner. We need river locks and portsthat allow American farmers to ship their products to market, no matter where that is. We need water pipes and sewers thattransport safe, clean water to every And we need to close the broadband gap so that every American can take advantageof the opportunities the Internet provides.  Investing in America's infrastructure is good politics, good economics, and the right thing to do. Each year, Americans takearound 11 billion trips on public transportation systems like buses, commuter rail, and light rail, contributing to the $58billion industry that employs nearly half a million people. And yet, almost half of our Nation's buses and a quarter of our railassets are in marginal or poor condition.  My city of Chicago is the crossroads for the Nation's freight system, and each day more than 54 million tons of freight ismoved across the U.S., and nearly a quarter of it passes through the Chicago city limits--at times, very slowly.  We stand to lose $1 trillion a year in lost sales in 2020, if we fail to build out our freight infrastructure to keep pacewith future growth.  Congestion is also an issue at our Nation's airports. Ground delays are becoming a greater challenge as more and more peoplefly regularly. These delays can have a very serious consequence, resulting in passengers being late to their destinations, lostproductivity from cargo sitting on runways, and increased pollution due to needlessly burning jet fuel.  In addition to air and ground, we must also talk about our waterways. Each year millions of tons of material traverse inlandwaterways like the Mississippi River and the Saint Lawrence But, according to the Army Corps of Engineers, there is abillion dollar maintenance backlog that threatens to keep our waterways from maintaining adequate levels of performance.  There are problems in our water and sewer systems, too. The 240,000 water main breaks that occur in this country each yearcost us more than $2.6 billion; not to mention the lost productivity caused by closed roads, lost water, and other indirectimpacts. Nearly all of the U.underground water pipes will reach or surpass their useful lifespans in the next decade. Thelonger we wait, the higher the price tag will become.  Finally, we can use our infrastructure system to promote economic growth and economic equality, and one great way to do thatis to close the broadband gap and increase access to high-speed As many as 50 million Americans live in areas withoutthe ability to get high-quality and useful Internet access. Extending the ability to get online benefits businesses, employees,students, and everyone else without this vital utility, all while spurring economic activities that ripple throughout theeconomy.[[Page H304]]  The benefits of smart investment and infrastructure are massive. Every billion spent in infrastructure creates 13,000 jobs,in addition to improving the efficiency of the system. And every dollar invested generates almost $3 in economic activity.  Conversely, the consequences of failing to act are dire. Each American household stands to lose $3,400 per year indisposable income thanks to infrastructure deficiencies. That is money taken directly from our constituents' pockets, money theywould use to support themselves and their families, not to mention the economy as a whole, which could lose more than $4trillion in GDP and more than 2.5 million jobs by 2025.  We owe it to each other and every one of our constituents to act. I urge the 115th Congress to prioritize infrastructurespending and pass a comprehensive package that addresses all aspects of the connected infrastructure system.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH303-4.txt,1967,P.M.

6643,topic-id,1528,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss 84, a bill that wouldprovide a one-time exception from the longstanding law that requires a member of the military to be retired from the armedservices for at least 7 years before being appointed as Secretary of We areconsidering this legislation today because the President-elect's nominee for Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis, hasonly been retired from the U.Marine Corps for 3 years.  In considering the unique situation presented by this nomination,this week the Armed Services Committee held two hearings. The first hearing, on Tuesday, had a panel of two excellent outsidewitnesses who discussed the history of the retirement restriction law and the benefits and challenges of legislating anexception to that law. Then, this morning, the committee held a nomination hearing with General Mattis and examined his views ona wide range of defense challenges facing our country and the Defense  General Mattis has a long anddistinguished military career, and he is recognized by his peers as a thoughtful and strategic thinker. However, since itspassage in 1947, the statutory requirement designed to protect civilian control of the Armed Forces has only been waived oneother time. Therefore, I believe it is extremely important that we carefully consider the consequences of setting aside the lawand the implications such a decision may have on the future of civilian and military relations.  Civilian control of themilitary is enshrined in our Constitution and dates back to George Washington and the Revolutionary This principle hasdistinguished our Nation from many other countries around the world, and it has helped ensure that our democracy remains in thehands of the people.  The National Security Act of 1947, which established the Department of Defense, included a provisionprohibiting any individual ``within ten years'' of ``active duty as a commissioned officer in a regular component of the armedservices'' from being appointed as the Secretary of However, in 1950, President Harry Truman nominated former Secretaryof State and former Chief of Staff of the United States Army General George Marshall to serve as the Secretary of Defense, thuscausing Congress to pass an exception to the statute.  While Congress ultimately waived the restriction for General Marshall,the law included a nonbinding section that stated: ``It is hereby expressed as the intent of the Congress that the authoritygranted by this Act is not to be construed as approval by the Congress of the continuing appointments of military men to theoffice of Secretary of Defense in the future. It is hereby expressed as the sense of the Congress that after General Marshallleaves the office of the Secretary of Defense, no additional appointments of military men to that office shall be approved.''  Nearly 70 years later, Congress again must make a determination if an exception should be made in the case of Let me remind my colleagues why making this change is so significant. During our committee hearings, Kathleen Hicksastutely noted: ``The Defense Secretary position is unique in our system. Other than the President acting as commander in chief,the Secretary of Defense is the only civilian official in the operational chain of command to the Armed Unlike thePresident, however, he or she is not an elected official.''  As I stated during the committee's consideration of the waiverlegislation, we must be very cautious about any actions, including this legislation, that may inadvertently politicize our During this past Presidential election cycle, both Democrats and Republicans came dangerously close to compromising thenonpartisan nature of our military with the nominating convention speeches from recently retired general officers advocating fora candidate for  I am also concerned about providing a waiver for General Mattis in light of the fact that he willjoin other recently retired senior military officers who have been selected for high-ranking national security positions in theTrump Throughout our Nation's history, retired general officers have often held positions at the highest levelsof government as civilians. In fact, a few have even been elected  What concerns me, however, is the total numberof retired senior military officers chosen by the President-elect to lead organizations critical to our national security andthe cumulative affect it may have on our overall national security policy. Specifically, there may be unintended consequenceshaving so many senior leaders with similar military backgrounds crafting policy and making decisions as weighty as those facingthe next administration.  In the course of our review of General Mattis' nomination, the reason most often cited in supportof a waiver allowing him to serve is that a retired four-star general known for his war-fighting skills and strategic judgmentto lead the Department of Defense will counterbalance the President-elect's lack of defense and foreign policy experience. AsTom Ricks wrote recently in The New York Times: ``Usually I'd oppose having a generalas Secretary of Defense, because it could undermine our tradition of civilian control of the military. But these are not normaltimes.''  Likewise, Eliot Cohen testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this week, and he argued thatif it weren't for his deep concern about the Trump Administration, he would oppose the waiver for General Specifically,he stated: ``There is no question in my mind that a Secretary Mattis would be a stabilizing and moderating force . . . and overtime, helping to steer American foreign and security policy in a sound and sensible direction.''  If Congress provides anexception for General Mattis, we must be mindful of the precedent that action sets for such waivers in the future. Therestriction was enacted into law for good reason, and General George Marshall is the only retired military officer to receivethis exception.  Based on General Mattis' testimony this morning, as well as his decades of distinguished service in the U.S.Marine Corps, and weighing all of the other factors, I will support a waiver for him to serve as Secretary of GeneralMattis testified to the fact that the role of Congress does not end with the passage of this legislation. As Hicks stated,``The United States Congress, the nation's statutes and courts, the professionalism of our Armed Forces, and the will of thepeople are critical safeguards against any perceived attempts to fundamentally alter the quality of civilian control of themilitary in this country.''  Any of us who support this bill have a profound duty to ensure that the Department of Defense andits leaders,[[Page S305]]both civilian and military, are following and protecting the principles upon which this country isfounded.  Let me be very clear. I will not support a waiver for any future nominees under the incoming administration orfuture administrations. I view this as a generational exception, as our bipartisan witnesses recommended. I would ask that mycolleagues on both sides of the aisle make this same commitment. Indeed, I intend to propose reestablishing the original 10-yearban which was in place when the Defense Department was established. Restoring the threshold for service to 10 years would send astrong signal that this principle of civilian control of the military is essential to our Democratic system of government.  Atthis point I would ask if the chairman of the committee might engage in a colloquy. I do that first by thanking him for theextraordinarily fair, thoughtful, and careful way he has guided this nomination through the committee and here to thefloor.  I wish to thank the Senator from Arizona for the thoughtful and thorough process we have had in considering thenomination of General I think one of the high points was a hearing on civilian military relations with Eliot Cohen andKathleen Both witnesses emphasized that while they supported this waiver, it should be a rare, generational exceptionto ensure the integrity of civilian control of our military, which is the bedrock of our democracy.  I agree wholeheartedlywith that assessment, and I would ask the chairman if he also agrees with that assessment.  Mr.Mr.President, I would say that I also agree. I want to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his leadership, andI want to thank him for setting the tenor and the environment that surrounds the Armed Services Committee, which resulted in the24-to-3 vote today in the Armed Services Because of the relationship that we have, but also because of hisleadership, we have a very bipartisan committee, which is vital to maintain, considering the awesome responsibilities wehold.  The Senator from Rhode Island has displayed time after time a willingness to work together for the good of the country.I think this is the latest example, even though he had significant reservations--which are valid--concerning the short period oftransition from wearing the uniform to holding down the highest civilian position as far as defense of the Nation is concerned.I know he didn't reach this conclusion without a lot of thought, a lot of study, a lot of--as he has displayed--references tohistory; reasons for the origination of this legislation, which requires 7 years before an individual is eligible to beSecretary of Defense after leaving the military.  So I just wanted to thank the Senator from Rhode Island, and I look forwardto an overwhelming vote.  Mr.President, could I ask the parliamentary situation as it is right now.

Instead, we stand here ready to erase the foundation that this law was based on and put forth a betterone, one that doesn't leave anyone behind, one that is based on market-driven, consumer-driven, patient-driven needs andexpectations and allows them to, for example, keep their job.  What do I mean by that, Mr.Chairman? Consider this. Not only do we have bad healthcare outcomes as a result of thisinsidious law, people are losing work. They are being robbed of their dignity to work. Since ObamaCare, 21 percent of businessesare reducing the number of employees, their wages and salaries and their benefits, including their retirement benefits.  So this insidious law is not only having detrimental implications on our health care and people's health, but it is takingaway the very dignity that they have to work.  It is also spelling the death of health savings accounts, proven over the last several years to be part of the solution toconsumer-driven health care. The idea that you can save for your healthcare expenses, with or without the government's help, sothat you can make value decisions as to your health care without government interference. It leads to better patient outcomes.It leads to freedom to make healthcare decisions absent the oversight of the government. ObamaCare all but outlawed healthsavings accounts. I think[[Page H492]]health savings accounts are probably in every one of those different plans the chairwomanpointed out.  So we are offering a replacement. We are offering solutions.

And if you go back to the beginning, it was created with a series oflies to the American people. We all remember: if you like what you have, you can keep it. How has that worked out for millionsof Americans who lost the plans that they liked and now cannot keep that plan?  What about the promise, Mr.Chairman, that premiums would go down by $2,500? President Obama made that claim. And today, inStates all across the Nation, you are seeing premiums go up, on average, 25 percent, and that is on top of double-digitincreases every single year ObamaCare has been in effect.  This law is not working. It is failing families. It is costing jobs across our economy. It is time to repeal this law andactually replace it with reforms that put patients back in charge of their medical decisions with their doctors. What a greatconcept that would be.  It is about time we focus on lowering the cost of health care and giving people real choices. In so many markets across thecountry--and it is a growing number--families have only one choice for health care now because ObamaCare has forced so many peopleout of the marketplace, which means you as a family don't have any choices, because one choice means it is a monopoly. And youwonder why the costs are skyrocketing.  Mr.Chairman, this should not be about preserving somebody's legacy. It should be about fulfilling those promises to theAmerican people that were broken.

I need mental health care. But now I think it is broadly accepted on both sides of the aisle, partly because of Chris Murphy's leadership, that mental health is health and that just as if you tweak your shoulder or need something with your lungs or have a crick in your neck, if you have some mental health issues, you need to get them taken care of.  The plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no replacement reminds me of a car I used to have. It was an OK car. I remember I bought it in 2006. It was a 2005, but it was new--one of those in the back of the lot. I got it for $2,500 less than It was a station wagon. It was ugly. It was purple, and I just sort of rode it into the ground. I kept driving it. I didn't take great care of it. I have gotten better about taking care of my cars. At the time I just rode it and rode it. The AC busted, and I didn't fix it. There was a fender bender, and I didn't fix that. The car was It needed some TLC, but it got me around. What if I had taken this car to Jiffy Lube in Honolulu just to get a little tuneup and left it, and then I came back an hour later and it had been dismantled? That is what the Republicans are doing with the Affordable Care Instead of fixing what is wrong and keeping what is working, they are going to destroy the American health care system.  I try very hard not to be too apocryphal with my language. I try very hard not to be too nasty and too partisan on this floor, but this is factual. They are going to destroy the American health care system. That is what repeal and replace is all about. They are going to remove a law from the books and come up with something terrific in a few months or a few years, but they are also going to keep the stuff you like.  Here is the first thing that everybody across the country needs to know about this process. It is not on the level. There is no way around it. This is just not on the level. Anybody who has spent any time thinking about health care policy knows that covering people with preexisting conditions like cancer, mental illness, and diabetes is a popular thing to do. It is the right thing to do. People also know that the only way to do that is to create a risk pool that includes healthy people. If you are going to insure folks, you can't just be paying out for the expensive cases; you also have to be bringing in revenue and not paying out, so you need young people in the risk pool. You need professionals in the risk pool. You need nonsick people in the risk pool. That is how this all works. Everybody understands that.  Everybody who is working on this in good faith understands that you need to create a risk pool in order to cover more people. So they know that if they eliminate the individual mandate, they eliminate the benefit, but they are stuck with a promise they made to repeal this law totally, root and branch--not to improve upon the law.  Just remember that it was an article of faith that we couldn't make even the most modest improvements to this law at any point in the last 6 or 7 years; that if you did so, you ran afoul of Republican orthodoxy. It is not that they wanted to fix the law. It is that they had told everybody it was so bad--partly because it was ObamaCare--that there was nothing good in it; there was nothing worth preserving about the Affordable Care  Now they are into repeal and replace. They are stuck with the promise they made to repeal this law totally, and they know people are about to be very, very angry because President Obama is the President only for another 10 days, and people are not going to accept the premise that we are going to rip health care out from under you, but don't you hate health care because it is called ObamaCare? That is an argument that may have worked 3, 4, or 5 years ago, but with a new President-elect and a new Congress, we have an obligation to have a better strategy than that.  Republicans do not have a replacement plan. If they had one, they would be adopting it shortly. It has been 7 years. It has been 7 years, and we haven't seen any legislative language--none. They have no plan at all for American health care other than to cause immediate harm and to try to blame it on the law that they are repealing.  There are only a few ways this could end up. I will give you a couple of them. First there could be the equivalent of a health care cliff, which is similar to what we have done with our fiscal situation where they have to periodically shovel money at the problem[[Page S178]]and bail out the insurance companies. What will happen is they are basically eviscerating the revenue that provides the subsidies for individuals, but they are going to realize: Hey, these subsidies are quite popular, but we just eliminated the revenue. We don't want to increase taxes so let's borrow money and keep shoveling money at the insurance companies or they may make minor reforms in the ACA and call it a replacement. That would be great. I do not see that they are on this path right now or they are really going to repeal the law and take health care coverage away from millions of This is completely irresponsible.  So what happens when they repeal ACA? Twenty-two million people will have their health care coverage ripped away from them, more than 22 million men, women, and children. For those of you who still have coverage, I want you to know that this impacts you too. If you have a preexisting condition as common as diabetes or high blood pressure or mental health issues or cancer or Crohn's disease or Lupus or in a lot of instances pregnancy is a preexisting condition, you are not going to be able to keep your coverage.  If you are a woman, you are likely going to lose access to preventive health care services like birth control. If you live in a rural area--everybody in rural America should understand this.  There is this thought that there are rural States and nonrural Every State is both a rural State and a nonrural I know the Presiding Officer has an urban area and plenty of rural areas. I have one of the densest cities in the United States, and then I have far-flung, very small towns that are old plantations. Everybody in the Senate represents rural America in some form or fashion.  If you live in a rural area, chances are that your local hospital will lose millions of dollars in funding, which will force many rural hospitals to turn away patients and close their doors. This is not an exaggeration. I encourage every Republican Member of the Senate, Member of the House, citizen out there to ask their health care leaders in rural hospitals what is about to happen. They are in a panic.  Let's be totally clear about what this means. You lose rural hospital money and you lose rural hospitals. For a lot of small towns, from Hawaii to the Dakotas, to the Carolinas, and everywhere in between, the rural hospital is the economic center of the community. It is often by far the largest employer. I want you to understand, if a rural community loses its rural hospital, a lot of the working-age folks leave. They move to a more urban area.  What happens is, the elderly citizens also have to leave because if you need access to emergency services but you are nowhere near any of that care, you are going to have to go too. So there is not a single thing we can do in the Congress that would harm rural communities quicker than what is being done this week by the  I want to be really clear about how much harm is about to be done to rural communities, not just rural health care providers, not just nurses and doctors and technicians and admins and janitors and everybody who works at those rural hospitals.  That is important because in a lot of instances, that is the economic driver of a small town. It is also about, people start to make choices with their own life and with their own planning, especially as they get older, and they think to themselves: How do I stay close to health care? If that rural hospital goes away, that rural town goes away.  We have seen it in That is why we fight for Molokai Community That is why we fight for Lanai Community That is why we fight for Waianae Coast Comprehensive Treatment That is why everybody fights so hard for their community rural hospitals--because it is the center of a community, not just economically, but without it, you basically have no community.  All of this will cause the entire insurance market to unravel, raising costs for everyone. This means families are going to pay more for prescription drugs, pay more on their premiums, and pay more for out-of-pocket costs.  So if the Republicans are still unfazed by the health impacts of the repeal I just outlined, and have been outlining for the last 4 or 5 hours, over the last 3 or 4 days, there is another reason to be extremely cautious about what is about to happen. As we know, the vehicle for this is a budget resolution, right? They are trying to characterize this as, no, it is not a budget resolution.  The only reason they are doing it as a budget vehicle is so they can do reconciliation. What does that mean? That means they only need 51 votes, where otherwise they would need 60 votes, but this is a budget. If it were not a budget, they would not be subject to the 51-vote threshold. This is the Federal budget. This Federal budget increases the deficit by trillions of dollars.  This Federal budget increases the deficit by trillions of dollars--not trillions of dollars at a flat line with the previous Federal budget, this is trillions of dollars more than last year's Federal budget.  So if you are a fiscal hawk, gosh, you must be swallowing hard over the next couple of days. This must be a bitter pill to swallow because on the one hand, boy, do you hate On the other hand, boy, do you hate running up the national deficit--not the debt, deficit--by trillions of dollars. This is insane. This deficit--what we are doing to the debt and deficit in the next 2 or 3 days makes everything that we have done in the last 3 or 4 years pale in comparison.  If you are a fiscal hawk, I cannot see how you get to yes on this. You cannot vote to increase the national debt by trillions of dollars and then still call yourself a fiscal hawk. So we have a choice in front of us. Do we build on the progress of the Affordable Care Act or do we strip millions of Americans of their health care coverage, leave those with preexisting conditions out in the cold, and raise the national debt?  We know ACA has its flaws. No one ever said it was perfect. Let us be clear. Every major piece of legislation, every signature piece of legislation that this body has ever passed has been flawed in some way. What do we do when we are a functioning world's greatest deliberative body? We iterate it. We work on a bipartisan basis to fix it. That is what we should do.  The benefits of ACA are undeniable. That is what we should be debating, improvements to the ACA, not an implosion. So let's keep our eye on the ball and remember what our common goal is: giving every American the opportunity to get quality, affordable health care they deserve.  I yield the floor.

6670,topic-id,1161,"Mr.President, first, let me thank my good friend from Maine for his usual eloquent remarks.  I thank my colleague from Connecticut, who is one of our great speakers and mainstays, who has let me sneak in ahead of him. So I will be brief.  My Democratic colleagues are holding the floor tonight to demonstrate our solidarity and our commitment to defending the Affordable Care It is not just defending some abstract law. It is not about protecting President Obama's legacy or Democrats' legacy. It is about people. It is about the American people and their access to affordable health care. It is about defending a health care system that has been made fairer, more generous, more accessible, and more affordable for the American family. It is about men and women and children whose stories we have heard tonight from Member after Member, one part of the country to the other, and their lives have been changed. In many cases, their lives have been saved by health care reform.  That is why Democrats have held the floor tonight. Though the hours have waned on, we will fight this repeal with every fiber of our being. We will not go gently into that good night.  The history of health care reform has been cast and recast by both parties, but there is a truth to be told amidst a lot of fiction. Here is a truth. Before the Affordable Care Act, our health care system was a mess. Health care costs were growing at a rate much faster than they are today, eating into workers' paychecks, dissuading them from taking risks and changing jobs lest they lose good coverage. A debilitating illness could wipe away a lifetime of hard-earned savings because insurers could put limits on how much treatment they would cover. Women were charged more for the same health care coverage. Many couldn't get insurance if they had a preexisting condition. Some insurance companies would simply delete you from the rolls if you got sick; in short, premiums spiraling up, spotty coverage, discriminatory practices, a marketplace out of balance. I remember the days before health care reform, before Everyone was complaining about the system. This idea that everything was hunky-dory and then ACA came in is fiction.  I was involved. We knew health care reform would be difficult. It is a $3 trillion industry with complicated rules and procedures. The politics were arduous. For that reason, health care reform had bedeviled Congresses and Presidents for decades. We knew in 2009 that we had a rare opportunity and that it was too important to let politics or lobbyists or special interests or fear stand in the way.  In the past, Democrats were able to make progress on smaller slices of the overall pie. The CHIP program, my dear friend who is no longer here, Senator Jay Rockefeller, championed it. Getting generic prescription drugs on the market, I was involved in that, along with the Senator from Never, never was a Congress able to pass a comprehensive package of reforms to the health care system until the ACA--the greatest leap forward in American health care, certainly since the passage of Medicare and  You can measure the results. The law has helped bend the health care costs curve down, insured more Americans than any time in our Nation's history since we started measuring the uninsured rate, all while providing higher quality health care.  Is the act perfect? No, no one ever said it was. I have listened to my friend the majority leader and our Republican colleagues on the floor these past few weeks. They used quotes from President Obama saying the law could use improvements as proof that it is failing.  That doesn't hold up. Go look at the full quotes. No one ever said the law would be perfect. We all know it could use some fixes. I, for one, am for a public option--we nearly had it in 2009--to increase competition in marketplaces where there is still too little. But scrap the whole thing and go back, back to a chaotic marketplace, inconsistent coverage, skyrocketing premiums? No way. Back to 40 million uninsured Americans, back to discriminating against women and Americans with preexisting conditions? No way.  Democrats don't want to make America sick again. We don't want to repeal the largest expansion of Affordable Health Care since Medicare and Medicaid and leave chaos in its wake--chaos instead of affordable care. That is what the Republican plan would do, sure as I am here tonight.  This evening, as colleague after colleague has come to the floor to describe how the ACA is helping their constituents, helping nurses, helping rural hospitals, helping students, helping seniors, I hope my Republican friends may have listened to them. The American people certainly are. They have been watching this debate. We have been talking to them on the phones, and they will carefully consider the consequences of repealing this law, and I hope our Republican colleagues will--particularly without a viable comprehensive replacement.  With the close of this long night, I make a simple plea to my Republican colleagues: Turn back. It is not too late. You are already hearing the grumblings from Members on the left side of your caucus and the right side of your caucus.  Well, they are starting to say, now that you have some power here, you are in the majority, maybe we shouldn't repeal without replace, even though for 6 years you have been unable to come up with a replacement.  The Republican Senators from Maine, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky, former Senator Rick Santorum, even the President-elect says that maybe we should replace and figure out how to replace before we repeal, but with this vote, it would just repeal it.  My simple advice to my Republican colleagues is turn back. The health care of Americans hang in the balance. Affordable care for every American hangs in the balance. If Republicans repeal the ACA without a detailed comprehensive plan to replace it, not a mere framework, not a set of principles, not a bunch of small-ball policies cobbled together, they will create utter chaos, not affordable care.  It is not too late. Work with us If you tell us tomorrow you are giving up on repeal, we will work with you to improve it. We know there[[Page S176]]needs to be some improvements, but don't scrap the law, leaving all those in the lurch and then come to us and say: Now let's fix it.  You better have a replacement. Something you haven't been able to do for 6 years. It is not too late. Work with us Democrats on improving the law. Work with us on making it better. Don't scrap it and make America sick again. Turn back before it is too late. It will damage your party. It will hurt millions of Americans, far more importantly, and hurt our great country.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

6938,topic-id,501,"Mr.President, I spoke at length about the Supreme Court nomination yesterday, but I just want to underscore a few points. We in the Senate have a constitutional duty to examine the record of Judge Gorsuch robustly, exhaustively, and comprehensively, and then advise and consent, as we see fit. We have a responsibility to reject if we do not.  We Democrats will insist on a rigorous but fair process. Part of that process entails 60 votes for confirmation. Any one Democrat can require it. Many already have. It was a bar met by each of Obama's nominations; each received 60 votes. Most importantly, it is the right thing to do. And I would note that a 60-vote threshold was reached by each of them either in cloture or in the actual vote.  On a subject as important as a Supreme Court nomination, bipartisan support is essential and should be a prerequisite. That is what a 60-vote threshold does; 60 votes produces a mainstream candidate. And the need for a mainstream consensus candidate is greater now than ever before because we are in major new territory in two ways.  First, because the Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Roberts, has shown increasing drift to become a more and more pro-business Court--siding more and more with corporations, employers, and special interests over working and average Americans--we need a mainstream nominee to help reverse that trend, not accelerate it. I will remind my colleagues, that is how President Trump campaigned, but his nominee seems not to be in that direction at all--not for the average working person but, rather, for special business interests.  Second, given that this administration--at least at its outset--seems to have less respect for the rule of law than any in recent memory and is testing the very fabric of our Constitution within the first 20 days, there is a special burden on this nominee to be an independent jurist, someone who approaches the Court without ideological blinders, who has a history of operating outside and above politics, and who has the strength of will to stand up to a President who has already shown a willingness to bend the  Requiring 60 votes has always been the right thing to do on Supreme Court nominations, especially in these polarized times. But now in this new era of the Court, in this new administration, there is an even heavier weight on this tradition. And if the nominee cannot gain the 60 votes, cannot garner bipartisan support of some significance, then the answer is not to change the rules; the answer is to change the nominee and find someone who can gain those 60 votes.  Changing the rules for something as important as the Supreme Court gets rid of the tradition, eliminates the tradition of mainstream nominees who have bipartisan support. It would be so, so wrong to do. I know many of my colleagues on the other side are hesitant to do it, and I hope they will remain strong in that regard.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgS610-3.txt,1036,FEDERAL EMPLOYEE HIRING FREEZE,2017.0,2.0,March

6664,topic-id,2971,"Mr.President, first I want to thank my good friend and colleague from Pennsylvania who serves with great distinction with me on the Agriculture I love that he is speaking about our farmers. In a few minutes, I am going to talk about Sonya, who is a blueberry farmer and small business owner from We know there are so many small business owners and farmers who finally have been able to find affordable health care because of what was passed in the health care reform act.  I want to thank Senator Casey for being such a strong advocate for those dairy farmers. We have a few dairy farmers in Michigan, as well, and we appreciate very much his advocacy.  I want to take a step back and look broadly for a moment at what is really happening here and why we are so concerned and why we have spent all of this evening and are going on into the night to talk on behalf of the people we represent on the impact of what repealing the Affordable Care Act without having a replacement that is as good or better in place at the time would really mean for people.  Republicans get sick. Democrats get sick. Independents get sick. People who don't vote get sick. This is not a partisan issue. This is about one of the most basic human needs, most basic things that we care about for our families. People go to bed at night and say: Please God, don't let the kids get sick. Make sure Mom is OK, Dad is  Because of the Affordable Care Act, because of the increases in access to affordable health care that we were able to pass a number of years ago, fewer people are having to worry. There are still people worrying, and there are still issues. There are still costs, and there are still things to do. I am anxious to get about the business--all Democrats are anxious to get about the business of making sure that health care is more affordable and doing more to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. I am also concerned about small businesses. There are things that we can do together, that we should be doing on a bipartisan basis, but we shouldn't be repealing health care and unraveling the entire system and creating chaos in the entire system instead of focusing on how we make health care better for families.  The bottom line of what is being proposed--and what this budget resolution is really all about--is going to make America sick again. That is the bottom line. We are going to create a situation where more Americans will be sick and not be able to see a doctor, not be able to find affordable insurance, or not be able to have the protections that they currently have under what we like to call the Patient's Bill of Rights--the patient protections for everybody. Seventy-five percent of Americans get their health insurance through their employer, and every one of them--all of us--have benefited from changes in health care that have taken total control out of the hands of insurance companies and given us more assurances that if we get sick, we are not going to get dropped. If we have an illness or our child has juvenile diabetes or cancer or Alzheimer's or leukemia or high blood pressure or if you are a woman of child-bearing age, which is viewed as a preexisting condition so you have higher rates--all of those things were changed in the interest of the American people.  Basically, when we look at it, there are four different areas where health care reform has made a difference in people's lives and what we are fighting for tonight. We are fighting for these things. We are fighting to have them not taken away and to have the system not ripped up and not create a situation where we cause incredible harm by what Republican colleagues are talking about doing.  The first general category is putting insurance companies back in charge by repealing the patient protections. That is what is being talked about: keeping young people, your son or your daughter, on your insurance until age 26. They graduate from college; they probably already have mounds of debt. Letting them get started in the workplace and stay on your insurance has made an incredible difference for hundreds of thousands of young people across the country. That is gone.  Guaranteed access to essential health benefits. I did fight very hard so that we had a benefit package that includes simple things, important things for women, like maternity care. Prior to health care reform, about 70 percent of the insurance policies that were available in the private market--if a woman were to go out and try to find insurance, about 70 percent didn't provide basic maternity care. Now all the policies have to provide maternity care. Policies have to include mental health and addiction services like physical health, so we are saying that if you have an illness above the neck, it ought to be treated the same as an illness below the neck. These are patient protections for all of us.  In health care today, you can't have your services capped. I have seen and spoken with so many doctors who treat cancer in children and adults. Families talk about the fact that in the past there would be a financial cap or a number of visits or a number of treatments as a limit, and if you were done with your treatment and your doctor didn't feel that you received enough treatments, too bad. Your yearly cap is up or the lifetime cap is up. Right now, that is gone. But with the repeal, those caps come back.  Preventive services with no copay. We want folks getting a wellness visit, getting a mammogram, being able to get contraceptive coverage, being able to get preventive cancer screenings. Doing that without a copay has made a tremendous difference in people being able to get the preventive care they need.  There are so many other things that have been put in place for everyone who has insurance. All of that gets ripped away with repeal, and there is no excuse for that. There is no way we are going to allow that to happen without continuing to fight as hard as we can. It is outrageous.  The second thing is cutting Medicare and All of the health care system is tied together. When we made changes in Medicare, we lengthened the solvency of the trust fund--12 more years of solvency in the trust fund, 12 more years of making sure it is solid, financially viable. That goes away.  My colleagues have talked about prescription drugs and the fact that we have closed this gap in coverage. If you have high bills related to the cost of medicine, right now you are covered. When you get to a certain point and there is a complete gap in coverage and you are not covered anymore, and then you are covered again--folks call that the doughnut hole. We are closing that so there is no gap in coverage.  With repeal, the doughnut hole comes back. Coverage is lost. Costs for medicine go up. Preventive services under Medicare are ripped away if we see a repeal. And there is not a replacement that is put in place that is equal[[Page S168]]to or better than what we currently have.  We have so many people who are working for minimum wage, working really hard at minimum wage jobs, who never had the opportunity to have health insurance before, and now they do. That is gone if the whole system is ripped up. Most of Medicaid goes for seniors in nursing homes, long-term care. If you look at the nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has proposed completely rewriting, ripping up Medicare as we know it, as well as health reform and the Affordable Care Act--if you put all that together with this repeal and somebody who wants dramatic changes--I believe it is $1 trillion in cuts proposed by the current chairman of the Budget Committee or the gentleman who now is being proposed for Secretary of Health and Human Services--Medicare and Medicaid are seriously threatened by all that is talked about right now.  We are talking about, in total, kicking 30 million Americans off their insurance. In Michigan, all together, counting Medicaid and those who are purchasing through the new insurance pools, it is over 2 million people. One out of five people in Michigan and their families will lose their access to a doctor and medical care.  What does all of this mean? It means costs are going to go up both for coverage and prescription drugs. And for Republican colleagues who say: Well, we are going to repeal it now, but not really because we are going to say it is repealed and then we are going to wait 2 or 3 years--first of all, Republicans have had 6 years of talking about repeal. It has been over 50 times in the House of You would think within that time they would have been able to come up with a plan, not a bunch of ideas but a plan to show that, in fact, these things aren't going to happen; that they are not going to unravel the health care system; that they have something bigger, better, greater, but that is not what we are hearing. We are hearing: Well, we don't have it yet; we don't know if we are going to have it. We will try to figure it out somehow, and we will wait 2 or 3 years.  What happens in the insurance market when insurance companies don't have predictability? Rates go up. What happens when hospitals--and I have already been told this in Michigan--don't know what is coming? You pull back. You pull back on investments. You pull back on what you are doing in terms of coverage because you don't know what is coming.  This makes no sense whatsoever. I understand politics. I understand slogans. I understand all the rhetoric that has been said for years about repealing health care reform, but this is the most irresponsible thing I have ever seen in my life if there is a repeal with no replacement immediately that at least equals what people have today--the protections, the coverage, the strengthening of Medicare, the lowering of prescription drug prices under Medicare, the help for people who work hard every day on minimum wage and are finding access to a regular doctor instead of using the emergency room, which, by the way, raises health care costs.  The truth is, we all are here because we care deeply about this. If our colleagues want to stop this craziness of running the cow off the cliff and decide that maybe we are going to work on just fixing it together, we are ready, willing, and able to do that. We know, as with any major change in form, that after they work a while, you have to figure things out and you have to fix problems. We are more than willing; we want to do that. We have been offering to do that and suggesting that for the last several years. But this approach is outrageous and completely irresponsible, and, in fact, it will make America sick again.  Let me conclude by just sharing a couple of stories from constituents in I have heard from a lot of people, particularly small business owners, people who have the freedom now to be able to leave their job where they were working only because of the insurance. That has happened to my own family and friends, where folks are in a job that does not work for them but at least they have insurance.  The Affordable Care Act has given the flexibility for someone to step away, to be able to start their own business or their own farm, like Sonia who is a blueberry farmer in She has written me, indicating they are extremely fearful that they are going to lose their insurance under the new administration because of what Republicans are talking about.  She says:       A number of years back in 2000 I quit my traditional job      and my husband, who had been laid off, and I bought my step-     dad's blueberry farm. He had passed away in 1995, and we took      care of my mom who had inherited the farm, and lived with us      for a year and a half until her death. We are full-time      farmers, small farmers, about 15 acres of blueberries. We      also have a small garden center, Sweet Summer Gardens, which      is open from May to September, and a small bead store, the      Enchanted It is open year round.  She says:       We are hard-working people who love the life that we have      carved out for ourselves, but there some drawbacks to being      self-employed and small business owners. In 2012, I tore the      meniscus in my right knee. I did nothing to take care of it      because I did not have insurance. But then in April of 2015,      3 years after the injury, I finally got to the point where I      could no longer take the pain. Luckily, we had signed up for      insurance through the Affordable Care I was able to have      the severe tear repaired.  Then she goes on to talk about how a little later there was a cancer scare, and she had to go in for ultrasounds and lab work and an outpatient D& Because she was able to do that, she was fortunately able to find out it was not cancer, thank goodness. Again, because of the Affordable Care Act and her insurance, she was able to get the services she needed. She goes on to talk about a number of different health challenges for them, including the following:       Finally we have coverage for preventive care. My husband      had a physical, the first time since high school, and we      found out that there was an issue that needed to be      addressed. He was referred to an orthopedic surgeon,      discovered he had severe arthritis. It was causing constant      pain. Again, we were able to have insurance coverage. Because      of the Affordable Care Act, he was able to have this      repaired.  She says:       We are hard-working people. We have never asked for help.      But we are extremely concerned because we could not afford      our insurance right now without the tax credits--the subsidy.  She says:       This morning, watching the news, we were met with a story      that the Republicans are all ready to repeal They      said that while they couldn't take away the insurance, they      could take away the subsidies. This would put insurance out      of our range and we would no longer be able to afford it. My      husband Larry said to me, ``they couldn't just throw us out      to the dogs, could they?''  She says:       My reply was, ``anything is possible.''       I know the Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. I know that      not everyone has taken advantage of it, but there has to be a      way to fix it without hurting the millions of people who have      been helped by it.  In fact, Sonia, there is a way to fix it without hurting you and your husband, full-time farmers and small business owners. I have a number of other stories. I am going to pause because I have other colleagues who I know want to speak who care deeply about this as well. I will share those at a later point.  Let me just say, what we are talking about is not a game. It is not. This is about real people with real lives who are encountering situations that could happen to any of us. Too many people are not in a situation, without Medicare or Medicaid coverage or access to health care through the exchanges, to be able to see the doctor and get the care they need. That has changed in the last number of years.  There is more to do. We can work together to make it even better, but the idea that people are not being helped today, that small business owners and farmers and families are not getting medical care today because of what was done is just not true. It is just not true. The reality is, we are in a better spot with more to do. Pulling the thread and unraveling the entire system and creating chaos in the entire system makes no sense.  So we as Democrats are going to do whatever we can. We know that ultimately the votes are there. If the Republicans in the House and the Senate and the new President want to completely dismantle the health care system, unravel the health care system, weaken Medicare, and weaken Medicaid, you can do it. You have the votes to do it.[[Page S169]]  People right now who get care, the millions of people, the over 2 million people in Michigan alone who have been directly helped by the Affordable Care Act, they know that. They will know when that is no longer available to them. It will hurt many, many people. We hope colleagues will take a second look and decide to work with us in a way to move forward on health care that will allow people to get the care they need at an affordable price for themselves and their families.  I know that is what we all want for our families. We should be doing everything humanly possible to make sure people have the affordable care they need and the protections they need to get care when they need it.  I yield the floor.

6781,topic-id,1090,"Mr.Chair, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, there are several perspectives, important perspectives, to health care and health insurance: one, value deliveredto patients in terms of insurance plan options, choice of doctors, access to treatment, and, most importantly, health outcomes;two, health insurance premiums and healthcare cost sharing; three, budgetary cost to the Federal and State governments; four,supply of healthcare services, including by doctors and hospitals and through medications; and fifth, indirect costs to theeconomy, such as reduced job creation and labor force participation.  The Affordable Care Act fails on all five counts, and that is why we are here today, to start the process of repealing andreplacing it. The program is dysfunctional, and its costs have become and will become more unsustainable.  Supposedly, the central objective for passing the ACA was to insure those who did not have coverage. I was there.  Yet, the increased government sprawl shown in this chart inhealth care is striking.  The Joint Economic Committee chart from the time of the law's passage illustrates the law's mind-numbing complexity.Unsurprising to anyone skeptical of bureaucratic solutions, the Obama healthcare system has not worked.  Instead of empowering innovators, doctors, patients, ObamaCare has implemented a complex scheme that relies on unelectedbureaucrats. And this chart demonstrates that clearly.  Mr.Chair, ObamaCare means fewer choices. In fact, Kimberly, a constituent in my district, recently told me that she had abrain tumor. She said:       Virtually no doctors take the marketplace insurance, so I      am left to changedoctors who I have seen for 30 years and      switch to new doctors who I don't trust and cannot provide      the same healthcare benefitsthat I have received in the past.  Traumatic for her.  Remarkably, the enrollment failure is happening, despite penalties on individuals failing to obtain coverage and onemployers failing to provide it.  Even with billions of dollars in subsidies, in my opinion, this illustrates that many would likely prefer to trade theirsubsidies for more flexibility, the choice of their own doctors, and useful alternatives.  ObamaCare also means higher premiums. Ohioans, on the individual marketplace, have seen increased premiums by 111 percentsince passage of ObamaCare, and now in my State, the average premium is over $5,000.  Republicans agree that the system needs reform, but ObamaCare cannot be reformed. The argument that parts of the Americanhealthcare insurance system were not working previously, and that more people now have health insurance, is irrelevant to thedecision to repeal Nobody claims that the former system was perfect. I certainly don't.  Certainly, the government can increase coverage with subsidies, increase coverage with mandates, but what has it done to theunderlying health care that is being provided?  The extent and method by which ObamaCare increases coverage has caused huge and unnecessary collateral damage to all othersin the marketplace, all others with respect to patient choice of their doctors, the quality of the care that they are receiving,the supply of health care, and, certainly, State and Federal budgets.  The focus of ObamaCare advocates has been almost exclusively on increasing the number of insured by government subsidy andmandate. I get that. I understand that, but not on maximizing healthy outcomes. Those aren't the same things.  Health insurance is not an end in itself. Effective treatment to healthcare problems is.  Private investment is so needed to push forward medical discoveries, innovation, accelerate drug development, personalizemedicine, and harness technology to coordinate our health care and help administrate it.  There is a better way. You will hear from the other side of the aisle that Republicans have no plan to replace ObamaCare.Here are the plans. It is just not true. The goal of the Republican plan is not to go back to the way things were beforeObamaCare; it is to move forward.  We want to facilitate a well-functioning market in health care, and health insurance as well. In the United States, we letthe marketplace work things out. Republicans want to fix those obstacles and make it better.  Among the features of the Better Way is: portability, patient-centered care, insurance across State lines, medical liabilityreform, new mechanisms for small businesses and individuals to power together to negotiate, flexibility for our Governors, apatient-centered, patient-focused program.  The government has a role and a responsibility to provide support for those who can't afford it, for those who fall throughthe cracks. A refundable tax credit is part of our plan, addressing preexisting conditions is part of our plan, and keepingdependents up to 26 on their parents' plan is part of our plan.[[Page H508]]  But the deeper points to recognize are: One, there is no reason why a free market could not offer insurance to individualsthat provides continuous coverage throughout their lives. There is no reason that helping the poor should not limit the choicesand flexibilities of everyone else, which ObamaCare has done, much less interfere with the larger economy.  Moreover, the law has had an impact on employment. I see it every week. Economics Professor Casey Mulligan of the Universityof Chicago estimated that the ACA taxes will affect nearly half of the working population in America, reducing average wages,hours worked, and  And based upon CBO estimates, the overall impact of the ACA on the supply of labor will become progressively worse as timepasses.  ObamaCare took certain problems in healthcare insurance--a large number of uninsured, lack of individual coverage forpreexisting conditions, higher premiums for individuals--and used them as an excuse to create socialized medicine.  The repeal of ObamaCare will take us off that path and replacement will offer shortcomings to other problems.  Going forward, Republicans stand ready to provide support away from ObamaCare through a transition. And getting an improvedhealthcare system in place improves consumer choice.  I understand the anxiety that many are feeling right now listening to the Democrats tell them that health care is going tobe yanked out from under them.  When I was a kid, my dad, a steel worker, lost his job. We lost our health care. We lost our insurance. I know what thatanxiety is like. And I want to assure everyone today, that is not what we are doing here today.  I know what we are doing here today. We are empowering patients. We are empowering doctors, not bureaucrats. We are givingthem more choices, more opportunities, and a better healthcare system.  Mr.Chair, I ask that we support this resolution.  I yield back the balance of my time.

These cost savings have been translated into more accessible and available services for their communities.  The Citizen Potawatomi Nation of Oklahoma's 477 Program has been in place since 1996. Since 2010, the Nation has served well over 6,000 participants through the program. Of those who had employment as their goal, 47 percent achieved unsubsidized employment.  H.288 will build on this success by permanently authorizing the program, increasing the scope and availability of participating Federal grant programs, and setting a streamlined process for tribes to follow.                              {time}  1645  I want to congratulate Chairman Young for his tireless work on this legislation and for bringing together all of the stakeholders to address their concerns and find a workable solution.

6815,topic-id,1443,"Mr.President, yesterday, the Senate approved H.44, a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, CRA, that overturned the Bureau of Land Management's resource management planning rule, commonly referred to as the planning 2.0 rule. I oppose this misguided revocation of a rule that would have allowed greater public involvement in the land-use planning process, increased government transparency, and improved the efficiency in making sustainable multiple use decisions for our public lands.  The BLM is responsible for administering 245 million acres, or over 10 percent of the total area of the United States, and 700 million acres, or 30 percent, of the Nation's mineral estate. The majority of BLM lands are in the 11 western States and  Across the West, the economy has changed significantly in recent decades. From 1990 to 2010, the population in the West grew by 36 percent, and the economy of the West has grown faster than any other region in the country. As new people and new businesses have moved West, demands on public lands for outdoor recreation, hunting, fishing, tourism, conservation, and renewable energy development have been increasing. These demands have the potential to lead to conflicts with uses such as grazing, timber, mining, and oil and gas extraction.  The planning 2.0 rule represented a new approach to addressing increasingly complex challenges on public lands and balancing what are competing uses and, quite frankly, at times competing values for the use of our public lands. Planning 2.0 was the first update of the BLM's planning regulations in 34 years. It included tools to help local land managers respond to these new challenges and the changing needs of western communities.  Under the BLM's 1983 planning regulations, the BLM's planning process has been far too slow. State, local, and tribal governments and the public have been frustrated with the BLM's inability to complete resource management plans that support key infrastructure projects like pipelines, utility corridors, oil and gas leasing areas, and other management designations. It takes an average of 8 years to complete a resource management plan, and the public is provided few opportunities for input. By the time a plan is completed, it is almost already out of date. Since public involvement doesn't occur until nearly the end of the planning process, new information provided near the end can require revision and cause further delay. Litigation also can stall the process and add significantly more time and costs.  Nullifying planning 2.0 through CRA disapproval permanently forces the BLM to use a planning process that wastes taxpayer money and is inefficient at best.  Planning 2.0 provided earlier and more frequent opportunities for public involvement as part of the new planning assessment step. By inviting State, local, and tribal governments and the public to share information and participate in developing alternatives before the draft resource management plan could be published, planning 2.0 made it possible to discover the issues and potential conflicts and work out solutions before huge investments of time and labor were expended. Early involvement and collaboration with the public and all stakeholders made the planning process more efficient and effective.  Under planning 2.0, the formal planning process remained largely unchanged: a draft environmental impact statement and a draft plan were still required, but with an expanded public comment period, from 90 days to 100 days. Draft plan amendments are often less complex, and so the minimum comment period was reduced from 90 days to 60 days. The rule provided opportunities to extend any comment period as necessary.[[Page S1687]]  Planning 2.0 preserved and enhanced partnerships with State, local, and tribal governments in the planning process. The rule maintained the coordination and consistency requirements, and it recognized the special roles of State, local, and tribal governments, affording opportunities to participate side-by-side with the BLM as cooperating agencies. The final planning 2.0 rule took meaningful steps to accommodate requests from States and local governments to improve the planning process and to ensure governors were able to raise concerns and fully engage in the planning process, as required by the Federal Lands Policy and Management  As vice chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I closely review Federal actions that affect native people and Indian Under planning 2.0, the right of federally recognized tribes to government-to-government consultation was clearly enumerated and protected. The BLM worked extensively to make sure the new planning process was more inclusive. Planning 2.0 recognized the value of the knowledge, history, and culture that tribes bring to the planning effort. By formalizing the tribal consultation role and providing early and more frequent opportunities for tribes to provide input, the BLM had taken an important step to ensure Indian Country was able to be fully engaged in the process. Repealing planning 2.0 through the CRA now risks ignoring the concerns of tribes in favor of commercial interests and their lobbyists in Washington,  Pressures on BLM lands have increased in scale and complexity, and planning 2.0 encouraged the collection and use of high-quality data. It encouraged flexibility to identify a planning area boundary that reflects the resource issues. By looking at larger landscapes, local offices could have collaborated where there are shared resource issues and could have reduced conflicts and litigation for large-scale projects. Planning 2.0 would have enabled the BLM to set clear goals and allowed local offices to work together on landscape-wide planning where resource issues span multiple administrative jurisdictions.  The rule identified important corridors for wildlife and critical habitats early in the planning process so that those important areas could be managed and conserved in balance with other uses and development decisions. Working across boundaries is especially important to tackle wildfire prevention and eradication of invasive species, which are degrading our public lands and placing neighboring private lands at risk of harm. Efficient and collaborative planning is desperately needed to approve infrastructure projects, pipelines, and energy transmission corridors that are stalled under the current planning process. Eliminating planning 2.0 reinstates a cumbersome and inefficient planning process that increases burdens on industries and the public.  Opponents of the planning 2.0 rule mischaracterized the rule as a last minute ``midnight rule'' that excluded public comment. This is simply not true. The planning 2.0 initiative went through a transparent rulemaking process over 2 and a half years. The BLM responded to over 3,000 public comments on the draft rule and made critical changes in the final rule. Congress held two hearings on planning 2.0, and the BLM incorporated that information before publishing the final rule. The BLM conducted extensive public outreach through public meetings, webinars, an extended public comment period, and input from a broad spectrum of the public that resulted in significant revisions to the final rule.  However, the CRA resolution disapproving planning 2.0 was accomplished without public hearings and without transparency. Management of our public lands will now revert back to a process that gives commercial interest greater power and the public less opportunity for meaningful involvement.  Opponents of planning 2.0 expressed concern that emphasizing landscape-scale planning could result in the primacy of national objectives over State and local objectives. This is not true. Planning 2.0 did not centralize decisionmaking in Washington, DC, or dilute local control of the planning process. The rule actually allowed for more local community involvement and preserved the priority status for local governments and states in land use planning. Increasing the opportunity for public voices helped develop plans that met the increasingly diverse needs of western communities. Further, the rule did not require all resource management plans to be multistate landscapes. The rule provided the process for planning at larger landscape-scales when it made sense given the resources involved.  The use of the Congressional Review Act to revoke planning 2.0 is a reckless tactic. Specific concerns could and should have been addressed through the regular rulemaking process or targeted legislation by Congress instead. Under the CRA, once Congress passes a resolution of disapproval, the BLM is prohibited from writing a new rule that is ``substantially the same'' without additional legislative action. As a result, many of the provisions of planning 2.0 that improved the planning process cannot be enacted or proposed again without express congressional approval.  Secretary Zinke has now been confirmed and should have been given the opportunity to consider revising planning 2.0 and making any necessary changes. With passage of H.44, Secretary Zinke will face considerable legal uncertainty, and his authority to reformulate a new planning rule will be limited substantially. This resolution should have been rejected and the new administration given the opportunity to reformulate planning 2.0 and to make sure the public continued to have a voice in decisions that affect their way of life.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1686-3.txt,1567,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCALYEAR 2017,2017.0,8.0,January

This is about theyoung person just out of college who can stay on their parents' insurance until they turn 26, giving them time to secureemployment and coverage on their own.

I would like to remind my colleague that her vote today to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in 266,000 people fromher State of Tennessee losing their healthcare coverage, 57,000 workers losing their jobs, and an economic loss of $34.2 billionin gross State product for the State of Tennessee over 5 years.  The so-called budget before us was drafted by Republicans for the sole purpose of repealing the Affordable Care Act anddefunding Planned Parenthood by a simple majority in the It squanders the opportunity to start this new Congress workingtogether to address the concerns and priorities of the American people in a constructive and bipartisan manner.  The Affordable Care Act is making an incredible difference across my home State of Kentucky, as in many other places. Withour expansion of Medicaid and the success of our State marketplace, Kynect, more than half a million Kentuckians in a State of 4million have gained quality, affordable coverage. In Louisville alone, the uninsured rate dropped 81 percent.  In a State with tremendous health needs, we are a national model of ACA success. Even our Republican Senator, RandPaul, and our Republican Governor, Matt Bevin, who are vehemently opposed to the law, know we can't go back to where we werebefore the They now acknowledge that Republicans in Congress should not repeal the Affordable Care Act without immediatelyreplacing it.  Much of the debate about the ACA focuses on the 20 million newly insured individuals, but the law has done much more thanthat. Millions of seniors on Medicare have saved on prescription drug coverage. For people on their employer's plan, out-of-pocket costs are capped, and lifetime limits are gone. If you are one of the 129 million Americans with a preexisting condition,you currently have the peace of mind of knowing that you can always get coverage if you lose your job, change your job, or startyour own business.  Let me tell you about Steve Riggert, my constituent who recently wrote to me. When Steve's daughter Anna was 12, she wasdiagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, a rare disease for a child. This is Over the next 3 years, she was hospitalized 15times. Despite their best efforts and prayers, transplant surgery did not achieve success. She has struggled with diabetes andcomplications. At age 22, she has been hospitalized 26 times for various reasons.  From the beginning, Steve knew that Anna's preexisting condition would make getting medical coverage difficult. So far, hehas been able to cover her medical bills through his employer plan. When the ACA was passed, he was immensely relieved that Annacould always get coverage even though she has had a serious preexisting medical condition.  But the Republican plan to repeal the ACA has now left Steve feeling--and these are his words--helpless, petrified, and,literally, losing sleep. At age 64 and recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, he fears for how much he can support her. Toquote his letter: ``Repeal of all aspects of the Affordable Care Act would place everything I have worked for and those I careabout in jeopardy.''  Mr.Chairman, I am here today to fight for Steve, for Anna, and for all the Americans across the country who are begging younot to take away their health care. Repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement will cause chaos. Nearly 30 millionpeople would lose coverage, including more than 4 million kids. Any consumers left in the individual market are likely to facehigher premiums and fewer choices as insurers exit the system.  It has been nearly 7 years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, and Republicans still do not have a viableplan to replace it, period. Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers said this week that the Republicanreplacement plan will guarantee ``no one who has coverage today because of ObamaCare will lose that coverage.''  We are waiting for that plan because none of the bills Republicans will wave from that podium today meet that standard orhas the support of the majority of their Democrats offered a number of amendments to this budget to protect the ACAand make it reflect the priorities of American families. We owe the millions of people who are deeply concerned about thisprocess nothing less. Unfortunately, Republicans refuse to allow a vote on a single one.  Putting American families and our Nation's healthcare system at risk is irresponsible. I, therefore, urge my colleagues tooppose the Republican budget. The American people deserve better.

We want the best quality of care available to the most people atthe lowest price. That is what every American wants. That is what Republicans and Democrats alike want.  We have put our plan to do that on the table. We recognize that there are ways it could be improved. But the idea that thereis a plan competing on the other side is just hilarious.                              {time}  1330  Last night, I testified at the Rules Committee before Chairman Chairman Sessions introduced a bill lastyear. He had one cosponsor. That gentleman is no longer in the House, so he has no cosponsors as of now. His plan is called theWorld's Greatest Healthcare I like the name, but I don't know how that relates to any of those other plans. I know thatprobably some of the elements are similar.  This is the problem with the exercise we are going through. We are heading down a road with no final determination ordestination. We are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, eliminating all the protections that we have provided for 300million Americans--expanded coverage, expanded guarantees, benefits, and quality--and we don't know what the alternative is.  Waiving around a bunch of papers does not mean there is a plan. It does not mean that the Republicans can say to theAmerican public: ``Here is what your health care is going to look like when we get finished with our repeal and replace.'' Theyjust can't do that.  That is why only 18 percent of the American people, according to a Kaiser survey, want this course of action, want a repealwithout a replacement.  All I have to say is, if we go down this path, we won't have repeal and replace. What we will have is repeal and repentbecause we are going to owe a huge apology to the American people for the damage that we have caused.  I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution.

6790,topic-id,275,"Mr.Chairman, the Republican rush to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, to take health insurance from 30million Americans, introduce chaos into the health insurance market, and give millionaires and billionaires a giant tax cut ismisguided and does not reflect the values of the American people. On top of that, it can significantly damage our economy.  Repeal will upend our Nation's healthcare system. Hospitals will see a spike in uncompensated care, leading to reducedservices, job cuts, or higher prices for every one. It will cost the Nation 2.6 million jobs in 2019 alone, including 44,000jobs in The hit to the economy will be in the trillions of dollars, and it will give corporations and the wealthyhundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts.  Repeal isn't about what is best for the American people. It is solely about politics and what is in the financial interestof the well-off and the well-connected. There is absolutely no logic to this.  That said, if Republicans are determined to rush something through Congress right now using the budget process, we wouldsuggest a totally different approach. Let's look at areas where this Congress and this incoming administration can work togetherto address a pressing challenge facing the country.  Members of both parties and the President-elect have expressed support for repairing our Nation's failing infrastructure,investing in our roads, bridges, ports, and other transportation needs to create jobs and build a stronger economic future. Thesubstitute I have offered today provides the budget procedures needed for such a bill to be considered.  Mr.Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this alternative budget so we can move our Nation forward together.  I reserve the balance of my time.

6797,topic-id,302,"Mr.Chairman, as I said in my closing to the debate on the resolution itself, it would be wonderful if theRepublicans had a plan that they could describe to the American people so that American families would know what would be intheir healthcare future. It would also be nice if they would wait to repeal the Affordable Care Act until they could do that. Ithink the American people expect it. The poll I mentioned from Kaiser, 82 percent of the people preferred to go in thatdirection. Let's find out if there is a better way.  I have said many times in public the reason there has been no Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act is becausethere really are only two alternatives: one is to go back to the era in which insurance companies decided who lived and died,and the other one is to go to single payer, something like Medicare for everyone. I would love to discuss that option. I thinkit would be immensely popular in this country. But, instead, Republicans come up with ideas that are drifting in the otherdirection, again, back to not patient-centered care but back to insurance company-centered care.  The important thing today is that we have an alternative here through which we can actually do something constructive forthe American people, something that will help the economy, something that will make vital investments in our Nation and thefuture economy instead of putting the country's healthcare system at risk. That is what this amendment does. That is why Iintroduced it, and that is why I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.Yarmuth).  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
