        HONORING THE LIFE OF CHICAGO POLICE COMMANDER PAUL BAUER

  (Mr. LIPINSKI asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the passing of 
Chicago Police Commander Paul Bauer, who was shot and killed in the 
line of duty yesterday. This is a terrible tragedy for the Chicago 
Police Department, our city, and, most of all, Paul's wife and young 
daughter.
  Paul Bauer graduated 2 years ahead of me at Saint Ignatius and joined 
the police department soon after, when he was just 21 years old. He 
rose through the ranks over 32 years to lead the mounted horse unit 
and, later, became commander of the Near North District.
  A member of Nativity Parish in Bridgeport, Paul is being remembered 
as a loving father and husband, someone who knew the value of community 
policing and giving back, and for leading efforts to raise funds for 
the Chicago Police Memorial Fund.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in mourning the passing 
of Commander Paul Bauer. Please pray for him, his family, and for our 
city.
  Please remember to take a moment to thank the police and other first 
responders that you encounter every day. We owe them so much.
