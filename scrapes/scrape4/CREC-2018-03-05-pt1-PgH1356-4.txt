      THE RUSSIAN BEAR IS HUNGRY FOR MOLDOVA, GEORGIA, AND UKRAINE

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, after the fall of the Soviet Union, 
the Russian bear started roaming Eastern Europe with its hungry 
appetite to gobble and dominate politics and the Governments of 
Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine.
  Each nation has had a portion of its sovereign territory occupied by 
the Napoleon of Siberia, Putin. His military is there, too.
  I have been in each nation and talked to the speakers of each of the 
parliaments. Now the three countries are working together in a 
trilateral bond to thwart Russian interference and also improve their 
democratic processes.
  For as it is written in Ecclesiastes: ``A cord of three strands is 
not easily broken.''
  I also commend the Atlantic Council for their work with these nations 
in promoting democratic ideals, combating corruption, and increasing 
personal freedom.
  The United States should encourage and support this trilateral union 
to prevent the hungry bear from eating up each nation and returning 
them to the old days of Russian oppression.
  And that is just the way it is.
