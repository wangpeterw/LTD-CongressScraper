                          personal explanation

  Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, on October 2nd, on rollcall votes 544 and 
545, I was not present because I was tending to my community in Las 
Vegas, in the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in United States 
history. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall 
vote 544 and ``yea'' on rollcall vote 545.
