                         CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Trump 
administration rolled back contraceptive care for hundreds of thousands 
of women. They called it a victory for religious liberty. But let's be 
real. This is just one part of the White House's fight to strip women 
of their independence and healthcare.
  First, they came for title X, scaling back the essential family 
planning centers that served low-income women. They attacked Planned 
Parenthood, pledging to block access for the millions of women who 
depend on it. They expanded the global gag rule, a policy that will 
limit the preventative healthcare options for women across the world.
  Then, they turned their destructive sights on title IX, scaling back 
crucial guidances that protect sexual assault victims on our college 
campuses.
  Now, they have opened the door for bosses to deny contraceptive 
coverage for their female employees.
  Let's not pretend this is a victory for religious freedom. This is 
about taking away women's choices.
