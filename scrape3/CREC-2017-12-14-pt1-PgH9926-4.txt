                  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM

  (Mr. YOUNG of Iowa asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues 
in Congress to quickly pass a 5-year extension of the Children's Health 
Insurance Program.
  In Iowa, around 85,000 children rely on CHIP for their health. This 
is very important to so many families in our Third District. I am 
grateful a short-term solution was included as part of the continuing 
resolution passed last week; however, we must do more.
  On November 3, the House passed legislation to extend funding for 
CHIP for 5 years, with the support of every Iowa Representative. 
However, since that time, we have been waiting for our colleagues in 
the Senate to act. They need to act now.
  We must work together to fund this critical program which has 
bipartisan support and bicameral support. The health of our children is 
at stake. Children in low- and middle-income families will be those hit 
the hardest if we do not fully fund CHIP. With Iowa families left 
without coverage and access to needed medical services for their 
children, we must act.
  I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to include an extension 
of CHIP in the important bills we will be considering in the weeks 
ahead, because families shouldn't be worrying about losing coverage for 
their children.
  As Congress continues to work on the many important issues facing our 
country, I know I, and other colleagues, will continue to support this.
