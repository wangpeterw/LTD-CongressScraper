The cost is just too high for  We have heard about Medicaid expansion here today. That is a second-class insurance for first-class people. I can't get my patients to see a specialist.

It repeals the mandates and restores freedom to individuals and markets.  It repeals about $1 trillion of taxes. It reduces deficit spending by over $100 billion, making it the largest entitlement reform since the 1960s. It rolls back regulations, gives maximum flexibility to States, and begins to defederalize health care.  For 7 years now, Republicans have promised the American people that if we were given control of the Presidency and the House and the Senate, then we would repeal and replace And now that we are given the opportunity to govern and to keep our promises and to deliver results for the American people, we can't let perfect be the enemy of good.  The debate is now closing. We have two choices. We either pass a good but imperfect bill, or we leave ObamaCare in place. That is an unacceptable alternative.  As leaders, we have a moral obligation to do something, to not stand idly by while the people suffer under a system that is failing them.  If we are going to restore the greatness of America and transfer power back to the people, we need more than policy solutions, even perfect policy solutions. We need the political will and the courage to lead.  This is a rescue mission, Mr.Speaker, and it isn't without risk; but I have faith in the President and his team. I have faith in our States and the free markets, and, above all, Mr.Speaker, I have faith in the American people.

5392,topic-id,500,"Mr.President, instead of focusing on bipartisan reforms to improve access to healthcare for the American people, Republicans are again pursuing divisive policies that jeopardize women's health and put politics, politicians, and the government between a woman and her doctor. This measure that we are debating this afternoon attacks a critical healthcare program known as the Title X Family Planning  The Title X Family Planning Program provides basic healthcare, like cancer screenings, contraception, and HIV testing to more than 4 million women and men. This politically motivated provision that we have before us today would allow States to discriminate against trusted health providers like Planned In eight counties in Wisconsin, Planned Parenthood is the only health clinic that provides the full range of publicly funded contraceptive services.  I met with Laurie from Bristol, WI, who told me that as a young teacher, she went to Planned Parenthood and they discovered that she had cysts and tumors in her ovaries. The providers immediately helped her get the care she needed. She had quick surgery and was able to recover, which allowed her to eventually have a family.  Republicans are playing doctor and telling women they can't access basic primary and preventive healthcare services at the health center of their choice. This would cut off access to care for millions of men and women, prohibiting access to high-quality, preventive services just because of the sign on the door. They would prevent women like Laurie from accessing lifesaving services when they need it the most.  We have already seen too many States enact record numbers of laws and regulations that restrict a woman's access to reproductive health services and the freedom to make her own healthcare decisions. In my home State of Wisconsin, our Republican Governor has signed a number of laws that target healthcare providers and simply have left far too many Wisconsin women out in the cold. He signed a law that forces women to undergo unnecessary and invasive medical procedures, and he has imposed unreasonable requirements on the doctors that deliver care to women. He has worked to close health clinics, including several Planned Parenthood clinics. But he hasn't stopped there. He also signed two laws that would effectively defund Wisconsin Planned Parenthood, which could leave thousands of Wisconsinites without access to critical health services.  The threat in Wisconsin and in States across the country--and right here in Congress--is clear: Politicians across the country are playing doctor, and this is a dangerous game for women and their families. The millions of Americans who rely on title X for primary care and their trusted providers are being held hostage. They are being used as a political punching bag by congressional Their agenda is to attack women's health.  Women's access to comprehensive healthcare--the healthcare they need and deserve--should never depend upon their ZIP So I urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous measure and to protect title X programs for all of our families.

I think it is unconstitutional and unBut what I saw there was startling.  I want to tell you the story of Fatema is a legal permanent resident. She got a notice in the mail that she was about to be sworn in to become a U.citizen on February 13. She was traveling with her 1-year-old son who is an American citizen. She was the victim and was being detained. Reports from lawyers on the ground were that she was being pressured to sign away her right to be a legal permanent resident right after they had sent somebody back, a student, who had a visa to be here.                              {time}  1715  I was there, along with one of my colleagues, Judy Chu, fighting, trying to get to the detainee to make sure that she had access to an attorney. I asked to go to CBC, the Customs and Border Conveniently, they were shut down. They had closed the office.  So I asked somebody: Can you walk me down to the arrivals so I could talk to somebody?  They wouldn't do it. I got a telephone number. I called. None of my questions were answered. They wouldn't answer a single question: Were any of my constituents being detained? Could I get a lawyer to somebody?  They wouldn't even say yes or no. All I was told was I had to call this Washington, D.C., number--a 202 number. Now, it was Saturday night. It was 7 p.m. on the Pacific  I called. I left a message, asking for a return call. I didn't get one. I demanded, with my colleague, that we get a briefing privately, behind closed doors, outside the press. We didn't get one.  As a matter of fact, when I called back, I asked: Who is your manager? Who are you answering to?  She said: The  You have talked to Donald Trump?  It was really disturbing. And then she hung up on me--and I am a Member of the United States I couldn't get any answers to try to protect the very constituents that we fight for, the constituents whom we represent. It was very disturbing.  These immigration orders are unsettling, but they are also a disservice to the Customs and Border Protection when you don't give a heads-up, when you don't have a warning on how things are going to be carried out. This led to mass confusion not just at LAX, but at airports across the country.  I hear often that this affected just a small number of travelers, but it affected a lot more than that. We saw the[[Page H925]]masses of people coming out. We saw lawyers who had to go down there and give their time. A shout-out to the ACLU and to the attorneys at public counsel and to so many other attorneys who went down there and gave their evenings, their time, and who have been standing up and fighting for people in court to get people to come back.  Just today, at Los Angeles International Airport, there was a press conference held to welcome back the one person who was allowed to come back--an Iranian citizen who was deported and sent back, who was forcibly removed on Friday night even though he had a legal right to be here. Hopefully we are going to hear more of these stories, but it shouldn't be that way. People should not show up at the airport and get on a flight in a country in which they have a right to be just to have to turn around and be sent back after being detained for hours on end. This isn't right.  As a Member of Congress, I will work to ensure that the Federal Government obeys the Constitution, respects our history as a nation of immigrants, and does not unlawfully target anyone because of one's national origin or faith.

As he knows, I had some concerns about the bill at the time. I didn't think it addressed all the problems that we needed to address.  At the start of this week, I was a ``no'' vote--a friendly ``no'' vote, but I was a ``no'' vote. Our Republican leadership in the House and the President and his senior advisers continued to involve themselves in constructive discussions with people like myself. Yesterday they agreed to put back in the repeal of the essential health benefits provision, and that is a big win for conservative values, so I am now a ``yes'' vote.  My friends on the left seem to think the only way to get a benefit is to have the Federal Government mandate it and then have the Federal Government pay for it. I am here to tell you, Mr.Speaker, that markets work.

5394,topic-id,686,"Mr.President, I am pleased to be here with the Senator from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the ranking member of the HELP Committee to address this important issue.  You would think that after the healthcare debacle last week, the other side would have gotten the message, which is that the American people didn't send us to Washington to take away their healthcare.  When I think about healthcare in Colorado, I think about sort of a circle that contains healthcare that people in my State are either getting or not getting, and some part of that is ObamaCare, that is for sure, but a lot of it has nothing to do with that. They are unhappy with the way our healthcare system works. They want more access than they have. The House bill went at this in exactly the wrong direction from where they are interested in going.  I would like to work with Republicans and Democrats to solve that, but this afternoon we are here once again because the resolution before us would risk funding for vital primary care, preventive and family planning services for more than 4 million Americans across our country, especially women and those who live in rural communities of my State and other  Since 1970, this body has supported title X funding to expand access to affordable healthcare for low-income men and women. We did that because we understood that it wasn't just the right thing to do, we recognized that it was a good investment. Each dollar invested in publicly funded family planning programs saves the government over $7 in Medicaid-related costs.  The other side rails against Medicaid spending. In fact, last week, they had a bill that cut it by about $850 billion. But if they succeed on this vote today, Medicaid spending will almost certainly rise as a result of what they are trying to do.  We supported title X funding with both Republican majorities and Democratic majorities in the Now a narrow majority is trying to ram this measure through.  This isn't supported by a consensus of Americans, and you know it is not when Vice President Pence has to drive over here from the White House to cast a tie-breaking vote. Just yesterday, the Vice President was at a White House forum on women's empowerment. It begs the question: Did he learn anything at the forum?  It is easy for Senators, apparently, to vote against healthcare for struggling I wonder sometimes whether the reason for that is that we are not affected by this vote. That is doubly true when 50 Senators--overwhelmingly men--vote to cut healthcare for millions of low-income women.  The vote today has real consequences for If this measure passes, it will threaten to cut funding for title X health centers serving over 52,000 men, women, and teens each year. It will also risk funding for the over 20 Planned Parenthood clinics throughout Colorado that provide healthcare services to more than 86,000 men, women, and teens. Planned Parenthood is a critical part of Colorado's healthcare system, providing essential services in a quarter of the State's counties. This support is especially vital for our rural areas. Two weeks ago, I visited Alamosa and Durango, CO, where these health centers are some of the only places women can turn to for preventive care and family planning services.  We should not do this. Pediatricians are against it. Family physicians are against it. Nurses are against it. But on the other side, we have a narrow majority voting to strip funding for vital primary and preventive care, including breast cancer screenings and HIV testing.  I would invite anyone voting against this measure, including the Vice President, to come to Alamosa and Durango and see what these health centers are doing in our communities.

5459,topic-id,1022,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today to speak in favor of the American Health Care Act, a bill that repeals many of the worst aspects of ObamaCare, and begins to repair the damage caused by the law by bringing choice, competition, and patient-centered solutions back into our healthcare system.  Standing here today in the House debating this bill is a proud moment for me. I was working as a nurse in Nashville in the 1990s when, fresh off of the failure of HillaryCare, the Clinton administration pushed out a single-payer pilot program in Tennessee called  As the story goes, Vice President Gore and the Democratic Governor sketched out a program on a napkin while sitting in a local bar. I saw firsthand the negative impact of government-run health care on patient care. I saw the costs rise, and the quality of care fall. I saw the burdens being placed on doctors, patients, hospitals, and care providers. I saw patients faced with fewer choices and more regulation. And I saw the devastating impact that TennCare was having on our State's budget, gobbling up so much State spending that other priorities like education and infrastructure were getting squeezed.  I couldn't sit idly by while this was happening in my State, so I decided to get involved in public service, and it is what inspired me to run for office at the very beginning. And when, in 2009 and 2010, I saw the same principles being debated and eventually implemented on the national level, I thought my experience in Tennessee would be valuable to the national debate. I told the people in my district that, if elected to Congress, I would fight to repeal and replace  In 2011, I sponsored the first piece of legislation that repealed a part of And today, we take the largest step yet in rescuing the American people from the damage that has been done by  We are united in our goal to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with patient-centered health care. Right now, ObamaCare is imploding. We were promised premiums that would decrease by $2,500; instead, average family premiums in the employer market have soared by $4,300.  We were promised healthcare costs would go down; instead, deductibles have skyrocketed.[[Page H2406]]  We were promised we could keep our doctor, and keep our health insurance plans; instead, millions of Americans have lost their insurance and the doctors that they liked.  In short, the Affordable Care Act was neither affordable, nor did it provide the quality of care that the American people deserve.  The American Health Care Act is a first step in our efforts to deliver patient-centered healthcare reform. This bill returns to the American people freedom and choice in their healthcare decisions. It gets government out of the relationship between patients and their doctors--where it has never belonged--and puts people back in charge of their own health care. It brings the free market principle of competition to an industry that has long been dominated by government intervention.  Today we are faced with a stark choice: Do we vote to continue the damage ObamaCare is doing to our country and our constituents, or do we vote to go down another path, a better way of doing health care in this country?  While no legislation is perfect, this bill does accomplish some important reforms. It zeros out the mandates. It repeals taxes. It repeals the subsidies. It allows people to choose health insurance plans that are unique to their families, instead of purchasing a one-size-fits-all plan that is mandated by some Washington bureaucrat, and it modernizes Medicaid, a once-in-a-lifetime entitlement reform.  Ending Medicaid's open-ended funding structure will play an important role in addressing the future budget deficits and our growing national debt. I applaud my colleagues who have stayed in this fight and continue to make this bill better.  The members of the Budget Committee, which I chair, outlined four principles they believed would improve the bill. Those principles led to significant changes to allow more State flexibility in Medicaid and ensure that tax credits truly served the people they are meant to serve.  Others fought to eliminate Federal ObamaCare regulations that drive up the cost of health care for all Americans and give those powers back to the At the same time, we also ensure that States have the resources to provide maternity and newborn care and treatment for mental health and substance abuse.  I agree with these changes, and I applaud my colleagues for the work to make sure that we truly reverse the damage ObamaCare is doing to our healthcare system and our economy.  ObamaCare's legacy is clear: more government, less choice, and higher costs. Our vision for health care in America is the opposite: more freedom, more choice, and lower costs. Put simply, the American Health Care Act is a good first step, but it is only a first step.  My good friend and our former colleague, Tom Price, will use his position as Secretary of Health and Human Services to address some of the regulatory burden of ObamaCare through administrative action. We have voted already and will continue to vote on individual pieces of legislation to implement even more patient-centered, free market reforms that we cannot address through reconciliation.  In fact, we just passed two bills already this week. One would allow small businesses to join together to purchase insurance, and the other would increase competition by tearing down antitrust regulations. That bill received 416 votes. This shows that these bills are commonsense measures that include bipartisan support.  The day is finally here where we have an opportunity to fulfill that promise that we have made to the American people. I, for one, cannot sit idly by and let this opportunity go to waste. Campaigning is easy compared to governing, but our constituents did not elect us to do what is easy. They elected us to do what is right.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on the American Health Care Act, to rescue the American people from  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

5461,topic-id,337,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.McClintock).  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I remind the gentleman from Kentucky that every promise made to the American people in support of ObamaCare was rapidly broken. We are now, at this moment in time, watching the death throes of  More people are paying the State tax penalty or claiming hardship exemptions than are buying ObamaCare policies. In a third of our counties, there is no choice left at all. You get one provider. Soon, we are warned, some regions will have no providers at all. Premiums soared an average of 25 percent last year, and this year we are warned it could be 40 percent or more.  Critics cite the CBO estimate that 24 million Americans will lose their coverage. It is important to understand their reasoning there. The CBO believes that people won't buy health insurance unless we force them to buy health insurance. In fact, people won't buy health insurance that is not a good value for them, and, clearly, ObamaCare isn't.  We replace it with a vigorous buyer's market where plans across the country will compete to offer consumers better services at lower prices tailored to their own needs and wants. And we assure these plans are within their financial reach with $90 billion of additional support that the CBO simply ignores.  The AHCA's biggest achievement is to replace coercion with choice for every It ends the individual mandate that forces Americans to buy products they don't want. It ends the employer mandate that has trapped many low-income workers in part-time jobs. It begins to restore consumers' freedom of choice, the best guarantee of quality and value in any market. It allows Americans to meet more of their healthcare needs with pretax dollars. It relieves the premium base of the enormous cost of preexisting conditions by moving them to a block-granted assigned risk pool.  Mr.Speaker, ObamaCare is collapsing, premiums are skyrocketing, and providers are fleeing. This may well be our last off-ramp on this road to ruin.

5485,topic-id,420,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to recognize that our Members on the other side of the aisle are sharing some data on the coverage of per congressional district based on a study that was conducted by the Center for American Progress, which is a left-leaning organization to begin with. The Center for American Progress employs a flawed methodology for estimating this coverage. In[[Page H2411]]fact, their foundational numbers are actually based on CBO's coverage estimates, estimates that the CBO itself has established are not infallible.  These coverage numbers only take into account plans that they consider comprehensive major medical policies. This is a term that is used in the very law that we are trying to dismantle today. These coverage estimates do not account for things that we have in our bill, such as HSA plans that allow purchase with tax credits, and many medical plans.  So the AHCA increases freedom for Americans to purchase the kind of coverage that works for them, not the narrowly defined coverage that we see that the Federal Government likes.  Mr.Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.McClintock), who is a member of our committee.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I simply want to underscore what the chairwoman has already laid out.  When my friend from Kentucky says that his constituents will lose coverage, he is basing it on two premises. He is ignoring the $90 billion of additional funds that we freed up in the Budget Committee to assure that nobody will face sticker shock as we make this transition.  Second, he assumes that the only reason that people buy insurance is if we force them to buy it. The reality is many are refusing to buy ObamaCare policies even when they are faced with these crushing tax policies. The AHCA replaces this heavyhanded and failing bureaucratic nightmare.  Ultimately, we are going to be judged not on polls or fairy tales, but on whether the vast majority of Americans have a better experience with this new consumer-driven market than they had with the bureaucratized, one-size-fits-all ObamaCare system. That system has already been weighed in the balance and found wanting by the American people, and I am here to stake my reputation on the prediction that they will find better policies with better services at lower costs when they are restored the freedom to be consumers in a marketplace with a supportive tax structure that assures that these policies are within the financial reach of every American family.

Mr.Speaker, I want to remind my fellow colleagues that, currently, when we look at the access to care for people, one-third of our counties only have one provider; two-thirds of our counties only have two providers. In my State of Tennessee, there are 14 counties where they will have no insurance provider on the marketplace. So when we talk about people losing their insurance, they are losing their insurance by not having access to even purchase the insurance.  One of my former colleagues, the gentleman from Minnesota, asked: What are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle trying to preserve?  I want to point to this chart here to ask that question, because these are the broken promises of  Why are you trying to preserve something where they say premiums will decrease by $2,500, and we see the average family premiums have soared by $4,300, making insurance unaffordable for many families?  Another broken promise: the cost of health care will go down.  We see some deductibles that have gone up as much as 60 percent. In my own State, they have gone up by 63 percent, making coverage unaffordable.  You can keep your doctor--70 percent of the plans consist of narrow networks, which means they cannot keep their doctor. I cannot tell you the number of people who have called me because their doctor was not on their inept plan.  Finally, ``middle class Americans won't see a tax increase.'' This was a promise by former President ObamaCare penalties were put in place, so people are receiving a tax penalty.

5359,topic-id,1352,"Mr.President, I rise today in a near empty Indeed, there is no Republican colleague here today. Our Republican colleagues have yielded back all their time on this resolution, and the reason they have yielded back all their time is that they apparently have no interest in appearing here and talking about a resolution of disapproval of a rule that is vital to ensuring that women have access to the family planning provider of their choice. It is really that simple.  Defending Planned Parenthood is what we have done on this side. Defunding Planned Parenthood has been the interest on the other side of the aisle.  They have also taken an inordinate interest in reinstating gender ratings in health insurance and are now damaging title X networks through this resolution. They have demonstrated an unmitigated desire to cut women's access to healthcare in order, apparently, to win political points. But their actions today show that the politics of this issue and, most importantly, the people of America are not on their side.  Title X is a critical program delivering important family planning and preventive health services in underserved areas of our great In 2015 alone, title X programs provided basic primary and preventive healthcare services. We are talking about Pap tests, breast exams, birth control, and HIV testing for more than 4 million low-income women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers across the country. For 40 percent of women, their visit to a family planning health center is the only healthcare they receive annually. Think of that number for a moment. Forty percent of those women have no access elsewhere except at these healthcare centers.  By overriding this regulation, Republicans will allow States and title X grantees to pick and choose who provides these services based on arbitrary criteria that have nothing to do with the quality of services patients will receive. It is no wonder that none of them is here to talk about it. Now, if they were here--and they have said so in public--they might argue that they support this resolution because they oppose abortion. So let me be clear. This regulation is about access to family planning services, not about access to abortion.  I know many of my colleagues disagree with me that abortion should be safe and legal. They have shown that disagreement by their repeated attempts to undermine Roe v. Wade and make it harder for women to access constitutionally protected healthcare.  While they may disagree, it is still the law of the land. In any event, this regulation is not about access to abortion. This regulation is about ensuring that States cannot discriminate against qualified providers that are an essential part of a safety net that serves women who have no place else to go. Those providers are willing to provide necessary, culturally sensitive care to individuals who otherwise would simply be without access to that care.  Title X funding does not go to abortion services. It goes to provide much needed family planning services. There is so much that the title X program does that I believe my colleagues would agree is absolutely vital to the health of women. I know we agree on wanting to reduce teen and unintended pregnancies. Without the contraceptive care provided by title X sites, the teen pregnancy rate would be 30 percent higher and the unintended pregnancy rate would have been 33 percent higher. We should agree on that point.  We should also agree on wanting to find ways to save money in the healthcare system. In 2010, health services provided at title X centers resulted in net savings of $7 billion in Federal and State funds. Those savings are indicative of the fact that every dollar invested in publicly funded family planning saves taxpayers $7. That is a great deal for the taxpayers of our That is a humane and profoundly significant deal for the women whose lives are bettered. We should all agree that preventing disease and saving health and lives is not only about dollars and cents. It is about the future of our  Title X began as a bipartisan program to support family planning services over 40 years ago, an era that was less divisive and when this Chamber was less divided. I urge my colleagues to recognize the importance of ensuring these services. States cannot restrict an already overburdened network of safety net providers.  Family planning services are provided through State, county, and local health departments, as well as hospitals, family planning councils, Planned Parenthood, and federally qualified health centers. Providers that focus on reproductive health comprise 72 percent of all title X-supported sites, and they are critical to delivering high-quality family planning services.[[Page S2124]]They are particularly able to offer the full range of contraceptive methods and to help women start and effectively use the methods that will work best for them individually.  There is simply no excess capacity in that safety net system now. For Republicans to allow States to remove providers from the networks based on arbitrary criteria is simply unwise and, in fact, unconscionable. The foundation of the program's success is the longstanding intent that its provider network be designed by the communities it serves to help patients have access to trusted, highly qualified, family planning providers.  Just a few weeks ago, I met with some providers and volunteers from Planned Parenthood of North I was deeply impressed with their dedication, their skill, and their humanity. In a high-need, low-income community like North Hartford, access to primary care is limited. Young men and women who come to this clinic have chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, depression, high blood pressure, and headaches. Left untreated, they have to be addressed at emergency rooms at much higher costs.  The clinicians recognized that there was an additional need for health services and for other providers in the community to meet them, but they were currently unable to do so. So they decided to initiate full-scope primary care services in Hartford, in addition to the comprehensive women's health services, so as to fully serve the men and women who choose to come to Planned Parenthood of North Hartford for their reproductive health and family planning care needs.  Patients there are seen for acute conditions and chronic problems, physicals, preventive vaccinations, as well as services to quit smoking. If there were ever a cost-effective program anywhere in the United States, then the North Hartford project is a sterling example.  Just to give one example, recently, a young woman came to this Planned Parenthood for birth control. She was found to have high blood pressure. So her provider started her on blood pressure medication and counseled her on dietary and lifestyle changes. She started exercising regularly and improved her diet, lost 30 pounds, and no longer needed the medication to control her blood pressure. Is that kind of treatment cost effective? The facts speak for themselves--the real facts--giving patients a choice, giving them a chance, giving them the counseling and care they need to save dollars and save lives.  Community healthcare centers like that in North Hartford simply cannot accommodate all the family planning patients who would lose coverage or funding if title X funds to Planned Parenthood affiliates, like Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, are eliminated. That is a lesson of this Planned Parenthood that is undeniable.  That may well be why our Republican colleagues have yielded back all of their time.  The real facts are undeniable. The real need is irrefutable. My colleagues and I are here today not because we are asking for more money or a change in how the funding program is used. We are standing up and speaking out against shortsighted efforts that would restrict access to family planning services for some of the most vulnerable patients--many of them voiceless in these halls; faceless, otherwise--in areas that are least able to absorb this cruel and inhumane change in the rules.  I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution and to stand strong for women's and men's healthcare across the country.  I yield the floor.

5368,topic-id,569,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the title X It is just a continued abuse of power, something we have never seen in this body--one after another, after another, along party-line votes--to overturn rules and overturn decisions that this government has made. It is disgraceful that this body is debating yet another effort that will threaten a woman's right to healthcare.  Title X ensures that women across the country have access to affordable healthcare, including family planning at clinics that are convenient and affordable. These are a vital resource for preventive care and for primary care.  Overturning this rule will allow States to discriminate against providers, allow States to pick and choose and potentially put thousands of healthcare centers out of business. We know that because we have seen this kind of activity in some State legislatures. These clinics are often the only places women and men have to turn to for basic health services.  Why do this in the same week that the House, fortunately, failed to throw 20 million people off of health insurance and throw off 200,000 Ohioans who are getting opioid addiction treatment and who have insurance because of the Affordable Care Act? The House did not do that, but now the Senate wants to do this? Again, it compromises people's healthcare, as it takes away, in some cases, their insurance and, in other cases, their clinics and health services they cannot get elsewhere.  Some 6 in 10 women who turn to title X for visits to family planning health centers say it is their regular source of healthcare. Many of them have nowhere else to turn. They either cannot afford healthcare elsewhere or they live too far away from another health center for there to be meaningful access to basic healthcare.  Let's be clear. This is not about defunding abortion, clearly. The Federal Government does not provide funding for abortions. I will say that again. The Federal Government does not provide funding for abortions, period. I support a woman's right to make a personal, private healthcare decision for herself and with her doctor. No matter your personal feelings about abortion, whether you call yourself pro-choice or pro-life or something else, surely, we can agree that cancer screenings and programs that have helped bring down Ohio's teen pregnancy and STD rates are a good thing. Cutting these services will have a real and serious impact on women and families across  If these actions by men--and it is, overwhelmingly, by men in Washington--whose healthcare is paid for by taxpayers continue to chip away at women's healthcare access, we will see more undiagnosed cancers, more untreated illnesses, and more unintended pregnancies.  I emphasize again that these are mostly men in this body, or men down the hall in the other body, who are voting--men with insurance that is paid for by taxpayers. Their insurance is subsidized by tax dollars. Last week, down the hall, they voted to take away healthcare--in this case, mostly for women but also for men--for people who are getting opioid treatment.  In case after case, privileged Members of this body, who get insurance paid for by taxpayers, take healthcare services away from, literally, millions of It is shameful. It is morally questionable. It is something we, simply, should not do.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

5345,topic-id,195,"Mr.Speaker, many of us have come here to the floor to share with the country and our colleagues statistics and data demonstrating how ObamaCare is failing patients. We have shown the numbers related to skyrocketing premiums and deductibles and reduction of patient choice.  Today, I want to share what my constituents are saying about their firsthand experiences with From comments we have received:  My deductible went from $250 to $2,500.  Our deductible skyrocketed to double the amount we were paying. Plus, it provided fewer options.  Our premiums have skyrocketed. We had few options from plans. We had to switch doctors.  We own a pharmacy. We see many with high premiums who can't afford the very things they need.  Cost of insurance keeps going up. It has never gone down.  I don't have insurance. It is too expensive, and I have kids to feed.  Mr.Speaker, the status quo under ObamaCare is unacceptable. It would be irresponsible and unethical not to act.  Our plan, House Republicans, will bring families relief by repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act with reforms that lower costs and expand access to quality affordable health care to all of our citizens.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgH1256-6.txt,2018,THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY,2017.0,16.0,March
5520,topic-id,266,"Mr.Speaker, when ObamaCare was debated 7 years ago, I wrote my Member of Congress to urge him to vote against what I saw as a government takeover of our healthcare system.  At that time, I was a practicing physician, and I could foresee the disastrous consequences of this law and what it would do to patients across this country, including my own. And I wasn't alone.  Citizens from every corner of America stood up and demanded that Congress reject the ObamaCare bill, but we were ignored. Since then, out-of-pocket costs for families have skyrocketed, patient-choice has evaporated, and ObamaCare has inched closer to the brink of collapse.  In that time, those same Americans who fought against passage of ObamaCare have delivered Republicans majorities in the House, in the Senate, and put a Republican in the White They did so, in part, based on our promises to repeal and replace  And here we stand, 7 years after ObamaCare passed, with the opportunity to finally deliver on that promise, and to bring relief to patients across this country who haven't been able to find the care they were promised at a cost they can afford.  It is an opportunity for us to fulfill our promise to our constituents. Let's be clear: a vote against this bill today is a vote for preservation of the ObamaCare disaster, a vote to keep critical healthcare decisions in the hands of bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., and a vote against the largest entitlement reform in a generation.

5487,topic-id,229,"Mr.Speaker, before I came to Congress, I worked in local government as a county supervisor. One of my proudest achievements during that time was working in a bipartisan way to create a program that reduced the rate of uninsured children in our county by over 90 percent--all before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. Since the Affordable Care Act, I saw firsthand the direct and positive impact of this legislation over the past 7 years to communities and families across the central coast.  The Affordable Care Act meant Sarah, from Lompoc, could open her small business and afford insurance coverage for her two children.  It meant that Kathleen, in San Luis Obispo, who was diagnosed with ovarian and breast cancer, that her $500,000 medical bill was covered by her healthcare plan.  It meant that Adrienne, from Buellton, now could afford to pay for her husband's nursing facility, as his debilitating disease prevents her from being able to physically care for him.  Repealing legislation that has improved the quality of life not only for Sarah, Kathleen, and Adrienne, but for the over 20 million Americans who have gained health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, would be callous, cruel, and irresponsible.  Instead of taking away health care from 24 million Americans, let's work together to create a more equitable, affordable, and accessible healthcare system for all.                              {time}  1215  ",CREC-2017-03-24-pt1-PgH2393.txt,99999999999999,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,24.0,March

Twenty-four million Americans will lose the access to health care by losing their insurance.

If you look at TrumpCare, you realize the great supposed negotiator actually has a great reputation of being the great bankrupter.  What this TrumpCare will do: It will affect tens of millions of Americans, and it will put them into misery, take away the dignity of health care and put them in a place that no one should ever have to be: lacking the dignity of being able to see a doctor.

5364,topic-id,762,"Madam President, I rise to express my strong opposition to H.43, a resolution of disapproval with respect to the title X regulation--a resolution which effectively endorses discriminatory practices toward family planning and safety net providers.  Title X is the Nation's only Federal grant program that is dedicated solely to providing individuals with comprehensive family planning and related[[Page S2127]]preventive health services. Last year, title X funding made it possible for nearly 4,000 health centers to provide basic primary and preventive healthcare services to over 4 million low-income women and their families. I am talking about critical services, such as Pap tests, cervical cancer screenings, contraception, breast exams, and HIV testing.  In Maryland, there are 55 title X funded health centers that span the These include federally qualified health centers, local health departments, Planned Parenthood clinics, and school-based health centers. In fiscal year 2015, Maryland received over $3.8 million in title X funding and provided health services to over 64,000 patients. These are low-income, underinsured, and uninsured individuals who would otherwise lack access to such basic healthcare.  As many of my colleagues know, Planned Parenthood, a high-quality health provider, has been under constant attack by the Republicans, who want to eliminate the organization's Federal funding. Just last week, the Republicans' Affordable Care Act repeal-and-replace bill threatened to defund Planned Parenthood, which is a trusted healthcare provider, by eliminating clinics' Medicaid reimbursements. This week, Republicans want to roll back protections that were put in place for family planning clinics and allow for discrimination against our Nation's family planning providers.  What I find even more disappointing is that this is a major policy shift for our Nation, and we are using a procedure known as the Congressional Review Act to make that decision. Yet those who support this are not even taking to the floor to defend it. This is outrageous that one would use a procedure to repeal this type of funding and not even be on the floor to defend those actions.  In December of 2016, the Obama administration finalized the regulation before us today to protect family planning providers from such discrimination. The regulation was intended to protect access to care in States that have issued their own regulations and legislation that block family planning providers from receiving title X funds. By overriding this regulation, Republicans will empower States to pick and choose who provides these services, but it will be based on arbitrary criteria that will have nothing to do with the quality of services the patients will receive. Republicans are actively condoning discrimination against providers, which will, ultimately, deny women and their families access to family planning and preventive health services.  It is not just Democrats who are concerned. Multiple healthcare providers have come out against this resolution because discrimination against any healthcare provider is wrong. Let me name just a few of the groups that oppose this action: the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Congress of Obstetricians and They are all alarmed because they know low-income, underinsured, and uninsured patients will be unable to access needed health services if it passes.  In Maryland, for example, 84 percent of the 64,000-plus patients served with title X funds have incomes at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty line. That means that they earn $11,770 a year or less--under $12,000 a year. How do you expect these families to be able to get their healthcare needs met if this resolution of disapproval is passed? Ninety-four percent of title X patients in Maryland earn less than $29,425 a year. Overturning this regulation will hurt our most vulnerable communities.  Let's be clear about this. This is not about abortion. There is no Federal funding for abortion. This is about low-income men and women not having access to pregnancy testing, contraceptive services, pelvic exams, high blood pressure and diabetes screenings, STD and HIV/AIDS screenings, infertility services, and health education. It is a war on the poor, and it is a war on access to preventive healthcare.  The American people deserve better from their elected officials. I am committed to fighting these reckless attempts to repeal a reasonable regulation that has been promulgated to prevent discriminatory practices that will harm thousands of low-income women and their families in Maryland and across our  I urge my colleagues to reject this procedural resolution, which will allow discrimination and deny adequate care to low-income families.

5632,topic-id,451,"Mr.Speaker, we are faced with an unenviable choice of the fact that there is infinite demand for health care. There is no top on the amount of healthcare cost necessary to provide all the health care that we want for everybody in this country, and we have limited resources within which to do that.  The real question is: Does ObamaCare take up that task by asking government to make those hard choices, or do we as individuals and families and caregivers make those harder choices for ourselves?  I believe that the bill that we will get to vote on today moves us toward that direction. This isn't about health care, per se; this is about how do you pay for it.  Insurance is not a magic bullet anywhere across the spectrum. Insurance is simply a scheme in which we risk-manage together. We put a certain amount of money into a bucket, assuming not all of us will suffer the risks that we want to cover. If we do, we have got to put more money in; if we don't, then the system works.  This is about having to confront that choice that there is way too much cost for the amount of resources that are available in any of these circumstances, and it is hard.  Many of my constituents ask: Why did Republicans spend 6 years railing against ObamaCare and not have the fix available on Inauguration Day? Well, this is Exhibit This is hard stuff. Even among Republicans, we have got more than 218 votes among us, and we can't agree among ourselves necessarily what ought to go forward.  But I do know this, that we are down to the final choice: Do we keep ObamaCare and the failure that is confronting us and will continue to be there, or do we take a chance on moving toward something different, moving toward freedom, moving toward choice, giving States back the opportunity to decide for their indigent population how they should take care of them?  I don't think anybody in Washington, D.C., can come up with a plan that fixes that for all 50 I trust my colleagues in Austin to make that happen far better than anybody I would trust in D.C., and this bill moves that direction, and that is the right direction for us to go.  This is a hard choice, but for me it is relatively straightforward. You keep ObamaCare with a ``no'' vote. You move toward a brighter future for health care in this country and the way we pay for it, who pays for it, and how we get that done by a ``yes'' vote.

5636,topic-id,2449,"Mr.Speaker, I've been here a while and it's hard for me to recall a time when we've voted on something so obviously and willfully harmful to children, seniors and working  This bill strips healthcare from 24 million people.  It requires some seniors to pay 100 percent or more of their income in premiums.  This legislation dramatically cuts Medicaid, directly contradicting President Trump's claim not to.  In Michigan, HALF of all children rely on  In my district alone, 56,000 people will lose coverage, including 16,000 children.  Let's be clear: if we pass this bill, children, seniors, and working people will suffer and some will die, so that the wealthy can get a tax cut.  Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. That's why I support a single-payer, Medicare-for-All plan, and why I will be voting ``no'' on this mean spirited legislation.  Mr.Speaker, as Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee, I include in the Record a legal analysis prepared by committee staff that concludes that the provision of H.1628 that requires New York State to change how its counties fund the State's portion of Medicaid expenses is not related to a legitimate Federal interest, that no rational Federal purpose has been proffered for the provision, and that it would severely intrude on traditional state prerogatives. As such, this provision would violate Constitutional limits on the Federal Spending Power, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses and the Tenth Amendment (reserving all undelegated powers to the States) and would likely be held unconstitutional if challenged in court.                               Memorandum     To: Interested     From: House Judiciary Committee Democratic     Re: Constitutionality of Faso-Collins     Date: March 24, 2017.       The Faso-Collins amendment, incorporated into the Manager's      amendment, would violate Constitutional limits on the Federal      Spending Power, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses      and the Tenth Amendment (reserving all undelegated powers to      the States). Requiring New York State to change how its      counties Fund its portion of Medicaid expenses is not related      to a legitimate Federal interest, no rational Federal purpose      has been proffered for the provision, and it would severely      intrude on traditional state prerogatives.       If the Faso-Collins amendment were ever enacted, it quickly      would be invalidated by the Federal courts. The irony of this      ``buyout'' is that the ``payment'' supposedly being delivered      in exchange for votes--the unconstitutional provision--is the      legislative equivalent of a check on a closed bank account,      which will never deliver the promised benefits.       For the last 51 years, New York State has chosen to fund a      portion of its share of the Medicaid Program by using funds      from county property taxes. Fifteen other States structure      Medicaid funding through a similar legally authorized system.       The Faso-Collins amendment specifies that any State that      had an allotment of Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH)      funds that was more than 6 times the national average, and      that requires subdivisions with populations of less than      5,000,000 to contribute toward Medicaid costs, shall have its      reimbursement reduced by the amount of contributions by such      subdivisions. (This effectively limits the application to New      York State, and carves out New York City.) Under the      amendment, New York State is at risk of losing $2.3 billion      of its $32 billion in Federal Medicaid funds.       This provision is unconstitutional, and could be struck      down for several reasons:       Violation of Limits on Spending Power--Article I of the      Constitution grants Congress spending power to ``provide for      the . . . general Welfare.'' In South Dakota v. Dole, 483      U.203 (1987), the Supreme Court held that any spending      condition imposed on the States must be related to the      Federal interest in that particular project or program and      that Congress cannot coerce the States into compliance with      the Federal government's objectives. In NFIB v. Sebelius, 132      2566 (2012), the Supreme Court found provisions of the      Affordable Care Act which required all States to comply with      the law's Medicaid expansion violated this spending      authority, noting the ``Constitution has never been      understood to confer upon Congress the ability to require the      States to govern according to Congress' instructions.'' The      Faso-Collins language does not appear to be related to any      Federal interest in the use or allocation of Federal Medicaid      funds: it does not further Medicaid's purposes and has      nothing to do with ensuring the proper disbursement of      Federal funds. Indeed, because the provision applies to      counties in a single State--and leaves the very same system      undisturbed in 15 other States--it could not possibly be      justified by any legitimate Federal interest.       An additional line of Supreme Court cases, including New      York v. United States, 505 U.144, 167, 172 (1992), has      held that conditions on Federal grants must be ``reasonably      related to the purpose of the [Federal] expenditure'' because      otherwise ``the spending power could render academic the      Constitution's other grants and limits of Federal      authority.'' Likewise, in Massachusetts v. United States, 435      U.444, 461 (1978), the Supreme Court noted that it has      ``repeatedly held that the Federal Government may impose      appropriate conditions on the use of Federal property or      privileges and may require that State instrumentalities      comply with conditions that are reasonably related to the      Federal interest in particular national projects or      programs.'' Under these precedents, the Faso-Collins language      would be held to be an arbitrary exercise of Federal power      which intrudes on only one particular State's sovereign tax      powers, and is unrelated to any Federal interest or purpose      in the Medicaid       As Yale Law School Professor Abbe Gluck wrote in a post on      the Balkinzation blog today, the Faso-Collins ``amendment is      likely unconstitutional. The protection from federal      interference of the internal functions of a state government      is one of the bedrocks of state sovereignty protected by the      limitations on Congress's powers in Article I of the      Constitution and the reservation of power to the states in      the Tenth Amendment.'' She further reasoned that ``Even if      one could argue that this is an exercise of the federal      spending power under Article I, for Congress to legally use      that power, the conditions on a state's use of federal      funding have to be tied to a reasonable federal propose . . .      It is hard to see a reasonable federal purpose here other      than garnering more GOP votes for the struggling repeal      bill.'' (available at https://ballkin.blogspot.com/2017/03/is-gop-aca-repealer-unconstitutional-on.html?m=1)       Violation of Due Process and Equal Protection--Under the      Fifth Amendment, the Federal government is not permitted to      deprive its citizens of equal protection or due process of      law. Those clauses have been interpreted on numerous      occasions to prevent the government from discriminating      between the treatment of the sovereign States absent a      rational basis. For example, in Helvering v. David, 301 U.     619, 640 (1937), the Supreme Court warned that Congress does      not possess the right to demonstrate a ``display of arbitrary      power'' in its treatment of the various In this      regard, in 2009, when an earlier Senate version of the      Affordable Care Act sought to provide special treatment for      Nebraska with respect to Medicaid reimbursements, 13      Republican State attorneys general wrote to Congress      (available at http://www.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/career-servicesifiles/Letter%20to%      20the%20 Honorable%20Nancy %20Pelosi%20 and%20the      %20Honorable%20Harry %20Reid.pdf) asserting the provision was      unconstitutional (the provision was ultimately dropped). In      the case of the Faso-Collins language, there is no legitimate      policy justification for developing a special rule limiting      Medicaid funds for New York as compared to all other States,      including 15 States which have sharing agreements with their      counties. Nor has a justification been offered for why New      York City should be excluded from the application of the      special rule. As such, it is clear that the provision is      discriminatory, ``arbitrary'' and has no rational basis.       Abrogation of Tenth Amendment Principles--The Tenth      Amendment provides in relevant part that powers not delegated      to the Federal government or prohibited to the States are      reserved for the This has been read to prevent the      federal government from ``commandeering'' the states to serve      its own purposes. In Printz v. United States, 521 U.898      (1997), the Supreme Court held that Congress cannot      commandeer State officers to implement Federal policy--in      that case requiring criminal background checks for handgun      purchases pursuant to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention      The Faso-Collins language commandeers New York State      government to facilitate the partisan political ends of a      faction in the U.Congress, which would seem well outside      the proscriptions of In fact, by essentially ordering      New York to reorganize its internal affairs, the Faso-Collins      amendment may run even further afoul of Tenth Amendment      principles than was the case in Printz given the lack of a      Federal purpose and the interference with the core sovereign      function of how a State chooses to use its taxing power.       It is of particular constitutional concern that the Faso-     Collins provision directly interferes with New York's      internal decisions about how to structure its own tax and      spending policies, and how to allocate those responsibilities      between the State and its subdivisions--which is a core      function of a sovereign entity protected by the Tenth      Amendment (and potentially Article IV 4 of the      Constitution, which provides that the ``United States shall      guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of      Government.''). This is constitutionally significant because      in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.533, 575 (1964), the Supreme      Court held that political subdivisions such as counties and      cities ``have been traditionally regarded as subordinate      governmental instrumentalities created by the State to assist      in the carrying[[Page H2441]]     out of State governmental functions.'' In Hunter v. City of      Pittsburgh, 207 U.161, 178 (1907), the Court noted that      these subdivisions are ``created as convenient agencies for      exercising such of the governmental powers of the state, as      may be entrusted to them'' and that the ``number, nature, and      duration of powers conferred upon these [entities] and the      territory over which they shall be exercised rests in the      absolute discretion of the state.'' The Faso-Collins      amendment purports to invoke Federal power to displace New      York's sovereign exercise of this ``absolute discretion''      and, for that reason, violates the As Chief      Justice John Marshall long ago explained in Gibbons v. Ogden,      22 U.1, 198-200 (1824), the States' ``power of taxation is      indispensable to their existence. . . . In imposing taxes for      State purposes, [States] are not doing what Congress is      empowered to do. Congress is not empowered to tax for those      purposes which are within the exclusive province of the      States.''                                  ____                                   Office of the Attorney General,                                      State of South Carolina,                                                December 30, 2009.     Nancy Pelosi,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,       The undersigned state attorneys general, in response to      numerous inquiries, write to express our grave concern with      the Senate version of the Patient Protection and Affordable      Care Act (``H.3590''). The current iteration of the bill      contains a provision that affords special treatment to the      state of Nebraska under the federal Medicaid program. We      believe this provision is constitutionally flawed. As chief      legal officers of our states we are contemplating a legal      challenge to this provision and we ask you to take action to      render this challenge unnecessary by striking that provision.       It has been reported that Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson's      vote, for H.3590, was secured only after striking a deal      that the federal government would bear the cost of newly      eligible Nebraska Medicaid enrollees. In marked contrast all      other states would not be similarly treated, and instead      would be required to allocate substantial sums, potentially      totaling billions of dollars, to accommodate H.3590's new      Medicaid mandates. In addition to violating the most basic      and universally held notions of what is fair and just, we      also believe this provision of H.3590 is inconsistent with      protections afforded by the United States Constitution      against arbitrary legislation.       In Helvering v. Davis, 301 U.S 619, 640 (1937), the United      States Supreme Court warned that Congress does not possess      the right under the Spending Power to demonstrate a ``display      of arbitrary power.'' Congressional spending cannot be      arbitrary and capricious. The spending power of Congress      includes authority to accomplish policy objectives by      conditioning receipt of federal funds on compliance with      statutory directives, as in the Medicaid program. However,      the power is not unlimited and ``must be in pursuit of the      `general welfare.' '' South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.203, 207      (1987). In Dole the Supreme Court stated, ``that conditions      on federal grants might be illegitimate if they are unrelated      to the federal interest in particular national projects or      programs.'' at 207. It seems axiomatic that the federal      interest in H.3590 is not simply requiring universal      health care, but also ensuring that the states share with the      federal government the cost of providing such care to their      citizens. This federal interest is evident from the fact this      legislation would require every state, except Nebraska, to      shoulder its fair share of the increased Medicaid costs the      bill will generate. The provision of the bill that relieves a      single state from this cost-sharing program appears to be not      only unrelated, but also antithetical to the legitimate      federal interests in the bill.       The fundamental unfairness of H.3590 may also give rise      to claims under the due process, equal protection, privileges      and immunities clauses and other provisions of the      As a practical matter, the deal struck by the      United States Senate on the ``Nebraska Compromise'' is a      disadvantage to the citizens of 49 states. Every state's tax      dollars, except Nebraska's, will be devoted to cost-sharing      required by the bill, and will be therefore unavailable for      other essential state programs. Only the citizens of Nebraska      will be freed from this diminution in state resources for      critical state services. Since the only basis for the      Nebraska preference is arbitrary and unrelated to the      substance of the legislation, it is unlikely that the      difference would survive even minimal scrutiny.       We ask that Congress delete the Nebraska provision from the      pending legislation, as we prefer to avoid litigation.      Because this provision has serious implications for the      country and the future of our nation's legislative process,      we urge you to take appropriate steps to protect the      Constitution and the rights of the citizens of our nation. We      believe this issue is readily resolved by removing the      provision in question from the bill, and we ask that you do      so.       By singling out the particular provision relating to      special treatment of Nebraska, we do not suggest there are no      other legal or constitutional issues in the proposed health      care legislation.       Please let us know if we can be of assistance as you      consider this matter.

5640,topic-id,1700,"Mr.President, let me start by offering my congratulations to my friend and colleague Senator Schumer from New He is a worthy adversary when we see things differently, as we frequently do, but he is also somebody with whom I have found I can work productively. I understand he has a new role to play as the Democratic leader. I am sure we will see a lot of that worthy adversarial part of his character in the forefront. But in this new year, with a new Congress, I do hope we can work together.  I became a little concerned, though, as I heard him go on. He had already declared the Trump Presidency over, and he is not even going to be sworn in until 17 days from now, by my calculations. Of course, we just swore in the new Members of the 115th  Let me also congratulate my colleagues across the aisle who were elected to join us here in what historically has been known as the world's greatest deliberative body. But if there is anything any one of us who have been here a while has learned, it is that neither party gets everything they want. It just was not designed that way.  For example in 2009, when one party controlled the White House, had 60 votes in the Senate, and had a majority in the House of Representatives, ostensibly you could get what you want since you didn't need to rely on any votes from the opposing party. But if there is one great historic example of why it is a mistake to try to do things alone or without bipartisan support, it is the example of ObamaCare, which we will be talking more about in the coming days.  The media, of course, is still trying to figure out what happened on November 8--how the pundits, all the experts, all the pollsters got it wrong. It is still not hard to find articles from those pundits and the mainstream media giving their diagnosis on exactly what the American voter was saying to us on November 8.  I personally don't think it is all that complicated; I think it is pretty straightforward. After 8 years of an Obama White House, the American people wanted a change. They spoke up loudly and clearly, demanding a new direction that would actually deliver results for the American people. I think those of us on both sides of the aisle ought to have enough humility to say it was not exactly a ringing affirmation of either political party.  I am grateful for one thing, though, and that is that the American people decided they did not want to change the Republican majority in the House and the We do take the responsibility of being in the majority seriously. We believe it is our duty to bring real help to the American people.  I would digress for just a moment and say to my colleague from New York, the Democratic leader, that I remember when I came to the Senate, Mike Enzi, conservative Republican from Wyoming, and Teddy Kennedy, whom you identified as your mentor, the liberal lion of the Senate--they worked so productively together on the HELP Committee, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions I remember one time asking Senator Enzi: How is it that somebody as conservative as you are can work with someone as liberal as Teddy Kennedy is and do so in good faith, good spirits, and so productively?  Senator Enzi said: It is easy. It is the 80-20 rule. The 80 percent that we can agree on, we do. The 20 percent we will never agree on, we simply leave for another fight another day. Actually, I think that is a pretty good rule of thumb.  The first job the new Congress will have is to repeal I alluded to that earlier. It is simple. I think if history teaches anything about taking advantage of a supermajority in Senate, it is that you should not do that because if we did that with Social Security, Medicare, or other programs widely supported by the American people, it simply would not be sustainable. That is the case with ObamaCare, voted through the Senate--jammed through with 60 votes on the other side in the Senate, and then a majority in the House, signed by President Actually, after Republicans picked up a vacant Senate seat in Massachusetts, it caused our Democratic colleagues to have to use the budget reconciliation process to pass it.  But we know the broken promises of ObamaCare, and we will revisit those more and more in coming days. There are higher premiums with less coverage. Many lost their insurance all together after being promised by the President himself that if you like what you have, you can keep it. We know that many folks no longer have access to the doctor or health care plan of their choice because their doctor has either quit accepting that insurance or retired or health plans have simply pulled up stakes because they can't compete under the provisions of  I believe the verdict for the American people has been that ObamaCare has failed the American people. I would ask our Democratic colleagues to look at the fact that they passed it originally with 60 votes. Now they are at 48. We have all been in the majority and the minority if we have been around here for very long, but I think ObamaCare is one of the big reasons our Democratic colleagues find themselves currently in the minority.  As one of our colleagues put it this morning, if we can't do better than ObamaCare, we might as well look for another line of work. What we owe the American people, I believe, is coverage that they choose, at a price they can afford.  Of course, that is just the beginning. Under President Obama's leadership, his administration has imposed thousands of rules and regulations, running up the pricetag of hundreds of billions of dollars, which has put a stranglehold on the American economy. Many of these are job-killing regulations that make it harder for small businesses, which are the very lifeblood of our economy, to make ends meet, to make a profit, to hire additional employees--things that we desperately need in this country--more well-paying jobs.  I look forward to working with the new administration to roll back those regulations and rules that don't make sense. With ObamaCare repealed and replaced with coverage you can afford from a provider that you choose and with the better economic climate for the country, we can help more Americans achieve their dreams. That should be the top priority for every one of us here in this  Finally, I look forward to working with the incoming administration to consider President-Elect Trump's nominees to fill his posts in his If I am not mistaken, on the day that President Obama was sworn into office, January 20, 2009, there were seven Cabinet members of his incoming cabinet that were confirmed that day. That demonstrates the sort of good faith and accommodation that this Senate should continue because we understand the importance of the President's Cabinet members. Whether it is the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, or the Attorney General, they hold critical positions, not only in terms of national security but in terms of making sure the government works for the American people.  I have already spoken about one of our colleagues, Senator Sessions, the President-elect's nominee to be the chief law enforcement officer for the country. I think Senator Sessions is an excellent choice. Our colleagues will have a chance to ask all the questions they want, but there is one thing I can[[Page S11]]be sure of with Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions, and that is that he will remove the political orientation of the Department of Justice and make sure that it is not just another political branch of the White I look forward to confirming him as Attorney General, and I am confident that he will be prepared to answer the questions from our colleagues.

We are blessed to work in a great American institution--a unique institution--and I believe it is our obligation and duty to try to find areas we can agree on and build consensus to move the country forward for the American people. While surely we will have our fights--and they will be glorious fights--we shouldn't shy away from those differences, but let's not let our desire just to fight for fighting's sake get in the way of our ability to work together and try to find consensus where we can.

5435,topic-id,748,"Mr.Speaker, as we are sitting here in this Chamber, right now off the coast of Groton, Connecticut, 30 miles from the Groton Navy Sub Base, which is the oldest submarine base in America, there is a Russian spy ship, the Viktor Leonov, that is loitering--as was reported this morning from the Navy and news sources--off the coast, again, within the bare minimum of international waters.  I can attest to the fact that--having just flown down from Connecticut a few days ago--anyone who would loiter off the coast of Connecticut is not doing it because of the great climate and weather. It is freezing weather out there. They are doing it, obviously, with aggressive intent, to say the least.  Mr.Speaker, this is part of a pattern that is going on right now not just off the East Coast of the U.S., but also overseas. The USS Porter, which is a Navy missile ship, was buzzed by military aircraft from Russia on February 10. They came within 200 yards of the ship. Again, because we have such incredibly competent and professional leadership that captain those vessels, an incident was avoided.  However, the danger of jet aircraft moving within 200 yards of a U.naval ship obviously is just common sense to anyone how high risk that is in terms of creating an incident that could have huge ramifications.  In addition to that, the news reported again just the last couple of days or so that the Russian military is now deploying intermediate medium-range nuclear warheads in different places throughout Western Russia, near Eastern Again, this is clearly in violation of treaties that go back decades.  As General Breedlove, who was the commander of NATO and the European Command who just stepped down, said that this new effort really just cannot go unanswered. It completely destabilizes the balance of power in that theater of the world.  Again, the folks in Connecticut woke up this morning with that news about the spy ship off the coast. As you can imagine, it has created a lot of consternation and questions.  Once again, I would reiterate that I have total confidence in our Navy leadership both at the Groton Navy base and here in Washington that they will react to this with total vigilance and professional competence to make sure that, again, our security is protected.  But I think it is time now for all of us in Washington, D.C., to understand that Vladimir Putin, during the 5 years that he has been in power, again, has taken a posture that is completely destabilizing any sort of global system of peace and security.  This new administration, which clearly has an infatuation with Putin--and this goes back during the campaign with President Trump talking on the campaign trail about his high regard for Putin's leadership--needs to basically move on and recognize that this is an emerging threat and that we have to take all necessary steps to respond to it both in the short-term and, obviously, as we take up defense policy and defense budgets, which is that the resurgence of the Russian Navy is a game-changer in terms of the demands on our fleet.  That is something that, again, on the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, which I am the ranking member, we are working hard in terms of implementing the Obama administration's boost to Navy shipbuilding and increasing the fleet size.  Again, we need to really, as I said, just disavow ourselves of any naive assumptions that somehow the Putin government is somehow something that we can trust, and shows any regard for international norms or international law.  Again, to the folks back home, I want you to know that we are monitoring this situation with our Navy team down here in Washington and I have total confidence that we are on top of this situation.  It is a reminder that the Russian Government and the investment that they have put into their Navy fleet is not a friendly gesture in terms of creating a system of global peace and security; and this administration needs to wake up and recognize that and move on to a bipartisan effort to respond to this threat.  They can do that by, again, disclosing all the background regarding General Flynn's interaction with the Russian Government because it is part and parcel of all those incidents which I listed in terms of aggressive actions that are happening in real time as we are here in Washington, D.C., today.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1189.txt,1836,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,15.0,April

After falsely promising that there would be coverage for everyone for less and better, TrumpCare only cares about huge tax breaks for the superrich and special interests, like[[Page H2428]]the totally unjustified $28 billion windfall for the pharmaceutical industry that they grab right out of the Medicare trust fund so that premiums will go up. Those earning $1 million within a single year get 79 percent of a $230 billion tax break, but there is no genuine relief for middle class taxpayers.  Removing the essential health benefits provisions will only enable insurers to exclude the very healthcare protections that folks thought they were getting when they paid their premiums.

5388,topic-id,468,"Mr.President, this vote to allow States to defund Planned Parenthood and other title X funded health programs is simply shameful and dangerous, and millions of Americans across this country, including tens of thousands of women and men in Illinois, are going to suffer as a result.  This vote is particularly devastating to the 2.7 million Americans who depend on Planned Parenthood for their basic preventive healthcare each year. I personally understand what is at stake with this vote because I have been there. When I was working my way through college as a waitress, with the help of Pell grants and student loans and student work-study, I relied on Planned Parenthood for my basic healthcare, for services that are just as simple as a simple physical that I needed to get that waitressing job. I went to Planned Parenthood because that is all I could afford on a student's budget, and I needed to get that second job.  While I can relate to the obvious good that Planned Parenthood does, many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, unfortunately, simply cannot. They don't understand what is at stake.  Let's take a look at my home State of In Illinois alone, Planned Parenthood serves 64,000 patients annually. Of those, 34,000 seek testing for sexually transmitted diseases, and nearly 7,000 are seeking out cancer screenings. So by defunding this organization, what they are really doing is stripping thousands of Illinoisans and Americans all across this country from access to essential healthcare. That is simply unacceptable.  We can't play politics with women's healthcare. Planned Parenthood should be able to do its job and continue providing quality care and services without fear of partisan or discriminatory attacks.  The bottom line is that Planned Parenthood is one of the Nation's largest women's healthcare providers, and it is essential to the health of our families and our country.  This vote makes taking away not just Planned Parenthood's funding but funding from any organization that receives title X easier, turning women around the country into second-class citizens and harming millions of Americans in the process. Why would we make it easier to take away a health center that helps our women's public health system and serves as a lifeline for affordable, preventive services like physicals, disease testing, and cancer screenings? Women and men all over the country need these services. Our States and our local communities need these services because they meet a need that would otherwise not be met.

5380,topic-id,1352,"Mr.President, most Americans agree--and I think last week's vote in the House indicated--that there is something special about healthcare. This just isn't the right of every American to own an SUV; it is the right of every American to have access to healthcare. That is really at the heart of our healthcare debate.  There are some who believe that health insurance ought to be another product on the shelf, and if you have enough money, you can buy it. But there are others, like me, who believe it is more fundamental.  Healthcare in America, as far as I am concerned, should be a right--not a privilege, a right--so that it doesn't go just to wealthy people. Everyone should have that peace of mind.  I have told the story many times on the floor of the Senate--and many of us are products of our own life experience. My wife and I got married when I was a student in law school here at Georgetown, in God sent us a beautiful little girl right away, but she had some medical problems--serious ones--and I didn't have any health insurance. I was a law student, had no real income, a wife, and a baby with a medical problem.  I ended up sitting in the charity ward of the local children's hospital with a number in my hand, waiting to see who would come through the door to provide me with healthcare for my little girl. I had never felt worse in my life as a father, as a husband, to think that I had reached this point where I didn't have health insurance, and I wasn't sure that I was bringing the very best medical care to my little girl.  Well, I never forgot that experience in the many years since, and I never will. I don't believe anybody should be sitting in that chair, worried because they don't have health insurance--whether they have the kind of healthcare that their family needs.  I think that is at the heart of this debate on our healthcare system in America and its future. What we are talking about today is part of it, as well, because we had decided 40 years ago--maybe more--that we were going to make sure, if you were poor in America, as a woman, you would still have access to basic healthcare. Poverty would not exclude you from healthcare. So we created this title X program to provide healthcare primarily for low-income families but for women and children. The services that are provided are basic life-and-death services--everything from breast and cervical care screening, high blood pressure screening, anemia, diabetes testing, and so on.  There is not much debate as to whether we should provide those services, but you know what this is all about. It is not about what I just read. It is about family planning, and it is about abortion. That is what this is really all about.  The Republicans who are voting to deny women access to healthcare are saying: We are doing this to reduce the incidence of abortion.  There is something they should admit: You cannot spend one penny of Federal money for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest, or where the life of the mother is in danger. Not here in the United States, not overseas.  What they say instead is: Well, we don't want to provide any money to any place that might use their own funds for abortion services, like Planned So we have this amendment before us.  For thousands of women and families in my State of Illinois, as Senator Murray has explained, it means the Republicans--who were all for choice in[[Page S2133]]healthcare--don't want women of limited means to have their ultimate choice of Planned Parenthood for their services. So the Republicans have brought in the Vice President of the United States to vote in the Senate  For those who are following the Senate, that doesn't happen very often. It has to be a big deal. And it must be a big deal to the Vice President and to the Republican Party to bring back one of our colleagues, who has been on the mend from medical care, and to bring in the Vice President to make that difference.  Their argument is: Well, we are just trying to reduce the number of abortions.  Well, if you have taken anything beyond Birds and Bees 101, there are some things that you might know. We had a study in Louis that was reported in 2012 that tells many people who are at least aware of the basics of how children are born something that we knew already and knew intuitively. Here is what it found:       The abortion rate in the Louis area declined by more      than 20 percent from 2008 to 2010, coinciding with a research      study that gave free birth control to thousands of area      women.       Although the drop in abortions in Louis cannot be      attributed solely to the project, the abortion rate for the      rest of Missouri--  Not in the study--     remained constant.       Contraception is key to reducing unintended pregnancies and      abortions, said Jeff ``We need to remove cost      barriers,'' Peipert said. ``I think all women should have      equal access.''       Teenage participants--  In this study--     experienced a birth rate of 6.3 babies per 1,000 girls,      compared with the national rate of 34.3, according to the      study published . . . in the journal Obstetrics and            There were an average of six abortions a year for every      1,000 women in the project, compared with the national rate      of 20.  Coincidence? I don't think so.  When you make family planning accessible to potential mothers and to the families, people are educated and make informed choices. There are fewer unplanned pregnancies. There are fewer teenage pregnancies. There are fewer abortions.  So the Republicans, by reducing the access of women to clinics and agencies that are providing family planning, reduce the likelihood they will get the information they need and the likelihood that abortions will increase--exactly the opposite of what they say they are trying to do.  Common sense dictates that--whatever your position is on abortion and choice--if you believe that an uninformed and uneducated young mother is the right person to make this decision as to whether they are going to have a family, I think you understand what all of us do: Information, assistance, and quality healthcare is critically important for women to make the right choice for themselves and their families and to avoid unplanned pregnancies.  We are now experiencing the lowest rates of unplanned pregnancies in the United States in the last 30 years and the lowest incidence of teenage pregnancies in the last 30 years, and the abortion rate is going down. It works. It is connecting.  This vote that the Republicans are forcing us to take--which the President, I am afraid, would sign, if it were sent to his desk--really gets at the heart of the issue. If you want to reduce the number of abortions in America, if you want to make them safe, legal, and rare, as they say, for goodness' sake, provide basic family planning information and services to women who otherwise might not have it.  This is a war against Planned Parenthood and a few other facilities that is mindless. It really is stopping information from people who desperately need it. Without that information, there will be bad results--bad results that often lead to abortions.  So I would just say flat out that we don't talk a lot about the A-word, ``abortion,'' on the floor, but that is really what is driving this debate. That is what is really behind it.  I hope that one more Republican colleague will decide that if you are truly against abortion, you should be in favor of family planning and giving basic information and counseling to young women who need it. That was proven in It is proven by our human experience. I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this effort.  I thank the Senator from Washington for leading this debate on the floor.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2122-2.txt,326,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,30.0,February

Those of us who have employer-provided health care, 170 million Americans, that is not a taxable event for them. It is not a taxable event where they have to pay tax at the end of the year on the value of that employer-provided health care.

The Sentencing Commission is an independent agency charged with establishing sentencing guidelines for the Federal court system. The commission's work is important. It is responsible for advising and assisting Congress and the Executive branch in the development of effective and efficient crime policy.

Since the start of the 115th Congress, the Sentencing Commission has been unable to do its work because it has been with only two commissioners. By statute, the commission requires a quorum of at least four commissioners.  For this reason, it is vitally important that Judge Breyer is confirmed once again to serve on the commission.

5373,topic-id,542,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose the title X Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval.  This resolution would permit discrimination against family planning healthcare providers that provide primary preventive and reproductive healthcare services to millions of women around the country. It will allow States to take away Federal funding from family planning clinics and make it much harder for millions of American women to meet with their healthcare providers and access basic care.  I am struggling to understand, amidst all these problems we are having to solve in this country and around the world, why this Congress seems to have such a singular fixation on controlling women's access to basic healthcare. This legislation is so far out of touch with the actual needs of our constituents. If we cut funding for women's health clinics, is that going to create more good-paying jobs? Is it going to open more factories in our upstate rural towns? I don't believe it will. It is certainly not going to make anyone healthier.  There are millions of American women, including thousands of women in my State of New York, who rely on title X health clinics for treatments, preventive care, and for family planning services. They need these health clinics because they provide contraception counseling, cancer screening, and medical expertise right there in their communities. Many of the women who use these services have nowhere else to go for access because title X clinics are often the only affordable option for them and may even be the only place within driving distance of their communities. Yet, once again, my colleagues are pushing legislation to limit women's options for accessing healthcare and making it harder for thousands of New York women to get the care and treatments they need. I continue to be amazed by how little empathy there seems to be for millions of women in our country who don't have the resources to travel to a major hospital outside of their communities and desperately need these local clinics to stay healthy.  Let's be very clear about who this legislation would hurt the most. This bill will hurt women in small towns and rural communities more than anyone else. It will cause lower income women to struggle even more. Every single one of my colleagues has many women in their States who rely on title X clinics and would suffer if these clinics had their Federal funding taken away.  So I urge my colleagues in this Chamber: When it is time to vote on this legislation, think about the women who live in your Think about the women who live in small towns and rural communities who are just trying to access basic women's healthcare services that they can afford. Think about the women who don't have big hospitals or big cities nearby. Think about the women who don't have enough money to travel. The bill is going to hurt them. It will make their lives harder, not easier.

She shared that she received a letter from her insurer stating that her policy was going to increase by $600 per month--increase by $600 per month. Since she wasn't of age to be on Medicare but wasn't working because she was at home caring for her sick husband, she was frustrated with her situation.  Kaye couldn't afford the extra money she owed on top of the bills for her husband's medical treatment. She told me: ``So I will now have to pay the fine, drop my insurance, and hope I do not get sick.''  I told Kay I would vote to repeal and replace  A nurse from Warren County wrote to me: ``The care that I give my patients is founded on their ability to choose their course of care. We advocate every day for our patients to have more choices in their care, and it will be very painful for us to deny them those options and to deny them care.'' She asked me to stand against ObamaCare, and I told her I would.  Susan, from Bedford County, told me her health insurance premium increased 156 percent and her deductible increased 766 percent in just 2 years. She asked how we could make her pay such high rates.

The reason I ask you to vote for the bill is kind of like the reverse: What is going to happen if this bill fails?  If this bill fails, you won't be able to have the huge increase in funding in HSAs, a free-market, patient-centered tax provision which is going to help many people and particularly allow flexibility for older married couples.  If this bill doesn't pass, we are going to continue to levy fines on young people who don't want health insurance, as so many people have not had when they are young. We will continue to levy fines on small business that can't afford health insurance.  If this bill fails to pass, we are not going to allow States to put work requirements on Quite frankly, Medicaid, in many ways, is a more generous policy than the one that people who do work are able to afford through their insurers.[[Page H2414]]  If this bill doesn't pass, we won't be able to stop the bleeding on Medicaid funding. We are approaching a $20 trillion debt. Of course, the bulk of that spiraling debt is caused by mandatory spending, of which Medicaid is one of the worst parts.  Finally, for the first time in years, we are passing a law that will make a significant dent in that mandatory spending.  If this bill isn't passed, we prevent putting a provision in here requiring documentation of citizenship for Right now, we are becoming the healthcare provider for the world. We cannot afford to become the healthcare provider of the world.  Under this bill, we are providing funds, seed money for high-risk pools for States, which will hold down insurance costs, which is the underlying problem we have here.  If this bill doesn't pass, we continue to fund abortion providers. I think this is the best bill in decades for those of us who wish we would stop funding these organizations.  We are providing assistance for people who can't get insurance through their employer.

It will be in the next budget session they have to deal with moving forward, if we don't address this situation.  So people keep talking about a rush process. Over a year ago, we put together a Medicaid task force, met with groups of people, met with Governors, we took a lot of information, and put together a plan that addresses the needs of Medicaid is growing. It will be over a $1 trillion program within 10 years if we don't deal with it. It is going to implode. So we actually worked to put it on a sustainable budget. It is growing. People talk about cuts to Only in Washington, D.C., is slowing the growth of a program looked at as a cut. So we have worked hard to move that forward.  The other thing I want to talk about is, last year, small businesses were going to be hit by the minimum essential benefits. Small businesses were saying: We like our plans, and we want to keep it. We are going to have our prices go up, and we are not going to be able to afford to provide coverage.  So we all came together, bipartisan, to address that to exempt the small-business plans for those programs. It passed by voice vote in the House, unanimous consent in the Senate, and signed by then-President  So the question is, if small businesses can design and keep their own plans, I think individuals can, too.

5374,topic-id,964,"Mr.President, I rise today in opposition to the Congressional Review Act measure, which would allow discrimination against title X family planning providers, which in turn could roll back access to family planning and preventive health services for women and their families in New Hampshire and across our country.  Throughout my time in public service, I have always fought to ensure[[Page S2130]]that women have meaningful access to the healthcare they need. I have fought to ensure that they can make their own healthcare decisions, and, in doing so, control their own destinies.  To compete economically on a level playing field, women must be able to make their own decisions about if--or when--to start a family. They should not have to pay more than men do for healthcare. They should be able to visit providers of their own choice who understand their healthcare needs. To fully participate not only in our economy but also in our democracy, women must be recognized for their capacity to make their own healthcare decisions, just as men are. They also must have full independence to make their own health decisions, just as men do.  During my time as Governor of New Hampshire, I restored family planning funds and pushed to restore State funding for Planned Parenthood, and I am going to continue fighting to ensure that women have the care they need, while standing firm against efforts here in Congress to roll back the progress that has been made.  Unfortunately, the vote we are taking today is a continuation of a partisan agenda that has been focused on restricting the care that women and their families can receive. The fact that Vice President Mike Pence was called in to cast the deciding vote to advance this measure shows just how far Republican leadership will go in order to undermine women's access to critical healthcare.  For more than 40 years, title X has provided women and their families with comprehensive family planning and preventive health services. When the legislation was originally passed in 1970, it was part of a bipartisan effort, with the support of prominent In the years that have followed, title X has been essential in delivering important services to some of our Nation's most underserved communities. That is why, in New Hampshire, title X and Planned Parenthood still have broad support in our communities, even if they have been the subject of political gamesmanship here in  Title X has support from Granite Staters because they have seen the real difference it has made in their lives and in the lives of their neighbors. They know that in some parts of the State there are no other options or, if other options do exist, they don't provide women with the same expertise and commitment to reproductive health that title X providers do.  For those in rural communities, for low-income women and men, and for members of the LGBTQ community, title X supported health centers have been a major source of preventive care and reproductive health services, including cancer screenings, birth control, HIV and STI tests, and counseling services. And title X's important public health services translate into savings for taxpayers. In 2010, title X investments resulted in net savings for Federal and State governments of $7 billion.  The measure we are voting on today would undermine this progress and the safety net for countless citizens. This measure would allow States to discriminate against providers and take away investments in family planning clinics, ultimately taking away these key services for those who need them most.  Last year, more than 4 million women and men at over 4,000 health centers across our Nation received care through title This includes around 20,000 patients in New Hampshire, including roughly 11,000 patients receiving care through title X supported Planned Parenthood centers. Those services can't just be replaced by other providers, even community health centers that do great work. But two counties in New Hampshire don't have a community health center at all. Others don't have the capacity to replace this work or this specialized experience that can make a critical difference to a woman's health.  In New Hampshire and other States, Planned Parenthood and the community health centers are often partners, working in tandem to get patients the reproductive healthcare they need. But when I hear from community health centers around New Hampshire, they tell me they would not be able to pick up the slack if Planned Parenthood is defunded.  Make no mistake about it, this CRA, which would let States discriminate against providers in the title X program, combined with the consistent attempts to defund Planned Parenthood by some in Congress, would be a disaster for women in New Hampshire and all across the That is why a number of leading advocates have come out against these efforts to overturn title X regulations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, the Human Rights Campaign, and dozens more. I share their concerns and oppose the measure we will consider today, and I am going to continue to fight against these attempts to roll back access to reproductive health and preventive services.  It is critical that we have a healthcare system that ensures that all women and their families can get the care they need. What we cannot do is eliminate services and discriminate against providers who have been providing critical, cost-effective healthcare to millions of Americans for decades. I strongly oppose this effort to undermine the title X program, and I will vote against this measure today.  We need just one more vote, and I urge my colleagues to listen to the voices of their constituents and vote no today.  I yield the floor.

5621,topic-id,312,"Mr.Speaker, tragically, I receive correspondence every week like this. I heard from Rita in east Texas, who writes me:       Since ObamaCare took effect, my insurance no longer covers      my colonoscopies as[[Page H2435]]     preventative care. I now pay $1,000 and more out of pocket      versus $100 outpatient fee.  I heard from Frances in the Dallas area near where I live. A few years ago she was tragically diagnosed with tonsil cancer. The good news is she had a good policy; $600-a-month premium and a maximum out of pocket of $3,500. But thanks to ObamaCare, her insurance company dropped her twice, and she wrote:       They dropped me again because they are leaving the Dallas      market.  Her premiums and deductibles doubled. She lost her oncologist, and she writes that this is all because of ObamaCare, the Affordable Care  I heard from Tonya in Van Zandt County, in my district:       We had five family members covered by insurance at around      $800 a month until Our insurance premiums      skyrocketed to $1,500 a month, equivalent to a house payment,      with a $15,000 deductible, and we cannot see the doctors that      know our medical history. Repeal it. I should not be forced      to pay for something I cannot use. This has been a nightmare.  Mr.Speaker, ObamaCare has been a nightmare. It is collapsing as we speak. People are losing their coverages. Insurance plans are pulling out of States and counties. Tens of millions of our fellow countrymen have been forced to buy health insurance plans they cannot afford, they do not want, and that do not work for them.  Right here, right now, we have a choice: failed ObamaCare or the American Health Care Act that begins the process of providing Americans with guaranteed access to quality, affordable, patient-centered health care.

5360,topic-id,922,"Mr.President, the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, resolution we are debating today is the latest attack in the unrelenting Republican crusade against funding--or defunding--Planned They have tried everything: passing stand-alone bills, attaching poison pills to must-pass bills, threatening a government shutdown, struggling and failing to pass  Today, we are debating whether to repeal an administrative action that protects abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, that receive title X funding. Just a little while ago, Vice President Pence was here to break a tie because Republicans in Congress couldn't get enough men to tell women what to do with their bodies.  For nearly 50 years, title X funding has helped low-income Americans access vital health services like birth control and cervical and breast cancer screenings. Title X funding has been a healthcare lifeline for millions of women in all parts of the country. But if this Congressional Review Act resolution is passed, Planned Parenthood clinics across our country can be prohibited from receiving title X funding, even though it is currently illegal to use Federal dollars to fund abortion services. Let me repeat: No Federal dollars can be used to fund abortion services, period.  I understand the strong anti-abortion belief held by some of my colleagues, but I don't understand why this translates into relentless attacks on an organization that uses no Federal funds for abortion. Planned Parenthood uses Federal funds to provide vital healthcare services to millions of people, mainly women. Yes, I acknowledge there are men who go to Planned Parenthood also.  In 2014, Planned Parenthood provided over 600,000 cancer screenings and over 4 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections. But this is a factual argument, and we have learned over the years that many of my Republican colleagues simply will not listen to facts when it comes to Planned  Let me share a few stories from my constituents about the transformational impact Planned Parenthood has had in their lives. Perhaps after hearing these stories, we will think twice about attacking the vital services Planned Parenthood provides all across our country.  Hawaii is home to a large military community. Taylor from Honolulu is a military spouse who wrote to me that she and other military dependents turn to Planned Parenthood because of long wait times and confidentiality concerns within the military healthcare system. Taylor wrote:       My friend was experiencing severe cramping and pelvic pain      to the point where she had to utilize a sick day. When she      visited the medical services provider through the military,      they scheduled her for an appointment for four days out. She      was sent home with no pelvic exam or ultrasound. The pain was      so severe that she went to Planned Parenthood because she      could not wait to see her primary care physician. They      immediately performed a pelvic exam, an ultrasound, and an      STD screening. She was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory      disease. Annually, 100,000 women become infertile as a result      of PID, so receiving quick treatment for this condition is      critical.  Taylor continued:       Defunding Planned Parenthood means that individuals who      experience common reproductive healthcare issues like this      would have lessened chances of receiving quick, necessary and      comprehensive medical care. Had it not been for Planned      Parenthood, she could have lost her ability to have children      in the future.  Do my Republican colleagues want to deprive military spouses of vital healthcare services?  I also heard from Tiffany, a student at the University of Hawaii, who went to a Planned Parenthood clinic after a pregnancy scare. She wrote:       I was afraid because I knew that having a child was beyond      my means. I was just starting out my university years at 21;      and I have extremely conservative parents who would have      surely not approved of my actions. I knew how difficult      having a child was for someone in my situation, especially      while going to school, and risking sacrificing my future, my      key to stepping out of poverty, was not an option. I was      unemployed and had Medicaid at the time as well, and Planned      Parenthood accommodated my financial situation.       Thankfully, I discovered I was not pregnant, and Planned      Parenthood took the extra time to sit me through my options      without any judgment whatsoever. I was also prescribed birth      control, offered an STD test, and was given Plan B in the      event I ever missed my birth control. The sense of relief,      reassurance, and care I felt walking out of the clinic left      me with a very strong impression, especially after so many      days of anxiety.  Do my Republican colleagues want to take away resources that help thousands of young women like Tiffany fulfill their full potential?  These stories aren't rhetoric. They aren't hyperbole. They aren't spin. They are powerful reminders that each day, women turn to Planned Parenthood in a time of need.[[Page S2125]]  Some of my colleagues have argued that all these thousands of women who go to Planned Parenthood clinics can go to community health centers if Planned Parenthood clinics have to close because of defunding.  This morning, I met with over a dozen leaders from Hawaii's community health centers. So I asked them, could you take in all of Planned Parenthood's patients? Their answer was an unequivocal no. Our communities cannot afford to lose Planned Parenthood clinics.  A vote for this CRA is a vote to deprive women like Taylor and Tiffany and millions more throughout our country of these important healthcare services. Let's stop these attacks on women's healthcare.

5264,topic-id,1296,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.Raskin), my friend and colleague, and I thank my other colleagues also who are here today to shine a light on the abuses that happened last week and last weekend with the executive order that was passed and signed into law by this  Mr.Speaker, this order is in direct contrast with the values that this country was built on: foremost, to be a refuge. That is how so many people in the history of this country have come here. Instead, our President has chosen to close the doors on people who are fleeing violence in their home countries, and it is based on their religion.  This ban is discrimination in its purest form. It does not make us safer. In fact, Mr.Speaker, I believe that doing what we did has actually put fodder into the hands of those who really do wish to do us harm by being able to say that America hates Muslims, that America hates Islam, and that America hates immigrants and refugees, none of which is true to the history and the founding of this country.  The reality, Mr.Speaker, is that the International Rescue Committee has said that it is more challenging for refugees to get into the United States than anyone else. They are the most heavily vetted group there is. As you can see here, there are 20 steps involved in the process, and those who do get approved have been through the most rigorous background checks, fingerprinting, and questioning.  Instead of making us safer, this ban is simply throwing people into chaos. Many of us over this last weekend went to our airports across the country--Dulles; New York; Seattle, Washington, my hometown. We were called to the airport because there was chaos that erupted across the country, chaos that erupted at the airports, because people who had legal documents to come to the United States were coming in and being told that the executive order meant that they no longer could actually stay here in this country.  Mr.President, what happened then for me, when I went to the Sea-Tac Airport at 1 in the afternoon on Saturday, I found a Somali family who had been waiting, a U.citizen woman who had been waiting to be reunited with her husband. She believed that finally she was going to get to hold him in her arms. Instead, Mr.Speaker, what happened is that he was put on a plane and sent back to Heathrow, but perhaps somewhere else. We were not given any information about what was going to happen to that gentleman.  We found out that there were two additional individuals who were already put on a plane ready to be deported. We, along with the ACLU, the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, and our governor, were able to file for a temporary restraining order. We were able to take that restraining order on our phone to the plane and say: Stop this plane.  That literally, Mr.Speaker, is how we were able to get those two people off of the plane. We were able to then get them legal counsel after much intervention.  Mr.Speaker, it should not be this way. This is a country that was built by immigrants. It is a country that has welcomed people from across the world to come here as a refuge, as a sanctuary. My State of Washington is one of the top States in the country for refugee resettlement. The reality is we are destroying the very principles of compassion, of humanity, of being a refuge, of building this country with immigrants and refugees.  Literally thousands of people came to the airport to say: We welcome refugees; we welcome immigrants.  This is not the America that we know and love. We are better than this.  This is not the first time I have had to fight against these illegal deportations. After 9/11, we had similar situations, not as bad as this, but we had the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, It required that men from 25 Muslim and Arab countries were going to be fingerprinted and registered. This was under the Bush administration. At the time, Attorney General John Ashcroft said: You are either with the terrorists or you are with us.  That is a false choice, Mr.The reality is that security and liberty do not oppose each other. They go hand in hand, and we cannot sacrifice one for the sake of the other.  Mr.Speaker, we were able to fight that, and we finally did end that special registration program, but now here we are again. We know the shame of history when we have not been on the right side of it. We know that in 1942, 125,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry were put into internment camps, and it took us a very long time to come back and apologize. Mr.Speaker, when we did, we said we will never do that[[Page H924]]again. Yet, here we are for the first time again instituting a religious test as to who can get into this country.  Let us be clear that it is a Muslim ban. It does not mean that every single Muslim country necessarily has been targeted yet. But what it does mean is that Muslims are being scrutinized in a different way simply for being  A constituent of mine called my office this week to tell me another very disturbing story, and she told me that I could tell it here on the floor. She was passing through immigration into Houston on her way back home from Angelina Godoy was traveling back from Central America where she was doing research. She is a U.citizen. She said she was so alarmed by what happened to her that she wanted to call and get it on the record.  Angelina is a human rights professor and she has traveled through immigration many times. This was the first time she said she had experienced anything like this. Her immigration officer asked her about her political views. When she said that she was deeply concerned about the President's actions, he asked her why she wasn't concerned with all the refugees that were flooding into our borders. And he used that word ``flooding.'' When she said she didn't think that they were flooding in, he told her that she can't tell him that based on the fake news she is seeing on television.  Mr.Speaker, this is incredibly disturbing. Are we going to now check the views of every U.citizen who is coming into the our borders to see whether they agree with these executive orders or not?  Well, I am here to tell you that it may be the thought that fear and patriotism together is the way to suppress dissent. We will not be suppressed with fighting for the very values that make us great.  In cities around the country, what gives me hope is that people stood up to stand up against this hatred. The Muslim ban is unconstitutional, and we are standing here today to demand that it be repealed.  You can see here the chart that I referred to earlier. There are 20 steps that you must go through in order to be screened. Syrian refugees are probably the most screened individuals in our country today. And there are 5 million Syrian refugees who are pouring out of the country.  Mr.Speaker, this is not a time to turn our backs on them. This is a time to make sure that we are taking care of the women, the children, the families, the majority of refugees to this country who are women and children and families.

Today, approximately 11.5 million students are enrolled in CTE, encompassing every State through nearly 1,700 two-year and thousands more secondary CTE centers, comprehensive high schools career academies and CTE high schools.

Tens of thousands of people in northern Ohio and millions across America will lose insurance if TrumpCare becomes law.  This bill is cruel. It will take away care from some of our most vulnerable citizens like those who suffer from opioid addiction, mental illness or have disabilities. This bill will undermine Medicare and cut $28 billion from Ohio's Medicaid program, the majority of which is spent on nursing home care. If Republicans succeed in repealing the Medicaid expansion, one in four Ohio hospitals would close according to the Ohio Hospital  Our goal should be to make our health care system better, not worse. This merciless bill is not a health care bill. This bill is an $800 billion tax cut for corporations and the very rich. How that giveaway provides better health care to working and middle-class families is beyond me.  For Lent I gave up chocolate, I recommend the Republicans try giving up tax cuts to the rich!  Let me share a story about a young man in Ohio who was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of cancer one month before his 26th birthday.  Once he turned 26 he lost coverage under his parent's health care policy.  But after visiting an Ohio Jobs and Family Services office, he learned about his eligibility for the Ohio Medicaid expansion, which allowed him to receive the cancer treatment he needed to survive.  Frankly, without the Affordable Care Act's multi-layered protections, he would be dead.  The Affordable Care Act and its Medicaid expansion has allowed him to return to finish law school.  This bill shifts the burden of health costs to the working and middle class, all so the rich can have a trillion dollar tax cut. A tax cut for the super rich doesn't help working people and seniors pay for health care. Astoundingly, the falsely labeled, so called ``health'' bill actually rewards billionaires and corporations with hundreds of billions in tax giveaways.  This bill does nothing to control costs for health insurance. Millions will lose coverage. It will actually result in higher costs too all while undermining Medicare and slashing  Congress ought to repair not repeal the We cannot move backward.

What will this poorly conceived Republican tax giveaway bill do to Ohio:  1. About 47,000 people will lose health insurance because they are insured through the ACA in Ohio's 9th district.  2. The district's uninsured rate has gone from 13.3% to 7.0% since the ACA was implemented. This 6.3 percentage point drop in the uninsured rate could be reversed if the ACA is entirely or partially repealed.  3. 318,900 individuals in the district who now have health insurance that covers preventive services like cancer screenings and flu shots without any co-pays, coinsurance, or deductibles stand to lose this access if the Republican Congress eliminates ACA provisions requiring health insurers to cover important preventive services without cost-sharing.  4. 370,700 individuals in the district with employer-sponsored health insurance are at risk of losing important consumer protections like the prohibition on annual and lifetime limits, protection against unfair policy rescissions, and coverage of preexisting health conditions, if the ACA is entirely or partially repealed.

For families in America, that is the simple expectation of our country's healthcare system, a commitment that our society makes to care for one another in our time of deepest need because our health is our great equalizer.

It is a simple explanation. This is a tax cut bill for the most wealthy in the guise of healthcare reform. That is unfortunate because it is a missed opportunity of fixing what isn't currently working in the healthcare system.

But there are things that need to be fixed, and we have to stay focused on reducing healthcare costs for all Let's continue to work on delivery system reform and payment reform so we get better results at a better price.  But a bill before us that increases the uninsured by 24 million, that delivers huge tax breaks to the most wealthy, that applies a new older American tax, especially in rural areas like mine in Wisconsin, and that robs money from the Medicare trust fund is not only a missed opportunity, it is bad legislation.

5385,topic-id,562,"Mr.President, I rise to join my colleagues in speaking about the harmful effects of this resolution of disapproval.  I thank the Senator from Michigan for his words and for the very important point that we are seeing the lowest number of teen pregnancies that we have seen for a long, long time. Why would you want to mess with something that is finally reducing the number of teen pregnancies?  I thank Senator Murray, who has been here diligently leading in this effort, because rolling this rule back will result in something very simple: It will result in less access to care for women and families.  Title X funding supports vital family planning and related preventive care for low-income, uninsured, and young people across this country. Every year, more than 4 million people, including many who are living in rural and medically underserved areas, go to the over 4,000 health centers that rely on this funding. This includes 41 service sites in Minnesota that provide access to cancer screenings, birth control, and testing for sexually transmitted infections. In fact, 40 percent of women who receive care at title X clinics consider it to be their only source of healthcare--40 percent--which is incredibly important in rural areas.  One thinks of, just recently, in the last few years, the Zika scare. People wanted to go and get birth control. They wanted to know what they could do to prevent themselves from getting Zika in order to save the lives of their babies. This is true, and this is what will be happening if they make these cuts.  The regulation we are voting on today should be common sense. It simply makes clear that funds will be awarded solely based on a provider's ability to serve a patient, and it guarantees that women have access to the care they are entitled to under Federal law.  We should be strengthening our efforts to provide better and more affordable care that best serves patients. Instead, repealing this rule will take essential services away from women when they need them most. By overriding this regulation, States will now pick and choose who provides these services, which will be based on arbitrary criteria that has nothing to do with the quality of services patients will receive. That should be our benchmark--the quality of services.  When States have done this in the past, it has blocked access to critical family planning and healthcare services for many women, including those in rural areas who rely on the health centers that need these funds.  As Senator Murray said this morning, women across the country have made it clear that restricting women's access to the full range of reproductive care is unacceptable.  We have a situation in which this existing rule has yielded the lowest number of teen pregnancies in years. We have a situation in which two of our Republican colleagues have joined us in opposition to this repeal. We have a situation in which the Vice President of the United States had to come in and break a tie.  Do you know what I would say?

Certainly that is what I am hearing from women from the State of  Three months into the 115th Congress, the Senate has yet to consider real legislation aimed at addressing the many challenges we Americans face today. Instead, the Senate, with simple-majority votes--permissible through the rarely used Congressional Review Act--is rolling back key protections for the American people that were put in place by the last administration. Never mind that the current administration has the power to address certain aspects of regulations that they wish to rewrite. They could address these. They could seek a rewriting of them. They could seek legislation. But, instead, Republicans in Congress are intent on using this blunt procedure to unravel years of very careful and deliberative work. These raw power plays are part of the Trump-Republican ``know-nothing, anti-science'' agenda, in which the winners are not the American people. They are not the women of my They are not the average person you might meet. Instead, they are typically the wealthy and powerful special interests and big polluters. They win, and the losers are real  Today, we are considering the 12th such resolution, one that rolls back protections under the Title X program. Title X of the Public Health Service Act is the only Federal grant program dedicated to providing those eligible with comprehensive family planning and preventive health services. In rural areas--and every single State has a rural area, but my State is especially rural--we know that Title X is crucial in making sure women have access to the basic healthcare they need. Unfortunately, in recent years, some States have made exceptions about which providers may deliver services under Title X, excluding family planning clinics.  Seeing the burden these rules would place on women seeking healthcare, the Obama administration finalized a regulation in December 2016 that protects these providers from this type of discrimination, and women from these hardships. The resolution we are considering today would undo this regulation, once again allowing States to discriminate against providers, thereby limiting access to healthcare services for millions--that is not hyperbole; it really is millions--of women and their families. Worse still, the resolution would prevent a similar rule or regulation from being implemented in the future.  In Vermont, our sole Title X provider is Planned Even in a State as rural as Vermont, no one has to drive longer than 45 minutes to reach a clinic. That is important to us. We consider 4 to 5 inches of snow a heavy dusting, but we often have 10 to 15 inches of snow. Nobody should have to drive farther than that to reach healthcare.[[Page S2129]]  This type of access is critical for those who need these services. It is especially important because for 40 percent of women, their visit to a family planning health center is the only healthcare they receive during the year. Vermonters are lucky because our State recognizes that this issue isn't about abortion, it is about ensuring the best network of providers for the people of our But other States have already worked to undermine family planning clinics like Planned  The passage of this resolution will allow these discriminatory efforts to advance, especially discriminatory efforts against women. There is no question about it: A vote for this resolution is a vote against women. This resolution would not only affect the lives of millions of American women, but it would also affect the lives of men and young people who trust and depend on family planning clinics for their basic healthcare needs, including for annual health exams, cervical and breast cancer screenings, and HIV screenings.  Last year in Vermont--keep in mind that Vermont has a population of just over 600,000 people--Planned Parenthood centers provided vital primary and preventive services to more than 16,000 patients. In a small State like Vermont, this harmful impact cannot be overstated.  Those who support this resolution argue that the States should be able to determine who receives Title X grants, and that women under this program can simply find another clinic to go to. Well, that is simply not the case. In fact, that argument is false. It is a lie. Family planning clinics overwhelmingly serve populations in rural and medically underserved parts of the country where access to healthcare, especially for low-income individuals, is difficult.  It is easy--easy--for Senators to vote to cut off this healthcare for women and children and people in rural areas because each one of us, if we need healthcare, can walk 2 minutes down this hall and walk to the Capitol physician and say ``I am a U.I need healthcare,'' and we are going to get it. While that may be the reality for 100 people in this body, it is not the reality for millions and millions of people in every single State we represent.  What this partisan resolution would do is force women and families in States who depend on family planning clinics for their healthcare to find another doctor--and often very few are available--or what is more likely, go without care at all. So they don't get preventive care, they don't get checkups, and they don't find the first indication that they may be facing melanoma or some other serious health problem. That undermines all of our efforts, which we should be joining, to strengthen our Nation's healthcare system, to try to make our healthcare system at least as good as many other countries', and to ensure access to care for everyone.  This Republican resolution marks just the latest overreach and intrusion into women's healthcare.  We even voted for a resolution to allow people to spy on what you do on the internet, and then sell that information for their own profit, destroying your privacy, but making money doing it.  Until the House failed to even take it up, the Senate was scheduled to consider a reconciliation bill this week that would have defunded Planned Parenthood and would have allowed health insurers to deny coverage for maternity care, thus requiring women to pay more for health insurance.  In the last Congress, it was more of the same--deny coverage for maternity care, and then go out and say: We believe in the right to life. Clearly not so much for the mother when she needs maternity care.  Should we really walk back from the remarkable progress we have made as a nation in women's health? Of course not. But I am concerned that we will still see the same irresponsible attack surfacing again and again.  Look, it is 2016; it is not 1917. It is time for the mean-spirited and ideological assaults on women's healthcare to end. Women are not second-class citizens. My wife is not, my daughter is not, and my three granddaughters are not.

In fact, in ordinary times, these nominees would be unanimously confirmed during wrap-up on the Senate floor.                            richard boulware  Mr.President, one nominee we are not considering today is Judge Richard Boulware, whom President Obama nominated in 2015 to fill a seat on the Sentencing Commission previously held by Judge Ketanji Brown Judge Boulware was confirmed to serve as a district judge in June 2014, becoming the first African-American man to serve on the U.District Court for the District of His nomination to the Sentencing Commission had the strong support of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which said that Judge Boulware would ``bring a much needed and valuable perspective to the work of the Commission because of his experience.'' Judge Boulware clerked in the Southern District of New York, served as a Federal public defender, and represented the Las Vegas branch of the NAACP on a range of issues, including voting rights, police cameras, and solitary confinement.  Despite his clear qualifications, Senate Republicans blocked Judge Boulware, and his nomination was returned to the White House at the end of last year. President Trump renominated Judge Reeves and Judge Breyer, but I am disappointed that he failed to do the same for Judge The Sentencing Commission does not have a single person of Color serving as a commissioner; yet its work on criminal justice issues has a significant effect on communities of color. Judge Boulware should have been confirmed last year, along with Judge Reeves and Judge While I support the two nominees before us today, I want the Record to note my deep disappointment and concern that Judge Boulware is not among them.  For nearly a decade, I have worked with Senators from both parties on bipartisan legislation to reform our criminal justice system. The Sentencing Commission has also studied the issue and brought about needed change to the sentencing guidelines. The Bureau of Prisons continues to consume nearly a quarter of the Justice Department's budget, even as violent crime rates have gone down; but instead of taking meaningful steps to reduce these costs, the Trump-Sessions Justice Department has signaled it intends to more aggressively charge low-level offenders with crimes carrying mandatory minimums. The Attorney General also lifted restrictions on the use of private prisons that serve only the interest of wealthy corporations. This is deeply troubling on moral grounds. Incarceration should not be a for-profit business. It is also troubling to me in my role as vice chairman of the Appropriations Instead of wasting taxpayer dollars on private prisons, we should be directing our limited resources to train and protect officers on the streets and to reduce recidivism and crime.  The Sentencing Commission has brought much-needed fairness to the Guidelines in the past, and I hope it will continue to do so once its new members are confirmed, Although we should also be voting today on Judge Boulware's nomination to the commission--rather, we should have voted on it last year--I will support the nominations of Judge Breyer and Judge                           breyer nomination  ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgS1862-2.txt,1383,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY,2017.0,21.0,March

I have heard from hospitals, doctors, patients, nurses, parents of children with serious illnesses, researchers and the list goes on. They have one thing in common: they are afraid of what TrumpCare could do to their patients and to their families.  H.1628 will not bring down health care costs or improve access. Indeed, by slashing Medicaid by $880 billion, it will force States to ration care for our most vulnerable populations.

It is also a disgrace that the funding being cut out of Medicaid is being handed over to insurance companies and the wealthiest Americans in a $1 trillion tax break for the rich.  TrumpCare slashes $175 billion from the Medicare Trust Fund, cutting its solvency by three years and hurts seniors by letting insurance companies charge older Americans five times more than they do young ones.

5393,topic-id,489,"Mr.President, we are here today because Republicans' discrimination against women knows no boundaries. They think a woman's right to choose is still up for discussion. It is not.  Let me be clear. A woman's right to choose is a discussion for a woman and her doctor. That is it. A healthcare provider receiving Federal funds should be judged on their ability to serve a patient. That is it.  Today, Republicans are voting on a measure that would allow States to discriminate against family planning providers simply because they do not like the populations they treat or the services they provide. It would embolden a State to restrict Federal funding for only health centers that serve primarily minority populations or patients who identify as LGBTQ, and it would allow a State to strip away Federal investments in family planning[[Page S2137]]clinics that serve women's reproductive health needs.  These are not hypothetical concerns. Women's reproductive care is under attack by extreme rightwing Republicans across this country. State politicians introduced more than 500 bills restricting access to reproductive healthcare in 2016, enacting more than 60 new abortion restrictions last year.  Let's be clear. The result of today's vote means that there will be less access to care for women and families across this country. Health centers receiving title X funding provide basic primary and preventive healthcare services, such as HIV testing and contraception, to more than 4 million women and men at nearly 4,000 healthcare centers nationwide. It is because of the work done at these centers that we are now at a 30-year low in unintended pregnancies, a historic low in teen pregnancies, and we have the lowest rate of abortions since the Supreme Court ruled that abortion was legal in 1973. We are a healthier Nation because of family planning clinics that receive title X funding.  Now, more than ever, we need to stand and raise our voice against the Republican Party's agenda of discrimination. It is about fighting for the freedom to make decisions in our personal lives without the fear of interference from our own government. It is about the access to opportunity that comes from quality, affordable healthcare and making sure that access is never restricted, no matter what gender you are. But with Donald Trump as President and both Chambers of Congress now controlled by the GOP, national Republicans are in the best position in decades to enact a radical agenda that rolls back women's rights. Today is just one step in their massive plan to take women's rights right back to the 19th century.

5386,topic-id,604,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today, just as I have many times before, to stop another rightwing attack on title X funding and to defend access to healthcare for millions of women.  Not even a week has passed since the American people successfully beat back Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and give insurance companies permission to charge women higher premiums simply because of their gender. Yet apparently less than a week is not too soon for Republicans to launch yet another attack on women's access to healthcare. This morning, my Republican colleagues needed the Vice President of the United States to come to Capitol Hill and cast a vote to overturn protections for 4 million patients served by title X funded health centers every year.  For many low-income women, title X funding is the lifeline that ensures their access to birth control, testing for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screenings, and other basic health services. In fact, 85 percent of the people served by family planning centers like Planned Parenthood have incomes below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. Approximately 20 percent of these patients identify as Latina, and approximately 14 percent identify as  In 2015 alone, title X funded nearly 800,000 Pap tests, breast exams to 1 million women, nearly 5 million tests for STIs, and 1 million HIV tests. Title X did not pay for a single abortion. Indeed, no Federal funding goes to abortion-related care. And indeed, for every dollar that title X funding spent, we saved about $4 and prevented nearly 2 million unintended pregnancies per year.  Family planning services at New Jersey's title X funded health centers[[Page S2135]]helped prevent 20,500 unintended pregnancies in 2014, which would have likely resulted in 10,000 unintended births and 7,400 abortions. Without publicly funded family planning, the number of unintended pregnancies in New Jersey would be 21 percent higher. Title X funded services produce significant cost savings to the Federal and State governments. Services provided at title X supported sites in New Jersey accounted for nearly $232.9 million in such savings in 2010 alone.  I hope President Trump knows that when my Republican colleagues vote to defund Planned Parenthood, they aren't voting to stop a single abortion; they are voting to defund the family planning care that helps avoid unwanted pregnancies and reduce the need for abortion.  A vote to defund title X is a vote to defund breast cancer exams. A vote to defund title X is a vote to defund cervical cancer screenings. A vote to defund title X is a vote to defund testing for sexually transmitted diseases.  The American people--those who voted for President Trump--voted for more affordable healthcare, certainly not less. Not one of my Republican colleagues has come to the floor to make the case in favor of repealing title X--not one. But if my Republican colleagues prevail in this cynical vote, they will jeopardize access to affordable family planning services; they will force many health centers to stop providing care to patients; and they will leave doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers working on the frontlines to abandon those who need them the most.  I, for one, refuse to allow the GOP to pander to the extreme elements of their party and in doing so limit a woman's access to affordable, accessible healthcare.

5375,topic-id,904,"Mr.President, last week the Senate watched the House and the American people watched the House because the House was on the verge of taking away access to healthcare for 24 million Then last Thursday, a week ago from today, the House said: We are going to postpone that vote. We are not sure we have the votes to take healthcare away from 24 million Americans, but maybe we will vote tomorrow,  That was 6 days ago. Friday came, and the House said: No, we are not going to do that vote today because we don't have the votes.  Why didn't they have the votes? Because across the country, millions of Americans said that taking away healthcare is the wrong thing to do--to take away healthcare from Medicaid expansion, the Oregon Health Plan; to take away healthcare by restricting standard Medicaid as it existed before ACA; to take away the healthcare bill of rights that people so much appreciated; to undermine the ability of low-income working families to buy policies with significant subsidies on the exchange--all of that.  The House set it aside. I thought that was tremendous because this week, we are not going to have a diabolical bill destroying healthcare here on the floor of the But the majority party decided: No, we can't go a week without destroying healthcare, so we are going to put up this Congressional Review Act that would take healthcare away from 5 million mostly low-income women who gain access to healthcare through Planned We won't bring up on the floor the bill that failed in the House for 24 million Americans; no, we will just focus on 5 million mostly low-income women and take away their healthcare.  That is what this vote is about right now, later today. Clearly this attack on healthcare for women across America is wrong, just as it was wrong to try to destroy healthcare for 24 million It is an attack on women's right to choose what to do with their own bodies. It is an attack on the basic decency and compassion of the American people.  Since 1970, the title X family planning provider network has been dedicated to providing individuals with comprehensive family planning and critical health services, such as screenings for breast and prostate cancer and sexually transmitted diseases.  Just in 2015 alone, title X provided basic primary and preventive healthcare services, including Pap tests and breast exams and birth control and HIV testing, to more than 4 million low-income women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers across the country. That is a huge impact on the health of the individuals served through title  In 2010, title X services prevented 87,000 preterm or low birth weight births. I can tell you, when my wife Mary was carrying each of our two[[Page S2131]]children, I so much hoped that we would not have a complication that would result in a low birth weight birth or a preterm birth in which the child might not even survive. So failing to provide that care is really setting back not just the health of thousands of babies but maybe affecting whether they live or die.  Title X services prevented 2,000 cases of cervical cancer. That is a big deal, cervical cancer, and it is a good deed to have title X services preventing it.  For 40 percent of women in America, their visit to a title X family planning health center is the only healthcare they receive annually.  So let's be honest about what repealing this rule means. It means family planning providers can be discriminated against by States that want to withhold Federal funding from family planning providers for reasons other than their ability to offer family planning services. It means less access to quality care and less access to affordable care.  By overriding this regulation, Republicans empower States to pick and choose who provides services on a criteria that has nothing to do with the quality of care patients receive. States have done this in the past, and it resulted in dramatically fewer women accessing critical family planning and healthcare services.  We know what this is about. It is about any Federal funding for Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides care and resources to 5 million women every year. They have been doing it for 100 years. And they are the target. But what has been their mission? Their mission has been to provide easy and affordable access to address reproductive health and enable women to make their own decisions about their healthcare. But now, thanks to this Congressional Review Act proposal before us, that principle is under attack, that principle of easy and affordable access to women's healthcare and women's control over healthcare choices, to keep the politicians out of their choices. This resolution is about putting the politician in charge of the individual healthcare decisions of women in America, and that is just wrong.  I encourage my colleagues to take a close look at this. You were spared having to vote on eliminating healthcare for 24 million Americans, but now you are required today to vote on eliminating healthcare for 5 million women--mostly low-income women--in Are you going to attack the healthcare of those women? Are you going to injure the babies they are carrying? There will be more low birth weight and preterm babies. That is the wrong thing to do.  Vote no.

5356,topic-id,1190,"Mr.President, this vote had to be held open in order to allow time for Vice President Pence to come down and break a tie.  My colleagues and I came to the floor weeks ago to make clear that this harmful legislation should not come to the floor. Republicans didn't listen to us, and they didn't listen to women across the country who made it clear that restricting women's access to the full range of reproductive care is unacceptable. We are not going to give up. We are going to keep holding them accountable, and we are going to keep making sure that women's voices are heard.  I want to thank all of my colleagues who have already come and will continue to come to the floor today to stand against this shameful, dangerous resolution.  The march that was held after President Trump was inaugurated was one of the most inspiring events I have ever had the opportunity to be a part of. Millions of people--men and women--marched in Seattle in my home State, here in Washington, DC, and in cities and towns in between and all across the world. They carried signs, they chanted, and they made it absolutely clear that when it comes to women's rights and healthcare, people across the country do not want to go backward. Since then, millions of people have continued to speak up and stand up. And last Friday, by the way, was no different.  Republicans have been threatening for years now to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, but it took just a few weeks for families nationwide to stand up and fight back and shut down a deeply harmful plan that would have taken healthcare away from tens of millions of people, spiked our premiums, targeted seniors for higher costs, and cut off access to critical services at Planned  I was so inspired by the countless people who bravely shared their personal stories about their health and their loved ones in order to make clear just how damaging--and even deadly--TrumpCare would have been. I am proud to say that women led the way and made it known, in no uncertain terms, that Republicans would be held fully accountable for the disastrous TrumpCare legislation.  And try as they might, last week, Republicans couldn't ignore them. This was an absolute, undeniable victory for women and families in this country.  But while TrumpCare was dealt a significant blow last week, it is clear the terrible ideas that underpin it live on now, today, in this Republican It is unprecedented that we are here, with the Vice President breaking a tie vote on an attack on women's health across this country.  We are here today, once again, because President Trump and Republicans in Congress are not getting the message. Today, continuing on their extreme, anti-women agenda, Senate Republicans are rushing now to roll back a rule that protects family planning providers from being discriminated against and denied Federal funding.  Let me explain a little bit about what family planning providers mean to our communities. Those providers that are part of the title X program--which has, by the way, bipartisan history--deliver critical healthcare services nationwide, and they are especially needed in our rural and our frontier areas.  In 2015 alone, title X provided basic primary and preventive healthcare services--services like Pap tests and breast exams and birth control and HIV testing--to more than 4 million low-income women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers. In my home State of Washington, tens of thousands of patients are able to receive care at these centers each year, and they often have nowhere else to turn for their healthcare. In fact, 40 percent of women who receive care at health centers funded by title X consider it to be their only source of healthcare.[[Page S2123]]  So taking resources away from these providers, which this resolution would do, would be cruel, and it would have the greatest impact on women and families who need it the most. It would undo a valuable effort by the Obama administration to ensure that healthcare providers are evaluated for Federal funding based on their ability to provide the services in question, not on ideology. In doing so, this resolution would make it even easier for States led by extreme politicians to deny family planning providers Federal dollars, not because of the quality of care that they get or provide or their value to the communities they serve, but based on whether the politicians in charge--the politicians in charge--agree that women should be able to exercise their constitutionally protected right to reproductive healthcare.  This is wrong. It is dangerous, and we cannot let this stand.  If Republicans think that millions of people who stood up last week have suddenly stopped paying attention, they are sorely mistaken. And if they think that Senate Democrats are not going to fight back, they have another thing coming. They can expect every single Democrat in the Senate--and I hope some Republicans who are concerned about losing healthcare providers in their States--to fight back against this resolution with everything they have.  This vote won by a tie vote, and the Vice President was the tie vote. It will take one Republican this afternoon on the final vote to say yes for the women in their State and States' rights to say no. That is all we are asking for the women of this country.  While I have the floor, I want to say we should all be aware there is more headed our way. In a matter of weeks, we all know that government funding is going to run out. Everybody understands this. I know that since they didn't get their way last week and they are pushing this resolution so hard today to the point where they bring the Vice President to break a tie, it is a safe bet that extreme Republicans are going to try to attach riders that try to take away Planned Parenthood funding in the spending bill for the rest of this year.  So I want to be very clear from the outset: That is a complete nonstarter. We have been here before. We have shown that we can win, and we are going to fight these efforts every step of the way.  So I urge people across the country to let their Senators know that this is not acceptable. Stand up for women and families and for their rights to take care of their own reproductive healthcare at the facility that provides for them in their own communities.  I urge my colleagues: Don't make the same mistake again. End the damaging political attacks on women, and stand with millions of women and men and families. They need us.  Thank you.

5362,topic-id,1475,"Madam President, I want to thank my colleagues who are here speaking out against this shameful resolution that is before us today that goes after women's rights and their opportunity to make their own healthcare decisions with their own provider.  I, too, want to echo the comments that were just made. I find it amazing that the Republicans have yielded back all of their time. They are not going to come out here and defend their vote; they are just going to take the vote.  In fact, it seems clear to me that President Trump is clearly focused on attacking women's healthcare--so much so that he sent his women's health adviser, Vice President Pence, here just moments ago to break a tie on this latest disgusting attack on women's healthcare. It is truly appalling.[[Page S2126]]  Women and men across the country are watching what is happening here today, watching what Republicans are trying to do, and they are paying attention.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Madam President, I wish today's resolution was the only shameful attack on women's health to talk about, but sadly that is not the case. So I do want to take a few minutes at this time to talk about another one that is very critical to women and families--not just today, but actually for years and years to come it will be happening, and that is the Supreme  Last week I announced I would be voting against Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court, and I will oppose a cloture motion ending debate. I did not reach that conclusion lightly. I consider my decisions about whether to support a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court to be among the most important and consequential choices I make as a But I made it in part because this is not a normal nomination.  This process really began about 12 months ago when Senate Republicans refused to even consider President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Merrick And because since President Trump entered office, he has shown complete disregard for the law, for our Constitution, for the well-being of families across the country, leaving me unable to trust that he is acting in our Nation's best interest, I am unable to support his choice for the Supreme  In addition to my deep concerns about this process and this administration, I also have strong concerns about this nominee specifically. Today, as Republicans appear to be rushing Judge Gorsuch's nomination through the Judiciary Committee as fast as they can, I want to lay out why putting Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court would be an attack on women's health, rights, and opportunity, one that has the potential to undo decades of progress we have made toward making sure women are equally able to participate in and contribute to our country.  The Trump administration has broken almost every one of its promises, but one it has certainly kept is its promise to do everything in its power to turn back the clock on women's health and women's rights. Extreme Republicans in Congress are doing the same and have more, apparently, in store. Right now, we are debating whether to undo a rule that prevents discrimination against family planning providers based on the kinds of services they provide to women. Congressional Republicans are already gearing up to attach riders to the coming budget bills in order to cut off access to critical services at Planned Parenthood for millions of patients in this country. There are similar attempts to undermine women's access to healthcare in cities and States nationwide.  More often than we would like, the Supreme Court is going to be the place of last resort for protecting women's hard-fought gains. The buck has to stop with the Supreme Court on women's health and rights.  I do not want Judge Neil Gorsuch anywhere near the bench. Time and again, Judge Gorsuch has sided with the extreme rightwing and against the tens of millions of women and men who believe that in this 21st century, women should be able to make their own choices about their own bodies.  Let me give a few examples. When the Tenth Circuit ruled in the case of Hobby Lobby v. Burwell that a women's boss--a woman's boss--could decide whether her insurance would include birth control, Judge Gorsuch didn't just agree, he thought the ruling should have gone further. That alone would be enough for me to oppose this nomination, but unfortunately there is more.  Judge Gorsuch has argued that birth control coverage included in the ACA as an essential part of a woman's healthcare--one that has now benefited 55 million women--is what he calls a ``clear burden'' on employers that would not long survive.  When it comes to Planned Parenthood, he has already weighed in on the side of defunding our Nation's largest provider of women's healthcare. What was his reasoning? Well, Judge Gorsuch thought that in light of completely discredited sting videos taken by extreme conservatives, women in the State of Utah should have a harder time accessing the care they need. Just this week, the makers of those false videos, by the way, got 15 felony charges. Women deserve independence and objectivity in a Supreme Court Justice, and that is clearly not it.  Attempts to control women's bodies aren't always about reproductive rights. Sure enough, Judge Gorsuch is on the wrong side here as well. He concurred in a ruling against a transgender woman who was denied regular access to hormone therapy while she was in prison. This ruling rejected the idea that under our Constitution, denying healthcare services is cruel and unusual punishment. Think about that. That is not the kind of judgment I want to see on the bench, and I think most families would agree.  I also want to be clear as well about what Judge Gorsuch's nomination could mean for a woman's constitutionally protected right to safe, legal abortion services under the historic ruling in Roe v. Wade, which was, by the way, reaffirmed just last summer by the In his nomination hearings, Judge Gorsuch wouldn't give a clear answer on whether he would uphold this ruling which has meant so much to so many women and families over the last four decades.  Judge Gorsuch has donated repeatedly to politicians who are dead-set on interfering with women's constitutionally protected healthcare decisions, and he has even made deeply inaccurate comparisons between abortion and assisted suicide.  I remember the days before Roe v. Wade very clearly. I heard and saw firsthand the stories of women faced with truly impossible choices during those times. Women from all across the country have shared deeply personal experiences because they know what it would mean to go backward. I know that millions of women who have already done so much to lead the resistance against this administration and its damaging, divisive agenda are going to fight this nomination as hard as they can. They know the Trump Presidency will be damaging enough for 4 years, but Judge Gorsuch's nomination could roll back progress for women over a lifetime. I am proud to stand with them and do everything I can to make sure they are heard loud and clear here in the Senate, and I oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination in light of everything it would mean for women now and for generations to come. Next week is when we will vote on that.  Today here in the Senate, we just saw a historic moment. The Senate Republicans put forth a resolution that would allow States to deny funding to providers in their States who provide healthcare services for women--funding that is desperately needed. They got only 50 votes, and those in opposition got 50 votes, so they brought over the Vice President of the United States, and he broke that tie in order for us to be here to debate this resolution now. This vote will now occur, under the order, later this afternoon, and he will be brought back once again to deny women the healthcare choices they deserve to have. It is a sad day for the  I want my friends, colleagues, and the women who have stood up and have spoken out since the day after the election, marched here in Washington, DC, and across the country, to know that I stand with them. My voice will not be silenced. I will continue to fight back.  I will say one more time that it will take one more Republican on the other side this afternoon--one--to stand up and let their voice be heard and say that women should get access equally in their States for the healthcare they deserve.

5379,topic-id,864,"Mr.President, I have to say that this is a sad day for the I know many of us here today--certainly my Democratic colleagues--are truly appalled. Once[[Page S2132]]again, instead of working on the many pressing issues at hand, Republicans are continuing their tired, dangerous obsession with attacking women's health.  Once again, women's health is being used as a political football, with Republicans attempting to cut off access to vital healthcare services. Once again, millions of families across the country are watching Congress, wondering why there isn't just one more Republican who will stand up for them.  The Republicans just held a vote open for nearly an hour to force a vote that would allow politicians to discriminate against family planning providers. Of course, whenever they can't make a vote, when women's health is being attacked, whom do Senate Republicans call to break that tie in the Senate? Vice President Mike  We have actually seen this before. We all remember what happened in the nomination of Secretary DeVos, and we all know that enough is enough. This is shameful. This is wrong. It cannot stand.  Families have spoken time and again, and they have made it absolutely career that when it comes to women's rights and healthcare, they do not want to go backward. But today, thanks to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, thanks to Vice President Pence, the Senate will hold a vote on whether critical healthcare services should be taken away from millions of women across the country.  Let's not forget, it hasn't even been a week since people nationwide completely rejected TrumpCare, that disastrous bill that would have undermined women's rights and healthcare in so many ways.  Now, here in the Senate today, we are about to vote on whether a young woman should be able to go to the provider that she trusts to get birth control; whether it is Pap tests, breast exams, birth control, or HIV testing, which should be more or less available to women across the country; whether healthcare providers are evaluated for Federal funding based on their ability to provide services or ideology; whether women are able to exercise their constitutionally protected rights to reproductive healthcare; and whether the Senate is going to turn back the clock today on women's health.  For me and for Democrats, and I know even for some Republicans, it is disappointing, deeply disappointing, that we are even having this vote today--a vote that was jammed through, with 48 Democrats and 2 Republicans voting no and Vice President Pence coming down to break the tie.  Put simply, rolling back this rule today will put at risk women's lives, like a constituent of mine from Tacoma, She wrote me a letter recently to tell me the many reasons this is so important to her.  When she was 20, she was uninsured. She had no other options. A family planning center was there for her. During a routine Pap test, her doctor discovered a precancerous condition in her cervix. That led to surgery, which saved her life and saved her fertility.  Without access to that provider, she would not have been able to get a regular Pap smear and checkup and most likely would have developed cervical cancer. She would not have been able to get pregnant, go on to have a daughter, become a community college counselor, and today, at the age of 65, be cancer-free.  I hope that some of my Republican colleagues are listening and that they think of women just like this, whose lives are healthier and have been saved because of the services of so many family planning centers. That is who I will be thinking about. That is what has always kept me going.  I urge people across the country right now to let Senators know that this vote today, this rule is not It is not acceptable. Make phone calls. Go on Tweet about it. Everything helps. Tell your Senator today that in about an hour, with their vote, to stand up for you, for your family, and for women across the country.  We need only one more Republican--one more--to join us. This vote that we are about to have in about an hour is dead even, on the razor's edge. Fifty Senators--48 Democrats and 2 Republicans--will vote to reject this harmful, disgusting resolution. We just need one more Republican to join us, to stand on the side of women and men and families, and put an end to this damaging political attack on women.  I am sure people will hear about this. I am going to be here on the floor. Many of my colleagues are going to be out here talking about it. People nationwide will have the opportunity to know exactly where every Republican stands on this.  I urge our Republican colleagues: Stop to think about what you are doing, taking away the ability of women in communities across our country to go to the provider they trust for the care that is most important to them, their families, and our country's future.

As a direct result of their choices today, extreme politicians in States across the country will have greater power to take away women's choices.  I think it speaks volumes that the vote to uphold this rule--which simply says family planning centers, where women can exercise their constitutionally protected rights, should not be[[Page S2138]]discriminated against--is bipartisan. But do you know what I think is most striking about this vote? The deafening silence from the group of almost entirely male Republican Senators who are voting today to make it harder for women to get the healthcare they need. Not one spoke today to justify this vote. Where are those Republican Senators? Why did they feel so entitled not just to interfere with women's healthcare decisions but to do so without explaining themselves? If they are ashamed of their votes, which they should be, they had ample opportunity to reconsider.  I came to the floor with my Democratic colleagues weeks ago to urge Republicans not to bring this damaging legislation to the floor. We asked for just one Republican vote today to prevent this attack on women's health. And women across the country, in Republican and Democratic States, called, emailed, tweeted, and organized to say that these restrictions on women's access to healthcare have no place in our country or in the 21st century. But what have these 50 Senate Republicans done? They refused to listen, and they refused to answer for their actions.  Frankly, women deserve better. The thing is, women know it. So today, as a woman, I am angry. As a mother and a grandmother, I am furious about what attacks like this mean for our daughters and our granddaughters, especially those who are struggling and disproportionately rely on family planning centers. But as a Senator, I am more confident than ever that Republicans who fail to listen to the women of this country do so at their own peril. I have had the chance to see how much impact women have when they call and march and organize and make their voices heard.  The fact that Vice President Pence had to come and break this tie today, that Senate Republican leaders could not twist enough arms to pass this bill on their own, is clear evidence. So is the failure of House Republicans' abysmal TrumpCare bill, which would have cut off access to critical services at Planned  I know without a doubt that Republican Senators who vote against women and with their extreme base today and who rely on this anti-women administration to jam this resolution through will be held accountable both by women across the country and women right here in the We will keep making our voices heard.

5637,topic-id,493,"Mr.Speaker, for seven years, the Republicans have tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care So now, with a Republican-controlled House, a Republican-controlled Senate, and a Republican in the White House, what have they presented us to vote on today? Republicans complained that premiums were skyrocketing, so they offer a bill that raises premiums. They complained that deductibles were too high, so they propose allowing insurance companies to charge more. They complained that too many people were losing their insurance, so they have embraced a plan that will take away health care from 24 million  This bill imposes a devastating age tax on older Americans and does next to nothing to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. It gives nearly $900 billion in tax cuts to the insurance companies and the wealthy, while refusing coverage for services as basic as hospitalization. It's simple: Americans will pay more and get less under this bill.  In New York, 2.7 million people will lose insurance and the state will lose $4.6 billion in Medicaid funding. Compounding those cuts is a cynical so-called deal several upstate Members made to secure their votes on this bill. Under the bill, New York State, and ONLY New York State, will no longer be allowed to ask counties to provide a portion of state Medicaid funding.  Don't be fooled--this is no deal at all for New York and will actually gut the State's Medicaid program, forcing hundreds of hospitals to close and rationing health care for millions of New  But my colleagues who have traded their vote for this provision have made an empty bargain. This provision is flatly unconstitutional and will never be enacted. They are giving away health insurance for millions of New Yorkers for an empty promise.  My Republican colleagues claim we need to pass this bill to give people ``freedom'' to buy health insurance. Let me tell you, freedom to buy health insurance and actually being able to afford health insurance are two very different things.  They keep talking about ``access'' to health care. Access is not coverage. When they talk about access and freedom, they are conceding that this bill does nothing to ensure that Americans have affordable, comprehensive health insurance to cover them no matter what their health care needs are.  The Republicans so clearly believe that Americans just need freedom to buy insurance, that when asked what a pregnant woman should do if her state no longer requires insurance companies to cover maternity care, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney said she can ``figure out a way to change the state [she] lives in.'' How callous are my Republican colleagues to believe that is a real option for Americans?

The GOP's pay-more-for-less bill cuts taxes on the wealthy at the expense of those who can least afford to pay for their health coverage, like low-income families.  One in five of Medicaid's 70 million beneficiaries have a mental health or a substance abuse disorder, and reports show services are needed especially for children.

5583,topic-id,796,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Recently, President Trump said: Who knew that health care could be so complicated?  Well, 70 years ago, Harry Truman knew how complicated it could be when he first proposed national health insurance. Lyndon Johnson knew more than 50 years ago when he proposed, successfully, Medicare and Richard Nixon knew when he proposed the individual mandate. Bob Dole knew when he proposed the individual mandate. In Massachusetts, Mitt Romney knew when he proposed the individual mandate.  Mr.Speaker, recently, within the last week, the great on-the-street writer, Jimmy Breslin, died. Amongst the great columns and the great books he wrote, one of them that he wrote that will be with us in a timeless manner was ``The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight.''  That is what this institution has been like for the last 10 days. There were caucuses and there were conferences. People were running back and forth with new CBO scores and coming back to the floor with new proposals. Members are put in the position of being offered special arrangements so that they might be brought over the goal line--that, after 61 times they have voted in this House to try to repeal the Affordable Care  Well, here is what we have in front of us this afternoon: a CBO score says that 24 million Americans will see either an increase in premiums or they will lose their insurance, there will be an imposition of an age tax on older Americans, and a tax cut of $1 trillion. This bill has gone from bad to worse.  If that wasn't enough, to get the votes to pass the bill, they want to cut prescription drug benefits, mental health benefits, hospital benefits, and maternity care; and, yes, every one of us in this institution knows a family who is struggling with a loved one's addiction, and they want to roll back that benefit.  Recently, the conservative columnist Bill Kristol tweeted:       The healthcare bill doesn't, A, lower costs that they have;      B, it doesn't improve insurance; C, it doesn't increase      liberty; D, it doesn't make health care better. So what is      the point?  Here is the point: it is a $1 trillion tax cut so that they can change the baseline for their tax cuts that are coming down the road. That is what this is about.  Now, the President said he wanted an insurance plan that covered all members of the American family. What they are offering up today is a plan that cuts health insurance for 24 million American family members. It does not increase coverage, it does not lower costs, and it does not strengthen consumer protections.  So what does it do?  Sadly enough, back to the old argument that we have had in this institution for years: a $1 trillion tax cut for the people at the top and special interests.  The former speaker here a minute ago, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, spoke about perfection. I was here when this legislation was authored, and I helped to write it. I can tell you this right now: we knew it was not about perfection, but we subscribed to the idea, as was the case with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, that we would improve it as time went on. We would fix it so that all members of the American family might benefit from the basic notion of access and affordability as it relates to health care.  So what do we have here?  $839 billion of cuts to Medicaid, which is now long-term care for members of the American family.  Do you know why?  Sixty percent of Medicaid dollars go to nursing home care, and they want to cut $839 billion to provide a $1 trillion tax cut. Let me tell you, members of the American family can understand that.  In Massachusetts, where proudly I can say 100 percent of the children in our State are covered, 97 percent of the adults in Massachusetts are covered. And guess what? It polls regularly in the high seventies as to consumer satisfaction. A Republican Governor of Massachusetts has advised them to go slowly and to go carefully, that this is not the path that they want to travel down, as well as other Governors across the country who happen to be a                              {time}  1400  The hard truth here today is they are asking the American family to pay more to get less. Dozens of Republicans have said so today.  Secretary Mnuchin recently said that ``there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.'' I hope that the Republican Conference confers with Secretary Mnuchin so that they might get their facts straight on this issue.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its score of      the AHCA on March 13. This analysis is broadly consistent      with concerns we have raised, with you and others, regarding      the bill's impact on the state and its residents' access to      affordable healthcare. Applying CBO's assumptions to      Massachusetts results in at least $1 billion of reduced      federal revenue beginning in 2020, and we estimate reduced      revenue of $1.3 billion in 2021, and $1.5 billion in 2022,      with likely a greater annual impact in the years that follow.       Specifically, our estimate extrapolated from the CBO      analysis of a $1.5 billion impact for FY 2022 includes $1.3      billion of annual MassHealth federal revenue losses and $200      million in annual reduced federal subsidies for private      insurance through the       Several key areas of concern for Massachusetts were not      included in the CBO analysis and could further impact the      Commonwealth's budget. For example, the CBO estimate does not      address 1115 waiver payments that we believe this bill would      put at risk. By FY22, the Commonwealth estimates an      additional $425-475 million per year of reduced federal      revenue in potential elimination of 1115 payments not      captured under the per capita targets, including federal      matching funds for a state-run ConnectorCare Wrap subsidy.       The actual experience for these and other factors is      significantly dependent on how the U.Department of Health      and Human Services implements the legislation and      unpredictable factors in the future (e.g., pharmaceutical      growth).       In addition to reduced federal revenue for Medicaid, the      CBO also projects a reduction in employer-sponsored health      insurance of 7 million people nationwide as a result of the      repeal of the federal Employer This would exacerbate      a trend that Massachusetts has seen over the last several      years. Massachusetts repealed the Chapter 58 Fair Share      Contribution in 2013 in order to comport with the My      administration has proposed reinstating an employers' shared      responsibility for the costs of health care. This would be      increasingly important if the federal Employer Mandate were      repealed, as the AHCA proposes.       The Commonwealth does have certain protections in place      that could mitigate the impact of some of these changes.      Massachusetts retains its individual health insurance      mandate, reducing the likelihood that many people would drop      out of the insurance market due to the repeal of the federal      mandate. Massachusetts also has protective insurance coverage      laws that would not be superseded by the federal legislation.       The AHCA includes a provision that would prevent Medicaid      from reimbursing Planned Parenthood for providing important      health services such as cancer screenings. My administration      opposes this provision, and has already committed to funding      these services with state dollars if it should pass.       During conversations with governors across the country, the      Trump Administration has expressed a general openness to      providing greater state flexibility with respect to health      care, including through a letter issued by HHS Secretary      Price on March 14 to states. Our administration will pursue      additional flexibilities to stabilize our markets and ensure      continued coverage for residents and we urge you to support      these efforts by leading discussions in Congress to ensure      the people of Massachusetts continue to have access to a      quality health care system.       Overall, our analysis indicates that the AHCA would      increasingly strain the fiscal resources necessary to support      the Commonwealth's continued commitment to universal health      care coverage. I hope this information is helpful to you as      Congress takes up the American Health Care       My administration and I will continue to stay in touch with      you as we work together to ensure access to quality,      affordable health coverage for all Massachusetts residents.

State of Michigan,                                             Executive Office,                                      Lansing, MI, March 21, 2017.     Sandy Levin,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Levin: As Congress considers      legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and      reform Medicaid, I want to ensure you are aware of the impact      that changes may have on beneficiaries in Michigan who rely      on these programs for access to care and overall health. I      also want to provide my perspective on priorities for federal      health reform and highlight how they have been utilized at      the state level to drive meaningful reform that has increased      access to cost-effective care.       In its current form, the American Health Care Act (AHCA)      shifts significant financial risk and cost from the federal      government to states without providing sufficient flexibility      to manage this additional responsibility. The proposed      legislation reduces federal resources that our state relies      on to assist 2.4 million Michiganders enrolled in traditional      Medicaid and the Healthy Michigan Plan, our state's      innovative Medicaid expansion program.       The current federal debate has largely focused on the      Medicaid expansion population, including over 650,000      childless adults and parents that are enrolled in the Healthy      Michigan However, half of all children in Michigan are      served by traditional Medicaid each year and roughly 67,000      of them currently reside in your district. Moreover, more      than 338,000 individuals with disabilities receive their      health care and support services through Medicaid and an      estimated 22,000 of these individuals reside in your      district. Altogether, there are 1.75 million children,      seniors, pregnant women and disabled individuals served by      traditional Medicaid in Michigan, and roughly 119,000 of them      reside in your district. As you know, these are our state's      most vulnerable citizens, friends and neighbors. The proposed      AHCA will adversely impact them.       While reforming the nation's health care system is vital,      it is imperative that gains in health coverage and access to      care are maintained. These ideas are not mutually exclusive.[[Page H2431]]       In Michigan, innovative approaches to improving quality and      value are being utilized to support each individuals'      personal responsibility for their health. This has resulted      in significant reductions of nearly 50% in uncompensated      care, a dramatic decrease in the number of individuals using      the emergency room as a regular source of care, and nearly      85% of enrollees taking part in annual primary or preventive      care visits. As drafted, the AHCA would eliminate coverage      from the 49,000 individuals enrolled in the Healthy Michigan      Plan in your district, as Michigan taxpayers assume      responsibility over time for up to $800 million in additional      costs. This cost shift will trigger a provision in Michigan      law ending the Healthy Michigan program.       I believe Medicaid reform is necessary, however, that      reform must be approached deliberately to ensure that state      flexibility and innovation are valued, Michigan providers      remain strong, and our most vulnerable citizens do not fall      through the cracks. Ideally, this would be done by removing      prescriptive program requirements that require states to seek      waivers when implementing innovative ideas. Instead, states      would be given performance based outcomes with federal      involvement only when performance is lacking.       If Congress moves forward in passing the proposed AHCA,      which shifts financial risk to state taxpayers, my      administration and the Michigan Legislature must possess the      flexibility necessary to manage that risk. The Trump      Administration may provide additional flexibility to states,      however, I am concerned that federal agencies may encounter      limitations in federal statute. Ultimately, Michigan cannot      rely solely on the promise of future action without seeing      all of the tools that will be at our disposal to manage the      program.       In addition, under the proposed AHCA, I remain concerned      about the affordability of insurance coverage in the      individual market. I am particularly concerned about the      impact this legislation may have on older Michiganders who      could see significant cost increases.       I welcome the opportunity to partner with you to provide      greater federal budget predictability and improve health      outcomes of Michiganders, which in turn relieves pressure on      other social programs. I have worked with other Governors to      develop a proposal to accomplish these objectives while also      preserving coverage for Michiganders, and I hope this can      serve as a blueprint for you as we work together to      accomplish these goals.       I look forward to continuing our partnership to help      Michiganders lead healthy and productive lives.

They are going to have a choice: give up their house so they can buy health insurance or don't buy health insurance, pray you don't have a health emergency, and go bankrupt or die.

If winning means that 24 million Americans are going to lose their healthcare coverage, if winning means imposing an age tax on seniors, if winning means higher out-of-pocket costs for working Americans, and if winning means robbing $75 billion from the Medicare trust fund, we don't want to be part of that victory lap.

5595,topic-id,435,"Mr.Speaker, it is no surprise that the Democrats today are upset, that they are complaining that they don't like this bill, because their number one goal all along, and I have heard them say it to me in conversations over the years, their number one goal was to go to a single-payer system. They wanted government-run health care, and we are on the track to that today.  In fact, in my home State of South Dakota, at one time, we had 17 options and companies that people could shop for their healthcare policies from. Today we have two.  We are well down our road now to giving them exactly what they want. They hate this bill because it puts people back in control of their own health care. It doesn't let some bureaucrat in Washington, D.C., decide what treatment they can get in the future. It lets people decide that with their doctors.  This is a vote, today, for freedom for people who have lived under the bureaucracy of the Federal Government not giving them options on how to take care of themselves and their families.  Rising costs, shrinking options, increasing bureaucracy under ObamaCare has taken healthcare control away from patients, away from people, away from families struggling to pay their bills; and, against their best and own common sense and household budgets, they are forced to pay $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 more per year for health coverage, health coverage which has a deductible so high that they don't even utilize it then because they can no way meet the $6,500 deductible, $10,000 deductible, $12,000 deductible. So they don't even use it at all if they do have it. Their stories are reflected in all the data that we have seen.  One hundred percent of the healthcare options on healthcare.gov in South Dakota have seen double-digit rate increases. Meanwhile, the number of providers families have to choose from has gotten much, much worse.  We have a responsibility to eliminate ObamaCare's individual and employer mandates, which today's legislation does. It also abolishes the taxes that were included in ObamaCare, up to $1 trillion of taxes that were put on health care in order to pay for the bill, which will be eliminated as well.  If left in place, the health insurance tax alone will raise costs on families up to $5,000 over the next decade.  Bipartisan congressional Members have repeatedly opposed taxpayer funding of abortions, and that is fixed in this bill as well.  When we talk about health care, we are talking about something very personal, which is why I want patients put back in control.

5502,topic-id,734,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I remind my colleague, my chairman, Greg Walden, that his vote for this bill will result in 64,300 people from his congressional district in Oregon losing health coverage and care.  Mr.Speaker, President Trump and congressional Republicans are not leveling with the American people when they say no one will be worse off under this repeal bill. TrumpCare dismantles the health and economic security that millions of hardworking Americans have gained over the last 7 years, and it should be defeated.  There is a reason this bill was hatched up in the back rooms only to be finalized last night, and that is because congressional Republicans did not want the American people to see what was in it.  TrumpCare provides less coverage, fewer protections, and higher costs.  TrumpCare is Robin Hood in reverse, taking benefits and financial assistance from hardworking, middle class Americans and our most vulnerable in order to give tax breaks to the wealthiest and the corporations.  TrumpCare cuts a combined $1 trillion from Medicare and These cuts are devastating, Mr. TrumpCare will ration care for the 76 million Americans who rely on Medicaid, including seniors with long-term care needs, Americans with disabilities, pregnant women, and vulnerable children.  I fear for seniors, Mr.Speaker, those in nursing homes. When States get less money, what will they do? They will give less money to nursing homes. We will go back to the days that I remember in New Jersey when nursing homes were terrible places, where there weren't enough nurses, where there were fires because of lack of maintenance of the nursing home.  Working families are going to pay more for less. They will see their premiums and deductibles skyrocket. My GOP colleagues talk about high deductibles and copays. Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.  You are going to see that this repeal repeals the limits on deductibles and copays that exist under the current law. Out-of-pocket costs are going to go through the roof. The deductibles will go even higher. The copays will go even higher. The out-of-pocket costs will go even higher.  And the bottom line is Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 will pay an age tax and be forced to pay premiums five times higher than what younger people pay for their coverage.  I have heard my colleagues on the other side say, well, that is only fair. Well, I don't think it is fair that seniors should have to pay a lot more, that those between 50 and 64 should have to pay a lot more.  Also, TrumpCare leaves the sickest and vulnerable Americans at the mercy of insurance companies, allowing them to charge a 30 percent penalty or sick tax to those who are unable to maintain continuous coverage. So if you fail to pay your insurance for a month and then you want to get it again, even if you have a preexisting condition, which is often the case, you are going to pay a 30 percent penalty, or sick tax. I don't think that is very fair.  Last night, in order to garner votes from the extreme right in their party, House Republicans added a provision that eliminates protections for essential health benefits. Now, maybe people don't understand that, but let me explain it.[[Page H2416]]  The ACA ensured that, when a consumer purchased health insurance on the individual market or gained coverage through Medicaid expansion, their plan would cover 10 critical, essential benefits.  TrumpCare eliminates this guarantee, meaning that unscrupulous insurance companies can sell skeletal plans, junk insurance, without benefits for hospitalization, maternity care, mental health, drug treatment services, and Americans won't even know what they are getting. They won't realize that they have worthless insurance until they get sick and it is too late.  The bottom line is this bill should be defeated for so many reasons because so many more people will not have health insurance, because their costs are going to go up, and because they won't even know what insurance they are buying. We are going go to back to the old days of the Wild West when insurance companies could sell whatever junk insurance they want and the public won't even know what they are getting. It is a disaster for the American people.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, since the implementation of the ACA, over 3.9 million women age 18 to 64 have gained health coverage through The ACA ended gender rating, meaning that the insurance companies cannot charge women more than they charge men for the same coverage. TrumpCare also eliminates Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, reducing access to health care for women. Millions of women rely on Planned Parenthood for both routine and lifesaving care, such as preventative services, family planning, and preventing unwanted pregnancies. When the GPO strips Planned Parenthood funding, health care of women will suffer.  TrumpCare and its Medicare cuts also hurts seniors. Older Americans account for over 60 percent of Medicare spending. Insurance companies will now be able to charge more based on their age, which will increase premiums by thousands.  Mr.Speaker, watching Republicans sell this bill is like buying a used car from a guy with a crooked smile, even they don't believe in it.

Medicaid is the source of 25 percent of all projected public and private spending for drug abuse treatment. It is about $8 billion.  Let's consider James Suber from my hometown of Paterson, New Mr.Suber began seeking treatment when New Jersey expanded its Medicare program and provided more comprehensive access to treatment.  At least New Jersey got it half right.  Each morning Mr.Suber receives treatment at Paterson Counseling Center, which allows him to go to work as a cleaner at Well of Hope, another treatment center in Paterson serving the homeless.  Without the treatment he receives through Medicaid, he wouldn't be working. He would be using the emergency department at Joseph's hospital, the most expensive part of the hospital. Or maybe he wouldn't have survived.  So, Mr.Speaker, for the life of me, I don't understand why we would jeopardize treatment for James and the millions of other Americans facing similar challenges.

Will this bill bolster employer coverage?  Will coverage now provide more access to care, a promise time and time again by Mr.Trump, himself?

5588,topic-id,329,"Mr.Speaker, today we are taking a very important step to lift the burden of the Affordable Care Act off of the backs of the American people. A key component of this is repealing the burdensome mandates and tax increases that were imposed to help fund this failed law. This includes the medical device tax, a senseless policy that placed an excise tax on lifesaving medical technology.  What did this achieve? A loss of 30,000 high-paying American jobs, less research and development, canceled projects, and postponed expansions. Most importantly, it hurt patients.  There is good news. Just a few years ago, in 2015, we came together on a bipartisan basis and suspended the tax for 2 years. We are seeing positive results. Companies are now hiring again, we have increased research and development, and we have new investments in facilities coming online.  We need to permanently repeal this onerous tax or it is going to start up again. Voting ``yes'' today means permanent repeal of the medical device tax.  Mr.Speaker, I am also encouraged to see several provisions I have authored to enhance and expand the use of health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts that are included in this legislation today.  HSAs and FSAs are now more popular than ever and used by 20 million It is time to remove the restrictions on HSAs that were imposed in ObamaCare so that we can make them more accessible and easier to use and empower Americans to take more control of their healthcare decisions.  Expanding HSAs will help us also begin to address the rising costs of health care. One recent study showed that, when a large employer switched their employees over to an HSA plan, it lowered their healthcare spending by an average of $900 per employee over a 5-year period. That is real savings, Mr. Let's support a better way forward to lower healthcare costs for patients and put them back in control of their healthcare decisions.                              {time}  1415  ",CREC-2017-03-24-pt1-PgH2393.txt,1930,THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY,2017.0,24.0,March
5384,topic-id,499,"Mr.President, I rise to express my opposition to the resolution of disapproval that is currently before the Senate, which would decimate Federal title X funding for healthcare providers across our Nation who provide vital preventive care and family planning services.  Let me put it in simpler terms. Republicans in Congress are once again rushing to advance legislation that will make it harder for Michiganians to get the healthcare they need. Just last week, we saw Speaker Ryan and President Trump in their efforts to take away healthcare from 24 million Americans and to defund Planned Parenthood, but this is a new week, and we are seeing a new assault on healthcare.  Today's resolution is just the latest in a long series of attacks against Planned A vote for this legislation is a vote to make it harder for millions of Americans to access birth control, cancer screenings, and testing for sexually transmitted infections.  ``Title X funding'' sounds arcane, but it is actually pretty straightforward. It is a bipartisan program which was established more than 40 years ago and which provides individuals with family planning and preventive health services. Not one penny covers abortion. Let me say that again. Not one penny covers abortion--not one. This is established Federal law, and anyone who says otherwise is simply lying to you or has no idea of what he is talking about.  We should take a step back and ask, what can we agree on here? I think every Senator would agree that we want to reduce unintended pregnancies and teen pregnancies and save money and prevent cancer. Today, unfortunately, we are voting to do the opposite.  Right now, we have the lowest rate of teen pregnancies in our Nation's history, and we are getting ready to heavily restrict a successful program that saves $7 for every public dollar invested. Preventive screenings are quick, affordable, and save lives. Cancer devastates families, ends lives, and is expensive to treat. Historically, low teen pregnancy rates have not happened in a vacuum; they have happened because of concerted efforts to promote education and prevention and give women a say in their own health.  The pain inflicted today will not be felt uniformly; it will disproportionately hurt people in rural and underserved areas in which these clinics are more often than not the primary sources of healthcare. Michigan has 19 Planned Parenthood clinics, and half are located in areas that are federally designated as ``rural and medically underserved.'' As a direct result of title X funds, Michigan family planning clinics prevent over 18,000 unintended pregnancies and over 1,000 cases of sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer each and every year.  Every woman has a fundamental right to make her decisions about her reproductive health. The government has absolutely no right to stand in her way.

The world-famous Broadmoor Hotel--that I visited many times and attended many education conferences at--currently has a 25-year special use permit to operate the guest ranch on the Emerald Valley parcel. This parcel has lost its National Forest character, and conveying it out of Pike National Forest will simplify management at that site and replace it with a parcel that is more appropriate.

5225,topic-id,724,"Mr.Speaker, there has been a lot going on around here lately. We have been conducting investigations, holding hearings, and some of us have even tried and failed to fundamentally change the way we provide health care in this country.  It has been easy to get distracted by the dozens of different headlines and breaking news stories we see each week. But no matter what else is going on here in Washington, one thing continues unabated: each day, the United States, like every other country on Earth, continues to release tons and tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and now we are starting to see the effects.  Over the last couple of years, the U.has joined 20 other countries from around the world in growing its economy while reducing its annual emissions into the atmosphere. This is not a small feat, and decoupling emissions from growth is the first step toward the substantive action needed to address the growing climate crisis. But I find this concept of reducing emissions can sometimes be a little misleading.  In the last few years, the U.has reduced the rate that it emits greenhouse gases. But even if we are doing it more slowly, we are still emitting harmful pollution into our air.  Imagine, Mr.Speaker, standing at the edge of an empty swimming pool with a garden hose. For a while, water was spewing out of that hose at a torrent; and each year, the volume got greater and greater. Now, the water is still running, but we have begun to turn the speed down. However, even if we manage to slow the rate of water going in, the pool still has more water than when we started and is still filling up.  Our atmosphere is that pool. For nearly 100 years, it has been filling up with greenhouse gases. And they don't just go away when the calendar flips. Reducing the annual emissions is vital, but we can't lose track of all the gases that have been accumulated year after year.  If we are going to hit the international goal of limiting climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius, we need to start acting now. Yet, this august body has been behind the curve on this issue for years.  Our colleagues seem content to ignore the climate crisis, to hold hearings with discredited, crank pseudoscientists bought and paid for by corporate interests, or to deny the value of scientific thinking altogether, an approach that is all too familiar given the post-research, post-intelligence, post-truth mindset that we have seen from this administration. They have adopted a ``hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil'' approach to climate change, hoping they can ignore it until it goes away. Sadly, that is not the way the world works.  We can't unfill the pool by pretending there is no such thing as water. This form of denial has been evolving over time. First, we heard that there was no way that climate is changing at all.  Now that the changes in the atmosphere are beyond doubt, we are starting to hear that climate is changing but there is nothing we can do about it. In addition to being flat out false, that type of thinking is unbecoming of a nation that put the first man on the Moon, pioneered instantaneous communication, and has led the world in the fight against countless deadly diseases.  Last month, we heard the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency question the very fundamentals of atmospheric science, a particularly dismaying thing from the man charged with leading the fight against climate change. This type of willful scientific ignorance has serious consequences. It will cost lives.  Children will be exposed to harmful, asthma-inducing pollution because we didn't act fast enough to clean our air. They will die because crops that could be counted on for generations will no longer grow. They will be forced from their homes because melting polar ice is driving sea levels higher and higher.  We cannot deny these impacts. We cannot continue to hear no evil and see no evil when these changes are happening all around us, resulting in devastating consequences that affect every aspect of our life.[[Page H2634]]  Instead, the time has come to speak up and speak loudly like our lives and the world depend on it, as it truly does.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2633-5.txt,1967,"CRAGS, COLORADO LAND EXCHANGE ACT OF 2017",2017.0,4.0,March

Well, that Muslim ban has, in its bizarre way, become law now in the United States of The President issued an executive order as one of his first actions on people coming to our country from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, those seven countries. And we have got to interrogate what exactly the logic of this is.  The President and his chief strategists of the alt-right, named Steve Bannon, have defended this order on the grounds of national security. The idea is that somehow we are defending the national security and the defense by banning people from those countries.  All right, we all support national security. If that would advance our national security, it is something we should look at.  Well, what is the evidence that that is going to benefit our national security? Our country now is no stranger to terror and to terrorism. All of us remember that shocking, fateful day, 9/11, back in 2001, when America changed forever.  Those 19 hijackers came from three countries. And which three countries on this list of seven did they come from? None of them. Those hijackers came from Saudi The overwhelming majority of them came from Saudi Arabia, then Egypt then United Arab  None of those three countries is on this list of seven. Why not? Well, a couple of different theories are out there. One is that President Trump has business interests in those countries. He is doing business with corporations in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt, and in the United Arab So that is one leading theory that is out there. The other is that these are rich and powerful countries. So despite the fact that they were the lead exporters from this prism of terrorist hijackers to the United States, they get a pass.  And instead, we pick on Yemen, and Somalia, and Iraq--our presumed ally--that another Republican President sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into waging a war based on the mythology that there were weapons of mass destruction in that country, but now they are on our side. Yet, we have imposed a ban of people coming in as refugees from But Saudi Arabia gets a pass; Egypt gets a pass; United Arab Emirates gets a pass because they are on the rich side.  So what exactly do these seven countries have in common if it doesn't have anything to do with our national security? Because if you look at the other terrorist events that have taken place in our country, for example, the Boston Marathon bombers, those young men who were implicated in that crime against the people of the city of Boston and the people of the United States came from Russia originally.  Is there a ban on Russia being imposed here? Quite the contrary. Earlier today, President Trump relaxed sanctions on Russia, made it easier for American businesses to export information technology to Russian companies, according to news reports.  I haven't seen the exact order yet, but there is an executive order that is lessening sanctions on Russia, despite the fact that two of the most infamous terrorists against the United States originally came from there. So what do those seven countries have in common?  Well, they are all Muslim countries. They are poor Muslim countries. They are poor Muslim countries that Donald Trump doesn't do business with. And so maybe that is it. Maybe the idea is, we are going to wage a worldwide war on the poorest, most vulnerable Muslim countries, even if they don't pose any special threat to us, because that will conform to Steve Bannon's ideological world view of a major contest between the Christian west and radical Islamic terror.  I think that would be it. But President Trump, of course, puts his business interests even above the racism and White nationalism of Steve Bannon, because the business interests have to come first in all cases.  So that is the best that we can make of what has been imposed on the country, an Orwellian policy imposed with Kafkaesque incompetence all over the United States of So the airports are in an uproar, families have been dislocated, children agonized over the situation, panic spreading across And part of me wants to think, well, this is just the misfortunes of a beginning Maybe this is part of a design by Steve Bannon who has proclaimed himself a Leninist who wants to tear the system down, tear the government down; to start over again.  Maybe that is what is going on. Who knows? But all of this brings us back to the emoluments clause. Now the emoluments clause, Article I, section 9, clause 8 of the Constitution was inserted by our great Founders because they feared foreign monetary dominance of the United States  They knew that kings and princes, dictators and despots, traitors and saboteurs all over the place would try to use their money to compromise the integrity of Republican government, Republican democracy.  Remember, we were trying something new here, what our great Republican President Abraham Lincoln would later come to call the ``government of the people, by the people, and for the people.''[[Page H923]]  That was the experiment that we launched then, and they knew that there was a basic problem, which is, the room will not hold all. We can't have a New England town meeting every time we need to make a decision, so we have got to elect people to go be our  But when you elect them, now you have got an agent. And the problem all of you lawyers know out there--in principal agent law--is how do you make sure the agent actually serves the client rather than the interests of the agent himself or herself?  And the Founders understood that, and they were afraid that the people who we elected might go to Washington and be corrupted by foreign money, by all of the diplomats and spies running around offering gifts, and gold, and snuffboxes, and diamonds, and so on. And so what they said was that no official in our government, no official could accept any gifts, or emolument, any payment of any kind at all from a foreign government, a king, a prince, or a foreign government. No foreign payments.  And that is something that has been observed scrupulously for more than two centuries by our Nobody has even come close to the line of violating that.  When Benjamin Franklin was Ambassador to France, he received a snuffbox from the people of He came back, and he brought it to Congress and asked Congress to approve, because it is up to this body to decide whether or not a foreign payment is acceptable or not.  And Congress said: Mr.Franklin, because of your extraordinary reputation for integrity, for decency, and for honesty, we understand you have not been compromised by that snuffbox, and it is just a snuffbox, and you can keep it.  But today, what we have got now is a President who has hundreds of millions of dollars of interest all over the world--in Russia, in the Philippines--millions of dollars of loans from the Government of China, the Trump Hotel, which is renting out banquet rooms, dining halls, floors, hotel rooms, to foreign governments and embassies from all over the world who come here to try to influence our government.  And what do we hear about the emoluments clause? Has the President come to ask us whether or not we approve of these arrangements? Nothing has happened. Is it affecting policy? Every single day.  And I come back--before I turn it over to my colleague--to what we are talking about, which is these executive orders which have this very bizarre quality, my fellow                              {time}  1700  They apply to poor Muslim countries where Donald Trump has no business interests. These executive orders don't apply to Saudi Arabia, they don't apply to Egypt, they don't apply to the United Arab Emirates, they don't apply to any of the countries where Trump Industries has business. That is precisely why the Founders put in the emoluments clause. I know it is a bit of a mouthful, but every American has got to learn to say it. All it means is payments. This is the foreign bribery clause in our  These terrible immigration orders, which have created chaos and pandemonium across the land, are a perfect demonstration of why we need to enforce the emoluments clause and why this President needs to divest himself immediately of all these foreign concerns, or this Congress must hear the appeals that are coming from our side of the aisle and must listen to the fact that these payments that are being received on a daily basis by the President are a threat to the American constitutional order.

The age tax will force older Americans to pay premiums up to five times higher than others, no matter how healthy they are, no matter how responsibly they have lived, making coverage too expensive, and forcing them to be uninsured.  For example, Rex, from my district, wrote me that he was worried about choosing between affordable insurance or saving for his retirement. Insurance for older Americans like Rex will be too expensive, leaving them uninsured when they need coverage the most.  Under this bill, a 64-year-old like Rex, with an income of $26,500, in the individual market, will pay up to $14,000 for health insurance.

5608,topic-id,394,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Republican's so-called healthcare bill.  It pains me to even call it a healthcare bill because it is actually a massive tax cut for insurance CEOs that provides nearly zero healthcare benefits for the American people.  In fact, TrumpCare ensures that 24 million Americans will lose their health insurance coverage. Seniors will be charged more, and insurance companies will once again dictate the health of the American people. On the very day that the majority tax cuts for the rich come into effect, on January 1, 2018, at least 40,000 of my own constituents would immediately lose their health care.  But that is not all. The Republican idea of health coverage will leave millions of Americans without the basic health services that they expect and that they deserve. That means that the monthly premium you pay won't cover all of the services you will need to get better if you get sick. The Republican healthcare plan won't cover your emergency room visit, the X-rays, or even the prescription drugs you need to recover.  Heaven forbid if you need prenatal or pediatric care, too. Basically, under this plan, one illness is enough to bankrupt a family for a lifetime. If you asked anyone on the street, no one in America would call this health insurance. Yet, my Republican colleagues hail this as choice--the choice to go bankrupt if you get sick or, God forbid, have an accident.  So, Mr.Speaker, I have to ask: How many Republicans are left who actually support the bill? Who wants to kick thousands of people off of Medicaid, reduce care for the disabled, and strip children of their health care because that is exactly what you are going to do if you vote for this bill.

5560,topic-id,244,"Mr.Speaker, after all these late nights and backroom deals, here we are. This version of the bill was just dropped on our lap this morning, so we ought to take a careful look at what is in front of us.  First of all, the bill defunds access to preventative health care and wellness. All the programs that we made progress on will be gone.  It shortchanges the Medicare trust fund. Seniors might be paying thousands more than they are now to get the care they need.  It returns us to a system with skimpy benefits without serious coverage for maternity care and mental health.  Most dramatically, the bill dismantles the Medicaid system as we know it, which has been a success across much of the country.  In Oregon, children and families finally have access to care that fits their needs. People living with disabilities are leading productive lives now. Hospitalizations and emergency room visits have been cut in half, and costs are down.  We are all going to do this--take health care away from 24 million Americans, 14 million just this next year--and not going to save any more money than under the original ACA?  Look, I know there are parts of the ACA that need fixing. While millions of people got coverage for the first time, premiums are still too high in the individual market. That is only 5 percent.  Vote ``no'' on this bill, and let's make the system better.                              {time}  1330  ",CREC-2017-03-24-pt1-PgH2393.txt,1950,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,24.0,March
5251,topic-id,785,"Mr.President, last night the Senate Democrats held the floor late into the night to demonstrate our solidarity and commitment to defending ACA, to defending the tens of millions of Americans who have been afforded the opportunity to access care for the first time and the tens of millions more whose coverage is fairer, more generous, and more affordable because of the law.  More than 35 Members participated on the floor or on Facebook Live, Snapchat, or I thank each and every one of the Members on my side--the vast majority of our caucus--for participating. Many of them discussed the threat the Republican plan to make America sick again poses to the health care of 300 million Beyond that, the Republican budget resolution calls for a massive increase in the Federal debt.  Yesterday Shaun Donovan, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, released a letter explaining that this budget resolution would allow publicly held debt to increase by $9.5 trillion, from $14.2 trillion in 2016 to $23.7 trillion in 2026.  Our colleagues have talked about being deficit hawks. Democrats bring up ideas. They say: Can't do it; it increases the deficit. Well, is that going to apply to this, which increases the deficit by massive amounts? The deficit would exceed $1.3 trillion in 2026. That is almost as high as the $1.4 trillion at the depths of that recession and financial crisis President Obama had to meet. Are my colleagues now going to do a 180-degree reversal and say that now a debt increase of such dramatic numbers is OK? I hope not. It wouldn't be right. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't be consistent.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of Director Donovan's letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management            and Budget,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.     John Yarmuth,     Ranking Member, House Budget Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington,     Richard Neal,     Ranking Member, House Ways and Means Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Congressman Yarmuth and Congressman Neal: I am writing      in response to[[Page S184]]     your letter requesting OMB's analysis of the Republican      budget resolution and its impact on the budget outlook.       On January 3, 2017, Republicans in the Senate Budget      Committee introduced an FY 2017 budget resolution. Based on      the numbers provided in the resolution, the Republican budget      includes virtually no deficit reduction and would allow debt      held by the public to increase by roughly $9.5 trillion, from      $14.2 trillion in 2016 to $23.7 trillion in 2026. After a      sustained period of historically fast deficit reduction under      the President's leadership, the Republican budget would allow      for a relatively steady increase in annual deficits, with the      annual on-budget deficit increasing to over $1 trillion by      2026.       Assuming that Republicans will not make cuts to off-budget      programs like Social Security, unified annual deficits will      be even larger: growing to over $1 trillion by 2022 and      reaching more than $1.3 trillion by 2026.       Comparisons of debt and deficit totals over time are best      viewed as a share of the economy. Based on the Congressional      Budget Office's most recent economic projections, it is clear      that the Republican budget would fail the key fiscal test of      stabilizing debt as a share of the economy.

5252,topic-id,142,"Mr.President, many of my Republican colleagues like to claim they care about the deficit. During President Obama's administration, there was an obsession over deficit and debt reduction--and, by the way, no praise for the President for reducing the deficit by a dramatic amount. Now many of those same Members who chastised President Obama for much smaller deficits than proposed in their budget are supporting this budget resolution.  I wish to say to my colleagues, you can't claim to be a fiscal hawk and support a budget that piles on trillions in additional debt. That is not being fiscally conservative; it is being fiscally hypocritical in the extreme. So far, my friend Senator Paul of Kentucky has made this point forcefully. My question is, Will other Republicans stand with him and stand up against this fiscal hypocrisy?

5301,topic-id,849,"Mr.President, according to President Trump's words, yesterday--not Friday--was his first official day in office. It is an important distinction because throughout the campaign, President Trump made numerous promises about what he would do on his first day. So we went through them. Turns out he made upwards of 30 promises of Executive actions or plans that he would announce on day 1. This didn't require any congressional approval; he could just announce it. Even by a generous count, the President fulfilled only two or three of them. Let me mention just a few of the important omissions.[[Page S408]]  The President campaigned against both establishments, promising to oppose elites and the powerful in Washington, ``to drain the swamp.'' He campaigned against the Democratic establishment, but he also campaigned against the Republican establishment. As a result, he explicitly promised to introduce an 18-point plan for ethics reform on day 1. How did he do on that? He promised to sign a 5-year ban on lobbying after officials worked in Congress or the White House, but he did not deliver. He promised to institute a lifetime ban on White House officials from lobbying on behalf of a foreign government, but he did not deliver. He promised to put in place a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections, but again he did not deliver.  On day 1, did President Trump fulfill his pledge to bring ethics reform to Washington? In fact, looking at his ``swamp Cabinet''--stacked with billionaires and bankers with myriad conflicts of interests--he may have already lowered the ethical standards in our government.  On trade--this is an issue where I am probably closer to the views of the President's than I was to either President Obama's or President Bush's, but it seems President Trump is again failing to deliver on his day 1 promises. He promised over and over again--it was one of the few things he said in the campaign I really liked. He said he was going to label China a currency manipulator on his first day. But he did not deliver. Instead, he issued an Executive action withdrawing from the  Everyone knew the TPP was dead in the water a month or two ago. Leader McConnell would not bring it up on the floor of the Senate because he did not have the votes. Furthermore, saying we won't do TPP, which is not in effect anyway, isn't creating a single new job.  So there is something else he could have done--his promise: On day 1, label China a currency manipulator. China is propping up their currency at the moment. They do whatever is best for China even if it hurts American jobs and American workers over and over again. You can be sure they will continue manipulating their currency when it is in their best interest to do so. You can be sure, even when they move up the currency, they are manipulating it.  Guess who I worked with on the issue of currency manipulation. Attorney General nominee, then-Senator Jeff He and I were partners in this, and many others. On our side, Senator Brown and Senator Stabenow were allies. On their side, Senator Graham and Senator Collins were allies. It was a broad bipartisan coalition. And we were opposed, frankly, by both President Bush and President But here we have President He promised to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. We are still waiting.  Last night at the White House, I mentioned this to the He didn't say no. I am not going to say what he said. He didn't say no. Maybe he will do it. I hope and pray he does. We await real action on trade, one of the President's signature issues. It is another promise not fulfilled.  There are many promises President Trump made during the campaign that we are glad he is not keeping, to be honest with you, but the bottom line is, there is a giant gulf between what the President says he is going to do and what he actually does. His rhetoric does not match reality. That is becoming clearer each day. Just look at what happened on Friday, inauguration day, which perfectly sums up my point. The President gave an inaugural address arguing that for too long Washington has reaped the rewards of government, while the people have suffered. Then, an hour later, the President took an Executive action that made it harder for Americans to afford a mortgage, even though Washington could certainly have afforded to give them a tax break. We are seeing a pattern emerge. President Trump is using populist rhetoric to cover up a hard-right agenda.  In short, actions speak louder than words. If day 1 is any indication, the grandiose promises this President made to the working men and women of America seem to be just a hall of mirrors.  I yield the floor.

5383,topic-id,613,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon on the pending business of the CRA that would allow States to discriminate against women's healthcare providers.  Before I begin, I want to recognize the members of the HELP Senator Murray, who understands this issue as well as anyone in our caucus and speaks powerfully about it, has been such a great leader on these issues, even in these difficult times when we are in the minority. I think our entire caucus is grateful to her and all of the members of the HELP It is an outstanding group of people.  As my colleagues have explained, this CRA would empower States to discriminate against healthcare providers, specifically title X family planning providers. The practical result of this measure is that State legislatures would pass laws to deny certain providers the funding they need to operate, which would prevent access to family planning and preventive care for millions of American women.  This CRA is just another example of the Republican war on women. It would let States treat women as second-class citizens who do not deserve the same access to healthcare as men. Some States say this is about abortion, but let me be clear. This is not about abortions. In fact, title X funding cannot be used to pay for abortion services. Some of our Republicans who are sort of tied in a knot on abortion say they are for other kinds of health services, contraception and things like that, but this would take that away. Our Republican friends could not get TrumpCare through, which sought to shut down Planned Parenthood for a year. Now they have moved on to this measure. It is just bad policy.  Title X clinics are a critical resource for women, especially in rural areas. This bill would hurt those areas most. Many of my Republican friends represent rural areas. I would like to remind them that in many of these places--and I have several in Upstate New York--these clinics are the only family planning and preventive care services that are available. Sometimes they are the only healthcare services available at all. I am sure that is why two of my Republican colleagues, with a great deal of courage--the Senators from Maine and Alaska--voted against moving to debate on this measure. They know that it would hurt women and hurt families in their States, particularly in the rural areas, and, of course, Maine and Alaska are both rural  For the second time this year, the Republicans had to beckon Vice President Pence down from the White House to break a tie here in the Senate on a measure that has bipartisan opposition.  President Trump, who once said, ``No one has more respect for women than I do,'' sent Vice President Pence down here to the Senate to break a tie on a bill that would allow States to discriminate against women's health providers. The next time the President says, ``No one has more respect for women than I do,'' I would ask the women of America to not look at his words but his actions because this is just another example in which the President has said one thing, but his policies have done exactly another.  I urge my Republican friends, particularly those in rural States, where this could really hurt, to please think about it and vote against this We only need one more vote to stop this resolution that would allow States to dramatically reduce the access for women to essential healthcare services. I urge each of my Republican friends to consult their conscience before they vote in the next hour.[[Page S2134]]  I yield the floor.

5361,topic-id,1174,"Madam President, I come to the floor to join my colleagues in opposing this misguided measure, which would leave millions of women and families with fewer healthcare options, and it would drastically decrease women's access to basic primary and preventive health services, including lifesaving cancer screenings and HIV testing.  Make no mistake about it, as my colleagues have said, the primary target of this legislation is Planned For years now, we have seen Republican leaders in Congress attempt to defund this essential healthcare provider, which serves millions of women nationwide, including nearly 12,000 women in New Hampshire, most of them with incomes below or near the poverty line. The sad irony of these attacks is that study after study has shown that restricting access to birth control and other family planning methods actually increases the number of abortions.  The authoritative Guttmacher Institute estimates that in 2014 alone, contraceptive care provided under title X helped women avert more than 900,000 unintended pregnancies and 326,000 abortions. Without contraceptive care provided by title X funded centers, the U.rates of unintended pregnancy and preventable abortions would be an estimated 33 percent higher, and the teen pregnancy rate would be 30 percent higher.  At the end of the Obama administration, teen pregnancy in the United States was at its lowest point since we have been keeping track. As Senator Hirono said, these services don't provide abortions. Federal law expressly forbids the use of Federal funds to pay for abortion, except to save the life of the mother.  So the real issue here is not about abortion. This is about ensuring that American women have access to the basic healthcare they need, where they want to receive it. This is just a mean-spirited effort to keep women from seeing the provider they want to see and getting care at rates they can afford. For 40 percent of women, their visit to a family planning center is the only care they receive annually.  In 2015 alone, title X provided basic primary and preventive healthcare services such as Pap tests, breast exams, birth control, and HIV testing to more than 4 million women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers. Planned Parenthood plays an essentially important role in delivering health services to low-income, uninsured, and vulnerable individuals, including in rural areas.  I am sure that every person in this Chamber has received letters and emails and phone calls from constituents on this issue. They are pleading with us: Don't take away our access to healthcare from Planned  I received a letter from Sandra Sonnichsen of Goshen, She writes:       Planned Parenthood was my only affordable source of      gynecological healthcare for most of my life. I received      good, wise, and thoughtful care. I think it is not extreme to      say they saved my life. Abortions were not involved. They--  Meaning Planned Parenthood--     remain very important, especially for poor or uninsured      women. There are not enough alternate low cost women's      clinics available. Not providing birth control services to      women who want it is not a good economic or social solution.      Don't let it be defunded.  In a follow-up call, Sandra said that without Planned Parenthood, she would not have had any healthcare at all. Because her mother died of breast cancer, Sandra is deeply grateful that she has been able to receive mammograms, thanks to Planned  I also heard from Meredith Murray of Exeter, She says:       Nine years ago I graduated from college and immediately      began my journey to become a medical provider. . . . During      this time in my life, I was surviving almost entirely on      student loans. And I knew that during this time, especially,      I needed to ensure that I was doing all I could to prevent      pregnancy. . . . With my insurance--an IUD would have cost      $900. That was not possible for me to afford. Then I      remembered--Planned . . . I was informed, due to      title X funding, my IUD would be completely covered. I      continued to use Planned Parenthood services for the next 5      years for my routine screenings while in medical school. The      care I received was phenomenal. As I proceeded through my      medical training, I strived to be as kind, compassionate, and      knowledgeable as those who work Planned Parenthood health      centers. I am now a practicing medical provider, married, and      still using an IUD because Planned Parenthood offered me that      opportunity.  I received this letter from Samantha Fox of Bow, She writes:       In 2007, I was a 19-year-old just barely starting out when      I was denied health insurance due to a preexisting condition.      Had I been able to access affordable coverage, my preexisting      condition, a reproductive system disorder, would have been      easily manageable. . . . At that time, I was able to access      care through Planned Parenthood, which likely preserved my      ability to conceive in the future.  And finally, let me share this message from Robina Parise of Rye, She says:       I started utilizing the services at Planned Parenthood for      birth control when I was about 17 years old. . . . Planned      Parenthood made sure I was protected and healthy. They gave      me access to vital protection and healthcare when I could not      get it anywhere else. They regularly called me with reminders      to have exams and to pick up my prescription. Planned      Parenthood is the reason my husband and I were able to      graduate from high school and college. . . . I'm not sure      what our lives would be like now without their support.  I don't know. Do the people who are voting for this CRA believe it would be better to have allowed the people whom I just talked about--to prohibit their access to these healthcare services so that their lives would have been disrupted, so they might not have finished college, so we wouldn't have another doctor in the world, so they wouldn't be able to afford healthcare? I hope we will listen to our constituents who have been speaking out in passionate support of Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics.  This is about respecting women's access to healthcare services, including millions of vulnerable women who have nowhere else to turn for essential care. This is also about respecting women's constitutionally protected right to make our own reproductive choices. We must not allow Congress to strip away investments in family planning clinics by allowing States to discriminate.  Finally, I want to point out that we haven't heard from any of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are voting for this measure about why they think it is so critical. I don't know. Maybe they are not willing to come to the floor and tell my constituents why they should be denied access to healthcare from the provider they want. Well, I am disappointed that we haven't heard from anyone who is willing to stand up and defend this vote. I hope they are going to have to defend it to the American people.

5376,topic-id,424,"Mr.President, just yesterday, the White House held a forum on empowering women. Sean Spicer said the President made women's empowerment a priority throughout the campaign, but earlier today, Vice President Pence traveled to the Capitol to cast a tie-breaking vote to move ahead on a resolution to undermine women's access to preventive healthcare. That doesn't sound like women's empowerment to me.  Title X was enacted in 1970. It passed the Senate unanimously at that time and was signed into law by a Republican Title X is the only Federal healthcare program dedicated solely to providing comprehensive family planning and other related preventive healthcare services so important to women, as well as preventive services for men.  Last year alone, 4 million women and men at 4,000 health centers all across our country got basic care because of title X funding--critical Pap tests to head off cases of cervical cancer, counseling to help women plan for a healthy pregnancy, contraception, breast exams, HIV testing, vaccinations. These services prevented 87,000 preterm or low birth weight babies and 2,000 cases of cervical cancer. These health services also save money. The taxpayer saves $7 for every $1 invested in preventive healthcare.  For more than 2 million people, the title X funded clinic is their only source of healthcare. This matters to small towns and rural communities all across Michigan, as well as all across the country. Title X funds clinics in three-fourths of all the counties in the United In Michigan, you can benefit from the services in the beautiful Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where I will be this weekend, where funds support the health department in Iron County, or the Planned Parenthood clinic in Marquette--at the opposite end of the State, down in the southeastern corner--where funds support the health department in Monroe  So what are we voting on today? Plain and simple, this is an effort to take away women's family planning and other healthcare services. Right now, title X funds are awarded solely based on the provider's ability to serve the patient, as it should be. Republicans want to discriminate against certain family planning services, certain providers, and reduce access to this care, frankly, based on politics or their own personal beliefs.  The vote this afternoon is very simple: It is about basic healthcare for women. A ``yes'' vote is a vote against women in Michigan and all across our country.

There was a lady east of Columbus who had cancer. She was a survivor. Fast-forward to a few years ago. She gets cancer again and finds out that the oncologist that she had, she could no longer have. He was not in the network. She could not go to the hospital in her community. She had to go 60 miles away.  Or there is the small-business owner and his wife and family on the individual market and now on the exchange not getting employer-provided health care and, therefore, not getting the benefit. They saw their plan price quadruple in the last several years. Mr.Speaker, we are going to take care of that person and give them a tax credit so they have the ability, just like employer-provided employee's health care.  In Ohio, last year, our CO-OP collapsed. We had 20,000 people without health care. Many saw bills not being paid. Twenty counties in my State had one provider and fewer choices.  Broken promises. Constituents can't keep their doctor, can't keep their hospital. Constituents saw emergency room visits go up.

That was their  We can do better, and in this bill we do. In one step, in the first step, more steps to come, we begin creating a patient-centered healthcare system that will not only put more power in the hands of our constituents, but it will also drive down healthcare costs.  Remember what they said in Ohio newspapers in my State about ObamaCare: a tough pill to swallow, a nightmare, very taxing, just more red tape. These aren't my words, Mr.Speaker; these are hardworking Ohioans' words. They deserve better. They deserve more choices. They deserve better access, the access and the choices they want for them and their families.  We begin, Mr.Speaker, with this bill. We don't end here. There is much more to do.

This is not a perfect bill. That is for sure. But ObamaCare is broken. One out of three counties has only one provider, and it looks like it is going to get worse as other major insurance companies are on the verge of pulling the plug.  Nearly two dozen of the nonprofit CO-OPS have already gone belly up. In my home State, folks saw their premiums increase by nearly 17 percent. Some States have had premium increases of more than 100 percent. Most had double-digit increases, many over 20 percent, and some forecast 40 to 50 percent increases come fall if nothing happens.  The calls on both sides of the aisle have often used the R word--on this side, ``replace''; on your side, the Democratic side, ``repair.'' Let's both agree. The status quo is not acceptable. But this, this bill, is the only train leaving the station. Is it going to improve if it gets to the Senate? Of course it will. We should all work for that goal.

Total repeal would mean taking away the ability of HHS to provide flexibility to the States to administer this critical program. It would mean taking away insurance for young kids on their parents' policies. It would reinstall a cap on insurance. And, yes, it would allow insurance companies to discriminate against those with preexisting illnesses.  This bill still allows all of those important protections to stay in place. A number of us will continue to work with HHS to provide even more flexibility to States like This has to be a key component of moving forward.

It reforms and strengthens Medicaid and gives States the flexibility to innovate and best meet the needs of their citizens.  This patient-centered approach will bring costs down, increase choice and competition, and provide important protections for patients with preexisting conditions.

5423,topic-id,489,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for this important piece of legislation, H.304, the Protecting Patient Access to Emergency Medications  This is a bipartisan bill. It was introduced by two of our colleagues from North Carolina, Representatives Hudson and It previously passed the House by voice vote, no objection, back in November; but, unfortunately, it was not taken up by the Senate before the last Congress adjourned, meaning we have to be here today to restart this process.  This, along with three other Energy and Commerce bills that we are considering today, shows that the Energy and Commerce Committee is picking right up where we left off, in a bipartisan way, to produce quality legislation that will improve the public health.  Now, H.304 is really an important bill because it enables our Nation's emergency medical services professionals to continue to provide quality emergency care by recognizing the unique nature of their practice.  Specifically, as you may have heard, the bill clarifies that paramedics and other EMS professionals can administer certain pain and antiseizure medications in emergency situations pursuant to standing or verbal orders. In other words, the doctor has said to the EMS person, you can do these things in emergencies.  Now, think about this. You are in a car wreck. The EMT shows up in the ambulance. They can't communicate with anybody because they are down in a valley or somewhere where they don't have communication. Without this legislation, it is uncertain now, because of this ruling out of the administration, whether or not they can give you antiseizure medication or pain relief medication until they can get in contact. This is not what any of us wants, so this legislation fixes that.  During this process, when this decision was made a while back, I heard from Paul Rostykus, an emergency physician in Jackson County, He said that this is really critical to saving lives and reducing suffering, particularly in our remote and rural areas where these emergency technicians, EMTs, may struggle to call in emergencies and it can take much longer for patients to reach the nearest doctor.  I just implore you to talk to anybody that is running around the ambulances, and they will tell you this is really, really important for patients.  I had an ambulance driver tell me--an EMT tell me it is important for them because sometimes in an accident, somebody is injured and they are kind of out of control and have a seizure. Now, I am not a doctor. We actually have one here who can tell us[[Page H208]]more. But they then are able to administer certain medications that will calm the patient, prevent them from hurting themselves or hurting the  So I urge my colleagues to support H.304 as well as the other bipartisan Energy and Commerce bills that are on the floor today.

We heard from people who said we need to do more in this area: newborn care, mental health, and substance disorders.  We are also taking action to strengthen We want to put Medicaid on a sustainable path so it can better care for those it was intended to serve, a path through this per capita program for States that, frankly, was at one time embraced by Democrats, including President  The most vulnerable in our communities need this help.

The end result highlights the diverse ideas of our Conference that come from the American people and the determination that we share to save this market and make it work again.  Remember, we are talking about a narrow slice of the insurance market, that driven by ObamaCare, that, last year, there were 225 counties in America where, if you were looking for insurance on that exchange, you had one option. This year, it is 1,022 counties. That is one out of every three in And that was before Humana pulled out and other companies said this market is about gone.  We need to fix this market. That is what this legislation seeks to do.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank our terrific staff that has worked day and night to get us to this point. We know there is a lot more work to do. This should not be taken in isolation as the only healthcare reform on our list. We are going to go after the cost drivers. We are going to go after prescription costs. We are going to go after hospital costs.  Wherever it is in the health system, if you have nothing to hide, you won't have to fear our investigations. But we are going to get costs down.

And to listen to the gentleman from California talk about how removing essential benefits from the Federal mandate from the law is going to cause all that to happen is tragic because he, on March 25 of 2015, cosponsored legislation that did precisely that, removed the same Federal mandates for workers in the 51-100 pool of employees for employers. He said it was too much of a mandate then on those businesses, when they provide insurance.  So every Member of the House who was here then, and every Senator, including the Democrat leader of the Senate at the time, voted for that, passed unanimously.  By the way, the Congressional Budget Office said that those regulations that we are pulling back here would have made nongroup premiums 27 percent to 30 percent higher in 2016, than they otherwise would have been. So we are basically taking what CBO said is a good policy and implementing it here once again.  Last time, in 2015, that was bipartisan. It was a voice vote. Today, you would think the world was falling around us, the sky was falling. Yet, everybody who was here in 2015 said, that is okay, it is the right thing to do because it will lower premiums, like CBO said, by 27 to 30 percent.  So we thought what was good for those in the work world, for everybody who is insured through a large group plan, which is about 155 million Americans--they don't live under this mandate, yet they have all those services and benefits--that that would make sense to lower premiums for individuals on the ObamaCare exchange, because what I hear is, premiums are too high, deductibles go up.  Nobody sees this thing coming down. We are making changes here because those exchanges are collapsing. We want to bring the premiums down. We want to make the changes that will bring them down. CBO says doing this on essential benefits would have resulted in nongroup premiums 27 to 30 percent lower than they would have otherwise been. They basically say they would be higher in 2016 than they would have otherwise been. So we are taking that, using that and saying: let's drive them down; let's get premiums down.

Then they came back and said: Well, that didn't work so well, so we had better get rid of the essential benefits for the workers and employers, 51-100 employees in a company; we are going to take that off because that will drive up premiums. And they voted unanimously to do that. Today, they come back and say: Oh, that would be horrible. But they did it before, so they were for it before they were against it.  But let me talk about what really matters here. First of all, there is lot of scare tactics out there by a lot of high-paid organizations. The first is, we preserve your right as a citizen to acquire health insurance regardless of your health condition.                              {time}  1345  So here is the deal: preexisting conditions, we protect that; lifetime caps, we protect that so that insurance companies can't go over the top of you; keep your kids on until they are 26, we protect that. Those were good things. We agree in a bipartisan way those should be protected. We do that.  But we also recognize that 19.2 million Americans looked at the Democrats' healthcare exchanges and plans, went the other direction, and said no. They have walked with their wallets and their feet and said: I don't like what you are selling and I can't afford what you are selling. I will even pay the IRS $600 or $700 not to take  Meanwhile, Mr.Speaker, the insurers have said that the way the Democrats created the insurance markets all over the country, we can stay in them. We are losing too much money, and we are out.  That is why in one out of three counties today in America you only have one choice, and that is called a monopoly. We are trying to fix this market so people will have choices that are affordable. We are trying to make sure people have access to coverage they want and can afford. This is the first step, not the last step, toward fixing this market.  I look at it like we have poured the foundation. Construction projects are a little messy when you are just pouring the foundation. Now we are going to put up the walls, we are going to put the roof on, and we are going to build this out in multiple steps throughout this year and next.  Meanwhile, we provide complete coverage. We do all the protections ObamaCare continues in its support for people while we fix the market and allow it to come back. We have timed this out. I know there are some on my side of the aisle who wanted to get rid of those protections, and we brought them around or they are going to vote ``no.'' But we said: No; we have to have those protections in place--existing conditions, no more lifetime caps, keeping your kids on until they are 26.  We have a product here that needs to go to the next step. We will all work on it and continue to make it better as we go forward. But if we do nothing and let it fail today, these markets are going to get worse and worse under the Democrats' ObamaCare plans, and people won't have a choice in States and counties all over  I wish we could join together today and put forward a bipartisan vote to save these markets and help our constituents going forward. Mr.Speaker, we owe it to them. They have asked for it for 7 years. Let's get it done.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

5600,topic-id,322,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the American Health Care  Yesterday marked 7 years since the ObamaCare law was signed into law. For 7 years, we have seen the same pattern: rising premiums, dwindling options, broken promises, and a collapsing system.  In the State of Indiana, four insurers left the ObamaCare exchange just this year in the past 3 months, forcing 68,000 Hoosiers to shop for a new plan, making it even harder for them to choose and keep their doctor.  But today we have the opportunity to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with a patient-centered system, lowering costs, increasing choices, and providing real protection.  This legislation dismantles ObamaCare's burdensome taxes, mandates, and the job-killing medical device tax.  It gives individuals and families access to quality, affordable health care through refundable tax credits and expanded health savings accounts.  It provides resources for States to tailor solutions to the needs of their citizens, protecting women's health, addressing the opioid crisis.  It gives States flexibility to implement innovative reforms.  It allows my home State to continue building on its patient-centered Healthy Indiana  It protects patients with preexisting conditions and ensures a stable transition so no one has the rug pulled out from underneath them.  With the American Health Care Act, we are delivering on our promise and acting on the policies of President This bill is just the first step in a three-part effort to repair our Nation's healthcare system. Coupled with administrative actions and additional legislation, the AHCA will lower costs and build a marketplace with real choices instead of a one-size-fits-all plan.  Mr.Speaker, 7 years of ObamaCare is long enough. Seven years of families seeing their premiums rise, plans canceled, and doctors dropped is enough. Today we can deliver on our promise and put our bold solutions into decisive action. The AHCA is a bill 7 years in the making. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

5366,topic-id,810,"Mr.President, since coming to Washington, I have observed something interesting about Republican politicians. Republicans talk a big game about respecting women, but when it comes time to vote on laws to help real, live, American women, a lot of Republicans turn their backs.  Take Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House of Just a few months ago, Speaker Ryan was adamant that American women deserve respect. ``Women,'' he said, ``are to be championed and revered.''  ``Championed and revered''--so what exactly does championing and revering women mean to Speaker Ryan? Does it mean he will promote policies that make us healthier, that he will help us access basic medical services, that he thinks we can make our own decisions about our bodies without government interference?  Over the past few months, Speaker Ryan has worked overtime on the American Health Care Act--a bill that would make it harder for millions of women to access healthcare. That miserable bill even included a special provision singling out certain health clinics and stripping them of the funding they use to provide women's health services.  Last week, Paul Ryan failed to get that bill out of the House, but Republicans are back to take another shot at cutting women's access to healthcare. This time the plan is to undermine the title X family planning program. This plan, just like their healthcare bill, is incredibly unpopular, even with Republicans who had to rush Vice President Pence over from the White House this morning to cast a deciding vote to start this debate on attacking women's healthcare.  Title X is a bipartisan program started back in 1970. It is the only Federal grant program dedicated to providing Americans with high-quality, low-cost family planning services. Title X funded clinics provide birth control, cancer screening, STI testing, and counseling. Just so there is no confusion about this, title X dollars cannot be used to fund abortion services--none.  In 2015 alone, title X clinics helped 2.9 million women access birth control. They provided over 700,000 Pap smears, performed 1.1 million HIV tests, and gave over 1 million breast exams. And Paul Ryan's way of making sure that women are ``championed and revered'' is to try to reduce their access to these lifesaving services.  Last December, the Department of Health and Human Services passed a very simple rule to keep States from pulling political shenanigans to shut down women's health centers. The rule prevents States from blocking a healthcare provider from the program ``for reasons other than its ability to provide Title X services.'' In other words, follow the law. If a provider is doing a bad job at delivering family planning services, by all means, kick them out of the program. But you don't get to kick someone out because you don't like the name of their organization or you don't like their politics or because of your politics or because of any other dumb reason that has nothing to do with their ability to deliver women's health services.  In February, House Republicans voted to overturn this rule. So Paul Ryan's version of championing and revering women is to let States close down women's health centers. Now Senate Republicans plan to do the same thing. Sure, Republicans give a bunch of reasons, but American women are not stupid. We know pretext when we see it. So let's just call it like it is. Republicans want to weaken the title X program because they want to make[[Page S2128]]it harder for women to access reproductive health clinics, like Planned Parenthood, that also provide safe, legal abortion services.  Just so we are clear, there are over 3,900 title X funded health centers. Only 10 percent of those health centers are affiliated with Planned The vast majority of centers getting title X money have nothing to do with Planned Parenthood, and the vast majority of Planned Parenthood's activities have nothing to do with abortion. But women should be able to choose a reproductive health provider without the interference of Republican politicians, and millions of women choose Planned Parenthood every year. The Congress representing those women should stop demonizing Planned Parenthood and stand with Planned  Yes, as it stands, title X makes sure that if women's healthcare centers, including Planned Parenthood, offer first-rate care, then their work will be reimbursed. The Senate should reject any efforts to change that.  Women in this country work their tails off. They should be able to choose their own healthcare providers. They don't need a ``champion'' to choose for them. They don't need to be ``revered'' into passive silence. Women want the respect that they deserve and to be able to access medical care without Republican politicians getting in the way.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

5460,topic-id,1136,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, after 7 years of campaigning against the Affordable Care Act, congressional Republicans have finally produced what they cynically describe as a replacement plan.  Sadly, however, this bill will unravel all of the progress we made under the ACA, including expanding access to health insurance to 22 million Americans and improving the quality of coverage and care for tens of millions more.  It nearly doubles the amount of uninsured people in this country, guts Medicaid by almost $900 billion, and weakens the Medicare trust fund.                              {time}  1130  That was bad enough. But the last-minute changes to this bill are astonishing and appalling. This legislation now allows insurers to end coverage for prescription drugs, mental health, maternity and newborn care, preventive care, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, outpatient care, rehab visits, lab services, and pediatric care. That is not progress. That is not a fix. That is a potential health crisis for every  My Republican colleagues are well aware of this. Why else would they have drafted this bill and these last-minute changes in secret? Why else would complicated legislation affecting the lives of millions be sent to the floor just 2 weeks after it was introduced with no congressional hearings, not a single one, on a bill that impacts the health care of nearly every American family? Why else would they rush the bill to the floor without an updated Congressional Budget Office estimate of how much coverage and care will be lost by their backroom deal that ends consumer protections?  I get it. I wouldn't want to, nor would I know how to justify giving nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy paid for by threatening the health and well-being of millions of American families.  Who is getting these huge windfalls?  Companies like Amgen, with annual profits of more than $3 million; Medtronic, with annual profits of more than $6 billion; and Gilead Sciences, with $13 billion in profits in 2016 alone.  When the CBO released its report last week showing that 24 million hardworking Americans will be left without healthcare coverage by 2026 if we pass this bill, that premiums will rise 15 to 20 percent next year, that people will pay thousands of dollars more in deductibles and out-of-pocket costs, and that older Americans will be priced out of the market by an age tax, I thought for sure it was dead on arrival, that there was no way my Republican colleagues would walk this plank. But here they are, and they are trying to take millions of American families with them.  Fourteen million Americans will lose health coverage next year if this bill is approved. Twenty-one million Americans will lose coverage in the next 3 years alone, wiping out all of the coverage gains from the ACA in just 3 years. For pretty much everyone else in the individual market, deductibles and other costs will be higher. And for lower-income individuals, out-of-pocket costs will be much higher.  Insurance companies will again be able to sell plans that offer much less financial protection, and we will return to the days when millions of people in this country will live in fear that they are always one serious illness or accident away from bankruptcy.  This bill will result in the largest transfer of wealth from struggling families to the well-off in our Nation's history, giving $1 trillion in tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and corporations. It is Robin Hood in reverse, but this is far worse because access to lifesaving care is being stolen.  I don't say that casually. I have met people, constituents of mine, whose lives have been saved because of the Affordable Care  This is from one of my constituents:  ``My name is Kevin I am 62 years old and I'm a lifelong resident of Louisville,  ``I worked hard, took risks and built a successful small business that I sold at age 59. My wife and I were excited about our prospects as we headed into early retirement. As a retiree too young for Medicare, I purchased health insurance on the open market. Less than a year later, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I have undergone multiple scans and 2 cycles of chemo. I am winning the battle so far, but since this disease is in my blood I will be fighting it for the rest of my life.[[Page H2407]]  ``A cancer diagnosis is a life-changing event that not only attacks the body, but the mental stress is just as tough to deal with. Thanks to ObamaCare, I've been able to rest easier knowing that my illness wouldn't bankrupt my family and that I'll be able to provide for my wife even after I'm gone.''  I also heard from a young woman named Sarah She suffers from chronic kidney disease. Sarah was able to get health insurance because of the On January 9, 2011, it saved her life. One of her kidneys shut down and almost went septic. If she didn't have coverage, she would have waited or not gone to the hospital at all. The doctor told her that if she had arrived at the ER an hour later, she would have died.  Mr.Speaker, the health of my constituents Kevin Schweitzer and Sarah Adkins is at stake in this debate. They, and the hundreds of other constituents I have heard from who have serious and chronic health conditions, will need high-quality, affordable health coverage for the rest of their lives. Under this bill, they will get less coverage, it will cost more, and eventually they will be priced out of the market, leaving them nowhere to turn for the care they need.  And that is not all. Because of the last-minute changes to this bill, insurers will be able to sell stripped-down coverage to weed out people with preexisting conditions. They will be able to refuse, for example, to offer coverage for chemotherapy drugs and cancer treatments, insulin pumps, hospital stays, and prescription drugs that treat chronic conditions across the board. Basically, if you have a serious health problem, the care you need may not be available to you at all.  When the American people were promised by President Trump and Republican congressional leadership that their existing coverage would be preserved and that everybody would have insurance and it would be less expensive and much better, they, understandably, believed they would be treated much better than this. None of those promises are in this bill. In fact, the opposite of every one of those promises is what is in this bill. Those were promises made to every family in our congressional districts, and this bill fails them at every turn.
