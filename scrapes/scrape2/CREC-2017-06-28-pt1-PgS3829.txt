                        TRIBUTE TO LILLI JASPER

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of 
my Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee intern Lilli Jasper. 
Lilli hails from Sioux Falls, SD, and is a rising junior at South 
Dakota State University.
  While interning on the Commerce Committee, Lilli assisted the 
Communication, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet Subcommittee. 
She is a dedicated worker who was committed to getting the most out of 
her internship. I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Lilli 
for all of the fine work she did for the committee and wish her 
continued success in the years to come.
