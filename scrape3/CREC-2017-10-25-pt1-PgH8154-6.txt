       PREVENTING TAX-FREE BONDS FROM GOING TO ABORTION PROVIDERS

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the No Abortion Bonds 
Act, to end Federal tax-exempt bonds that support abortion providers.
  Under a loophole in the current law, cities, counties, and States can 
issue Federal tax-free bonds to finance construction of abortion 
clinics.
  In 2012, the New York City government issued a tax-free $15 million 
bond for a $30 million renovation of Planned Parenthood's national 
headquarters, which was subsequently sold 3 years later for $60 
million. In 2007, Sarasota County, Florida, floated an $8 million tax-
free bond to pay for a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic.
  These tax-free bonds are intended to finance schools, hospitals, 
infrastructure--not abortion clinics.
  The No Abortion Bonds Act has over 30 bipartisan cosponsors and is 
endorsed by Americans United for Life, Susan B. Anthony List, National 
Right to Life, March for Life, the Family Policy Alliance, and the 
Eagle Forum.
  Please join me today in applying the spirit of the Hyde amendment to 
the Tax Code by preventing tax-free bonds from going to abortion 
providers.
