       HONORING THE 23RD ANNUAL VERA HOUSE WHITE RIBBON CAMPAIGN

  (Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against domestic 
violence and sexual abuse. As a former Federal prosecutor for 20 years, 
I have seen firsthand how domestic violence affects people of all ages, 
races, religions, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
  According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, nearly 
20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner. We 
must work together to end this abuse.
  Central New York is home to Vera House, an organization that works to 
prevent and respond to domestic and sexual abuse. Yesterday, Vera House 
kicked off its 23rd Annual White Ribbon Campaign in central New York. 
This campaign raises awareness for the need to put an end to domestic 
violence and sexual abuse.
  This month, thousands of central New Yorkers will be wearing a white 
ribbon like I have on today, or a white wristband, to stand in 
solidarity against domestic and sexual violence.
  I urge my House colleagues to join me in wearing a white ribbon to 
demonstrate a personal pledge to work towards preventing violence 
against men, women, and children.
