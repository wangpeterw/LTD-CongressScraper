         REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.J. RES. 50

  Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my name be 
removed as a cosponsor of H.J. Res. 50 in order to emphasize my support 
of term limits under H.J. Res. 6.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Ohio?
  There was no objection.
