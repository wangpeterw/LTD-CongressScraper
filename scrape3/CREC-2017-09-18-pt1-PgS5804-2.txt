   SENATE RESOLUTION 261--RECOGNIZING THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 2017 AS 
                      ``ALASKA WILD SALMON MONTH''

  Ms. MURKOWSKI submitted the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 261

       Whereas the sustainable Alaska wild salmon commercial 
     fishery contributes over 38,000 jobs and nearly 
     $2,000,000,000 in annual labor income to the United States 
     economy;
       Whereas the commercial Alaska wild salmon harvest comprises 
     approximately 50 percent of the wild salmon caught worldwide;
       Whereas the sport fishing industry of the State of Alaska 
     generates $500,000,000 in economic output and creates 4,500 
     jobs annually;
       Whereas wild salmon returning to Alaskan streams and 
     rearing young in Alaskan water are the basis for one of the 
     most valuable and important industries of the State of 
     Alaska;
       Whereas commercial and sport salmon fishing and processing 
     provides the greatest number of private-sector employment 
     opportunities in the State of Alaska;
       Whereas many Alaskans depend heavily on subsistence-caught 
     wild salmon for food and cultural purposes;
       Whereas Alaska Natives have relied on Alaska wild salmon 
     for thousands of years, and Alaska wild salmon continues to 
     comprise up to 70 percent of the subsistence harvest of many 
     Alaska Native communities; and
       Whereas, in September 2017, Alaska Wild Salmon Month 
     celebrates and raises awareness nationwide regarding the 
     contributions of Alaska wild salmon to the health and economy 
     of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) recognizes September 2017 as ``Alaska Wild Salmon 
     Month''; and
       (2) encourages individuals, corporations, and other 
     relevant organizations to celebrate the sustainable Alaska 
     wild salmon industry and the health and social benefits 
     Alaska wild salmon provide to the United States.
