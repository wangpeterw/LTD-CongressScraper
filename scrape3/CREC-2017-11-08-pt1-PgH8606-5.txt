                        THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the 
need for tax policy that benefits hardworking families in New Hampshire 
and all across this country.
  We are long overdue for real tax reform, but, unfortunately, the plan 
unveiled by my Republican colleagues is more of a giveaway to 
millionaires, billionaires, and corporate special interests.
  In fact, consider this: 80 percent of the tax breaks in their bill go 
to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. This is while cutting $500 
billion from Medicare and $1 trillion from Medicaid. That trade is, 
frankly, unconscionable. This bill is a bad deal for Granite Staters 
and a bad deal for the American people.
  The Republican tax plan eliminates important deductions for 
hardworking middle class families. It caps property tax deductions, 
eliminates student loan interest deductions and the medical deduction 
tax credit. The plan even ends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit that 
encourages employers to hire veterans.
  House Democrats are offering a better deal. I urge my Republican 
colleagues to work with us to support working families.
