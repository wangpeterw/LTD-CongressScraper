       RECOGNIZING NATIONAL DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, October is National 
Disability Employment Awareness Month, and it is a time when we 
celebrate the numerous contributions and skills of American workers 
with disabilities.
  Many Americans with disabilities struggle to find employment 
opportunities despite the wealth of skills they have to offer. In 2016, 
only 27.7 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities were 
employed.
  More employers should recognize the fresh perspectives and skills 
that these men and women can add to an organization.
  Workers with developmental disabilities tend to be reliable, 
dedicated, and loyal employees with a positive attitude and a strong 
work ethic.
  Right here on Capitol Hill, my office participates in the 
Congressional Internship Program for Individuals with Intellectual 
Disabilities. This program is designed to give students with varying 
intellectual disabilities an opportunity to gain congressional work 
experience, and it has been rewarding for everyone involved.
  Mr. Speaker, hiring an individual who has a disability can have a 
profound impact on their life. They experience the independence, 
economic self-sufficiency, pride, and community that come with a job.
  These individuals promote workforce diversity and can truly enhance 
the workplace for the better.
