                 CONGRATULATING PLEASANT VALLEY VIKINGS

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was givenpermission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr.LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out the pride of Chico, 
California, and the First District. The Pleasant ValleyHigh School 
Vikings became State champions of football just a few weeks ago.
  It was a very exciting game. They traveledsouth to Long Beach for it, 
to beat St. Anthony. The resiliency of the Vikings was amazing. I 
didn't get to go to the gamemyself, but I was texting back and forth 
with a good friend down there. After a 17-13 halftime score, it ended 
up 50-49.
  The Vikings were back and forth, up and down. With just 1\1/2\ 
minutes left in the game, after a late interception by theother team, 
they were down by 8 points. But with about 1\1/2\ minutes to go, they 
drove the field, scored a touchdown, got the2-pointer and tied. They 
went into overtime. After giving up a touchdown to the other team in 
overtime, they came back, drovethe field once again, scored a 
touchdown, and went for two and became division champions for the State 
of California by a scoreof 50-49.
  Congratulations, Pleasant Valley Vikings. Well done. You showed a lot 
of heart.
