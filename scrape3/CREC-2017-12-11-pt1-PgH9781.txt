                         APP CHALLENGE WINNERS

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize West Seattle High 
School students Will Rasmussen and Aidan Day as the winners of 
Washington's Seventh District Congressional App Challenge.
  Will and Aidan developed an app that helps students and teachers 
maximize learning time in the classroom by automating the checking of 
attendance, which often takes several minutes of class. Will's and 
Aidan's design uses RFID technology to let students quickly tag into 
class using a keycard similar to ORCA cards, our region's transit 
access cards which allow passengers to pay their bus and train fare by 
swiping their cards.
  Our diverse group of App Challenge judges praised Will's and Aidan's 
ingenuity. Microsoft enterprise specialist Hammad Rajjoub called it ``a 
great idea to bring to life,'' because ``time is the most important 
asset we all have.'' Other judges suggested scaling it up for use in 
other school districts.
  Will's and Aidan's winning project is a model for all of us to use 
our creativity, knowledge, and ultimately the technology we create to 
benefit the greater good and improve our communities.
  Congratulations, Will and Aidan.
