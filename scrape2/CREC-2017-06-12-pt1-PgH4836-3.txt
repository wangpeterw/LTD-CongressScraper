                   AHCA TO REPEAL AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, last month, House Republicans passed 
the AHCA, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act, and now 
Republican Senators are working on their own version.
  So far, we know the plan they are developing will be a disaster for 
our economy and for countless Americans who will either pay more for 
their healthcare or struggle to afford coverage at all. The Senate plan 
would force working families to pay higher premiums, end Medicaid as we 
know it, and could make health insurance nearly unaffordable for people 
with preexisting conditions and older Americans.
  At this point, we don't know more details of the Senate plan because 
the Republican leadership is attempting to deny the American people a 
voice in their own healthcare system.
  We need a healthcare reform that lowers cost, expands coverage, and 
strengthens our economy. We need legislation written in the light of 
day that can survive public debate. We do not need this.
