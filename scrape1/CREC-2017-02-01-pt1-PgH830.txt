                      TRUMP WHITE HOUSE'S POLICIES

  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to give voice to millions 
of Illinoisans who are outraged by President Trump and his disastrous 
first week in office. He has already managed to achieve a 50 percent 
disapproval rating. Here is a recap of his first week:
  He closed the White House telephone line, has attacked the health of 
millions of families and started the process to repeal the ACA--
something that experts estimate will kill 43,000 Americans a year, has 
put politicians and politics between women and their ability to make 
their own healthcare choices.
  His Cabinet is stocked with a foreclosure king, a billionaire 
lobbyist, and someone rejected from the Federal bench for racially 
charged rhetoric.
  He capped off last week with the unconstitutional and un-American 
Muslim ban that makes us less safe. It was so awful that it achieved 
bipartisan condemnation. Even our allies are starting to retreat from 
us. More than a million U.K. citizens signed a petition to keep 
President Trump from visiting.
  As we face new and emerging threats, can we afford to allow this 
administration to alienate us from long-held allies? Mr. Speaker, it is 
time to get serious about the Trump White House's policies.
