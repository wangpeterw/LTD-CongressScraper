                      HONORING L. STEPHEN GAITHER

  (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank Mr. 
Stephen Gaither for his dedication and service to our Nation's 
veterans.
  After over 40 years of service, Mr. Gaither is retiring as the public 
affairs officer at the Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital in 
Columbia, Missouri.
  Mr. Gaither has spent his entire life serving this great Nation. In 
addition to his numerous years serving our veterans at the Truman VA, 
Mr. Gaither served in the United States Air Force, the Utah Air 
National Guard, and the Army Reserves.
  Since 1989, he has been an active volunteer for the Heart of Missouri 
United Way, a nonprofit organization that works to improve the economic 
and social conditions of those who reside in our local community. His 
passion for serving others will forever leave a mark on the Truman VA 
and the city of Columbia.
  So, Mr. Gaither, this week, as we celebrate Veterans Day, I want to 
thank you for your devotion and your work on behalf of our Nation's 
veterans and our community, and I want to wish you the very best in 
your retirement.
