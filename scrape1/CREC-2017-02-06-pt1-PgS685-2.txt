                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Gracious God of infinite goodness, confirm Your past mercies to us by 
empowering us to be faithful to Your commands. Help our lawmakers this 
day to use their understanding, affections, health, time, and talents 
to do what You desire. May they desire to please You with faithful 
service as You rule their hearts without a rival, guiding their 
thoughts, words, and works.
  Lord, enable them to fulfill their duty to love You with all their 
heart, mind, soul, and strength. Take possession of their hearts, and 
order their steps by the power of Your loving providence. Pour down 
Your blessings upon our Senators that they may ever promote liberty and 
justice for all.
  We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
