                        TRIBUTE TO STEVE JOHNSON

  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to Steve 
Johnson who is retiring on December 22, 2017, from his position as the 
manager of the U.S. Senate Dining Room.
  Mr. Johnson is a well-respected member of the Senate family. For over 
two decades, Mr. Johnson has managed the Senate Dining Room with care, 
enthusiasm, poise, and the utmost hospitality. He understands the rich 
history and importance of this institution and has witnessed much of 
its tradition over the years, serving Supreme Court Justices, Vice 
Presidents, and many of my Senate colleagues.
  Starting in 1995, Mr. Johnson's leadership has kept the Senate Dining 
Room running smoothly and efficiently. Whether it is tallying receipts

at the end of the day or providing specialized off-menu items to 
guests, everything Mr. Johnson does is done with the utmost attention 
to detail. Mr. Johnson treats everyone the same and always maintains a 
high level of professionalism.
  Mr. Johnson's work ethic and perseverance are visible throughout his 
personal life as well. In addition to his impressive tenure, he has 
completed 18 marathons while working in the Senate Dining Room, 
including the Boston Marathon a total of seven times.
  My colleagues and I would like to express our sincere thanks and 
gratitude for Mr. Johnson's 22 years of service. His institutional 
knowledge and unparalleled courtesy are greatly appreciated and will be 
deeply missed. Please join me in wishing Mr. Johnson and his wife, 
Joanne, a long and healthy retirement.
