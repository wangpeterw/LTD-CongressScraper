                  HIGHLIGHTING THE DIY GIRLS INVENTEAM

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the work of the 
DIY Girls InvenTeam, a group of 12 incredible young women from the San 
Fernando Valley. These young scientists invented a tent with solar 
panels to aid refugees and the homeless. Earlier this month, I had the 
opportunity to meet these 12 young women at their high school, my alma 
mater, San Fernando High.
  As an engineer myself, I recognize how impressive their work is. Not 
only did these women create something amazing, but it was rooted in a 
desire to help other people. The DIY Girls InvenTeam has received one 
of just fifteen $10,000 grants awarded by MIT. It is also noteworthy 
that these young scientists were able to come together through the help 
of DIY Girls, a grassroots program that empowers young women to become 
scientists.
  As their Representative, I am proud to highlight their work. I know 
we will continue to see great accomplishments from these bright, young 
women as they master science, technology, engineering, art, and math.
