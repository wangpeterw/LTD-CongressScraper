                      EXECUTIVE ORDER ON REFUGEES

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I believe that we live in the greatest 
country on Earth, and I am proud to say so. But I have to say that last 
week's executive order by President Trump on refugee resettlement is 
shaking that faith.
  How can we hold ourselves as a beacon of hope when we turn away tens 
of thousands of the most desperate and vulnerable of our men, women, 
and children of this planet? How can we be the light of the world when 
our policies are driven by darkness and fear?
  I am going to keep that light alive. I am going to fight to keep it 
that way because that is what we are, that is what we represent. I am 
going to fight because I still believe that we are that shining city on 
the hill. And I am going to fight for my State of Rhode Island, which 
was founded on the principle of free religious practice, not fear of 
the other. I am going to fight against injustice with my amazing 
constituents who joined together for the second weekend in a row of 
rallying at our State House to keep that light alive.
  Mr. Speaker, we are a strong country, but we are strong because of 
our values and our principles embodied in our Constitution. Let's 
continue to build that shining city on the hill for the world. I am 
going to continue this fight, and I hope my colleagues will, too.
