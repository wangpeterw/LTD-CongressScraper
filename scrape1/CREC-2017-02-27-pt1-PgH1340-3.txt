RECOGNIZING THE LIVE LIKE BELLA SUPERHERO 5K RUN/WALK AND THE RUN, WALK 
           AND STROLL 2K FOR CEREBRAL PALSY IN SOUTH FLORIDA

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House

[[Page H1341]]

for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the members of 
my south Florida community who came out last Saturday to the Live Like 
Bella Superhero 5K Run/Walk at Zoo Miami.
  Live Like Bella works every day to fight pediatric cancer through 
medical research while offering much-needed support for families and 
caregivers.
  I would also like to recognize the Run, Walk and Stroll 2K for 
Cerebral Palsy that took place in the Village of Palmetto Bay, located 
in my congressional district, also on Saturday. This walk brought 
together patients, families, friends, and volunteers to shed light on 
how cerebral palsy can impact those afflicted and to provide much-
needed assistance for therapy programs and special needs equipment.
  Live Like Bella and the Cerebral Palsy Walk are just two of the 
latest examples of south Floridians banding together to help others.
