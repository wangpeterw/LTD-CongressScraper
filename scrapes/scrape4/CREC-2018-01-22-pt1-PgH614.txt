            URGING SENATE DEMOCRATS TO REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, last week the House voted to keep the 
government open with legislation that, on any other day, every Member 
would have supported. It funded the government and it reauthorized CHIP 
for 6 years, a program that 24,000 Montana children depend on for their 
healthcare needs.
  On any other day, these proposals would pass with broad bipartisan 
support, but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in this 
Chamber opposed it and 44 Senate Democrats opposed it. And for what?
  An unrelated immigration issue that can be addressed before March.
  What has been the result of these misplaced priorities?
  The government shutdown. More than 2 million servicemen and -women 
aren't being paid; 9 million American children, including 24,000 in 
Montana, are losing their healthcare insurance.
  My colleagues in the Senate will soon consider reopening the 
government. I urge them, particularly the 44 Senate Democrats who voted 
for the Schumer shutdown, to reopen the government, pay our troops, and 
restore health insurance to children.
