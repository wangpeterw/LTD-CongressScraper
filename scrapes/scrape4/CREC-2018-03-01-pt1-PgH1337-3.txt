                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Gene Hemrick, St. Joseph's Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Lord, on the east side of our U.S. Capitol stands a statue of peace 
that is a divine quality of Your love. We pray that You inspire the 
creativity of our Congress in pursuing peace in a world that is more 
hostile than nonviolent. May our Congress embrace Your wisdom for 
opening hearts in which reconciliation is preferred to strife; a time 
when lion and lamb will lie down together.
  Amen.
