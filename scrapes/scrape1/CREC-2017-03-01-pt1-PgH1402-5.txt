                       NEBRASKA SESQUICENTENNIAL

  (Mr. BACON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 150th 
Statehood Day of the great State of Nebraska.
  This day is a proud day for all Nebraskans. Today, we honor the long 
and rich history of our State and the contributions our citizens have 
made to our country and the world.
  On March 1, 1867, Nebraska became the 37th State, and much has 
happened since then. In a century and half, Nebraska has grown to not 
only be the leader in agriculture, but also in technology and business.
  From the Sandhills of western Nebraska to the many neighborhoods of 
Omaha, one can see each day the evidence of the extraordinary 
industriousness of my fellow Nebraskans. Across nearly 49,000 farms and 
ranches, our proud citizens are responsible for a multi-billion-dollar 
agriculture market producing food that fuels the world.
  Nebraska is home to many great and wonderful things, but what I 
celebrate about Nebraska Statehood Day more than anything is the 
State's wonderful people.
  In roughly 30 years in the Air Force, I had 16 assignments, taking my 
family all over the world. During these 16 assignments, I found that 
nowhere were the people nicer and more accommodating to military 
families than Nebraskans. We found out that there is no place like 
Nebraska, and we are happy to call Nebraska home. Nebraska truly is the 
good life.
