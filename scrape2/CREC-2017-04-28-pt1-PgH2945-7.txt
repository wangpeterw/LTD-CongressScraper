                         HONORING CLAIRE LOVELL

  (Ms. BONAMICI asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Claire 
Lovell, an accomplished columnist and devoted resident of Seaside, 
Oregon.
  North coast residents are richer for Claire's presence, and I join 
them in celebrating her life and her legacy. For 27 years, Claire's 
column chronicled the happenings of Seaside with cogent prose and an 
observant eye.
  First known as ``Overheard: Notes from Seaside,'' and later ``Scene 
and Heard,'' her column was the first thing readers went to when they 
eagerly opened their newspapers. Indeed, some readers bought the 
newspaper just for her column.
  Claire was a Seaside resident for almost all of her 96 years, and no 
one was better qualified to document the city's life. Whether she was 
sharing her observations on politics, popular culture, growing older, 
or the birth of her first great-grandchild, Claire enriched each topic 
with her signature verve and keen love of the written word.
  In a recent column, Claire wrote: Whether one is 5-years old or 95, 
as the case may be, life's small pleasures are very important.

  For decades, one of Seaside's small pleasures was reading her column. 
It is my honor to recognize Claire Lovell's many contributions to our 
community and to offer my condolences to her family and the Seaside 
community on the loss of this remarkable woman.
  Her wit, wisdom, and well-chosen words will not be forgotten.
