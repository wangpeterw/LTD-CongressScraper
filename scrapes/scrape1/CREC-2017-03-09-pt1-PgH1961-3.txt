                  REPEALING THE ACA HURTS MY DISTRICT

  (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I want to share with you what repealing the 
Affordable Care Act means to Pennsylvania's Second Congressional 
District:
  369,000 people who receive health care from their employers could 
lose consumer protections;
  335,000 people with health coverage that covers preventive care 
services could lose their coverage;
  62,000 people covered by Medicaid expansion could lose their 
coverage;
  21,000 people who receive financial assistance will be at greater 
risk of not being able to afford coverage.
  These are our mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and 
daughters, and friends and neighbors. Philadelphia deserves a 
healthcare law that offers quality, affordable care. We must continue 
to speak up and speak out against the new healthcare law that hurts so 
many people in our city, our State, and our Nation.
