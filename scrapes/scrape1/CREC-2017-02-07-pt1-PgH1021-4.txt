                DIMINISH THE BLIGHT OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to 
efforts to diminish the blight of human trafficking on my district, the 
country, and the world.
  Each year, millions of individuals worldwide, most often children and 
those living in poverty, fall victim to human trafficking. According to 
the National Human Trafficking Hotline, approximately 550 cases were 
reported in Florida last year.
  In my district, Pasco County law enforcement officials have been hard 
at work to combat human trafficking and protect victims locally. We 
have seen it too many times in our own community.
  I also wish to highlight the commitment to end human trafficking 
worldwide by the Greek Orthodox Church. This week, His All Holiness 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew hosted a forum in Istanbul, Turkey, 
alongside religious leaders, scholars, and policymakers to address the 
issue of modern-day slavery.
  I commend their cooperative leadership and stand with them in 
promoting peace and human dignity internationally.
