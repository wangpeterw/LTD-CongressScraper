  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, next week is the fifth anniversary 
of the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Just over 2 months ago, 
a mass shooter took the lives of 58 at a concert in Las Vegas; and 31 
days ago, Sutherland Springs, Texas, was changed forever.
  But just minutes ago, my Republican colleagues memorialized those 
deaths by passing a bill that would increase the risk of this happening 
in communities like yours and mine. To pass a bill written by the NRA 
at the expense of the safety and security of residents and law 
enforcement is an absolute disgrace.
  To allow people, including those with dangerous histories, to carry 
hidden, loaded guns anywhere across the country is simply shameful.
  First, by stripping healthcare and now this, it seems that the 
Republican agenda is fostering death over life.
