                          GOP HEALTHCARE BILL

  (Miss RICE of New York asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, people in my district and in 
districts all across the country have been making it clear that they 
don't want millions of Americans to become uninsured just to cut taxes 
for the rich. They don't want Congress to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act.
  What they want is for Democrats and Republicans to work together to 
make it better: to keep expanding coverage, reducing costs, and 
improving care. Now that the Senate has delayed a vote on the BCRA, we 
have yet another opportunity to do just that.
  I urge my Republican colleagues to move past repeal and replace once 
and for all. Democrats are ready to work with you. So let's seize this 
opportunity and start solving problems for the people we serve.
