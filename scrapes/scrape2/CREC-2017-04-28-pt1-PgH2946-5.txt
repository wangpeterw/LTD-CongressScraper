       QUALITY ACCESS AND INCLUSION FOR THOSE WITH DOWN SYNDROME

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of my 
constituent Evan Rothholz, an energetic, tech-savvy kindergarten 
student who happens to have Down syndrome.
  Down syndrome is a condition that results from having an additional 
full or partial copy of chromosome 21. Since his diagnosis, 6-year-old 
Evan, along with his parents, Mitchel and Julie, advocate for others 
with Down syndrome and help educate families facing this unexpected 
diagnosis.
  I am appreciative of the work of the Pennsylvania Down Syndrome 
Advocacy Coalition, a group of concerned parents, self-advocates, 
supporters, committed to achieving quality access and inclusion for all 
individuals with Down syndrome in the State of Pennsylvania.
  As a member of the Congressional Task Force on Down Syndrome, I am 
very proud to support H.R. 1896, the ABLE to Work Act, which provides 
more flexibility for thousands of individuals with disabilities, 
allowing them to save and plan for the future.
  It is Evan's hope that individuals with Down syndrome, and all of 
those in the special needs community, will have the same educational 
and financial opportunities that are afforded to others.
