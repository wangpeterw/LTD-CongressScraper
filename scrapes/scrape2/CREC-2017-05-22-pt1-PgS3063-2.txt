              TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL H. MICHAEL EDWARDS

 Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and 
commend Maj. Gen. H. Michael Edwards, who retired on March 31, 2017, 
after 43 years of exceptional leadership and service to our country, 
including 36 years in the Colorado Air National Guard.
  For almost a decade in the position of the adjutant general for 
Colorado, General Edwards was responsible for the command 
administration of over 5,300 Army and Air National Guard members.
  He also served as the executive director of the Department of 
Military and Veterans Affairs and was a member of the Governor's 
cabinet.
  He had responsibility for the Colorado National Guard's primary 
missions of national defense and State emergency response. In addition, 
he was responsible for supporting the missions of the Civil Air 
Patrol's Colorado wing.
  General Edwards received his commission in 1973, after graduating 
from the Air Force Academy, and earned his pilot wings in 1974 at Reese 
Air Force Base, TX.
  He served as an F-4 pilot and AT-38 fighter lead-in instructor pilot 
at Osan Air Base, Korea, and Holloman Air Force Base, NM, respectively.
  General Edwards joined the Colorado Air National Guard in August 
1980. He has served in numerous assignments in flying and operations, 
as well as command positions at squadron, group, and wing levels--
culminating as the adjutant general for Colorado.
