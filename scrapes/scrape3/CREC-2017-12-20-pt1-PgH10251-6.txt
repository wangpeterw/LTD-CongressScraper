             THIS IS THE WRONG DIRECTION AND THE WRONG BILL

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, on the floor of this House and, I 
guess, again today, there will be a vote on this massive tax cut 
targeted to people at the very top, targeting big cuts for 
corporations.
  Like many Members on this side of the aisle, I welcome the 
opportunity to do comprehensive, real tax reform. And for a long time, 
the discussion in this body and around the country was about the need 
to lower the rates and broaden the base and eliminate some of those 
loopholes that allow some corporations to get away with paying 
literally no taxes at all. But instead of doing that, what we saw was a 
massive shift of the responsibility to fund the government away from 
people at the top to people who work hard every day.
  There are many examples of how we could have done this better. There 
was a lot of discussion on the Senate side about the child tax credit. 
But why did we end up with a child tax credit that rewards a minimum 
wage family with about $75 a year, when somebody making $400,000 would 
get $4,000? I mean, is the life of a child of a family making a half a 
million dollars worth that much more?
  This is the wrong direction. This is the wrong bill. We should reject 
it.
