                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Everlasting God, our light and our salvation, You are the strength 
and shield of our Nation and world. Lord, as we receive the gift of 
this new year, we thank You for fresh starts and new mercies.
  May our lawmakers seize the seeds of opportunity that reside in the 
soil of their tomorrows, laboring diligently to ensure an abundant 
harvest. Teach them to number their days as they remember that they 
pass this way but once. Lord, remind them that Your hand is on the helm 
of human affairs and that You still guide Your world. Give our 
legislators the integrity to strive to do all the good they can, for as 
many as they can, for as long as they can. Bless our Senators who are 
leaving and those who are coming.
  We pray in Your sovereign Name. Amen.
