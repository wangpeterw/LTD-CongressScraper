                             A BETTER DEAL

  (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because it is 
long past time that the American people got a better deal.
  All Americans want the same thing: a fair chance to get ahead and a 
better deal than the raw deal that many have right now.
  Granite Staters in my district want to have the skills to get ahead 
in the 21st century economy. We want better pay and better jobs. Many 
women, and increasingly more men, are what we know as the ``sandwich'' 
generation, caring for young children and aging parents and relatives, 
often at the same time.
  That is why we need paid family leave and sick leave. We need to 
expand our educational system and skills training for all types of 
opportunities.
  Just this week, the Girl Scouts of America announced 23 new merit 
badges in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This is 
symbolic of what we need to do as a nation. Encourage young people, 
boys and girls, to pursue their interests in the fields that will be 
the cornerstone of the 21st century economy.
  America deserves a better deal, and that is what we are offering.
