9,2244,Ralph,ABRAHAM,REPRESENTATIVE,R,LA,5.0,A000374,115,9,topic-id,236,"Mr.Speaker, I am honored to introduce this resolution with my good friend, Representative Sam Johnson of Texas, one of the greatest patriots I have had the honor to come in contact with and a lifelong defender of our freedoms in  This resolution can be boiled down to one point: no bureaucrat should be able to deny an American his or her constitutional rights just because someone else handles their finances.  In the midnight hour of President Obama's last days in office, the Social Security Administration finalized a rule that would allow it to send the name of any beneficiary to the FBI's criminal background check system if they are assigned a representative payee due to mental impairment.  Allowing bureaucrats at the Social Security Administration to determine whether or not a beneficiary is fit to exercise their Second Amendment rights is a clear violation of due process that every American is afforded.  When this awful rule was proposed in 2015, both Representative Sam Johnson of Texas and I introduced legislation to prevent the Social Security Administration from carrying it out. With the introduction of this joint resolution, I am pleased that Congress and the President will now have the opportunity to review and to reverse this terrible rule.  That is why I strongly urge my colleagues, in both the House and the Senate, to pass this resolution and keep the government bureaucracies from putting themselves before the  ",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgH894-3.txt,CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgH894-3.xml,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017,2,February

178,1695,Lamar,ALEXANDER,SENATOR,R,TN,,A000360,115,178,topic-id,3352,"Mr.President, tonight the Senator from Maryland, Mr.Cardin, and I and a bipartisan group of U.Senators, have submitted a resolution reaffirming the strong alliance between the United States and I wish to speak about that for a few minutes.  I don't know what happened during last week's telephone call between the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Australia, but I do know this: The people of the United States do not have better friends than the people of  We are more than friends. As one Australian told me when our family lived there thirty years ago, ``Well, we're mates all right. The English may be our ancestors but you Americans are our cousins. First cousins. We started out the same kind of people. Underprivileged, a long way from home, doing the same kind of thing, looking for a new life. Found a hard life. Hoped it would be a better one for our children. Each wave of new ones lifted up the last ones. A pioneering spirit in the countryside here. In America, too.''  Even though they live down under on the other side of the world, for a century Australians have stood with us every time we are at war, and we have stood with them. During World War II, when Australian troops were fighting in North Africa and Europe, and the Japanese were bombing Darwin four times a day, the United States came to the rescue. In 1992, Dick Cheney and I, as members of President George H.Bush's Cabinet, traveled to Australia to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, when the U.Navy stopped Japan's advance. Today, no two countries trust one another and cooperate in security arrangements more than Australia and We trade, we visit one another, and our[[Page S749]]students study in each other's universities.  Thirty years ago, our family lived an American dream and we moved to We arrived on Australia Day, January 26, 1987, 199 years after the first fleet of English settlers sailed into Sydney After 8 years of swiveling in the Governor's chair, on the very day I was sworn out of office, my wife Honey and I and our four children flew to Sydney for Six Months Off in the ``Land Down Under.'' It was my wife's idea: an opportunity for a retreat from the merry-go-round of power and to discover what really was important.  We rented a home in view of the most beautiful harbor in the world, bought an Australian car, and I learned to drive on the wrong side of the road. Our four children walked to Australian schools, and we all sank deeply into the culture of America's favorite cousins. I attended Chester Arthur Society meetings, where Australian Parliament members competed to show that they know more about American history than United States Senators do. We spent the night in the South Wales bush. We saw 9-foot crocodiles in the Northwest We traveled by train to see the Melbourne Zoo and took a horseback trip across the Snowy It didn't take long for us to understand what Mark Twain meant when he wrote: ``When a stranger from America steps ashore in Sydney . . . the thing that strikes him is that it is an English City with American trimmings.''  We made friends then that exist to this day. Last year, four of those friends, the Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr and the Australian Ambassador to the United States Kim Beazley and their wives, spent the weekend with us at our home outside the Great Smoky Mountains in We cherish those friendships and our country's relationship with It is always appropriate for the U.Senate to reaffirm the importance of that relationship, and I am glad to join Senator Cardin and a long list of bipartisan U.Senators to do that again today.  To offer a more complete understanding of what makes the Australians our favorite cousins, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record chapter 30 from my book ``Six Months Off,'' written after our time in  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       Chapter 30--First Cousins       ``When a stranger from America steps ashore in Sydney . . .      the thing that strikes him is that it is an English city with      American trimmings.''--Mark Twain, Following the Equator       You would have thought the Sydney taxi driver, who was      English, was speaking of his barely grown-up stepchildren.       ``They hate the English, the Why? Because they      realize we're superior. Minute they find out you're from      England they've got a chip on their shoulder. It's the      convict thing--you know they came from convicts. It's the      darndest thing I've ever gotten myself into. I've been here      four years and now I've got a superiority complex.''       The taxi paused at the entrance to the harbor bridge, but      no one was waiting to take the toll. I had read in the      morning Herald how toll-takers were striking in support of      the postal workers, who had stopped carrying mail while they      bargained for a pay increase. We sped on across without      paying and the genealogy lesson continued. ``Master the      little quirks of living here and you know it's not a bad      place, but the Aussies still need convincing of the fact.      They'll find their own identity one day. Then they won't have      to come on so strong. Over the years England ruled a bit too      heavily here, but the Aussies are their own people now. They      don't have to always prove themselves to anybody, but they      do.''       The Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton Wentworth Hotel was      crowded with guests, black-tied and long-gowned for the      Australian-American Bicentennial Honey and I found      our places and introduced ourselves and found that the other      ten who were dining with us at large round table number 27      were all We sat down and then were immediately      invited to rise so that the American ambassador could toast      the queen of The governor-general of Australia      responded with a toast to the president of the United States,      and we sat again.       ``He is the only man in Australia for whom everyone will      always stand,'' explained the lady on my right, as the      governor-general began speaking so gently that the raucous      table talk in the ballroom quieted.       ``It is a happy accident of fate that the Constitution of      the United States was being signed in 1787 just as our first      fleet was sailing eastward across the Atlantic from Rio to      Cape Town on the third leg of its ten-months long voyage. The      fleet carried a cargo of convicts who would have been on      their way to Georgia had not the American Revolution      succeeded and denied the British the opportunity to send      their prisoners to America.''       The lady on my right, who wore a white dress and dangling      gold earrings, whispered, ``It's the 'in' thing now, you      know, to trace back to see if your ancestors were on the      first fleet. A lot of people have always known they were      descended from lawbreakers, but very few had been willing to      spend money to prove it.''       The governor-general was proceeding toward a triumphant      conclusion. ``The links between our two nations have evolved      from earliest times. Out pioneers, like yours, were as      unlikely a band as one could conceive. Your gold rush spilled      into ours. Our constitution has been built on yours. Our      soldiers have died together and we have shared freedoms of      speech and of associations and of laws and of humanities and      of civil liberties--and now both of us are a melting pot. We      read your prose, we speak your poetry and watch your plays      and films. We even watch your terrible TV dramas!''       Applause and generous expressions of affection erupted all      around, and the governor-general smiled, cautiously      retreated, and sat, and Dame Leonie Kramer of the University      of Sydney rose and strode to the microphone and spoke      bluntly.       ``We are profoundly interested in one another, but we are      more profoundly ignorant. Americans, for example, are      enchanted that this is the land of the crocodiles but they      don't seem to have enough sense to stay out of the water when      they are here.''       Dame Leonie Kramer then sat, and our table plunged into      grilled fresh fish and boiled asparagus tips and hot      conversation.       The car dealer on my left said, ``When I was in America,      they thought we had roos hopping in the streets and crocs in      the swimming pools and abos behind the fences.'' His short-     cropped hair and narrow tie and innocent eagerness would have      made him a perfect candidate for the role of father in a      1950s American family television series.       His plumpish wife agreed. ``Most Americans can't find      Australia on the map, and even when they do you always have      to prove to them that it's as bi as the United States.''       Her husband laughed. ``One bloke coming to the America's      Cup almost went back when he found out Perth is as far from      Sydney as L.is from New York.''       A tanned young blond woman, sitting between the car dealer      and me, said, ``I was skiing in Denver once, was on the lift,      and an American man was in the next seat and he was trying to      come on to me, and so he asks me, `In Australia it's summer,      isn't it?,' and I say `Right.' And then in a minute he says,      `And what month is it in Australia?'''       The Australians especially enjoyed that, which encouraged      the blonde, who turned to me and asked, ``How do you like      Australia?'' She asked this in the same worried way      Californians used to question visiting New       I said, ``It's beautiful and friendly, but what surprises      me is how much like America it is. Sometimes I think I'm at a      family on another planet.''       The blonde said, ``It is another planet, orbiting in sight      of the big ones but never to be one.''       The plumpish wife of the car dealer agreed. ``We always      seem to be missing something.''       I said, ``But, for an American, coming to Australia is      almost better than going home again. When you try to go home      again it's a disappointment. It's only nearly perfect. But      when you come to Australia it's such a pleasant surprise how      nearly perfect it is.''       The car dealer said, ``I reckon everyone in America must      have heard about your family reunion. Three hundred thousand      of 'em coming this year. That's what the telly said.''       The lady in the white dress and earrings on my right asked,      ``Isn't Australia just the flavor-of-the-month in America?      Couldn't we just as well be Timbuktu?''       ``It's more than that,'' her thin and red-faced husband      said. He was a member of       Honey, who was sitting on the right of the member of      Parliament, suggested, ``Some Americans come here looking for      `The America that Was.' ''       The M.said, ``Some of us hope America is the ``Australia      the Might Be.' ''       The car dealer leaned across the table and said to them,      ``And you'll both be disappointed. Australia's the land of      bushmen and sheepshearers and croc hunters in about the same      way America's the land of Hopalong Cassidy and the cowboys.''       His plumpish wife supported him. ``Crocodile Dundee's a      fairy tale, isn't that right? And America's not really like      Miami Vice.'' She didn't seem entirely sure.       I said, ``Sometimes we don't know so much about ourselves.      Sometimes we're visitors in our own countries.''       Waiters arrived with plates of an Australian dessert called      a Pavlova--whipped cream and fresh papaya in meringue shell--     and exclamations over its fluffiness only temporarily      diminished the conversation.       ``Well, we're mates, all right.'' The car dealer could not      tolerate a lull. ``The English may be our ancestors, but you      Americans are our cousins''.       ``First cousins,'' said the thin, red-faced member of      Parliament, whom I sensed correctly was preparing to make a      statement. ``We started out the same kind of people,      underprivileged, a long way from home, doing[[Page S750]]     the same sort of thing, looking for a new life. Found a hard      life. Hoped it would be better for the children. Each wave of      new ones lifted up the last ones. A pioneering spirit in the      countryside here. In America, too.''       ``I love America!'' exclaimed the wife of the Australian      bicentennial chairman who was sitting across the table. Her      cheerful face had been hidden behind an enormous centerpiece      of flowers. ``When they sing `New York, New York' I get      excited with the best of 'em. It's our second home. It opens      your eyes a bit, doesn't it, to get out of your own      country.''       ``When you do, we look awfully small.'' The speaker was a      dour bald gentleman sitting next to her, who might have been      seventy, a plywood manufacturer who was rather obstructed by      the centerpiece. For the moment, he held the floor. ``Our GNP      is about the size of the GNP of Los Angeles.''       The blond woman said, ``Australia's a village, same names      always popping up.''       The plywood man said, ``Americans have got a head start and      size and location and better education, and they have more      self-confidence.''       This resonated with the blond woman's male guest, whose      name I never got in all the din and who now decided to talk      to me. ``We follow You regulate the stock market, so      we do it, too. You change school curriculum. We do it, too.      Don't think about it. Just do it.''       ``We'd have been better off to start with pilgrims and a      revolution, instead of convicts,'' said the plywood      manufacturer.       ``We could have used an Alamo,'' suggested the car dealer.      ``We had Gallipoli,'' said the blonde's friend.       ``Wouldn't it have been nice to have something in the      center besides a red desert?'' sighed the plywood man's wife.       The last of the fluffy Pavlova had been scraped from the      plates, and the coffee and mints arrived.       The young blond woman suddenly turned to me and insisted,      ``I reckon I ought to have a quarter of a vote every time you      elect a president. I should. After all, we sit here half our      time waiting for American to do something. Our prime minister      can't make a deal with No one's wondering what      Australia's trade policy will be. We have to depend on you.''       ``We already do,'' said the member of ``Do      what?'' asked the blonde.       ``Depend on For defense. For things we really      enjoy. Ask any of our school kids. I've done it. `Where would      you like to go on this planet?' and nine out of ten say,      `Disneyland.' The script for every Australian Tonight show      was prepared by an American until recently.''       The car dealer was saying to Honey, ``We never can have      anything like the things that you have in There're      not enough of us Disneyland and interstate      highways--things that are ordinary to you--are a wonder to      us. Space stations. All the museums in Washington, D.C.''       ``Another reason we can't is what's happening on Pitt      Street,'' intoned the plywood manufacturer.       ``The esplanade work?''       ``The lack of it. Did you hear the workers complained about      passersby harassing them for leaning on their shovels? And      that yesterday the arbitration board awarded them a twenty-     seven-cent wage increase because of the harassment!''       The blond woman's date said, ``Watch them on MacQuarie      Street, at the restoration, the workers smearing suntan oil.      It would make a good frame for `still life.' I watched them      from my club window yesterday at lunch.''       The car dealer said, ``Sunday's Herald said United stewards      works twice as much as Qantas stewards.''       I said, ``You see that on flights to The same Qantas      crews going up on Monday and coming back on And      last month the Bridgestone Tire Company president told me his      tire plants work three hundred forty-five days in Japan and      America, and the Bridgestone plant in Adelaide works only two      hundred ten.''       The plywood man looked positively funereal. ``We're      unusual, all right. We pay double time for afternoon work,      for overtime, for vacation. We pay for days off on a      butchers' picnic and a bakers' picnic--everybody has a picnic      and we pay for that. How are we going to compete with the      rest of the world when we're on a picnic?''       Now the men were enjoying long cigars and the ladies were      doing their best to survive the haze, and my watch said the      dinner had already lasted three hours.       Honey said. ``I see a lot of Japanese cars and American      fast foods, but I don't hear much proper Is it      because I'm American and just don't notice it?''       ``It's because we've changed,'' said a lady across the      table who up till now had been mostly listening. ``We moved      here in 1978. We decided Sydney winters were better than      English summers, so we sold our house in Then,      Australians still spoke of `going home' to Now, no      one talks about `going home.' Australianness is coming out      all round. We're more American, too, but mainly we're prouder      of being Australian.''       The wife of the member of Parliament said to Honey, ``Read      our children's books. I'll send you some for your children.      Instead of stories about English hobgoblins, there are more      about aborigine spirits and stories full of the sounds of      frogs croaking and of the didgeridoo, hostile and growling      like the bely of the earth.''       Honey said, ``The new Sheraton in Yulara was lovely, brown      like the desert and built like sails.''       The wife of the M.said, ``Our Australianness came out      all right when they tried to kill the brumbies in the Snowy      Put a stop to that.''       Honey said, ``We've seen a lot of Australia in David      Williamson's plays and Mary Gilmore's poetry and Ken Done's      bright splashy painting . . .''       ``. . . and Fred Elliot's old marine watercolors even if he      was drunk a lot,'' I added.       The wife of the plywood manufacturer said, ``And I believe      we're learning that our harsh vast spaces and distance from      everyone sometimes can be a wonderful advantage.'' Those were      the first words she had uttered in nearly two hours.       From behind the centerpiece of flowers came the cheerful      contribution of the wife of the bicentennial chairman.      ``Eight hundred ten of our eight hundred thirty shires have      bicentennial committees.''       The member of Parliament added, ``At least now we toast the      queen of Australia instead of the empire.'' His wife, on my      right with white dress and earrings, asked me, ``Have you      tried the wichety grubs, the moth larvae the abos used to      eat? They're all the rage. Large and crispy and in all the      best restaurants.''       ``No,'' I said, ``but I have been to the beaches and I have      thought about those convicts who were laughing at the      aborigines standing there sandy and naked and greasy. Now,      the descendants of some of those first-fleet convicts are on      the same beaches, sandy and naked and greasy.''       The member of Parliament had arranged himself into speaking      position. ``The English left us. We didn't leave      them. They joined the Common Gave us five years to      adjust our exports.''       This roused the car dealer, who said, ``It goes back to the      last war. Churchill said, `Let them have We'll win      it back.' Our boys were on the other side, fighting in North      Africa and in Europe and the Japanese were bombing Darwin      four times a day. The Americans saved us.''       His wife, who was finishing off his mints, too, agreed.      ``Two Christmases ago there were ten thousand American      sailors in Perth and some family took every one of `em home      for the holidays.''       The lights dimmed and the official bicentennial film began.      Trumpets heralded the arrival of the first fleet of      ``settlers'' on Australia's Identity Day, January 26, 1788,      and violins moved the story quickly along into the nineteenth      century, and then lingered amid the excitement of the gold      rush at       I whispered to the wife of the member of Parliament, ``It      didn't mention that the `settlers' were convicts.''       ``No worries,'' she said. ``The first bicentennial logo      forgot Had to make a new one. But it's a good      thing, our bicentennial. Helps us remember important      things.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-06-pt1-PgS748.txt,CREC-2017-02-06-pt1-PgS748.xml,SENATE RESOLUTION 50--REAFFIRMING A STRONG COMMITMENT TO THE UNITED,2017,6,February
223,1695,Lamar,ALEXANDER,SENATOR,R,TN,,A000360,115,223,topic-id,663,"Madam President, with this vote, the Senate will move early next week to confirm the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be the U.Education In my judgment, she will be an excellent and important Education Secretary for this country.  The 1 job of the U.Education Secretary is to help create an environment in which our 100,000 public schools succeed, because that is where 9 out of 10 of our children go.  When I was Education Secretary for President George H.Bush in the early 1990s, I had the privilege of working with a man named David Kerns, who had been the chief executive officer of the Xerox He came in as the Deputy Education Secretary at a time when he was not only one of the country's leading businessmen, but he was also the leading businessman who tried to help change public education. David Kern's belief was that it was very difficult to help children by changing public education if you try to do it from within. As all of us do, he respected the teachers, the parents, and the students who work within the public education system, but over the last 30 years, as this country has worked to try to improve our public schools, much of that energy has come from outside the public school establishment. Among those were the Governors of the country.  In the mid-1980s, all of the Governors met together--in 1985 and 1986--on one subject for a whole year. The purpose was, how can we help improve our public schools? I was chairman of the National Governors Association that year, Bill Clinton was the vice chairman, and we did that in a bipartisan way. We did that from outside the schools. Since that time, many Governors and many business leaders have worked hard in support of our public schools, trying to help them have even better opportunities for our children. Among those has been Betsy The Governors I spoke of are Governors who are familiar names in this country. I think of Jeb Bush, John Engler of Michigan, Mitt Romney, and the work they did in their respective States to make their public schools better and to create other opportunities for children. All of the three Governors I mentioned--Bush, Romney, and Engler--support Betsy  As chairman of the Senate's Education Committee, there are 22 Governors who have written letters to me supporting Betsy They see her as someone from outside the system of public education who, as they worked for 30 years, can help change and improve it.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my remarks the names of the 22 Governors who support her. They come from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and  The Governors of all those States support Betsy Four of the last Education Secretaries support Betsy Bill Bennett, Rod Paige, Margaret Spellings, and I support her. Joe Lieberman, who served in this body and worked on the DC voucher program for many years, endorsed her. She has strong support from the Governors who for 30 years have been working hard to successfully improve our public schools.  Some have said: Well, she has spent her time working on giving children choices of schools other than public schools.  She has done that, and it has always puzzled me as to why anybody would criticize that. The idea that a low-income child should have the same opportunity or more of the same opportunities as a wealthy family has would seem to me to be a very all-American idea. Not only does it seem to be, it is an idea that underlies the most successful piece of social policy our country has ever enacted, arguably--the GI[[Page S665]]bill for veterans in 1944. Think about that. The veterans came home from World War We gave them a scholarship. It followed them to the college of their choice.

Unless the      chairman and ranking minority member agree on a shorter      period of time, the minority shall have no fewer than three      business days to prepare supplemental, minority or additional      views for inclusion in a committee report from the time the      majority makes the proposed text of the committee report      available to the minority.[[Page S579]]       Rule 17.--(a) The committee, or any subcommittee, may issue      subpoenas, or hold hearings to take sworn testimony or hear      subpoenaed witnesses, only if such investigative activity has      been authorized by majority vote of the committee.       (b) For the purpose of holding a hearing to take sworn      testimony or hear subpoenaed witnesses, three members of the      committee or subcommittee shall constitute a quorum:      provided, with the concurrence of the chairman and ranking      minority member of the committee or subcommittee, a single      member may hear subpoenaed witnesses or take sworn testimony.

Prior to the issuance of each subpoena, the ranking      minority member of the committee or subcommittee, and any      other member so requesting, shall be notified regarding      the identity of the person to whom it will be issued and      the nature of the information sought and its relationship      to the authorized investigative activity, except where the      chairman of the committee or subcommittee, in consultation      with the ranking minority member, determines that such      notice would unduly impede the investigation. All      information obtained pursuant to such investigative      activity shall be made available as promptly as possible      to each member of the committee requesting same, or to any      assistant to a member of the committee designated by such      member in writing, but the use of any such information is      subject to restrictions imposed by the rules of the      Such information, to the extent that it is      relevant to the investigation shall, if requested by a      member, be summarized in writing as soon as practicable.

(d) Any witness summoned to testify at a hearing, or any      witness giving sworn testimony, may be accompanied by counsel      of his own choosing who shall be permitted, while the witness      is testifying, to advise him of his legal rights.       (e) No confidential testimony taken or confidential      material presented in an executive hearing, or any report of      the proceedings of such an executive hearing, shall be made      public, either in whole or in part or by way of summary,      unless authorized by a majority of the members of the      committee or subcommittee.       Rule 18.--Presidential nominees shall submit a statement of      their background and financial interests, including the      financial interests of their spouse and children living in      their household, on a form approved by the committee which      shall be sworn to as to its completeness and accuracy. The      committee form shall be in two parts--       (I) information relating to employment, education and      background of the nominee relating to the position to which      the individual is nominated, and which is to be made public;      and,       (II) information relating to financial and other background      of the nominee, to be made public when the committee      determines that such information bears directly on the      nominee's qualifications to hold the position to which the      individual is nominated.       Information relating to background and financial interests      (parts I and II) shall not be required of nominees for less      than full-time appointments to councils, commissions or      boards when the committee determines that some or all of the      information is not relevant to the nature of the position.      Information relating to other background and financial      interests (part II) shall not be required of any nominee when      the committee determines that it is not relevant to the      nature of the position.       Committee action on a nomination, including hearings or      meetings to consider a motion to recommend confirmation,      shall not be initiated until at least five days after the      nominee submits the form required by this rule unless the      chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking minority      member, waives this waiting period.       Rule 19.--Subject to statutory requirements imposed on the      committee with respect to procedure, the rules of the      committee may be changed, modified, amended or suspended at      any time; provided, not less than a majority of the entire      membership so determine at a regular meeting with due notice,      or at a meeting specifically called for that purpose.       Rule 20.--When the ratio of members on the committee is      even, the term ``majority'' as used in the committee's rules      and guidelines shall refer to the party of the chairman for      purposes of party identification. Numerical requirements for      quorums, votes and the like shall be unaffected.       Rule 21.--First degree amendments must be filed with the      chairman at least 24 hours before an executive session. The      chairman shall promptly distribute all filed amendments      electronically to the members of the committee. The chairman      may modify the filing requirements to meet special      circumstances with the concurrence of the ranking minority      member.       Rule 22.--In addition to the foregoing, the proceedings of      the committee shall be governed by the Standing Rules of the      Senate and the provisions of the Legislative Reorganization      Act of 1946, as amended.                         *    *    *    *    *  Guidelines of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions With Respect to Hearings, Markup Sessions, and Related Matters                                HEARINGS       Section 133A(a) of the Legislative Reorganization Act      requires each committee of the Senate to publicly announce      the date, place, and subject matter of any hearing at least      one week prior to the commencement of such hearing.       The spirit of this requirement is to assure adequate notice      to the public and other Members of the Senate as to the time      and subject matter of proposed hearings. In the spirit of      section 133A(a) and in order to assure that members of the      committee are themselves fully informed and involved in the      development of hearings:       1. Public notice of the date, place, and subject matter of      each committee or subcommittee hearing should be inserted in      the Congressional Record seven days prior to the commencement      of such hearing.       2. At least seven days prior to public notice of each      committee or subcommittee hearing, the majority should      provide notice to the minority of the time, place and      specific subject matter of such hearing.       3. At least three days prior to the date of such hearing,      the committee or subcommittee should provide to each member a      list of witnesses who have been or are proposed to be invited      to appear.       4. The committee and its subcommittee should, to the      maximum feasible extent, enforce the provisions of rule 9 of      the committee rules as it relates to the submission of      written statements of witnesses twenty-four hours in advance      of a hearing. Witnesses will be urged to submit testimony      even earlier whenever possible. When statements are received      in advance of a hearing, the committee or subcommittee (as      appropriate) should distribute copies of such statements to      each of its members. Witness testimony may be submitted and      distributed electronically.         EXECUTIVE SESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKING UP BILLS       In order to expedite the process of marking up bills and to      assist each member of the committee so that there may be full      and fair consideration of each bill which the committee or a      subcommittee is marking up the following procedures should be      followed:       1. Seven days prior to the proposed date for an executive      session for the purpose of marking up bills the committee or      subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide written notice      to each of its members as to the time, place, and specific      subject matter of such session, including an agenda listing      each bill or other matters to be considered and including:       (a) a copy of each bill, joint resolution, or other      legislative matter (or committee print thereof) to be      considered at such executive session; and       (b) a copy of a summary of the provisions of each bill,      joint resolution, or other legislative matter to be      considered at such executive session including, whenever      possible, an explanation of changes to existing law proposed      to be made.       2. Insofar as practical, prior to the scheduled date for an      executive session for the purpose of marking up bills, the      committee or a subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide      each member with a copy of the printed record or a summary of      any hearings conducted by the committee or a subcommittee      with respect to each bill, joint resolution, or other      legislative matter to be considered at such executive      session.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgS578.txt,CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgS578.xml,"COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS",2017,1,February

We treated her just like we did President Obama's Education She offered to meet with the Democrats in They refused. She finally met with them in their offices.  Then she testified for 90 minutes longer than either of President Obama's Education Secretaries before our committees.  Then there were followup questions. We asked President Obama's Education Secretaries 53 and 56 questions; they asked her 1,400 questions. Then they met, and one of their Members announced that they all agreed to vote against her before she had a chance to answer the questions. What does that say about those questions?  She has conflicts of interest? We have a procedure for that, an independent conflicts of interest office, the Office of Government The head was appointed by President Obama, confirmed by the He has an agreement with every Cabinet member about conflicts of interest. He wrote a letter to us 8 days before we voted on her and said she would have no conflict of interest if she followed this agreement.  So plenty of time for questions, no conflict of interest. What is the problem?  One, her support for public charter schools. Some people don't like that. But 2.7 million children attend them. They were founded by the Democratic Farmer-Labor Party in They have now grown to 6,800 schools. They are the most effective public school reform in 30 years.  School choice. What is wrong with giving low-income Americans more choice and better schools? We have done it since the GI bill from 1944--taxpayer money following veteran students to Notre Dame, Yeshiva, Harvard, the National Auto Diesel Has it hurt the public universities, of which I used to be President of one? It has helped them. Then, more people went to private schools, and now more people go to public colleges.  Betsy DeVos has committed to no more Washington mandates. No more national school board, no Washington mandates for vouchers, no Washington mandates for common core, no Washington mandates for specific kinds of teacher evaluations with Betsy DeVos in charge of the Department of  One year ago, we had no Education I asked President Obama to appoint one, even though I knew he would appoint John King, with whom I disagreed. I promised that if he did, we would promptly confirm him, and we did. We asked him 53 questions, not 1,397. We didn't say he had conflicts of interest when the Office of Government Ethics said he did not.  I know my friends are surprised about the election, but wouldn't they be really surprised if he appointed someone from within the education establishment to be the Secretary of Education? Wouldn't you be surprised that a Republican President would be for charter schools? Are you really surprised that a Republican President has appointed an Education Secretary who wants to give low-income children more choices of schools? Are you surprised that a Republican President has nominated an Education Secretary who wants to reverse the trend to a national school board and restore local control?

As a longtime resident of the area, Dessey graduated from Georgia Southern University and served in the United States Army from 1959 to 1965.  I was fortunate enough to work for him and with him during my 35-year career in construction and the development industry. I had the opportunity to serve alongside him in the Augusta Exchange Club and sit in front of him on Sundays at Trinity on the Hill United Methodist  Dessey was a husband, a father, a grandfather, a friend, and a mentor to many in our community. He and his wife, Barbara, lost two of their children at a young age, and Dessey was the rock that held that family together.  Mr.Speaker, I have recently lost two of my heroes: Arnold Palmer in September and Dessey Kuhlke last week. But through the loss, I can't help but smile when I think about the possibility of those two getting together with family in Heaven and playing a round of golf.

WOTUS is a rule issued under the Clean Water Act by the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers designed to redefine the scope of waters protected and regulated by the Federal  WOTUS would grant the Federal Government regulatory power over virtually any place where water flows in the United States; that includes ditches, puddles, streams, or any manmade constructions, you name it. If enacted, it would undermine the rights of States, local governments and landowners, and create more red tape, preventing economic growth and jobs, particularly in the agriculture industry. If it sounds ridiculous, that is because it is.  WOTUS was flawed from the beginning. It has been held up in the courts since 2015.  To ensure WOTUS never sees the light of day and completely eliminate the potential of it becoming a reality, I introduced legislation to repeal this harmful rule.
