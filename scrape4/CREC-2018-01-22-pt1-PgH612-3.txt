                  FIND COMMON GROUND AND END GRIDLOCK

  (Mr. O'HALLERAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, on the third day of this reckless 
government shutdown, I rise to urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to find common ground and end this gridlock.
  Families in Arizona and America are hurting. It is past time for 
Congress to come together to boost our military. We must reauthorize 
funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, community health 
centers, and the Special Diabetes Program for Tribal communities, and 
many others.
  Mr. Speaker, we can't go back to business as usual and continue to 
fund our military a few weeks at a time. Secretary Mattis and our 
military leaders have been clear about the dire impacts of continuing 
resolutions on our national security time and time again throughout 
this year.
  We are facing increasing global threats. We cannot undermine our 
defense leaders and our troops by refusing to work together. We are 
here to solve problems. For our brave servicemembers and families 
across our communities, let's get the job done.
