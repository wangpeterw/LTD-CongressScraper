                              NORTH KOREA

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, concerning North Korea, instead of 
undermining his Secretary of State and picking Twitter fights with Kim 
Jong Un that risk a war, President Trump should formulate a serious 
strategy to put the heat on China to pressure the North Koreans and 
resolve this crisis. China holds the cards here, but they have done 
nothing to help us or very little at least.
