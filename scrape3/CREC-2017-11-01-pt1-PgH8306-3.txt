                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Michael W. Waters, Joy Tabernacle AME Church, Dallas, 
Texas, offered the following prayer:
  Immutable God, greater than all that has or ever will be conceived, 
hear our prayer:
  For ancestors at rest in the abode of angels, accosted and assaulted 
while present upon these shores, enduring avalanches of animus never 
atoned; for babies bombarded by bombs, bounties placed upon their 
beautiful heads at birth; for the cacophony of cries citing crimes 
against humanity, callous cycles of crisis, casualties colored in 
chalk.
  In Your name, we shall resist evil by loving our neighbors as 
ourselves.
  Grant that we become drum majors of justice, promulgators of peace, 
architects of an America freed from greed, hate, oppression, racism, 
suppression, indeed, the very threat of tyranny, replete with liberty 
and justice for all, till that great day when lions shall lie down with 
lambs and we study war no more, when justice flows like waters, and 
righteousness, like a mighty stream, and all God's children are finally 
free.
  Amen.
