                CONGRATULATING THE ROSELLE PARK PANTHERS

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Roselle Park High 
School wrestling team for reaching the milestone of 1,000 varsity wins 
after beating Scotch Plains last week. The Roselle Park Panthers became 
only the fourth program in the country and just the second in New 
Jersey to reach this milestone.
  The entire community played a part in propelling the Panthers to this 
milestone. The Panthers have always had strong support from local 
businesses, community groups, and, of course, their loyal fans and 
neighbors.
  Mr. Speaker, Head Coach Ryan Rooney and his team have worked hard to 
get to this point, but they aren't letting the record distract them 
from their ultimate goal: winning another State championship.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Coach 
Rooney and the Roselle Park Panthers for their 1,000th win and wish 
them continued success on their way to another State championship.
  Go Panthers.
