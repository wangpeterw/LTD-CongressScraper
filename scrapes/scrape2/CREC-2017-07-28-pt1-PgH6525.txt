                            PRAISING PRO-ACT

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the work of the 
Council of Southeast Pennsylvania. The council provides resources and 
opportunities to reduce the impact of addiction, trauma, and other 
health-related issues for the five counties in southeastern 
Pennsylvania through intervention, education, and mobilization.
  Established in 1997 by the council, PRO-ACT works to provided 
advocacy and residence for those suffering from the terrible disease of 
addiction. Through workshops and peer advocacy meetings for afflicted 
individuals and families, addiction victims can get back on their feet 
and learn necessary skills for both recovery and entering the 
workforce.
  I am proud to work with my constituent, Executive Director Beverly 
Haberle, and her administrative team, Cindy Mikalauskas and Stacey 
Conaway.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to share the words of a man named Jim, who stated 
that, through PRO-ACT, ``A fire was lit inside of me, my spirit 
rekindled by hope.''
  Recovery from addiction is difficult, and it is up to remarkable 
associations like the council to serve the southeastern Pennsylvania 
community and make sure that these people can successfully beat this 
devastating disease.
