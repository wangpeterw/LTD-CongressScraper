                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Paul D. Holland, S.J., Jesuit Conference, Washington, D.C., 
offered the following prayer:
  Gracious God, we acknowledge You as Lord of all nations, creator of 
land, and sea and sky, source of the wonders of nature and of all 
goodness.
  You have entrusted creation to our faithful stewardship, yet You 
alone sustain all Your creation through the life-giving breath of Your 
spirit.
  In Your wisdom, You arranged the changing of times and seasons so 
that we might marvel at Your love, reflected in the vastness of the 
universe and the bounty of this Earth.
  As we near the end of this year, we pray Your blessings upon the 
Members of this Congress throughout the coming new year, and ask You to 
keep them always in Your ways of truth and faithful service.
  We pray this in Your Holy Name.
  Amen.
