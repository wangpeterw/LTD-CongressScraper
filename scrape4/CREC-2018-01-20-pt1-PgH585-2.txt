                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We come to You today, humbly, to ask Your blessing upon the Members 
of this people's House. Help them to do the work that needs to be done.
  Bless all those who worry that their needs may not be addressed in a 
timely fashion. May those who possess power here in Washington be 
mindful of those whom they represent who possess little or no power and 
whose lives are made all the more difficult by a failure to work out 
serious differences.
  May all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
