HONORING 50TH COMPANY, INFANTRY OFFICER CANDIDATE SCHOOL CLASS OC 24-69

  (Mr. BEYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a special group 
worthy of our recognition for the sacrifices they have made for our 
country.
  This month, the surviving members of the 50th Company, Infantry 
Officer Candidate School's Class OC 24-69 will have their first reunion 
at Fort Benning, 48 years after pinning on the gold bars of second 
lieutenants.
  The men in the 50th Company came from 42 different States, 
representing all walks of life and backgrounds. They accepted the risks 
and volunteered to become Army officers at the height of the Vietnam 
war.
  After graduation, over half received orders to Vietnam. Two 
classmates made the ultimate sacrifice: James Du Pont and Thomas 
Edgren. Many others earned the Purple Heart.
  At the reunion in Fort Benning, these men will renew the bonds forged 
48 years ago. Please join me in pausing to reflect on their sacrifices 
and extending them our thanks.
