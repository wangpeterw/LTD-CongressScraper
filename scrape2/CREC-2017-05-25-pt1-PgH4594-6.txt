                      SEXUAL ASSAULT IN CALIFORNIA

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Nolan Bruder's younger sister believed 
that she could trust her big brother. So when this 19-year-old brother 
offered her marijuana ``dabs'' and the opportunity to get high, she 
accepted, trusting him. But with Nolan's pushing, she became so stoned 
that she no longer recognized the man in front of her, that it was her 
older brother.
  Taking advantage of her drugged state, he sexually assaulted his own 
16-year-old sister. This is repugnant, Mr. Speaker.
  On May 17, Nolan was sentenced for rape of an intoxicated person. The 
sentence? A mere 240 days in prison and

then probation. Why? Because the judge decided that prison would 
severely impact Bruder.
  Well, Mr. Speaker, isn't that the point?
  Even evidence showed the defendant had no remorse and was smug at the 
trial.
  I was a prosecutor and a judge in Texas for over 30 years. I met a 
lot of rape victims and learned that their lives were forever 
devastated by rapists.
  Mr. Speaker, sexual assault is never the fault of the victim, 
contrary to what Judge Follett thinks. Judge Follett got it wrong, Mr. 
Speaker. He got it wrong in this case. It is time for him to pack his 
toothbrush and leave the bench.
  And that is just the way it is.
