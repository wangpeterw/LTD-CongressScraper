              IN MEMORIAM OF SPECIALIST ETIENNE J. MURPHY

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life 
of Army Specialist Etienne J. Murphy, who died on May 26 when his 
vehicle overturned in Syria as part of Operation Inherent Resolve.
  Specialist Murphy was raised in Loganville, Georgia, where, from an 
early age, he showed a keen interest in the American Armed Forces and 
for serving his country. He enlisted in the Army at 18 years old, and 2 
years later he joined the 1st Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment, 
stationed at Hunter Army Airfield.
  Murphy was just 5 days into his first deployment in Syria when his 
vehicle was involved in a nontactical rollover-related accident which 
is still under investigation.
  Murphy's wife and two young sons continue to reside in Savannah, 
Georgia, where he was stationed.
  Only a short time after Memorial Day, Specialist Murphy's passing 
reminds us all that freedom comes at a high price, and servicemen and -
women face danger daily when fighting to preserve American values 
against terrorism.
  I want to share my deepest condolences to his family and thank 
Specialist Murphy for his service, bravery, and sacrifice.
