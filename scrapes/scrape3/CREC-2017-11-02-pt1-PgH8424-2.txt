                      SUPPORT REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Mr. McHENRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, here in Washington, we are in the midst of 
a major debate on tax reform, tax simplification, and tax cuts.
  The plan unveiled by House Republicans today is a tax cut plan for 
middle-income, middle class families in America. If you are a family of 
four making $59,000, which is the median family income in America, you 
will receive a $1,200 tax cut as a result of the plan that we unveiled 
today.
  That is real money for middle class families in North Carolina. Maybe 
it is not real money in Washington, D.C., but it is real money in 
western North Carolina.
  We need tax cuts. We need tax simplification. We need economic 
growth, more American jobs, and a more competitive environment in 
America so that we can keep jobs here in the United States and not 
offshore those jobs. We need middle class families to win. Our plan 
does that.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support our efforts.
