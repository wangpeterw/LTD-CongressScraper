                        REMEMBERING KATE FRONEK

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Kate Fronek, an 
extraordinary 13-year-old from Eden Prairie who just passed away this 
last week.
  Kate was an active girl who played hockey, lacrosse, and soccer 
throughout our Eden Prairie community. She attended Central Middle 
School, and people often noted her love for music.
  This past February, Kate was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. 
In the following months, she underwent multiple rounds of chemotherapy 
and a bone marrow transplant. Amid these challenges, Kate was brave and 
spirited, and friends and family remember her positively and, above 
all, her warm smile.
  But over the weekend, in memory of Kate, neighbors and friends began 
putting orange balloons outside their homes, on the streets, and the 
bridges as a part of a tribute. Driving around Eden Prairie and seeing 
the streets lined with these balloons to honor her memory shows that 
she clearly touched very many lives.
  Mr. Speaker, I wanted to extend my thoughts and prayers to the Fronek 
family. She will be missed, but her spirit will not be forgotten.
