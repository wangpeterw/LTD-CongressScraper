     FRED D. THOMPSON FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE

  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of H.R. 375, which was received from the House.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.
  The bill clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 375) to designate the Federal building and 
     United States courthouse located at 719 Church Street in 
     Nashville, Tennessee, as the ``Fred D. Thompson Federal 
     Building and United States Courthouse.''

  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.
  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill 
be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The bill (H.R. 375) was ordered to a third reading, was read the 
third time, and passed.
  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am grateful that the Senate has 
approved that measure naming the Fred D. Thompson Federal Building and 
United States Courthouse in Nashville.
  I stand at the desk of former Senator Thompson. This was a desk that 
Senator Howard Baker also had. I have the desk myself because Senator 
Thompson and I were inspired by Senator Baker to be involved in 
politics and government in our State and the House of Representatives--
our delegation.
  I think Senator Carper and his committee all seem to think that it is 
very appropriate that the new Nashville courthouse be named for Senator 
Thompson. It gives me a great deal of pride and personal privilege to 
be able to ask for that to be done. I thank Congresswoman Blackburn in 
the House for her leadership and all the Members of the delegation and 
the Members of the Senate for their cooperation in this.
  I thank the Presiding Officer.
  I yield the floor.
