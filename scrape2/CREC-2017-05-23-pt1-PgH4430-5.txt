                RECOGNIZING MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, May marks Military 
Appreciation Month, a special time to recognize the tremendous support 
and encouragement families offer their servicemembers. As the son of a 
Flying Tiger who served in India and China, and as the grateful father 
of four sons who have all served overseas, and as a 31-year veteran of 
the Army Reserve and Guard, I know firsthand the commitment of our 
troops, veterans, and military families.
  Last week, I was honored to join Senator Roy Blunt, Senator Kirsten 
Gillibrand, and Congresswoman Susan Davis to introduce commonsense, 
bipartisan legislation, the Military Families Stability Act, which 
provides for greater flexibility by allowing military families a 6-
month option of moving to the start of their next assignment.
  The happiness and success of our military families is critical to 
overall troop readiness and retention. I am confident this legislation 
will greatly benefit families around the country.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. We offer our 
sympathy and solidarity for the victims of Manchester and our beloved 
allies in the United Kingdom. Together with members of the European 
Union Parliament, we will defeat the murderous losers.
