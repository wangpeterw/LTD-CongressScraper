                        PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISES

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, throughout the Presidential campaign, 
Donald Trump promised to create good-paying manufacturing jobs, but 
nearly 100 days into his administration, we are learning that this is 
just another broken promise.
  Since taking office, President Trump has failed to use American steel 
for the Keystone pipeline, proposed $2.5 billion in cuts in the Labor 
Department, which will reduce funding for critical job training in 
advanced manufacturing, and proposed complete elimination of the 
Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a Federal initiative that provides 
critical matching grants to support regional manufacturing economies.
  If President Trump were serious about putting working people first, 
he would work with Democrats to pass bills we have already introduced 
to strengthen manufacturing, bills like Make It In America 
Manufacturing Communities Act that I have introduced to revitalize 
manufacturing economies and legislation to modernize and strengthen Buy 
America provisions.
  If Donald Trump wants to keep the promises he made to working people, 
then he needs to start working with Democrats to deliver results. We 
are ready to go. We have introduced bills to strengthen American 
manufacturing. All we need now is a real partner in the White House, a 
President who is more concerned with results than TV ratings.
