         CELEBRATING 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF McHENRY COUNTY COLLEGE

  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate McHenry 
County College on their 50 years of service to our community and State.
  Since April 1967, MCC administration, faculty, staff, and trustees 
have demonstrated unparalleled commitment to their students through 
quality degree and certificate programs.
  Through the college, the community is provided a diverse and relevant 
array of enrichment and lifelong learning opportunities; everything 
from advanced manufacturing, engineering, and healthcare to fine arts, 
the humanities, continuing education and training, and everything in 
between.
  I commend the college, led by President Dr. Clint Gabbard, for its 
continued focus on student success, innovation, and contribution toward 
the community's economic development.
  True to its goal of student success, the college has been ranked 
among the top 150 community colleges in the Nation and scores in fourth 
place in the State for student success rates and affordability.
  From visiting and hosting numerous congressional events at MCC, I am 
always impressed by the extraordinary efforts and commitment of McHenry 
County College faculty and staff.
  Congratulations, McHenry County College, on your 50th anniversary.
