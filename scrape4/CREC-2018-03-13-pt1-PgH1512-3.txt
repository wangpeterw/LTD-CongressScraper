                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear Lord, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  At the beginning of the week, we use this moment to be reminded of 
Your presence and to tap the resources needed by the Members of this 
House to do their work as well as it can be done.
  May they be led by Your Spirit in the decisions they make. May their 
faith in You deliver them from any tensions that might tear the 
people's House apart and from worries that might wear them out.
  All this day, and through the week, may they do their best to find 
solutions to pressing issues facing our Nation. Please hasten the day 
when justice and love shall dwell in the hearts of all peoples and rule 
the affairs of the nations of Earth.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
