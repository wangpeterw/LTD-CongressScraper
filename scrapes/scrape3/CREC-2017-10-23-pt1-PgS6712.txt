                            VOTE EXPLANATION

 Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, unfortunately, I was unable to 
attend the rollcall vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion 
to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2266, 
emergency supplemental appropriations. Had I been able to attend, I 
would have voted in favor of cloture.
  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered 
to be printed in the Record.)
