              RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FAMILY CAREGIVERS MONTH

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of National Family 
Caregivers Month. Caregivers are our Nation's hidden heroes. They 
foster family stability and help those with chronic and disabling 
conditions avoid costly out-of-home placements. In fact, family 
caregivers are very often the difference between costly institutional 
care or staying in their home.
  Family caregivers not only deserve our respect and gratitude, but 
also respite from the physical and emotional toll of ensuring their 
loved ones receive the care that they need. But if the caregivers 
themselves aren't taking care of their own needs, they are not going to 
be very effective at taking care of their loved ones.
  Mr. Speaker, almost 44 million Americans are providing over $470 
billion in uncompensated care each year, if we had to put a dollar 
figure on it. These caregivers are our grandparents, parents, spouses, 
siblings, children, and

even our grandchildren. They are often the lifeline to accessible, 
quality care at home.
  We in Congress need to do our part to support these heroes by passing 
the Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act, which my good friend 
Representative Gregg Harper and I have introduced. It is the least that 
we can do in appreciation of the sacrifice these family caregivers make 
each and every day.
