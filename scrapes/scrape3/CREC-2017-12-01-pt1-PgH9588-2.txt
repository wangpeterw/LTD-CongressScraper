                                TAX SCAM

  (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, the Republican tax scam picks clear winners 
and losers, yet our colleagues are rushing it through Congress faster 
than President Trump can retweet British racists.
  Let's be clear: the winners in this tax scam are the country's 
wealthiest, including Donald Trump, his family, and his billionaire 
cronies in his Cabinet. Meanwhile, students, middle class families, 
homeowners, and seniors across this country are the losers. They are 
left holding the bag.
  Californians get an especially raw deal because my Republican 
colleagues want to impose an unfair double tax on the State and local 
taxes that we pay.
  There is more bad news for Californians. Homeowners will be hit by a 
new cap on mortgage interest deductions, students will have to start 
paying taxes on student loan interest, graduate students will lose tax-
free tuition waivers, and biotech companies who focus on ultra rare 
diseases will see their tax credit disappear.
  The Republican tax bill is unbelievably bad and historically 
unpopular, for good reason, but it is not too late for my Republican 
colleagues to stop it.
