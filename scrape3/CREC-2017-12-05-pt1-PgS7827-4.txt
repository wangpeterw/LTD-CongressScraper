                            TAX REFORM BILL

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one final matter. Last night, our 
colleagues in the House voted to send the tax reform legislation to a 
conference committee. There, Members from both Chambers will work to 
resolve the differences in our bills and eventually enable us to send a 
final product to the President for his signature.
  The House's action last night is more progress in our years-long 
effort to deliver real relief to the men and women we represent. I am 
grateful to our friends in the House for their willingness to continue 
working with us to help shift our economy into high gear. I look 
forward to the Senate voting to join the conference later this week.
  In the end, both Chambers will have an opportunity to pass the final 
legislation to help families keep more of their hard-earned money, to 
create good jobs, and to jump-start economic growth. I look forward to 
working with all of our colleagues to get this done.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.
