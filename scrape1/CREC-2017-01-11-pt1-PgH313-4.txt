                         YOUR VOICE DOES MATTER

  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, there is lots of incredible news out 
there. The Trump press conference just makes your headspin, but we have 
seen that the public's voice does matter.
  Because of public outcry, within minutes after the late-night closed 
meetings, the Republican plan to gut the independentOffice of 
Congressional Ethics was reversed. In response to outrage about 
jeopardizing health care for millions of Americans,some Republicans now 
admit that repealing the Affordable Care Act is not quite so simple and 
maybe they should come up with areplacement, even if they don't yet 
know how to do it. Senate Republicans even delayed some of the Cabinet 
confirmation hearingsto allow a more orderly review and scrutiny.
  Your voice does matter.
  The President said last night that change only happens when ordinary 
people get involved, get engaged, and come together todemand it. 
Obviously, these fights are just beginning, but the last 10 days shows 
that together we can and will protect thevalues and programs so vital 
to America.
