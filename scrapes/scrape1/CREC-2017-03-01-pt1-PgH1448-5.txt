                        ATTACK ON WOMEN'S HEALTH

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, today begins Women's History Month, 
and I am proud to use this occasion to lift up our achievements, our 
perseverance and dedication to a more equal and balanced world. That is 
why it is so unfortunate that my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle and President Trump's White House insist on harming women through 
their stubborn adherence to antiwomen policies.
  One prime example is their assault on the Affordable Care Act. The 
facts are clear: ACA prohibits charging women more than men for 
insurance; ACA establishes preventive services to be provided at no 
extra cost to women, including annual well-women exams, breastfeeding 
support, supplies for new moms, birth control, and screening and 
counseling for domestic and intimate partner violence; 9.5 million 
previously uninsured women now have coverage through ACA; 55 million 
now have access to vital preventive care at no cost.
  These are not alternative facts or fake news. If this is the Trump 
Republicans' gift to us in celebration of Women's History Month, I hope 
they keep the receipt.
