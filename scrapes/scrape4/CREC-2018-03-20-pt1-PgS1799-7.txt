                       TRIBUTE TO OKSANA MASTERS

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, during Sunday's closing ceremonies at 
the Pyeongchang Paralympics, the American flag was held high by a 
special member of Team USA. Oksana Masters of Louisville, KY, was 
elected by her teammates to represent our Nation at the ceremonies, 
capping off her remarkable trip.
  Born in Chernobyl with radiation poisoning, Oksana was adopted at the 
age of 7 and came to the United States. She underwent a number of 
medical procedures at a young age, including the amputation of both of 
her legs, but that didn't stop her. Regardless of the obstacle, she 
pushed through.
  This year marks her fourth Paralympics. She entered Pyeongchang with 
a silver and two bronze medals, but this time, this talented multisport 
athlete set her sights on the gold, and I am happy to report that 
Oksana, once again, achieved her goal. She ascended to the top of the 
podium, not once but twice.
  Kentucky is very proud of Oksana and all that she has accomplished. 
She is a fine representative of our Commonwealth and our Nation.
