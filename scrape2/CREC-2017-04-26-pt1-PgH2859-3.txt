     THE IMPACT OF STOPGAP SPENDING BILLS ON STATES AND LOCALITIES

  (Mrs. TORRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, it looks like Congress has avoided another 
government shutdown for now. We will probably pass another short-term 
spending bill or two before this latest stopgap bill runs out, 
threatening to bring us to the brink once again.
  This is no way to govern. As a former mayor and State legislator, I 
know that our States and cities need to be able to plan ahead. They 
can't do that if Federal funding is up in the air and subject to the 
latest political tug of war.
  If we expect 50 States to pass a budget every year, there is no 
reason Congress can't do the same. It is time for Congress and the 
White House to stop playing games and to do the job that we were sent 
to Washington to do.
