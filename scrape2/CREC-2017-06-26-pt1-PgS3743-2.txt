                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, sovereign of nations, answer our lawmakers even before 
they call, and hear them even before they speak. Give them the wisdom 
today to commune with You. May this fellowship bring them Your gifts of 
knowledge, judgment, and wisdom for these turbulent times.
  Lord, help them to yield their minds, hearts, and wills to the flow 
of Your Divine intelligence, using Your might to solve problems in our 
Nation and world. Give them the power to handle the pressures of 
legislative labor as they find fuel from a fresh flow of Your strength. 
May they think clearly, serve creatively, and endure consistently.
  We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
