                REMEMBERING ZELL MILLER AND DANIEL AKAKA

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to begin with a few words 
of tribute to two retired colleagues who passed away since we were last 
together.
  On Friday, March 23, former Senator Zell Miller departed this life at 
the age

of 86. Those of us who served with Zell knew him as a kind and 
honorable man and a committed public servant.
  He rose from a childhood without electricity and running water well 
into his school years to serve the State of Georgia as Governor and 
later as Senator. Zell Miller did so with grit and determination, never 
afraid to buck partisanship in favor of his principles.
  Also, this past Thursday, Senator Daniel Akaka, our former colleague 
from Hawaii, passed away at the age of 93. He worked closely with 
Senator Inouye and others to advocate for his State. As the Senator 
himself once put it, he always preferred being a workhorse to a show 
horse.
  The Senate offers our condolences to their families.
