                        COMBATING ANTI-SEMITISM

  (Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
H.R. 1730, the Combating Anti-Semitism Act of 2017. I am proud to 
introduce this important legislation with my colleague from the other 
side of the aisle, Representative Derek Kilmer from Washington.
  Since this January, we have seen a wave of disturbing violence and 
threats towards religious institutions across America. In 2017 alone, 
more than 100 bomb threats have been made at 81 Jewish Community 
Centers across our Nation in 33 States. Tennessee, the State I call 
home, is also on that list. It is time that we send a clear message: 
religious intolerance has no place in this country.
  The Combating Anti-Semitism Act of 2017 would increase the penalty 
for these violent threats and make them punishable as hate crimes under 
Federal law. We have a moral duty and responsibility to protect the 
rights of all Americans to worship freely and without fear, whether at 
a church, a synagogue, or any religious institution.
  With this bill, we will deter threats and stand united against 
religious intolerance.
