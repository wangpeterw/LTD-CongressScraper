                    THE FCC AND NET NEUTRALITY RULES

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the new Trump-appointed FCC 
Chairman announced his mission to undermine the net neutrality rules 
that we fought so hard to put in place.
  In 2015, over 4 million people submitted comments calling on the FCC 
to keep the internet open and fair. However, the FCC's new Chairman, 
who used to work as counsel for Verizon, wants to turn the internet 
into a system of pay-to-play fast lanes for Big Money and people who 
can afford it, leaving everyone else behind in the slow lane.
  This hands the levers of access over to big ISPs at the expense of 
students,

small businesses, entrepreneurs, independent content creators, and 
millions more.
  In today's digital age, maintaining open and equal internet access is 
essential to breaking down barriers in education, media, expanding 
access to jobs and employment, driving innovation in health care, and 
so much more.
  We must stand strong in opposition to the FCC's attack on fairness, 
equality, and net neutrality.
