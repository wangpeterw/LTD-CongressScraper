                   NEW AMERICANS CAUCUS' CALL TO VOTE

  (Mrs. TORRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not only as a Member of 
Congress but as an immigrant and a proud American, and I and my fellow 
members of the New Americans Caucus took the step to not just become 
naturalized citizens and exercise our right to vote but also to get 
involved in our communities and eventually run for office.
  This is why, today, I want to encourage all of those who can to do 
the same, become a citizen and get involved. Your vote is your voice. 
It allows you to use that voice to better your community and to speak 
up for those who still can't.
  Citizenship is a security. Citizenship is power. These days, too much 
is at stake, so don't wait until it is too late.
