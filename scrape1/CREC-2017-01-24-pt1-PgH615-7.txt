             RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

House of Representatives:

                                     House of Representatives,

                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.
     Re Resignation from the United States Congress.

     House Speaker Paul Ryan,
     U.S. Capitol,
     Washington DC.
       Dear Speaker Ryan: I write to inform you officially that, 
     effective January 24, 2017,

[[Page H616]]

     ahead of being sworn in as California's Attorney General, I 
     will resign from my office as the Representative of the 34th 
     Congressional District of California in the U.S. House of 
     Representatives.
       It has been a distinct honor to serve the people of Los 
     Angeles and my country in Congress for more than 24 years. I 
     am eternally grateful to my constituents for their tremendous 
     counsel and support over those two decades.
       I leave my work in Congress with mixed emotions. The 
     People's House has been home to some of America's greatest 
     patriots and talent. I have learned from them and been 
     fortunate to have had a chance to add my grains of sand--as 
     we say in Spanish--to build a better America.
       In service to my country I will always look for the best 
     way to make the biggest difference for our people. Working as 
     Attorney General on behalf of the more than 39 million 
     Americans in California--the sixth most vibrant economy in 
     the world--will give me that chance to fight for all 
     Americans to share in the forward-leaning values and 
     opportunities that have made California so great.
       I hereby submit my resignation from the House of 
     Representatives. I look forward to working with all of my 
     colleagues in Congress in the future for the betterment of 
     our great nation.
           Sincerely,
                                                   Xavier Becerra,
     Member of Congress.
                                  ____



                                     House of Representatives,

                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.
     Re Resignation from the United States Congress.

     Governor Jerry Brown,
     State Capitol,
     Sacramento, CA.
       Dear Governor Brown: I write to inform you officially that, 
     effective January 24, 2017, ahead of being sworn in as 
     California's Attorney General, I will resign from my office 
     as the Representative of the 34th Congressional District of 
     California in the U.S. House of Representatives.
       It has been a distinct honor to serve the people of Los 
     Angeles and my country in Congress for more than 24 years. I 
     am eternally grateful to my constituents for their tremendous 
     counsel and support over those two decades.
       I will do my utmost to uphold your faith in me to serve as 
     our great state's next chief law enforcement officer and 
     legal advocate. And while I leave Congress with mixed 
     emotions, I am ready to begin my work as Attorney General. 
     California's hard-working families are counting on us, and we 
     won't let them down.
           Sincerely,
                                                   Xavier Becerra.
