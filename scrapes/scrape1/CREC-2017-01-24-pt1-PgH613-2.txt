                CONGRATULATING THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the 
New England Patriots on reaching their NFL record ninth Super Bowl. The 
very questionable suspension of Tom Brady early in the season could not 
stop New England or the determination and dedication to excellence that 
defines the New England Patriots.
  Fans throughout New Hampshire and beyond are incredibly proud of 
their team and the unparalleled success of Tom Brady and Bill 
Belichick. But they would be the first to tell you that the success of 
the Patriots lies with not one individual but instead is built upon the 
core value of team before self. This year, the motto made famous by New 
England, ``Do Your Job,'' is as true as ever.
  When the Patriots face the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI, I will 
be joined by everyone across New Hampshire and throughout New England 
in offering them good luck. Go Pats.
