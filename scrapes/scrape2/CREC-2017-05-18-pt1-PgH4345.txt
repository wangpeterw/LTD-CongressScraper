                           TRUMP-RUSSIA TIES

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, on May 9, President Trump abruptly fired FBI 
Director Comey, who was leading the investigation into ties between his 
administration and Russia.
  On May 10, the President met with the Russian Ambassador in the Oval 
Office, and the White House changed their reasoning for firing Comey.
  On May 11, in an interview with Lester Holt, President Trump admitted 
that the Russia investigation was a factor in firing Comey.
  On May 12, he appeared to threaten Comey, saying he had ``better hope 
that there are no `tapes' '' of their conversations.
  On May 15, we learned Trump shared code word classified intelligence 
with the Russian Ambassador.
  On May 16, Comey's memo of his conversation with President Trump 
quoted him saying: ``I hope you can see your way clear to letting this 
go.''
  Every day brings a new scandal.
  The appointment of Director Mueller as special prosecutor is a good 
first step, but it shouldn't be our last. We need an independent 
commission, free of meddling from the Trump administration. Our 
democracy depends on it.
