                        THE RIGHT TO HEALTHCARE

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, even as our 
colleagues in the Senate try, once again, today to strip lifesaving 
healthcare away from millions of Americans, I find that there is reason 
to hope and to have faith not in this Congress, where the work of cruel 
indifference to suffering precedes once again, but, rather, in the 
American people, because it has been the efforts of ordinary citizens 
whose calls and letters and protests have been making all the 
difference in this issue. It has been the collective voices of people 
telling their stories of struggle and survival who have slowed the 
system roller of repeal.
  I salute each and every one of them. Your voices count. Your stories 
are important. Keep them coming because you, your health, and your 
healthcare matter.
