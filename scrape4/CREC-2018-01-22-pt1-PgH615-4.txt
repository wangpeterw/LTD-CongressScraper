                                DREAMERS

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, a precocious 10-year-old named 
Stella reminded me yesterday that we teach our children in kindergarten 
that it doesn't matter who starts a problem, what counts is that we end 
it.
  She asked me how it is that once we become adults we somehow forget 
that basic lesson.
  Looking at Washington right now, I didn't have a good answer for her 
or for my many constituents who are frustrated by this shutdown.
  Just because the President and some in the Congress aren't doing 
their jobs doesn't mean our Federal workers should not be able to do 
theirs.
  So what do we need? We need real commitment and compromise, not more 
partisan rhetoric like we have heard today. We have to get this done, 
get it done right, and get it done soon. Our national security, our 
Federal workforce, those who serve our country in uniform, our 
DREAMers, and all of our constituents are depending on us.
