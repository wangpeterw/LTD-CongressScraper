                        AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT

  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the so-called American Health Care Act is 
up today.
  If you are over age 50, insurance companies can charge you five times 
the normal rate. This couple, 64 years old, $30,000-a-year income, 
$1,700 for a policy now. After this great bill passes, this big 
beautiful bill, $15,000 a year for health care out of a $30,000 income.
  Now, how the heck does that work?
  In the next 3 years, 24 million Americans will lose coverage. Among 
them, 153,000 in my district on the Oregon health plan so-called 
extended Medicaid. But that wasn't bad enough to get this bill through 
the House. The rightwing demanded more, so they have done away with the 
preexisting condition exclusion.
  Now they say: Oh, no, it is still in there, but the insurance company 
can charge you whatever they want. You have cancer? Oh, that will be 
$100,000 a year for your policy. Oh, but don't worry, don't worry, they 
are going to have a risk pool.
  A few Members with weak knees went down to the White House to get a 
deal with the dealmaker, Trump, $8 billion. A lot of money for people 
with

preexisting conditions. Unfortunately, there are 130 million American 
adults with preexisting conditions, as described by the insurance 
industry. Over 5 years, that will be $1 per month per person. That is 
going to buy a hell of a lot of health care; right?
