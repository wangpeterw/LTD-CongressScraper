                  STAND AS PATRIOTS AGAINST TRUMPCARE

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this morning I came in contact with two 
mothers of two young boys who are homebound with catastrophic 
illnesses. My heart broke as I listened to them say: The only way that 
I survive to see their happy face and I can work is because they have 
insurance through extensive Medicaid.
  And so I come today to ask my friends on the other side of the aisle 
not to worry about threats about losing your office or your job. This 
is about patriotism and being an American. Vote against this horrible 
TrumpCare debacle that will create higher cost, less coverage, and an 
age tax that will hurt the old and devastate the young.
  This is a time for the flag to be waved and for patriots to stand and 
to be heard across America. Vote down TrumpCare not for self and 
selfishness, but really to be able to stand with those who cannot help 
themselves.
  I wanted to embrace those mothers as a mother, as a grandmother, 
because we are giving life to those beautiful children, now 9 and 10, 
living because they got health care under the Affordable Care Act. 
Stand as a patriot against TrumpCare.
