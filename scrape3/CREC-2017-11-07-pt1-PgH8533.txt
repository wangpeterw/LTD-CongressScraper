                GOP TAX PLAN WILL HURT WORKING FAMILIES

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise today against the GOP tax 
plan that benefits the top 1 percent by raising taxes on millions of 
working families. It eliminates important tax incentives for middle 
class families and those who strive to join the middle class.
  This bill would no longer allow Americans to deduct interest on 
student loans, making college even more expensive.
  By capping the mortgage deduction, it keeps the American Dream of 
owning your home in economically vibrant areas of my State out of 
reach.
  The bill ransacks Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, and if you 
have a sick child or a family member with disabilities or long-term 
medical needs, you will struggle just to make ends meet.
  While the tax cuts for billionaires and corporations are permanent, 
the help for working families would disappear over time.
  Raising taxes on middle class families isn't the kind of tax reform 
our country needs. This isn't the relief they were promised. This isn't 
the relief they deserve. Working moms and dads can't simply hope that 
corporate tax cuts turn into profits that trickle down to them.
  Mr. Speaker, we need to invest in economic growth, not in hurting 
working families across America.
