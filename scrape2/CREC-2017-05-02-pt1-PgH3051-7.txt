                          SMALL BUSINESS WEEK

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Small Business Week 
in recognition of the entrepreneurs and small-business owners that form 
the foundation of our American economy.
  More than half of all working Americans either own or are employed by 
small businesses.
  In Congress, our job is to promote an environment where small 
businesses grow and succeed and communities and working families can 
prosper. To do that, we need to educate our kids to close the skills 
gap too many businesses face in trying to find the talent they need to 
grow their companies.
  We need to reimagine and renew our crumbling infrastructure for the 
21st century economy. We can help small businesses invent things here, 
make things here, and ship them around the world.
  We need to reform our immigration system to reduce the complexity 
employers face when trying to legally hire talented, industrious 
people.
  I urge my colleagues to consider this week, Small Business Week, what 
we can do together to support American small businesses--the greatest 
job creation engines of our economy.
