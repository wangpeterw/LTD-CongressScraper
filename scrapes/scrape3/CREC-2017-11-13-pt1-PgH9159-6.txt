                                TAX BILL

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, many times, the American people wonder 
about the correlation between the work that we do here. As a member of 
the Budget Committee, I can tell them that the tax bill that is about 
to move through this House--the Republican Trump tax bill--will bring 
about $1.41 trillion in revenue decreases in discretionary spending, 
which means cuts in their Medicare and Medicaid.

  Why do they want to do this?
  They want to do this so that they can compound the injury to those 
who need a mortgage deduction, which will be eliminated for any home 
that you buy in the future.
  If you have medical expenses, that will be eliminated. You will not 
be able to deduct that, whether you are a young family with a 
catastrophic illness or a senior citizen.
  Then those of you who are trying to increase your opportunities for 
the future--help your children--you will not be able to deduct student 
loan interest, tuition, and other education expenses.
  Elections matter, but actions matter. This tax bill is a crippling, 
devastating bill, and it will create the complete opposite of what 
Republicans say they believe in--a huge deficit, with a huge debt, on 
the backs of the American people. Vote ``no'' on this tax bill.
