                  FUND CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, in our increasingly competitive 
world, the importance of education beyond our K-12 system has only 
grown. As we address this reality, it is vital that we recognize the 
importance of career and technical education, in addition to colleges 
and universities.
  That is why I am proud to be the lead Democrat on the bipartisan 
Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. 
This bill, which passed the Education and the Workforce Committee last 
week unanimously, will increase funding for career and technical 
education by 9 percent over the next 6 years to modernize these 
initiatives and to ensure students have the skills employers are 
looking for.
  Through investing in our citizens and our economy, this bill will 
help hardworking families across the country join and stay in the 
middle class. I am proud to work with my colleagues from both parties, 
including Congressman Thompson from Pennsylvania, to build a more 
promising future for millions of Americans, and I hope this bill will 
soon receive consideration on the House floor.
