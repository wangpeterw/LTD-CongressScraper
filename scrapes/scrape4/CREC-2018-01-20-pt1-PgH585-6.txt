                      THE HOUSE HAS DONE ITS WORK

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, all the news today is about the Schumer 
shutdown. The House has done its work. The economy is booming. We 
passed a massive tax cut before the end of the year, which is bringing 
raises and prosperity to all segments of our economy. What is the 
problem?
  The problem is the Democrats in the United States Senate. The 
Democrats in the Senate are holding government funding hostage. The 
people protecting this country will continue to work but won't get a 
paycheck; this includes firefighters, Border Patrol, and 
servicemembers.
  We have a short-term funding bill ready for the President to sign, 
but Democrats are standing in the way. Democrats are endangering our 
national security, our veterans, and our children. The insurance of 9 
million children is at risk because CHIP would not be reauthorized.
  Mr. Speaker, it appears as though the Democrats want to take away 
attention from the wonderful economy we have. We need to pass this bill 
and move on.
