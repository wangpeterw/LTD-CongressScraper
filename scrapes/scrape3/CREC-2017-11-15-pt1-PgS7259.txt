                            VOTE EXPLANATION

  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I was unavailable for rollcall vote 
No. 274, on the nomination of Mark T. Esper, of Virginia, to be 
Secretary of the Army. I believe Mr. Esper is well qualified to be the 
Secretary of the Army. Had I been present, I would have voted yea.
  I would also note that I was unavailable for this rollcall vote 
because I was serving as ranking member at a Senate Judiciary Committee 
hearing for judicial nominees--and specifically a panel of four 
district court nominees from Kentucky and Kansas that had been 
enthusiastically endorsed by Majority Leader McConnell and Senators 
Roberts and Moran earlier that morning. Senator Cruz--who was serving 
as the acting chair of the committee for this hearing at this time--and 
I had hoped that the vote would be held open long enough for us to 
participate.
  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered 
to be printed in the Record.)
