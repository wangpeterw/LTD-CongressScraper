             REMEMBERING OFFICER GREGORY JONATHAN CASILLAS

  (Mrs. TORRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I report to 
you an incident that occurred the evening of March 9.
  Officers of the Pomona Police Department were involved in a short 
pursuit that resulted in a 15-hour-long standoff. At the onset of that 
standoff, Officer Gregory Jonathan Casillas was killed in the line of 
duty.
  Officer Casillas was at the beginning of his career in law 
enforcement. He was a dedicated public servant. He was young, 
energetic, and honest. He never lost hope or sight of his dreams.
  Officer Casillas joined the Pomona Police Department in December of 
2014, working his way up as a records specialist, jailer, recruit, to 
his graduation in 2017 from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Academy 
Class No. 207. He died doing what he loved: serving our community.
  He is survived by his wife and his 5-month-old and 4-year-old sons.
  Officer Casillas, your memory and spirit will live on. May you rest 
in peace.
