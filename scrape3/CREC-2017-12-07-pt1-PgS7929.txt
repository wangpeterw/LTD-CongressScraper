                              Resolutions


    IN RESPONSE TO THE JANUARY 27, 2017 PRESIDENTIAL EXECUTIVE ORDER

       Whereas, Immigrants founded this Commonwealth nearly 4 
     centuries ago, and
       Whereas, This nation and this Commonwealth are proud of our 
     strong tradition of welcoming immigrants and refugees to our 
     shores, and
       Whereas, Our nation and this Commonwealth have stood as a 
     beacon of hope for refugees fleeing war, violence and 
     persecution, and
       Whereas, Immigrants play an essential part in strengthening 
     the communities and enriching the society of this nation and 
     this Commonwealth; and
       Whereas, Important sectors of the Commonwealth's economy, 
     including higher education, health care and innovation, 
     depend heavily on immigrants' contributions, and
       Whereas, The executive order prohibits many foreign 
     students, workers and other visa holders from 7 targeted 
     majority-muslim nations, including many who have already been 
     vetted and documented, from entering the United States for at 
     least 90 days, suspends the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program 
     for 120 days and resumes the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program 
     after 120 days only for nationals of countries as determined 
     jointly by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland 
     Security and the Director of National Intelligence; and
       Whereas, The First Amendment of the Constitution protects 
     the freedom of religion and this Executive order prioritizes 
     the admission of refugees based on specific religions, and
       Whereas, Much of the Executive order is inconsistent with 
     the Nation's and the Commonwealth's strong tradition of 
     welcoming immigrants and refugees to our shores, while not 
     conclusively contributing to the important goal of keeping 
     our residents safe and secure from terrorism, and
       Whereas, The Executive order presents serious 
     constitutional and other legal issues of due process, equal 
     protection and discrimination on the basis of religion and 
     national origin, Now therefore be it
       Resolved, That the Massachusetts Senate:
       (1) Reaffirms the Commonwealth's strong tradition of 
     welcoming immigrants and refugees and rejecting 
     discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion;
       (2) Calls on President Trump to reconsider and rescind 
     those portions of the Executive order that interfere with the 
     rights of already documented students, workers, permanent 
     residents and other visitors;
       (3) Supports the legal actions of our attorney general and 
     other plaintiffs to contest the legality of the Executive 
     order in court, and be it further
       Resolved, That copies of these resolutions shall be 
     transmitted forthwith by the clerk of the Senate to the 
     President of the United States and those Members of Congress 
     from the Commonwealth.
