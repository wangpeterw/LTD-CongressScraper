                  PRESERVING HEALTH CARE FOR VETERANS

  (Mr. GALLEGO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise as a proud marine on behalf of 
countless veterans across America whose healthcare options will vanish 
if House Republicans succeed in repealing the Affordable Care Act. The 
ACA has provided an invaluable safety net for our Nation's veterans, 
fulfilling critical gaps in coverage within the VA system.
  Mr. Speaker, in the first 2 years after the ACA's implementation, the 
rate of uninsured veterans dropped by an astonishing 43 percent. This 
was largely due to the fact that, through the ACA's Medicaid expansion, 
7 out of 10 previously uninsured veterans became eligible for coverage.
  The Republicans' so-called repeal-and-replace plan would slash 
veterans' options by abandoning our commitment to a more inclusive 
Medicaid program. Democrats refuse to compromise on care for our 
Nation's heroes, and we absolutely refuse to compromise in the fight to 
preserve the lifesaving Affordable Care Act.
