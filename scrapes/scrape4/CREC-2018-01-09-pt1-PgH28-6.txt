                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Lord our God, we give You thanks for giving us another year.
  At the beginning of this new session, surround us with Your Holy 
Spirit. Encompass with Your power all the walls and the dome of this 
building, truly a symbol to the world of inalienable rights and the 
freedom of people.
  Guide and protect Your elected servants in government and all who 
work in this place. May all who visit here be treated with respect and 
kindness.
  May the comings and goings of Your people be under the seal of Your 
loving care, and may all our work be done for Your greater honor and 
glory.
  Amen.
