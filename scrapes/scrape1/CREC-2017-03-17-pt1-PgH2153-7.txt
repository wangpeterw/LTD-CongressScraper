                    FIGHTING FOR RIGHTS AND EQUALITY

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, since 2013 I have flown the pride flag 
outside my D.C. office in solidarity with the LGBT community. According 
to the House historian, I was the first to do so, a fact that I am very 
proud of.
  Yesterday, outside my office in Washington, D.C., a man took that 
flag out of its holder, threw it on the ground, and stomped on it. He 
called the flag disgusting and immoral.
  This flag is a symbol of pride for the LGBT community--an 
international symbol of love, understanding, equality, and hope.
  The shadows of intolerance have grown longer in recent days: bomb 
threats called into Jewish community centers, desecrations of Jewish 
cemeteries, hate crimes against minorities and the transgender 
community, horrifically racist statements from a Member of this body.
  To all our brothers and sisters who endure through these hateful 
acts, we stand with you, and we will continue to fight for your rights 
and your equality.
