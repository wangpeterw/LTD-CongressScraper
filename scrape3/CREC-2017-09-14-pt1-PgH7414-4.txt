          CONGRATULATING JOHNSON CITY ON ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 125th 
anniversary of the village of Johnson City in Broome County. Founded in 
1892, Johnson City was first named Lestershire. The village was later 
renamed Johnson City in honor of George F. Johnson, a factory worker 
who rose through the ranks at the Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company, a 
local manufacturing firm started in Binghamton in 1854.
  Under Johnson's leadership, Endicott-Johnson evolved into an economic 
hub in the region. Through the square deal and his generosity to both 
the community and his employees, George Johnson played a pivotal role 
in shaping Johnson City into the village we know today.
  Part of the Tri-Cities, Johnson City is now home to over 15,000 
people and will soon be home to Binghamton University's School of 
Pharmacy.
  On behalf of the entire 22nd District, I extend my sincerest 
congratulations to Johnson City on this landmark anniversary.
