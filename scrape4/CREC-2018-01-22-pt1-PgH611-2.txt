                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. We also 
give You thanks that You have given to us the goals of justice and the 
designs of freedom and that these are our heritage as Americans.
  Bless the Members of the people's House with the understanding that 
it is their work to develop the strategies and the plans for achieving 
those goals and the trust to know that Your spirit is with them in 
their work.
  Grace this assembly with the resolve to be faithful in its tasks, 
responsible in its actions, and fervent in its desire to serve a nation 
which so many hope will live beyond the current difficulties into an 
ever greater realization of both justice and freedom.
  May all that is done today be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
