                NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it is National Cyber Security Awareness 
Month, and we have a lot of work to do to better secure our Nation's 
cyberspace, and we cannot underestimate these challenges.
  During our district work period last week, I took the opportunity to 
go on a cybersecurity tour to understand better what Rhode Island's 
initiatives are. During that time, I visited some of the Ocean State's 
growing cybersecurity companies, stopping by SecureWorks' Providence 
campus and speaking on a panel at Carousel Industries' AlwaysOn 
Technology summit.
  I learned about efforts to stem cybercrimes from the Rhode Island 
State Police, and I joined Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie 
Gorbea at an election security workshop for local officials.
  At the Rhode Island Society of CPAs, I encouraged our accountants to 
advise their clients about cybersecurity risk, and I joined State 
Senator Lou DiPalma to promote cyber hygiene practices.
  Most importantly, I spoke to PTECH students and participants in 
CyberPatriot about their importance as the next generation of 
cybersecurity leaders.
  Mr. Speaker, cybersecurity may be the national and economic security 
challenge of the 21st century, but with the talent that we have in 
Rhode Island, I am confident that we can take it on.
