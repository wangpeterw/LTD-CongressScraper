                  SLEEP APNEA IN THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY

  (Mr. SIRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the grave consequences 
that undetected obstructive sleep apnea has on safety in the railroad 
industry.
  Obstructive sleep apnea is caused by the obstruction of the airway 
during sleep. Untreated sleep apnea can cause unintended sleep episodes 
that may result in attention deficits and in a loss of situational 
awareness. It is a serious safety concern in railroading and has been a 
factor in numerous crashes:
  The September New Jersey Transit crash in Hoboken, New Jersey, was 
operated by an engineer with undiagnosed sleep apnea;
  In April 2011, a BNSF coal train collided with a standing train in 
Iowa that resulted in the deaths of two crew members. Medical records 
showed that both crew members had multiple risk factors for sleep 
apnea;
  In December 2013, a Metro-North Railroad passenger train derailed, 
killing four passengers and injuring 60. The engineer feel asleep due 
to undiagnosed sleep apnea.
  I am pleased that the Federal Railroad Administration finally 
released a safety advisory that calls for railroads to screen train 
operators for sleep apnea, and I hope it is instituted quickly.
