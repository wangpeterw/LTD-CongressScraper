       DISAPPEARANCE OF MEXICAN STUDENTS NEEDS MORE INVESTIGATION

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago today, 43 students from 
Ayotzinapa, Mexico, disappeared.
  I recently traveled to Mexico where I spoke with many of their 
parents and the family members of the students who disappeared. I was 
humbled by the strength that they show. After a 3-year struggle, they 
have asked for answers to two simple questions: What happened that 
night when their children were taken; and where are they now?
  On this third anniversary of their loss, I am repeating my past calls 
for the Mexican Government to prioritize their search for the students, 
to bring justice to those responsible for their disappearance, and to 
investigate any obstruction of justice.
  If the Mexican Government cannot do this, I urge them to allow the 
independent panel of experts to expand on their initial investigation. 
The students, their parents, and the Mexican people deserve answers.
