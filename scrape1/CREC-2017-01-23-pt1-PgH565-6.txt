              MOURNING THE LOSS OF DETECTIVE JERRY WALKER

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the memory of 
Detective Jerry Walker of Little Elm, Texas.
  Detective Walker was lost in the line of duty last week when he 
responded to an emergency call that involved an active shooter. This 
great loss has cast a shadow of sadness over our close-knit community. 
This is the first time in the city's history that we have lost an 
officer in the line of duty.
  Detective Walker was a dedicated member of our police force and 
community. He was a husband, a father, a mentor, and a friend to many. 
I had the privilege of meeting Detective Walker when he was on duty at 
one of my townhall meetings in the summer of 2014. His dedication to 
protecting the residents of Little Elm was evident in all that he did.
  Dallas Cowboys' wide receiver Cole Beasley sums up this loss 
precisely saying: ``We lost a good one.''
  Our town of Little Elm continues to mourn the loss of one of our 
heroes. His service to our community will not be forgotten.
  I extend my deepest sympathy to Detective Walker's family and will 
continue to keep them in my prayers.
