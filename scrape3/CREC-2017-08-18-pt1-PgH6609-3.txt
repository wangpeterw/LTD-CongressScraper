                                 PRAYER

  Rabbi Arnold E. Resnicoff, Retired Chaplain, United States Navy, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Almighty God, we pray, reflect, or meditate in different ways but 
together ask Your blessing for this country that we love. We are far 
from perfect, but we have a perfect dream: liberty, justice--equality--
for all.
  On this date, August 18, we made progress in the past. We ratified 
the 19th Amendment, tearing down the wall that blocked a woman's right 
to vote; did what we do best when we are at our best; made a moral 
right a legal right, enshrining liberty in law.
  This week we mourn the pain and death of neighbors--the clashes in 
the street, the shouted words of hate--attacks against the very dreams 
that remind us who and what we yearn to be.
  And so we pray with words of song: America, America, God mend thine 
every flaw, confirm thy soul in self-control, thy liberty in law.
  And let us say, Amen.

                          ____________________
