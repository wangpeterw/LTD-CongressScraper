             CONGRATULATIONS UCONN WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM

  (Mr. COURTNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, at 11 p.m. last night, the UConn women's 
basketball team once again stunned the sporting world and, really, the 
Nation by winning their 100th straight win against a very good team, 
the University of South Carolina.
  Again, Mr. Speaker, the UConn women just continue to defy the laws of 
gravity. They have won 11 NCAA titles, again, shattering all records 
before them, and the 100th win was exceeding the last record which the 
UConn women set a number of years ago in terms of consecutive wins.
  Coach Geno Auriemma has an extraordinary program, which has almost a 
perfect record of graduation. These are true student athletes. Last 
night, Gabby Williams, Napheesa Collier, Kia Nurse, and Crystal 
Dangerfield once again made us proud in the State of Connecticut to be 
the home of real champions.
  Again, congratulations. You are in unchartered waters now at 100 wins 
and counting, and we look forward to more success in the future.
  Go Huskies.
