            AMENDMENTS TO NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT

  (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues for 
passage of my three amendments to the National Defense Authorization 
Act last night.
  Two of my amendments would address our Nation's opioid crisis as it 
impacts or Nation's servicemembers and veterans. They would direct the 
Defense Department to study the effectiveness of their opioid 
prescriber education policies and require Department providers to 
counsel or give referrals to the VA for transitioning veterans that 
suffer from addiction or chronic pain.
  My third amendment would direct the Department of Defense to analyze 
sexual coercion in the military as part of its annual report on sexual 
assault.
  While I commend the Department for their progress in reducing the 
occurrence of sexual assault in the military, more work needs to be 
done. Understanding sexual coercion is important to the safety of our 
brave men and women, and important for our national security.
