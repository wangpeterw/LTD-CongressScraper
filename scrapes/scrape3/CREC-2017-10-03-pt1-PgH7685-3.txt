                        HONORING ELAINE NEKRITZ

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated public 
servant, terrific mentor, and good friend, Elaine Nekritz, who retired 
this week as State representative for Illinois' 57th District.
  For more than 14 years, Elaine has ably represented the communities 
of Buffalo Grove, Arlington Heights, Northbrook, Wheeling, Palatine, 
Mount Prospect, and Prospect Heights in the Illinois House of 
Representatives.
  During this time, she has been an outspoken advocate for her 
constituents, a passionate defender of the environment, and a champion 
for women's rights.
  Future generations in Illinois will benefit from Elaine's work to 
invest in infrastructure, including a high-speed rail link between 
Chicago and St. Louis.
  Her smart backing of criminal justice reform ensures more young 
offenders have an opportunity to reform their lives through juvenile 
court.
  The residents of the 57th District will miss her energy, dedication, 
and tireless communication with her constituents.
  I am personally grateful for Elaine's service and wish her the best 
and her husband, Barry, the very best in whatever comes next.

                          ____________________
