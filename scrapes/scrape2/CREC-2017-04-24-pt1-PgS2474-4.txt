                     REMEMBERING MATTHEW McCLANAHAN

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I echo the majority leader's 
remarks on the tragic death of Matthew McClanahan last Tuesday. We all 
know the Architect of the Capitol employs plumbers, landscapers, 
painters, electricians, custodians, and mechanics. They make their 
careers by ensuring that our buildings and grounds are well maintained, 
safe, and beautiful. The stunning tragedy of last week has shaken this 
entire staff to its core.
  Matthew McClanahan died way too young. That he died at work in 
repairing the Capitol's sprinkler system has hit our entire community 
very hard.
  To those who worked so hard to save him, you have our gratitude and 
admiration.
  To those who feel his absence so keenly in their daily lives, you 
have our sympathy and our support.
  May you remember the words of Scripture fittingly from Matthew: 
``Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.''
  Our prayers go out to his family--his wife, Lauren; his 7-year-old 
daughter, Evie; his young son, Matthew; and to his parents, brothers, 
and sisters-in-law, and grandparents.
  His funeral was yesterday, and I understand it was completely packed, 
with some mourners outside and unable to get in. He was well loved. He 
will be well remembered.
