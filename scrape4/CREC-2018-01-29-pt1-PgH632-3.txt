                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  You not only design but create. You sustain and shape what we know as 
reality. In Your hands, as the craftsman and artist, we are instruments 
for the time You have given us. Fitting into the palm of Your hand, we 
can accomplish Your will and produce what You have in mind for us, or 
we can prove unfit to achieve Your purpose for the tasks at hand.
  Almighty God, help the Members of this people's House to see 
themselves as instruments in Your hands, shaping the time in which we 
live. As well, enable them to see in each other that same creative 
impulse and responsibility.
  Only by relating to each other as Yours can we find our true 
identity, work together, and truly give You the greater honor and 
glory.
  Amen.
