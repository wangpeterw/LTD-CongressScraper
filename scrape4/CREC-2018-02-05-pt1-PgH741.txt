             RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT OF DONNA McCLOSKEY

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
retirement of Donna McCloskey, a constituent of mine from Bristol 
Borough, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, after a 42-year career of 
community service as an employee of the Grundy Foundation. Starting in 
1975, Donna worked at the Grundy Library, eventually assisting the 
Grundy Foundation's executive director until Donna was appointed the 
Grundy Museum administrator, a position which she held for the past 12 
years.
  As the museum administrator, Donna is credited with updating the 
museum's strategic plan, creating best practices for all of the 
museum's programs and services, and building up partnerships between 
the museum and the community. Under Donna's leadership, the number of 
visitors to the museum increased exponentially, and the 40th and 50th 
anniversary events were great successes.
  I want to express my deep gratitude and the gratitude of our entire 
community for Donna's commitment to preserving the history of our 
community. While her retirement is well deserved, her exit is already 
felt.
  Thank you, Donna.
