                         FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as we all know, we must pass 
legislation to fund the government before the end of the week. By 
approving a short-term bill, we can continue the crucial functions of 
the Federal Government while we work with our colleagues in the House 
and the Trump administration to finalize a long-term plan.
  The temporary funding measure will come before the House soon, and I 
expect the Senate to consider it shortly thereafter. It is a clean 
bill, free from any sort of objectionable policy riders. In addition, 
it includes a provision to assure States of the future of the 
Children's Health Insurance Program while a bipartisan reauthorization 
agreement is completed. All Members should be able to support this 
noncontroversial, short-term legislation.
  We will continue working to pass a funding agreement that advances a 
number of American priorities--something we will be discussing with the 
President on Thursday, along with Democratic leaders of the House and 
Senate.
  Yesterday, the Senate Democratic leader expressed his opposition to a 
government shutdown. I certainly agree with him. So I hope he and his 
fellow Democrats will continue to work with us in good faith to pass 
this short-term funding bill and maintain the critical functions of the 
Federal Government.
