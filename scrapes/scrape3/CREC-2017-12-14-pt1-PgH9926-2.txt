                             TAX CUTS BILL

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am excited.
  For the first time in decades, I can dare to hope that we will not 
crush our children's future with debt.
  As our House and Senate colleagues work hard to shape the details of 
a final bill, we can see the goal line:
  We will lower rates across the board for hardworking taxpayers in all 
brackets;
  We will provide relief to small businesses and farms throughout our 
Nation so that America can compete and win; and
  We will simplify the Tax Code.
  Mr. Speaker, you shouldn't need an army of lawyers and accountants to 
do your taxes. Americans deserve a Tax Code where everyone plays by the 
same rules and a code that projects a lifetime of savings.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to work together, give America the 
healthy economy it deserves, and support the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
