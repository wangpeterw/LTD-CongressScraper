  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, the Republican House bill is a 
disaster for the American people. The process by which the bill was 
voted on, Members had very little time to review the text. As a result, 
we were forced to vote on legislation without the benefit of facts, on 
a bill that affects a $3 trillion annual industry.
  That is why I have joined Congresswoman Jayapal in introducing H. 
Res. 441, to require a review by the Congressional Budget Office before 
a bill comes to the floor.
  Members of Congress should have as much information as possible to 
make a smart decision on major legislation affecting 18 percent of the 
American economy. This resolution would simply affirm the time-honored 
principle that facts do matter and that a fair, honest, and transparent 
policymaking process is essential to a healthy and thriving democracy.
