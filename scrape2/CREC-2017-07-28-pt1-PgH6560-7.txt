                          LET'S WORK TOGETHER

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Senate Republican majority 
failed to pass their ACA repeal. This is a win for the people across 
America who wrote letters, made phone calls, and organized communities 
against this disastrous bill.
  Mr. Speaker, millions of people rely on insurance expansion made 
possible under the ACA. Our job is not to harm the people we serve but 
to make their lives better.
  Under every single Republican healthcare bill, millions of people 
would lose health coverage. There are many steps we can take together. 
Let us strengthen the risk pools, promote competition among insurers, 
and require States to expand their Medicaid programs.
  These steps will help lower premiums, increase choice, and allow 
50,000 individuals in my district and millions of low-income Americans 
across the country to get insurance.
  My constituents are tired of the partisanship. I urge my friends on 
the other side of the aisle to work with us and each other instead of 
against each other so everyday Americans do not grow even more cynical 
of our governing institutions.
  While the failure of TrumpCare is welcome news, now is the time to 
hold public hearings, bipartisan meetings, and work toward goals that 
reduce premiums, deductibles, and healthcare costs for American people.
  I look forward to working with my Republican colleagues to build on 
the ACA and improve the law.
