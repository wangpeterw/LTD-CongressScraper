               OPPOSE DISASTROUS RYAN-McCONNELL TAX PLAN

  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Ryan-McConnell 
tax plan that puts the interests of wealthy elites and corporations 
ahead of the needs of the American people.
  This bill tears away protections for Americans with student loans and 
Americans who choose to adopt children. It strips support for 
individuals with unexpected health challenges, even those whose homes 
have burned down.
  Under this plan, some 8 million American families will see their 
taxes go up almost immediately, and millions more will face tax 
increases in the future.
  All this is done while giving permanent tax breaks to millionaires 
and billionaires and increasing the deficit by trillions of dollars. 
This puts America's social safety net and our economic future in deep 
jeopardy.
  This is not the type of tax relief the American middle class and 
working poor need--or deserve--right now.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge every one of my colleagues to put the needs of 
the American people first and oppose the very disastrous Ryan-McConnell 
tax plan.
