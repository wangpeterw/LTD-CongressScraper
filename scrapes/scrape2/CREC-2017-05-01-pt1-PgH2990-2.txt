               DISABILITY DISCHARGE OF PARENT PLUS LOANS

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, today I introduced the PLUS Loan 
Disability Forgiveness Act, a bill to relieve the burden of student 
loan debt on parents whose children become permanently disabled. While 
most student loans are forgiven if a student becomes totally and 
permanently disabled, parent PLUS loans are not.
  It is simply wrong that a parent struggling with a child's disability 
is not afforded the same loan forgiveness as other borrowers. My bill 
would extend disability discharge to parent PLUS loans. It would allow 
families to focus on healing, not servicing debt. It would help lighten 
the $1.4 trillion owed by student borrowers and their families.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these 
parents, who are just trying to help their children succeed.
