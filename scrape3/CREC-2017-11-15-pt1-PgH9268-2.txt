                 HONORING MAGGIE McNEILL OF ASHE COUNTY

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to salute a brave, dedicated 
nurse of Ashe County, North Carolina, Mrs. Maggie McNeill.
  Recently, the Fifth Congressional District of North Carolina 
experienced torrential downpours and flooding, causing severe damage to 
many residents and their property.
  Mrs. McNeill, scheduled for her shift at Ashe Memorial Hospital, 
found her car's path blocked by flood waters and a downed tree. 
Undeterred by this danger, Mrs. McNeill hiked on foot up a steep hill 
to her helpful father who gave her a ride to the hospital in time to 
help deliver two babies.
  What a fantastic role model Mrs. McNeill is. She understood she was 
needed, and she risked herself to get to her patients. She exemplifies 
the best characteristics of Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for many when I say that future 
generations of the Ashe County community are blessed by Mrs. McNeill's 
dedication to her calling.
