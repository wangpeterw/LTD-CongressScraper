             AMERICA CAN BE A FAIR AND COMPASSIONATE NATION

  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, last week I visited Norte Vista High School 
and stood before a room of DREAMers who were desperate to know if they 
have a future in America, the only country they have ever called home. 
I had to look each student in the eye and say: I can't make any 
promises.
  The question is not whether we have enough votes in Congress to pass 
the Dream Act. We all know that we do. The question is not whether 
passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do. We all know that it is.
  The question before this Congress is whether we have the political 
courage and the basic decency to reject our worst impulses, and protect 
the most vulnerable members of our society.
  In a few months, I hope I can stand before that same room of DREAMers

[[Page H7104]]

and tell them that the answer is, yes; yes, America can be a fair and a 
compassionate nation, and, yes, they are free to realize the promise of 
this great country.
