                             EQUAL PAY DAY

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, it is Equal Pay Day, and I am privileged to 
rise in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act today. This legislation 
would strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by ensuring that women can 
hold employers accountable for what they earn and challenge 
discrimination. Representative Rosa DeLauro has introduced this bill 
for two decades, which is two decades too long.
  Women in Ohio make 75 cents for every dollar a man makes, which is 
unacceptable. It is time we close the decades-old loophole that 
prevents the United States from closing this gender pay gap once and 
for all.
  The Paycheck Fairness Act would close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act 
of 1963, by holding employers accountable for discriminatory practices. 
The bill would end the practice of pay secrecy, ease workers' ability 
to individually or jointly challenge pay discrimination, and strengthen 
the available remedies for wronged employees.
  President Trump said on equal pay: ``If they do the same job, they 
should get the same pay.'' Boy, do I agree. So let's make it happen.
