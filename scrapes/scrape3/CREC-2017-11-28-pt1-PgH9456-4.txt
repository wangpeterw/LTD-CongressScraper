                CONGRATULATING NEEDVILLE LADY BLUE JAYS

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, it first happened in 1975, then 1976, 1977, 
and 1992. The fifth time was November 18, 2017, 2 weeks ago.
  The Needville Lady Blue Jays won the Texas State volleyball 
championship. One word describes our Blue Jays, and that word is 
``domination.'' They swept the playoffs, losing 1 out of 22 sets.
  All of Texas 22 is proud of our coaches--Schultz, Bradford, and 
Smyers--and the stars who took us on the drive for five: Janssen, 
Sydney, Kailey, Peyton, Hayden, MacKenzie, Kaitlyn, Samantha, Anna, 
Baley, Madison, Evan, Treasure, and Maddy.
  Mr. Speaker, get ready, number six is coming in 2018.
  Go Blue Jays.
