                              THE TAX BILL

  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, the President said yesterday that these 
massive tax cuts for corporate America will be rocket fuel for the 
economy--rocket fuel for corporate America and for the Trump empire for 
certain, and a rocket-fueled hit to the heart of middle America for 
sure.
  If you are in college and you are trying to become better and self-
sufficient to thrive in the global economy, you are getting a big tax 
hike. If you have a medical illness that you were born into and your 
costs exceed your insurance coverage, you will be getting a big tax 
hike. If you are 1 of 13 million Americans to lose your healthcare 
coverage and the millions more who will see their premiums explode 
because congressional Republicans needed another $300 billion for their 
deficit-exploding corporate tax cuts, you will be taking a big hit on 
top of a big tax hike.
  Mr. Speaker, this tax cut bill is a massive takeaway from middle 
America and a massive giveaway to corporate America. The deficit will 
rise by $1.5 trillion, and both the Congressional Budget Office and the 
Joint Committee on Taxation confirmed that, in less than 10 years, 
Americans making between $40,000 and $50,000 will pay $5.3 billion more 
in taxes.
