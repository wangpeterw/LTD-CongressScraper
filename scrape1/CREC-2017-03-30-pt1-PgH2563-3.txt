                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, thank You for giving us another day. Send Your spirit 
upon the Members of this people's House to encourage them in their 
official tasks. Especially during this season of budget deliberations, 
give them wisdom and an accurate understanding of the needs of the 
citizens of this country, most particularly those with narrow margins 
in their life options.
  As the trees of the city are bright with flowers, may Your spirit 
enlighten the minds of those who serve, and may the beauty of Your 
creation show forth in the creative work of our Congress.
  May all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
