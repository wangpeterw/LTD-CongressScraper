     CONGRATULATING LaTOYA CANTRELL, THE MAYOR-ELECT OF NEW ORLEANS

  (Mr. RICHMOND asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with extreme joy and 
excitement. My hometown, which is New Orleans, a part of my 
congressional district, next year, will celebrate our 300th 
anniversary. Over the years, we were under French control, we were 
under Spanish control, we were back under French control, and then we 
had the Louisiana Purchase. But as we walk into our 300th year, we have 
an elected--and we will be under the control of--female mayor for the 
first time in New Orleans history. That female is LaToya Cantrell.
  She is a community activist and she is very focused on the future. I 
just want to congratulate LaToya on being elected to be the mayor of 
the city of New Orleans, and just to assure the people of New Orleans 
that we are going to go forward in our 300th year together and continue 
to improve the greatest city in the world, and that is New Orleans, 
Louisiana.
  Mr. Speaker, I, once again, congratulate LaToya Cantrell on her 
election to be mayor of the city of New Orleans.
