                  CONGRATULATING PENN STATE WRESTLING

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the Penn State wrestling team on winning this year's NCAA 
Division I National Championship.
  The Penn State Nittany Lions are a force to be reckoned with and they 
proved it again last weekend in Cleveland, Ohio, when they brought home 
their seventh team title in 8 years. The team went 4-and-1 in the 
finals, coming back from a 6-point deficit heading into the final round 
to clinch the title on a pin by junior Bo Nickal in Penn State's final 
match of the night.
  Penn State won the team title with 141.5 points, while Ohio State was 
in second with 134.5. Iowa took third with 97.
  Head coach Cael Sanderson now has 22 national champions as a head 
coach, 20 at Penn State, and 7 NCAA titles.
  I could not be more proud of my alma mater or this team that gave us 
yet another season to remember. Many college athletes dream about 
participating at the NCAA championships.
  This team truly is the pride of Happy Valley, and I congratulate 
Coach Sanderson and every wrestler on the team.
  We are.
