                  AMELIA EARHART CONTINUES TO INSPIRE

  (Ms. JENKINS of Kansas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, Amelia Earhart, one of the most 
iconic aviators in history, became the first woman to fly across the 
Atlantic Ocean, which launched her to national notoriety and inspired 
millions to follow. Highlighting her contributions to aviation, 
yesterday, the House passed the Amelia Earhart U.S. Post Office Act, 
which names her hometown post office in Atchison, Kansas, after her.
  While she was lost at sea, that wasn't the end of the Amelia Earhart 
story. A woman's aviation group, the Ninety-Nines, which she founded, 
still exists today and advocates for female pilots in the industry. 
Amelia's legacy soars as high as ever as she continues to inspire new 
generations of women to reach for greater heights.
  Please join me in celebrating the life of Amelia Earhart.
