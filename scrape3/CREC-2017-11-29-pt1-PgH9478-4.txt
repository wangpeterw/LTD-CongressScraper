                        THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the tax bill being debated in the Senate.
  Under this bill, by 2027, those making $1 million and over will see 
the biggest tax cuts. All the while, by 2021, families earning just 
$10,000 to $30,000 would start seeing their taxes increase. By 2027, 
taxes would increase for all Americans earning $75,000 a year or less. 
The Senate bill repeals a vital part of ObamaCare and would lead to 
increased premiums and 13 million people becoming uninsured.
  This bill is disastrous for America, California, and my district. In 
2027, California residents will suffer from an over-$12 billion tax 
increase.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my Senate colleagues to oppose the GOP tax bill.
