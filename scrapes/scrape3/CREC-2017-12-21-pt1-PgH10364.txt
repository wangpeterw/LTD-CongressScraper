                      TITLE III--BUDGETARY EFFECTS

     SEC. 5201. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION.

       This division is designated as an emergency requirement 
     pursuant to section 4(g) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act 
     of 2010 (2 U.S.C. 933(g)).

     SEC. 5202. DESIGNATION IN SENATE.

       In the Senate, this division is designated as an emergency 
     requirement pursuant to section 403(a) of S. Con. Res. 13 
     (111th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for 
     fiscal year 2010.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 
1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Appropriations.
  The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. Lowey) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present H.R. 4667, a bill making 
emergency appropriations for hurricane and wildfire recovery.
  Parts of our Nation have been devastated by multiple back-to-back 
hurricanes and wildfires that have caused tremendous loss of life, 
livelihoods, and property.
  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria are three of the top five most 
expensive hurricanes in the last 25 years. Combined with the horrific 
wildfires that continue to rage in California, the toll that these 
disasters have taken is unprecedented.
  We must stand by our fellow Americans to get them the help and 
resources they need to recover. To this end, this legislation provides 
a total of $81 billion for crucial Federal programs that support 
ongoing relief, recovery, and rebuilding.
  This includes $27.5 billion for FEMA to provide relief and recovery 
assistance; $26.1 billion for Community Development Block Grants for 
shelter and housing and infrastructure improvements, and the means to 
help large and small businesses recover; and $12.1 billion for the Army 
Corps of Engineers to repair and rebuild infrastructure projects that 
help protect against future disasters, building in resiliency.
  The bill also includes $3.8 billion for the Department of 
Agriculture, which will support critical agriculture disaster 
assistance for massive crop and livestock loss.
  Funding is also included to repair Federal highways and local transit 
systems, to help children displaced by the storms of Puerto Rico get 
back to school, and for small business disaster loans, which will allow 
businesses to reopen their doors as quickly as possible.
  Our Committee on Appropriations will continue to monitor these 
recovery efforts to ensure accountability, transparency, and that every 
dollar is spent wisely. From Florida and Texas, to Puerto Rico and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, to California, and all areas dealing with major 
disaster declarations, this Congress is committed to helping you.
  Congress has already provided $51.75 billion in two separate 
supplemental bills for these ongoing efforts. With this third tranche 
of emergency funding, it will bring the total funding for fiscal year 
2018 emergency response to $132 billion. This funding is desperately 
needed by thousands of American families, individuals, and communities 
to rebuild their homes and businesses, restore electric power and 
critical infrastructure, and to protect against further damage. It is 
the duty of Congress to provide this help to our fellow Americans in 
their times of need.
  Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to thank everyone who came 
to leadership and to the Appropriations Committee to make sure that 
Congress is getting the assistance to those hurricane and wildfire 
victims that they urgently need.
  I would also like to thank the clerks and professional staff and the 
chairs of the 12 Appropriations Subcommittees for their working 
tirelessly to bring this bill to the floor and, may I say, nearly 30 
others this year.
  It is time to get this emergency aid to those who need it. I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill and this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a failure of both process and 
substance. When Congress received the paltry and insufficient disaster 
request from the administration, the House and Senate Appropriations 
Committees began a bipartisan and bicameral process to develop an 
emergency assistance package that would come closer to meeting the 
massive scale of need resulting from hurricanes and wildfires in the 
summer and fall 2017.
  I sincerely regret that the majority leadership abandoned that 
process, choosing, instead, to disregard input from Democrats and even 
from Senate Republicans, and developed their own partisan supplemental. 
The results of that decision is a poor product that will not be enacted 
into law.
  Despite some robust funding levels, this bill fails to fix a 
potentially calamitous Medicaid system situation for Puerto Rico and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. Without help from Congress, these programs 
will exhaust available funding within months. This bill also fails to 
waive unworkable and unjustifiable cost share requirements for FEMA and 
the Army Corps of Engineers' projects, which could put Federal funding 
out of reach.
  These and other serious shortcomings must be fixed before an 
emergency supplemental is enacted into law. Even if this supplemental 
passes today, the House majority's decision to exclude both Democrats 
and Senate Republicans from this process means that it will not be 
enacted this year because it cannot pass the Senate.
  Instead of the partisan product with no chance of advancement, we 
should be considering a responsible bipartisan emergency supplemental 
that both the House and the Senate could pass and enact into law.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Culberson), the chairman of the Commerce, Justice, and 
Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and 
Speaker Ryan for rejecting the Office of Management and Budget's 
completely inadequate funding request that they sent to Congress. It is 
the job of the Appropriations Committee and Congress to write 
these emergency spending bills, and we have done so.

  I am one of eight subcommittee chairmen who held public hearings at 
the request of the chairman. I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen for 
listening to all of us to change the legislation to ensure that the 
State of Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico are a long way towards being 
made whole. This is a tremendous step in the right direction. We are 
grateful for the funding that is contained here. We are also grateful 
for a lot of the changes that the chairman and the committee have 
included.
  For example, we have got $12 billion here for the Army Corps of 
Engineers' projects that is going to be prioritized

[[Page H10386]]

and targeted to areas that have suffered repeated floods over the last 
2 years, to areas that have been declared disasters by the President. 
That will help ensure that the people of Texas, in particular, who had 
53 inches of rain over an area the size of New Jersey, the people of 
Texas and southwest Louisiana who suffered from Hurricane Harvey, those 
projects will receive priority consideration by the Army Corps of 
Engineers. That is going to help us get that third reservoir built in 
northwest Harris County.
  This funding is also sufficient to fully pay for all federally 
authorized flood control projects in southeast Texas. That means we 
will have front-loaded funding for a critical project to finish out 
Brays Bayou, to build it to the 100-year flood protection standard.
  The Army Corps of Engineers' funding is also going to allow us to 
dredge the Port of Houston, the Port of Beaumont, and open up those 
ports to full capacity.
  Another important change that the chairman included at my request, 
and I am very pleased it is in there, is that we had a lot of people 
flooded because the Army Corps of Engineers opened the floodgates 
necessarily on Addicks and Barker.
  These folks were flooded by the action of the government in the 
Neches River Waterway and the Sabine Waterway and on the San Jacinto 
River.
  Chairman Frelinghuysen included language that allows the Governor of 
the State of Texas to ask for a waiver of the prohibition against 
duplication of benefits.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to 
the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, it is important for the people of Texas 
to know that help is on the way to not only repair the damage caused by 
the flood, but if they were flooded by the action of the government, 
there is a provision in this legislation today that will allow the 
Governor to request that they be compensated, that they can take out an 
SBA loan at the front and they will pay the government back, and then 
receive a Community Development Block Grant at the end to help make 
them whole.
  Mr. Speaker, we will also be able to rebuild churches and synagogues. 
That is vitally important because we suffered so much damage in 
southeast Texas.
  I am proud to support this legislation, and I look forward to working 
with the chairman and my colleagues as we go forward, if there is 
additional funding needed. I am very grateful for the support of 
Congress. I urge Members to support this vital legislation to help the 
people of southeast Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico have a better 
Christmas.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Serrano), the ranking member of the Commerce, Justice, 
Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
  (Mr. SERRANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the time.
  I rise to sadly oppose this disaster supplemental, which does not do 
enough to help Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
  This is a bill created by Republicans with little Democratic input. 
At some point, they decided that rather than working in a bipartisan 
manner, they wanted to try and address these disasters without taking 
into account some of the most important Democratic priorities.
  In particular, it does not address many issues crucial to Puerto 
Rico's recovery in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. For instance, 
it does nothing to address the looming Medicaid cliff, which will 
devastate health kits access and delivery on the island early next 
year. It does not waive numerous local cost share requirements, which 
will make it extremely difficult for the government of Puerto Rico to 
access large parts of the Federal funding made available here.
  It does not do enough to help States like New York and New Jersey and 
others that have generously opened their arms to our fellow citizens 
displaced by these storms.

                              {time}  1500

  It expands the powers of the Puerto Rico Fiscal Oversight Board, 
giving them authority to approve the recovery plans of Puerto Rico's 
government.
  The end result of all of this is further delay in Puerto Rico's 
recovery. This is not the message that we want to send to 3.4 million 
American citizens this holiday season.
  As I look at my notes and as I look at what this debate may become 
today, it really comes down to one point: we as Americans, we as the 
United States Congress, we as the U.S. Government still have not come 
to grips with the fact that, yes, we have territories, that, yes, we 
have colonies.
  If you ask the American people, ``Are the people of Puerto Rico 
American citizens?'' you would be shocked before all this information 
went out on the hurricanes how many would say: ``I don't know. I served 
with some in the Army, but I don't know if they are citizens.''
  Well, I think, more and more, we need to know that the Virgin 
Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianna Islands, and 
Puerto Rico are part of the American family. It is not as a long gone 
member of my party once told me when I said: What are we going to do 
about Puerto Rico in this bill?
  He said: Well, we have no money left over.
  I said: Did you have money left over for the 50 States?
  He said: Well, they go first.
  I said: Why do they go first? Why can't the whole family go together?
  So my plea that I have made for years, I continue to make. There is a 
bigger issue than the one we are discussing today, and that is the fact 
that we have territories. We have colonies. They are part of the United 
States. They should be part of our family. We should treat them as 
such.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Carter), the chairman of the Homeland Security 
Subcommittee on Appropriations.
  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  I recently flew in a C-130 with a gathering of my colleagues and 
members of the Senate the length and breadth of Florida, across the 
Gulf of Mexico, and up and down the Gulf Coast of my home State of 
Texas and looked at the devastation that, in 1 day, on about a 12-hour 
flight, we could see all the devastation that took place from these 
terrible storms.
  That is why this supplemental is so very important, because this is 
not about numbers, this is not about anything; it is about people, 
human beings. We helped people move their ruined furniture out of their 
houses when we were on that trip. We saw the devastation. We saw the 
tears and the pain that these people were dealing with.
  As chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations, 
I am proud to have had a small part in working on this project.
  Let me explain that the supplement provides $28.6 billion for the 
Department of Homeland Security; $27.5 billion is for the Disaster 
Relief Fund to provide for the continued response and recovery efforts 
for all recent disasters. These funds will provide for the recovery 
efforts of all disasters that have received a major disaster 
declaration, to include, Texas, Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands.
  This money is needed to ensure food, water, and temporary shelter is 
made available to disaster survivors. These funds are used for debris 
removal efforts, the first step in recovery. These funds will also 
support the long-term recovery efforts to help rebuild utilities, 
bridges, roads, and buildings.
  $4 billion of this can be used for community disaster loans to help 
communities pay for essential services while they get back on their 
feet.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to 
the gentleman.
  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  The bill also includes $1.1 billion to address the damages to 
important Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and 
Transportation Security Administration facilities.
  The supplement provides $4.4 billion more than requested, but we 
looked at

[[Page H10387]]

each project to ensure that funding was only going to projects that 
address damages, improve resiliency, and increase disaster responses.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen for his leadership. He 
has been right on top of this, and we have got a good product here.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the supplemental.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Crowley), the chair of the Democratic Caucus.
  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for 
yielding me this time, and I thank her for her work. I thank Mr. 
Frelinghuysen, as well, for his work and my colleagues on the other 
side, but I have reservations, strong reservations about this bill.
  I appreciate the very real needs of those still recovering, our 
American citizens and friends and family in Florida and Texas, and that 
concern is genuine. I have always supported aid to other parts of the 
country, even when some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
refused to help New York and left New York hanging after Superstorm 
Sandy. I have never let that get in the way of my wanting to be helpful 
to my fellow citizens anywhere in this country who are under duress.
  But I can't, in good conscience, vote for this bill. It leaves some 
of the hardest hit and most vulnerable Americans, American citizens, 
without the help that they need. It treats Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands as second-class citizens--not second-class people, but second-
class, literally, citizens--and will stall the efforts there to 
rebuild.
  I appreciate Mr. Culberson saying that the people of Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands are a long way from recovery. I am paraphrasing what 
he said. I do appreciate those words. I do hope that it is an insight 
for my Republican colleagues and the leadership on the other side of 
the aisle that more help will be on the way for the people of Puerto 
Rico, but simply not enough is being done in this bill to help the men 
and women of Puerto Rico and the children of Puerto Rico today.

  Our fellow citizens of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are no less 
American than those in any of the 50 States.
  I wonder if anyone would argue that point as to whether they are 
citizens of the United States or not. I would argue they are no less 
citizens of the United States than any other individuals in the rest of 
the 50 States, and they should be treated the same and with the same 
respect.
  The people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands suffered direct hits 
not from one, but from two massive hurricanes, the likes of which we 
have never seen before, not in our modern history. Maybe you have to go 
back to Alexander Hamilton and the hurricane that he wrote about back 
in the 1700s that rocketed him to stardom.
  Here we are 3 months later. Millions--not hundreds, not thousands, 
but millions--of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and in the Virgin 
Islands are without power. Far too many still, because they are without 
power, lack clean drinking water. Thousands are unable to receive 
adequate healthcare, and earlier this week, the Governor of Puerto Rico 
ordered a recount of the storm's death toll, which could number, now, 
into the thousands. If that is not a sign of how neglectful the 
response has been to this disaster, then I don't know what would be.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Smith of Nebraska). The time of the 
gentleman has expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 additional minute to the gentleman 
from New York.
  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
  We must provide the assistance that our territories need. We must 
fully fund Medicaid as the islands recover. We must eliminate 
disparities in the law that are holding back that recovery. We must 
stand up for not the people of the Virgin Islands, not the people of 
Puerto Rico, but the United States citizens who have fought in our 
wars, who have defended our freedoms, for the United States citizens of 
the Virgin Islands and the United States citizens of Puerto Rico.
  They deserve no less than how any other State is being treated after 
a disaster like this. They deserve no less. They deserve more than they 
are getting in this bill.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. Calvert), chairman of the Interior, Environment, 
and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4667, which 
provides $81 billion in Federal disaster assistance to States and 
territories recently devastated by natural disasters. This is not a 
small amount of money.
  First, as chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee on Appropriations, I am pleased to include $616.4 million 
for repairs, cleanup, and recovery at various agencies, including the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, 
the National Park Service, and others.
  As chairman of the California Republican delegation, I have a 
particular interest in wildfire assistance in this bill. The 
coordination and collaboration between Republicans and Democrats on 
this bill to reflect the needs of California shows bipartisanship is 
alive and well.
  Mr. Speaker, I would certainly like to thank Congressman Mike 
Thompson for his tireless efforts in regard to the fires in northern 
California.
  Last month, I toured Santa Rosa, California, which was absolutely 
decimated after a wildfire tore through the area. Forty people lost 
their lives, and more than 14,000 homes were destroyed or damaged.
  As a lifelong California resident, I have seen a lot of fires and the 
resulting devastation, but I have never witnessed anything like I saw 
in Santa Rosa. The stories of survival and heroics of our first 
responders truly are incredible. Now, in the aftermath, we must come 
together to recover and rebuild.
  This bill is the first step towards recovery and provides $27.5 
billion for the Disaster Relief Fund, a $4.5 billion increase from the 
request, a 90 percent Federal cost share for wildfire disasters; and 
$541 million for watershed and flood prevention efforts, which will be 
vital as the rainy season begins in California.
  California will be eligible for nearly all the various sources of 
disaster funding in this bill, including for crop losses, Army Corps of 
Engineers projects, Federal highway damages, small business assistance, 
displaced employees, and student assistance, among others.
  With my colleagues, I will continue to monitor the fire situation and 
respond as needed. The Thomas Fire in Ventura County has burned over 
272,000 acres, on track to be the largest wildfire in California 
history; and, unfortunately, the fire rages on.
  Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and 
the Appropriations Committee staff for their outreach and 
responsiveness to the fires in California. We greatly appreciate their 
assistance and ongoing support.
  Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't thank all my staff and the 
Interior Subcommittee, but in particular, my chief of staff, Dave 
Kennett, and on the Interior Subcommittee, Betsy Bina, both of whom 
went above and beyond to deliver results for California.
  On a quick note, best wishes for Betsy, who is getting married today.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this emergency supplemental funding 
bill.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from 
New York; I want to thank the chairman; but I do want to take a moment 
and particularly thank the gentlewoman from New York for the kindness 
that she showed the first victims of this horrific hurricane season.
  I remember coming back to Congress in the immediacy of Hurricane 
Harvey. Many don't know, but I left my home in a firetruck--not out of 
desperation, but to go where my constituents were--and spent the rest 
of the time with 14,000 homeless evacuees in a shelter that had been 
set up immediately with concern about the city of Houston.
  We had meetings starting at 6 a.m. In the evening, as the waters 
started moving in different communities and different communities 
became flooded, we

[[Page H10388]]

could see evacuees carrying their only belongings--pillows, just a 
paper bag--flooding into the George R. Brown Convention Center.
  This is serious for me.
  I remember seeing elderly persons being evacuated after the Addicks 
Reservoir, Barker Reservoir was released and family members standing on 
what was now the shore waiting for those loved ones. I know the family 
and went to the funerals of the six family members who died in Greens 
Bayou in my congressional district.
  I introduced a bill, H.R. 3686, which the gentlewoman from New York 
was quite interested in. It was for $174 billion. If we had that amount 
now, I would be more than happy to share that with Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands.
  We don't have that. And I am extremely disappointed that we have $81 
billion, not because of the lack of the hard work of those who worked 
on the Appropriations Committee, because I know they wanted to do more, 
but there were other distractions--like a $1.4 trillion tax cut.

                              {time}  1515

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 1 
minute.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I want to thank my Texas colleagues. We worked 
together, and I truly appreciate that and will thank them for it.
  Today, I indicated that I have constituents who are down testifying 
in Houston about their devastation, so I want to make this point. First 
of all, I fought very hard for a $1 billion grant program for small 
businesses. I want to tell my constituents it is in, and I want to tell 
the State of Texas they have to put that in their application that they 
want to give small businesses grants and not loans.
  There is $12 billion in CDBG programs. I want to make sure that the 
State works with us to ensure that the elderly, the people who have no 
resources, families that have no resources have their homes rebuilt or 
they have their homes fixed.
  I want to make sure that the watershed study comes under section 
title IV, that the Army Corps is listening, that the watershed program 
that I have passed in two sessions to study the bayous, as to why 
Greens Bayou and Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou and Halls Bayou 
flood, and why people lose their lives. I want that watershed done, and 
the Army Corps of Engineers, I hope, will listen.
  There is a lot of work left to be done. We have got to get more 
money. And I am glad that Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are 
in, but you can count on me, Texas, and count on me, Puerto Rico and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands and Florida. We will fight into the new year to 
ensure that we get more funding. But these items have to be considered. 
We fought hard for them.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 4667, ``Making Further 
Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2017.''
  H.R. 4667, provides $81 billion in aid to respond to the damage 
caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and the wildfires in California.
  I thank the Speaker and Rules Committee Chairman Sessions for acting 
favorably upon my request to bring this emergency disaster supplemental 
to the floor for debate and vote as a stand-alone measure.
  But the fact remains that the amount of funding provided in the 
disaster relief package is very disappointing because it is not nearly 
sufficient to ameliorate the suffering still being experienced by the 
people of the communities in the areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, 
Irma, and Maria.
  Congress has had more than three months to develop an aid package 
that it is commensurate to the challenge faced by the affected states 
and territories in rebuilding their devastated communities.
  Much of this time has been squandered by the Republican congressional 
leadership all-consuming focus on ramming through the Republican Tax 
Scam legislation that gives 83 percent of its benefits to the top 1 
percent, raises taxes on working and middle-class families, takes away 
health insurance from 13 million Americans, explodes the deficit by 
$1.5 trillion and the national debt by $1.7 trillion, and will be paid 
for by 5.4 trillion in cuts to vital programs Americans depend on, 
including an imminent $25 billion reduction in Medicare funding.
  Mr. Speaker, on September 6, 2017, ten days after Hurricane Harvey 
struck and joined by 44 of our colleagues, I introduced H.R. 3686, the 
``Hurricane Harvey Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2017,'' which 
provides $174 billion in disaster relief for the areas affected by 
Hurricane Harvey, the worst superstorm ever to strike the mainland 
United States.
  The $174 billion in funding provided by H.R. 3686 represents a 
comprehensive response commensurate to the challenge; specifically my 
legislation provides relief in the following amounts:
  1. Housing and Community Development Fund: $50 billion
  2. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $35 billion
  3. Army Corps of Engineers--Construction: $15 billion
  4. Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies: $13 billion
  5. Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program: $33 billion
  6. Small Business Disaster Loans Program: $2 billion
  7. Emergency Conservation Activities: $650 million
  8. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $321 million
  9. National Aeronautics and Space Administration: $50 million
  10. Legal Services Corporation: $10 million
  11. Army National Guard: $10 million
  12. Army Corps of Engineers--Civil Investigations: $150 million
  13. Coast Guard: $450 million
  14. National Park Service Historic Preservation Fund: $800 million
  15. EPA Environmental Programs and Management: $2.5 billion
  16. EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund: $7 million
  17. Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund: $15 million
  18. State and Tribal Assistance Grants: $600 million
  19. Employment and Training Services: $100 million
  20. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund: $2.5 billion
  21. Airport and Airway Trust Fund: $90 million
  22. Federal-Aid Highways Emergency Relief Program: $6.5 billion
  And that is just for Texas and the areas affected by Hurricane 
Harvey; the damage wrought by Hurricane Irma in Florida, and Hurricane 
Maria in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was nearly as great in 
dollar terms and equal in the level of misery and suffering inflicted 
on the residents.
  Mr. Speaker, on September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in 
Puerto Rico, along the southeastern coast, near the small town of 
Yabucoa.
  The devastation wrought on that beautiful Caribbean oasis and its 3.5 
million inhabitants, our fellow citizens of the United States, is 
unimaginable, except perhaps to those of us who have lived through and 
survived similar natural disasters, like Hurricanes Harvey and Katrina.
  At least 48 people have died as a result of the storm as rescue and 
recovery operations proceed, a number likely to rise, especially with 
so many elderly, sick, and very young persons at risk.
  Much of Puerto Rico's population is still without potable drinking 
water and large swaths of the population still lack electrical power.
  Hurricane Maria destroyed 80 percent of Puerto Rico's agricultural 
industry, including banana, plantain and coffee crops, which translates 
into lost income of approximately $780 million.
  On August 30, 2017, Hurricane Irma struck, inflicting horrific damage 
on the U.S. Virgin Islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John, the 
Caribbean nations of Barbuda, St. Maarten, Cuba, and Anguilla, before 
making landfall in the Florida Keys.
  In Florida alone, 6.4 million people told to evacuate to safety, 
leading to days of jammed highways and frantic searches for gasoline 
amid one of the nation's largest ever emergency evacuations.
  At least 124 persons are known to have lost their lives in Hurricane 
Irma, more than 200,000 Floridians took refuge in shelters, and nearly 
6.5 million homes and businesses were without power.
  Mr. Speaker, we do not yet know the full extent of the damage and 
devastation suffered by our fellows Americans in Florida, the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and 
Maria.
  But what we do know is that the costs of recovery and reconstruction 
will be extensive, best estimates place the cost in the range of $50-
$100 billion.
  This puts in perspective the inadequacy of the amount of disaster 
relief provided under H.R. 4667 and why more, much more, must be done.
  Mr. Speaker, right now, at this very moment, approximately 300,000 
Texans--in Port Arthur, in Port Aransas, in Houston and Harris County--
remain homeless or are living in substandard homes with blue tarp roofs 
and infected with mold.

[[Page H10389]]

  Today, residents of the Cashmere Gardens community are meeting with 
local government officials to highlight their plight and those of other 
residents in the northeastern part of Houston.
  They are angry and frustrated and anxious, and who can blame them?
  Mr. Speaker, this is personal to them; and it is personal to me.
  That is why right now my highest priority is to ensure that funding 
that has been made available expeditiously gets in the hands of local 
governments so that relief can be deliver the resources and services so 
desperately needed.
  And I will be working with the Texas General Land Office and HUD 
Secretary Carson to relieve the emergency housing crisis in my 
congressional district and state.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the bipartisan leadership of both 
chambers, and my colleagues in the Texas congressional delegation for 
their diligence and commitment in bringing this package to the floor 
for debate and vote.
  I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey, and Speaker 
Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi, and their Senate counterparts for 
the work that has been done thus far and for their assistance in the 
work that lies ahead.
  I also thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey, and T-
HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Diaz-Balart, and Energy and 
Water Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Simpson and Ranking Member 
Kaptur for including in the legislation before us the following 
beneficial measures that I requested, including:
  1. Authority to establish an implement a $1 billion pilot program to 
provides small business disaster recovery grants, modeled on H.R. 3930, 
the ``Hurricane Harvey Small Business Recovery Grants Act,'' 
legislation I introduced on October 3, 2017 and co-sponsored by 16 of 
our colleagues.
  2. $75 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Investigations 
account, which is to be used in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, 
Irma, and Maria, and can be used to finance the $3 million Houston-Area 
Watershed Assessment Study I have worked to secure and previously 
approved by the House.
  3. The bill also includes helpful legislative language to ensure that 
in awarding CDBG-Disaster Relief funds to states, the Secretary of HUD 
should to the maximum extent practicable award grants to units of local 
government and public housing authorities that have the financial and 
administrative capacity to manage a grant awarded under the program.
  Let me describe briefly some of the major provisions contained in the 
Disaster Relief Supplemental:
  1. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $27.5 billion to provide critical 
funding to assist the ongoing federal disaster response. allows up to 
$4 billion to be provided for Community Disaster Loans (CDLs).
  2. Community Development Block Grants Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR): 
$26.1 billion for housing and infrastructure needs. $13.56 billion for 
grants to states, tribes, and territories for unmet housing needs and 
business losses.
  3. $12.5 billion for mitigation efforts to help communities protect 
against future disasters.
  4. This funding can provide for housing elevation, buyouts in the 
flood plain, water/sewer infrastructure enhancements, public 
infrastructure hardening (e.g. storm proofing public buildings).
  5. Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief: $1.4 billion to 
address all current damages to federal highways caused by designated 
disasters
  6. $12.11 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to repair existing 
damages by natural disasters and for studies and projects to reduce the 
risk of future natural disasters, $75 million to expedite studies to 
help mitigate future disaster damage.
  7. 2.9 billion to help displaced students get back to school. funding 
can be used for both public and private schools
  8. $3.8 billion for agriculture assistance.
  9. $1.66 billion for Small Business Administration Disaster Loans to 
assist small businesses and homeowners repair or replace real estate, 
personal property, machinery and equipment, and inventory and business 
assets.
  Mr. Speaker, there is much more work to be done in my city of 
Houston, and across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm 
that will be forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey, and by 
Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
  That is why I am disappointed that only $81 billion is being provided 
at this time.
  That is why it must be emphasized and understood that this can only 
be understood as a partial response because much more funding will be 
needed to provide our fellow Americans in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, 
Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands the help and support they need 
to restore their communities to their previous greatness.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), the chairman of the Transportation, 
Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the chairman of the 
committee for his spectacular work on this bill.
  Look, this bill provides much-needed relief and resources to Texas, 
Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, California, and Puerto Rico. I have 
heard a lot in this debate, but let's be very clear. This bill treats 
Florida, the folks in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, and California exactly the same--exactly the same.
  Significant portions, Mr. Speaker, of my district were hit hard by 
Hurricane Irma. Communities are still working to get back on their 
feet, communities like Everglades City, Chokoloskee, Plantation Island, 
Immokalee, and Montura Ranch.
  This bill helps meet our Federal obligation to ensure the full, 
appropriate Federal commitment is there for long-term recovery.
  Mr. Speaker, for highways, this bill funds repairs for the 2017 
storms and clears the backlog of prior years.
  On the housing side, this bill provides $26.1 billion for Community 
Development Block Grants. Of that, $13.6 billion is provided to meet 
all remaining unmet housing, business, and infrastructure needs for 
those hurricanes, and, yes, that includes the Virgin Islands and Puerto 
Rico.
  The remaining $12.5 billion is provided for mitigation grants, again, 
also to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and Florida and California 
and Texas. All of those are treated exactly the same. So, again, these 
grants provide resources to our communities so that they can rebuild.
  Additionally, I am pleased that $3.8 billion is allocated for the 
Department of Agriculture. This will go a long way to help those 
affected, those farmers, like the ag industry and the citrus industry 
in the State of Florida.
  So, again, I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on this important 
supplemental.
  I once again want to thank the chairman, Chairman Frelinghuysen, for 
his leadership, for his courage, for bringing forward a good bill that 
helps the folks in our country and that treats everybody equally, 
equitably, and fairly.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Thompson).
  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, this year has been the worst 
fire season in California history. The October fires included 21 major 
fires that were fought by over 11,000 firefighters.
  They were driven by powerful winds that reached speeds of over 80 
miles an hour, and these fires moved, at times, as fast as 200 feet per 
second. That is 40 football fields in a minute. They burned nearly 
300,000 acres.
  They forced over 100,000 people to evacuate their homes, and they 
destroyed over 9,000 homes and structures. And, most tragically, 44 
people lost their lives.
  Our communities have been devastated, Mr. Speaker, but they have also 
come together and supported each other in inspiring ways, and now they 
begin the very long road to recovery.
  I am pleased to see this supplemental funding package will deliver 
much-needed funds for fire recovery. I want to specifically thank 
Congressmen Calvert, McCarthy, and Pelosi, who came out and saw this 
devastation and have been working with us to make sure we get the funds 
that we need. I want to thank the appropriators and the appropriations 
staff for all their help as well.
  With the support of the entire California House delegation, the State 
of California has requested $4.4 billion for fire-related disaster 
relief. These funds will be vital to helping families rebuild their 
homes and their lives and to supporting our community as they rebuild 
critical infrastructure and restore essential services.
  It is critical that the Federal Government steps up and does its part 
to support our long-term recovery. This funding package is an important 
first step in that effort.
  I have a picture of one of the devastated areas. This is over 3,000 
homes in one swath that were just burned to the ground. Folks in 
California who experienced this terrible disaster need our help.

  I ask for an ``aye'' vote.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee.
  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I 
thank the chairman and the Appropriations Committee for bringing 
forward this extremely important legislation, which includes important 
FEMA reforms which were approved unanimously by the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee partially in response to this year's historic 
hurricane season.
  The bipartisan, bicameral Disaster Recovery Reform Act addresses the 
rising costs of disasters in the United States. It reforms Federal 
disaster programs to ensure our communities are more resilient and 
better prepared for the next hurricane, flood, earthquake, wildfire, or 
other disaster.
  It focuses on predisaster planning and mitigation and creates 
incentives for communities to build better and smarter to speed 
recovery when disaster does strike. This will save lives, and it will 
also save money.
  Putting our focus on mitigation is good government and is fiscally 
responsible. For every dollar we spend on mitigation, between $4 and $8 
is saved in avoided disaster recovery costs later. This is good policy 
that will benefit every single congressional district across the 
country.
  I want to thank many Members who contributed, but especially to my 
Democratic colleagues who contributed to this effort: Congressmen 
Johnson, DeFazio, Huffman, Wilson, Maloney, Ruiz, Sinema, Frankel, and 
Nadler. And again, many, many others contributed to this important 
reform legislation.

  Many Americans are still recovering from hurricane damage, and 
California is in the middle of fighting massive wildfires. This is 
extremely important legislation. I would urge all my colleagues to 
support it.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), the chairman of the Water Resources and 
Environment Subcommittee of the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure.
  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
working with us on this and for yielding time.
  I also want to thank the chairman of the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee and the ranking member for all their 
assistance.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill doesn't just include money, which, of course, 
is very, very important. It also includes language and changes that I 
would consider to be priceless. It includes things like applying 
lessons learned, reducing disaster response costs, and, importantly, 
speeding up recovery--things outside Washington called common sense and 
applying it to how we handle disasters. It pivots from being reactive 
and spending billions of dollars after disasters to being proactive.
  You can look back since 1980. We have had well over 200 disasters in 
this Nation that have cost over $1 billion each. In fact, when you add 
it all up, we are looking at approximately $1.3 trillion in disaster 
costs in this Nation.
  As the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee 
said, this bill includes text from H.R. 4460 and H.R. 4438 that 
transforms this process: instead of just coming in and picking up the 
pieces after a disaster, actually leaning forward and making sure our 
communities are more resilient, making sure they are prepared for 
disasters, making sure they are prepared for the future.
  This bill includes very important provisions to the State of 
Louisiana that address this duplication of benefits issue, some 
nonsensical policy that someone came up with that a loan is duplicative 
of a grant. It eliminates these barriers that prevent us from spending 
hazard mitigation grant programs on federally authorized Corps of 
Engineer projects to prevent flooding and prevent hurricane damage to 
our communities.
  It applies common sense. It ensures that deficiencies like the I-12 
barrier in Louisiana are addressed. It provides funding to respond to 
the 2016, 1,000-year flood that we had in the capital region in 
Louisiana.
  It provides flexibility for these STEP program housing program-type 
concepts that ensure that we are not wasting money that is only ripped 
out later on, but it truly provides long-term solutions.
  Finally, Mr. Speaker, it addresses inefficiency in food banks and 
churches and others, and it makes them eligible. I urge adoption of 
this bill.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta).
  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4667, 
which includes provisions of my bill, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act.
  In 2017, 8 percent of the United States population was affected by at 
least one disaster. This startling statistic highlights the importance 
of investing in mitigation infrastructure before tragedy strikes.
  Studies have repeatedly shown that, for every $1 invested up front, 
we can save between $4 and $8 in avoided recovery costs. My bill would 
allow us to realize those savings by transforming how we approach 
disaster spending.
  It would provide FEMA with the programs, authorities, and resources 
to help our communities plan for, mitigate against, respond to, and 
recover from disasters.
  Every one of our districts, Republicans and Democrats alike, will be 
impacted by disaster at some point. In 2011, my own district was 
devastated by flooding from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. 
People lost everything, and homes and businesses were completely wiped 
out.
  I visited with families and employers affected by this tragedy, and 
it made me realize that we need to do something to help communities 
build better and smarter before disaster strikes. My bill, the Disaster 
Recovery Reform Act, will do just that. It will save lives, lessen 
damage, and speed up recovery.
  I thank Chairman Shuster and my colleagues on the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee and the Senate for their work on this 
bipartisan and bicameral agreement.
  Again, I urge swift passage of H.R. 4667.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, my congratulations go out 
to Chairman Frelinghuysen and to Chairman Shuster for putting these 
FEMA reforms into law that were long overdue. I thank the gentlemen for 
their support.
  I rise in support of H.R. 4667, the critical disaster assistance 
legislation to help those affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and 
Maria this year.
  I have said on the floor of this House numerous times that I believe 
it is important for Congress to come together when disaster strikes to 
help those impacted. Helping our fellow Americans after a disaster is 
the right thing to do.
  And, don't forget, you never know when a disaster may hit your State. 
That is why I am thankful to Chairman Frelinghuysen and Chairman 
Shuster for including language important to my home State of Illinois 
in this bill. My bill, the Disaster Declaration Improvement Act, 
requires FEMA to place greater weight and consideration on the severe, 
localized impact of the damage following a disaster.

                              {time}  1530

  I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Cheri Bustos, for working 
with me on this bipartisan bill.
  FEMA currently takes into account several factors when determining 
the need for public and individual assistance. However, there is no 
standard to determine which factor is more important than another, 
which leads to a highly subjective process, and one that has left rural 
counties in very populated States, like Illinois, left without help 
from the Federal Government.
  It is because one major factor used by FEMA is a State's population. 
Currently, FEMA multiplies a State's population by $1.39 to use it for 
the threshold to determine need, meaning, for Illinois to receive 
assistance, damages would have to be $18 million or more.
  As you can see by this chart, that is more than or nearly double that 
of all

[[Page H10391]]

of our neighboring States. There have been multiple times where a storm 
hits both Illinois and our neighbors, but Illinois is the only one 
denied assistance.
  One of the most recent examples is, 2 years ago this Christmas, flood 
damage throughout 16 counties cost $15 million in damages. Missouri, 
who was also impacted by this same storm, received assistance, but 
Illinois did not.
  This is wrong. My constituents pay into the Disaster Relief Fund to 
help other States. It should be there when they need it.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters).
  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, California is 
experiencing the worst fire season in its history. Tragically, these 
fires have taken 46 lives, including one of our brave Cal Fire 
firefighters, Cory Iverson.
  California has lost nearly 10,000 homes and structures since the 
start of the October wildfires. The need for relief and assistance is 
immediate.
  Mr. Speaker, I support the swift passage of the Emergency Disaster 
Aid Package, which includes legislation I introduced, the California 
Wildfire Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2017.
  These specific provisions will allow victims to deduct property 
damages and access retirement funds without penalty, as well as 
encourage charitable giving.
  Passage of this bill will help mitigate the burden of these 
devastating wildfires and allow people to begin rebuilding their lives.
  Mr. Speaker, California faces a long road to recovery and rebuild 
from this devastating fire season. I urge my colleagues to aid in that 
recovery by voting for the Emergency Disaster Aid Package.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for 
yielding time to me and for his tremendous bill. It is a great 
bipartisan piece of legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, after Superstorm Sandy, I and others saw how leaders and 
volunteers of churches, synagogues, and other religious centers helped 
feed, clothe, and shelter tens of thousands of victims, yet they were 
left out and left behind when it came to repairs of their own 
facilities.
  The FEMA policy was and is unfair, unjustified, and discriminatory. 
Over 4 years ago, the House came together in the wake of Superstorm 
Sandy and passed legislation that I authored by 354-72. Surprise, 
surprise, the Senate never acted, so the policy continues to this day.
  I want to thank the chairman for including a provision in this bill 
that will ensure that houses of worship, churches, and synagogues get 
the kind of help they need on an equal basis with other nonprofits. I 
also want to thank him for including language that will get rid of this 
misnamed duplication of benefits clause.
  Imagine this: men and women who are victimized by Superstorm Sandy or 
any other storm, they go to FEMA, they are advised to take out an SBA 
loan, then a little later in the recovery time, they are told that 
there is a HUD grant available, and they are precluded from getting 
that grant to even pay off the SBA loan.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. Rutherford).
  Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this 
emergency supplemental bill.
  This emergency funding provides much-needed and, frankly, overdue 
relief to my district in northeast Florida.
  In September, Hurricane Irma caused flooding that the city of 
Jacksonville had not seen in more than 150 years. Downtown was 
literally under water, power was out for many days, and homes and 
businesses were shuttered.
  In our more rural agricultural communities in Nassau County and St. 
Johns County, crops were wiped out, hurting our agriculture community 
for months, if not years to come.
  The city of Jacksonville recently projected that Hurricane Irma will 
cost the city $85 million.
  I would be remiss if I did not commend the quick Federal response, 
the leadership of our Governor, and the planning and coordination of 
local emergency management officials and first responders, who saved 
lives and made our community safe and quickly back up and running.
  But the Federal support in this bill provides the next phase in 
emergency response that we so desperately need.
  I would like to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and his committee and 
committee staff for their work to get this bill over the line. I urge 
my colleagues in the strongest way possible to support this bill.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader.
  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to 
me and for his work.
  Mr. Speaker, it is only 4 days until Christmas. I look forward to 
going home and being with my family. I know every single Member in this 
body looks forward to that, too. I count my blessings that my family is 
safe and that I have a community and home to head back to.
  There are people in this country who don't have that. Their homes 
were destroyed by wind, flood, and fires. Their communities were torn 
apart by hurricanes and flames.
  Mr. Speaker, I had the somber privilege of traveling to these places. 
I went to Texas and spent time with Members from both sides of the 
aisle, seeing the flooded homes and streets filled with water. We 
visited NRG Stadium to meet the people forced to evacuate their homes.
  I stood with Representatives like Sheila Jackson Lee, Al Green, Randy 
Weber, and Brian Babin. These folks don't often agree on much in 
politics. But you know what we did that day? We all promised to help 
the people of Texas.
  I flew to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with Minority Whip Steny 
Hoyer, and I would like to thank Delegate Stacey Plaskett and Resident 
Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon for welcoming us and opening the 
eyes of the Nation to what was happening.
  In the Virgin Islands, we visited a hospital. The storm left half of 
it unusable. No dialysis machines. They had to come to the mainland. 
Nurses and doctors were working, doing the best they could to help 
people in the most difficult of circumstances.
  In Puerto Rico, we were the first congressional delegation to visit 
the interior after the storm. We were with Members like Jeff Denham, 
Anthony Brown, and Norma Torres. We met people without power for weeks, 
low on food, low on medicine. We saw schools and homes destroyed and 
completely washed away.
  We then went to Florida to see the other towns hit by Hurricane Irma, 
places that face storms year after year.
  I returned to my home State of California with Congressmen Mike 
Thompson and Jared Huffman during the worst wildfire season our State 
has ever seen. We saw the fires rage up north, where it destroyed 
entire communities. Forty-six people have lost their lives in the fires 
in California this year.
  You could see the devastation, block after block. Ash heaps of homes 
and trees, standing like barren pillars.
  I met with firefighters down south, still battling what may become 
the largest wildfire in California's history. As it looks right now, 
they will still be standing on the front lines of those fires come 
Christmas day.
  Every single place I went, Democrats and Republicans stood together. 
We saw the devastation together. We spoke to the suffering that the 
people were having together, and together we made a promise that we 
would return here to Washington and work hand-in-hand to help them as 
soon as possible.
  That is why you heard Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, on September 26, say 
that he would ``work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
ensure Congress provides all funding necessary to ensure that all 
Americans affected by these storms can recover and rebuild.''
  That is why he said on November 2 that he believes ``we can work 
together in a bipartisan way to ensure that the affected areas receive 
the resources they need from Congress.''

[[Page H10392]]

  That is why I appreciated joining him in an op-ed piece that was in 
The Washington Post on November 8, where we wrote: ``We are determined 
to ensure that there is strong bipartisan support for the next 
supplemental emergency funding package so that affected areas, such as 
those we visited, have the resources they need.''
  Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke similarly. She signed a letter 
with Members across California saying to President Trump that: We look 
forward to working with you to ensure that all Americans who have been 
severely impacted by recent natural disasters across the United States 
receive the Federal support they need and deserve.
  She told the Appropriations Committee that: Congress has an urgent 
responsibility to the California families, whose lives have been 
upended by disastrous wildfires.
  I couldn't agree more with these statements. In the past few weeks 
and months, we did--we worked together. We analyzed the damage. We 
studied the requests from Governors and legislators. We even made 
significant reforms to respond to disaster in the most effective and 
responsible way possible.
  The legislation today is the result. It provides funding for every 
single State and territory affected by natural disasters.
  I remind all my friends from California that this legislation 
accommodates exactly what our entire delegation requested.
  In all this work, we did it together in a bipartisan way; the way the 
American people expect this body to work.
  Now, I know it is the habit of this town to play politics. Mr. 
Speaker, I do want to tell my friends on the other side: If they feel 
like they have to, play politics on tax cuts. Call it whatever you want 
to call it. Play politics on all the other legislation that comes to 
this floor.
  But if I can request one thing: Please don't do it here. Don't play 
politics on a vote to give aid to the people of Texas; to the people of 
Puerto Rico; to the people of the Virgin Islands; to the people of 
Florida, and to the people of California, who are still fighting the 
fires.
  Don't play politics on a bill that you are going to hope to maybe 
stop another. That would be the worst of any politics I have seen 
played here.
  Mr. Speaker, I beg my friends on the other side: Please don't do what 
they did 2 weeks ago when they whipped against the funding bill to shut 
the government down. If they don't like tax cuts, I understand; 
vot against them. If they don't want to vote for the funding of the 
government and they want to shut it down, fine, take that vote.

  But here and now, right before Christmas, don't vote against aid for 
Americans who just lost everything. They don't understand the politics 
in it. Don't vote against aid we promised to deliver. Don't vote 
against aid we worked so hard together to put on this floor.
  Washington, D.C., can be far from our homes. We may all be dreaming 
of being home with our kids, eating Christmas dinner, opening presents, 
and enjoying time with our family and friends; but what we do here and 
now has consequences. What we do here and now will either give tens of 
thousands of people something to hope for this Christmas, or take that 
hope away.
  We can deliver that hope if those who stood with me on the flood 
plains of Texas and on the burnt hills of California keep the promise 
they made. We can deliver that hope if those who worked with us for so 
long continue to work with us today.
  People need our help. Vote to give them the help they need, the help 
we all promised.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their 
remarks to the Chair.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).
  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time 
to me.
  Mr. Speaker, at this moment I would like to speak on behalf of the 
people who I represent, the people of the Virgin Islands.
  I am thankful that this House has decided that they wanted to work in 
a bipartisan manner on supplemental aid for the unprecedented disasters 
that have occurred in the Virgin Islands.
  I did hear the voice of so many of my colleagues who said that they 
would be willing to do whatever was necessary to support the people of 
the Virgin Islands.
  But right now, as I stand here, people of the Virgin Islands, almost 
60 percent of them, still do not have power.

                              {time}  1545

  I have no power in my own home, and those of you in Florida, Texas, 
and in other places would not stand for that. But you expect us to 
stand for it. We are supposed to muddle through.
  We are only supposed to have hope this Christmas of what is supposed 
to come?
  Mr. Speaker, you can have hope at your Christmas dinner because you 
have got some lights on. My house I will go empty to, it will be cold, 
and it will be dark there until my husband and I crank up the generator 
and get it going for a couple of hours so that maybe we can wash, cook 
some food, and turn it back off again later in the day.
  Today, I am urging my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 4667, not 
because I don't want supplemental support, not because the people of 
the Virgin Islands don't need it, but because I understand that I have 
said, when this measure was unveiled, that the funding in this bill is 
woefully insufficient, and it has not improved since that time.
  This measure provides only $81 billion to be split between Texas, 
Florida, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and other places. If history 
is any indication, that money is not going to get to the people of the 
Virgin Islands, because while the California delegation and the Texas 
delegation can lobby in late hours to get what they need in the bill, I 
am the only person from the Virgin Islands here to support the people 
of the Virgin Islands. Not only do I not get invited to those 
negotiations, I don't even have a vote when the bill that comes to 
providing for the people that I represent comes on this floor.
  One of the things that is noticeably absent from this disaster 
package is funding for Medicaid programs, the same type of funding that 
was put in, in discussions for Katrina, for the people of Texas and 
Louisiana.
  The government of the Virgin Islands cannot shoulder the current 
burden of the local matching requirements for Medicaid funding which 
the government of the Virgin Islands has recently submitted to be $64 
million and an additional $50 million. The government of the Virgin 
Islands has respectfully requested that the Medicaid provisions, that 
the cap be removed, the arbitrary cap be removed for us for a period of 
time for us to be stabilized and for 100 percent the same way it was 
for Katrina in other places be given to us.
  Now, the people of the Virgin Islands and the people of Puerto Rico--
I know it may be news to many people--but we are U.S. citizens. We 
decide to live on an island because that is where we were brought.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands.
  Ms. PLASKETT. Because of that, we have been treated 
disproportionately and unfairly in the ways that some of this funding 
has come about.
  In addition, the bill does not include important local cost-share 
waivers for the Virgin Islands and contains unnecessary limitations on 
the ability of the Virgin Islands to use Federal assistance to rebuild 
with more resilience.
  Furthermore, the Virgin Islands cannot wait for the community 
development funds provided in this bill. HUD should immediately award 
community development funds to the Virgin Islands on the damage 
assessments that have been completed.
  Those are things that I can get around. Those are real support in a 
real bill that is really working in a bipartisan way to help all 
Americans--not just delegations who can get together in the dark of the 
night and in the cold of the night and make provisions for themselves 
leaving those of us. I have told my colleagues on this side of the 
aisle that they are going to pick off Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands, we are going to be left out.
  Some of you are going to get what you want, and you are going to vote 
for

[[Page H10393]]

this. Once again, the people who have no vote on this floor, the people 
who have no say in this country, although they are U.S. citizens, are 
going to be left out.
  Mr. Speaker, I am urging all of my colleagues to vote ``no.''
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to close.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to reiterate that the bill before us is 
insufficient to meet the needs of those living in Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands. Months after hurricanes devastated the islands, 
hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans have died, and far too many 
people are living without basic necessities that all Americans should 
have.
  I include in the Record a letter from Puerto Rico's Resident 
Commissioner, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, which requests Medicaid 
assistance and 100 percent Federal costs for FEMA and Army Corps 
projects which are not included in the bill.

                                    Congress of the United States,


                                     House of Representatives,

                                Washington, DC, December 20, 2017.
     Hon. Thad Cochran,
     Chairman, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, 
         DC.
     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,
     Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, 
         Washington, DC.
     Hon. Rodney Frelinghuysen,
     Chairman, Appropriations Committee, House of Representatives, 
         Washington, DC.
     Hon. Nita M. Lowey,
     Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, House of 
         Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairmen Cochran and Frelinghuysen and Ranking Members 
     Leahy and Lowey: I write to draw your attention to several 
     disaster supplemental appropriations matters that are 
     important to Puerto Rico's recovery from the catastrophic 
     damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The revisions I 
     propose to the disaster supplemental legislation that 
     Congress is currently considering are necessary for 
     rebuilding the lives of the 3.4 million U.S. citizens who 
     live on the island.
       Regarding any federal funding for Medicaid in Puerto Rico, 
     it is imperative that disaster supplemental legislation 
     provide that for not less than two years Puerto Rico will 
     receive 100% federal funding (FMAP). This funding is 
     necessary because there is no question about Puerto Rico's 
     looming Medicaid crisis: within the first months of 2018, 
     absent emergency funding, Puerto Rico's Medicaid program will 
     exhaust its current funds and the island's Medicaid system 
     will collapse, which will bring to a halt Puerto Rico's 
     entire healthcare system.
       The disaster supplemental legislation must be revised so to 
     statutorily waive for two years Puerto Rico's state cost 
     share for FEMA Public Assistance. Moreover, the disaster 
     supplemental legislation must be revised so to include a two 
     year waiver of the cost-sharing requirements for all Army 
     Corps of Engineers projects in Puerto Rico.
       As you know, the recent hurricanes have destroyed Puerto 
     Rico. The lives of millions of U.S. citizens are now in the 
     federal government's hands. I look forward to continuing to 
     work with you to move forward the proposals I have outlined 
     in this letter. Together we can rebuild Puerto Rico better 
     than ever and make the island anew. At this moment, the 
     federal government has an opportunity to demonstrate 
     America's commitment to all its citizens, including those who 
     reside in Puerto Rico.
           Sincerely,
                                         Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon,
                                  Member of Congress, PR-At Large.

  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill--put together after eight public hearings, 
input from all Governors, all Members of Congress, and all Delegates, 
especially those who represent Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, 
the Virgin Islands, and California--represents a fair and a 
compassionate treatment of all hurricane and fire victims.
  Like the first two emergency supplementals put together by our 
leadership, our committee, and Congress, we acted within days to help. 
I ask that we do it again this afternoon without delay. Get this $81 
billion disaster package into the hands of the States, the territories, 
and the communities that continue to suffer.
  Let me associate myself with the remarks of our majority leader. 
Let's get the money into those communities that have been suffering. 
That money is going to the Virgin Islands, it is going to Puerto Rico, 
and it is going to Florida, Texas, and California. There has been no 
discrimination at all.
  This bill has been put together with the cooperation of all the 
chairs and ranking members, and it deserves to be acted on promptly. 
People are suffering. Let's get the money out the door to help them as 
we have done in the past on the first two supplementals.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Division B of this 
bill, which has bipartisan, bicameral support of the leadership of the 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs of the Senate. It includes H.R. 4460, the ``Disaster Recovery 
Reform Act'', and several other Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) bills that passed the House earlier this year.
  While there are many good provisions in Division B, I will focus my 
comments on a few provisions that I believe will have the most impact 
in making the United States a leader in disaster recovery. Under 
Division B, the Nation will be on the right track to build stronger and 
more resilient communities and it will encourage better behavior before 
and after disaster strikes.
  We know that for every dollar invested in mitigation to make our 
communities stronger before disaster strikes, the taxpayer saves $3 to 
$4 in future disaster costs. Section 2036 of this bill furthers the 
goal of investing in mitigation before disaster strikes by establishing 
a steady funding stream for FEMA's Predisaster Mitigation (PDM) 
program.
  Under Section 2036, the President must provide a specific amount of 
additional funding from the Disaster Relief Fund for the PDM program. 
The specific amount of additional funding is equal to six percent of 
the estimated amount of disaster assistance provided for each major 
disaster. The President will then distribute these funds in accordance 
with existing law, with a certain amount provided to each State and the 
remainder made available through a competitive grant process.
  Section 2036 uses language similar to language in the Robert T. 
Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) 
authorizing FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), which is 
mandatory funding provided post-disaster with each disaster 
declaration. Although Section 2036 uses the term ``may'', the intent is 
that FEMA will set aside funds for the PDM program, just as they do for 
HMGP. We have had several bipartisan conversations with FEMA confirming 
that FEMA understands the intent of this section and will interpret the 
``may set-aside'' language included in section 2036 as mandatory. The 
mandatory funding for the PDM program from the Disaster Relief Fund 
required under this section will provide consistency to a program with 
a proven record of saving taxpayers money.
  In addition, section 2036 authorizes FEMA to withdraw and 
redistribute funds that remain unobligated three fiscal years after 
FEMA awarded the funds to the grantee. The intent of this provision is 
to provide FEMA with discretionary authority to move funding that is 
not being used to States and projects that will use it. However, FEMA 
is not required to withdraw these funds from grantees and shall make 
these decisions on a case-by-case basis. For instance, a grantee may 
have commenced work on a project or is actively working on a project 
but the project is not at the point where funds need to be obligated. 
In this instance, we would not expect FEMA to withdraw the funds.
  In addition, while this section will apply to PDM funds awarded prior 
to enactment of this Division, the intent is to give grantees three 
fiscal years from the date of enactment of this Act to obligate these 
funds. Grantees with existing PDM funds are now on notice that they 
have three years to obligate these funds or at least be actively 
working on projects that will allow those funds to be obligated shortly 
thereafter.
  I have noted time and time again how nonsensical it is that the 
Federal Government pays to rebuild communities after a disaster to 
inadequate standards only to have those facilities destroyed again by a 
later disaster, with the Federal Government once again on the hook for 
the cost of rebuilding. Under this legislation, this nonsense will 
finally stop. Section 2037 requires communities to rebuild to the 
latest consensus-based, design standards and in a more resilient 
manner, thereby ensuring stronger, smarter facilities going forward. 
The cycle of repeatedly rebuilding and repairing disaster-damaged 
public infrastructure will end under this measure.
  Although FEMA must define ``resilient'' and ``resiliency'' pursuant 
to regulations within two years of the date of enactment of this Act, 
FEMA is required to adopt guidance to immediately implement the 
``resiliency'' requirements of this legislation. The need for resilient 
construction has become even more apparent after the 2017 disaster 
season. FEMA must use this opportunity to invest taxpayer funds wisely 
while saving lives and reducing injuries. FEMA has the ability to 
ensure that the United

[[Page H10394]]

States leads the way in disaster recovery and I urge FEMA to seize this 
moment.
  Accordingly, as FEMA works to develop the definition of ``resilient'' 
and ``resiliency'', the agency needs to ensure that it takes into 
account the extent to which the improved facilities:
  reduce deaths and injuries during and after a major disaster;
  sustain minimal damage allowing the facility to continue to provide 
the primary function and services of the facility during and after a 
natural hazard;
  prepare for and withstand all hazards that could result in a major 
disaster; and
  reduce the magnitude or duration of a disruption to the facility's 
primary function and services to a facility.
  In addition, any ``resilient'' facility should be constructed:
  in consideration of current and future environmental conditions based 
upon the best-available science, changes in demand, and extreme weather 
events;
  to reduce potential disruptions to the facility, including by 
building in operational redundancies, and increasing the ability of the 
facility to recover more rapidly; using techniques and materials that 
have the absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and recoverability to 
withstand a potentially disruptive event;
  to the maximum extent practicable, using durable and sustainable 
material; and
  to incorporate, to the maximum extent practicable, natural and 
nature-based measures and energy efficiency improvements.
  Currently, FEMA provides HMGP funds when a State receives a disaster 
declaration, but HMGP funds are not provided when a State receives a 
Fire Management Assistance Grant to respond to wildfires on non-Federal 
lands. Unfortunately, wildfires destroy the landscape often causing 
mudslides and flooding that then result in a disaster declaration. 
Under Division B, States will receive HMGP funds if they have received 
Fire Management Assistance Grants to respond to wildfires. With HMGP 
funds, States will be able to restore landscapes and vegetation 
destroyed by wildfires and make the land less susceptible to future 
mudslides and floods. This legislation also clarifies that wildfire-
related mitigation activities are eligible under both the PDM and HMGP 
programs. Together, these provisions will help prevent wildfires and 
related disasters and I commend our colleague from California (Mr. 
Ruiz) for his leadership on these issues.
  Division B also clarifies that earthquake-related activities are 
eligible for mitigation assistance. The West Coast faces the most risk 
from multiple and extreme earthquakes, and Oregon is long overdue for 
an earthquake and tsunami on the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Yet, the 
United States' earthquake early warning system lags behind those of 
other nations. Clarifying for grantees that mitigation funds are 
available for earthquake-related activities will save lives and reduce 
injuries in a future disaster.
  Finally, important to the State of Oregon, section 2029 clarifies 
that for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), FEMA 
is not responsible for privately funded actions taken by private 
parties on private land. Under actions proposed by the National Marine 
Fisheries Service, the entire State of Oregon would become a critical 
habitat, seriously impeding economic development. The proposed 
requirements, are so onerous, the State of Oregon, which already has 
strict land use regulations, would have difficulty implementing them, 
as they violate federal and state property rights. This provision will 
help ensure that FEMA implements the NFIP in a manner that is 
consistent from state-to-state and does not become a land use 
regulatory agency.
  I support all of these important provisions and urge their adoption.
