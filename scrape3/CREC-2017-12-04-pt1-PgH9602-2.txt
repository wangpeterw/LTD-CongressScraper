  EXPRESSING GRATITUDE TO THE MEN AND WOMEN IN FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I serve on the House Judiciary 
Committee and serve as the ranking member on the Crime, Terrorism, 
Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee, which means that I 
deal with every single Federal law enforcement entity across the 
Nation.
  I am disappointed and I am outraged by the language from the 
Commander in Chief to suggest that the FBI is in tatters. We have 
agreements and disagreements with the chief law enforcement agency, but 
these men and women protecting us in this Nation, but also against 
domestic terrorism and even beyond, are called around the Nation to 
investigate heinous crimes. Their expertise is respected.
  I remember when there was a child molester in my community. I worked 
with local police, but I insisted that the FBI get involved. They were 
willing to do so even though it was not a matter across State lines. 
Their very presence made a difference.
  I think we owe them a better response, and I certainly think the 
Commander in Chief has a responsibility to do a better job.
  I also believe that we have got to pass CHIP because thousands of 
children need healthcare. It is important for us to do our job.
