     FRED D. THOMPSON FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Ferguson). The unfinished business is 
the question on suspending the rules and passing the bill (H.R. 375) to 
designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 
719 Church Street in Nashville, Tennessee, as the ``Fred D. Thompson 
Federal Building and United States Courthouse''.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
