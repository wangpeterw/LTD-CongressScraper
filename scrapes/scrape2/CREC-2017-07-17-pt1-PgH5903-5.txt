                      CONGRATULATING JAMES HAUTMAN

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate James Hautman 
of Chaska, Minnesota, who recently won the Federal Duck Stamp Contest 
for the fifth time. This year, James' design depicts three geese flying 
at sunset.
  Since 1934, sales of the Federal Duck Stamp have raised more than 
$950 million for the conservation of wetlands and national wildlife 
refuges all over our country. The money raised helps to preserve the 
habitat of hundreds of species, as well as provide clean water for many 
communities throughout the Nation.
  Last fall, a panel of five judges selected James' submission out of 
152 total entries, marking the fifth time that he has won the 
competition. Only two other artists, Mr. Speaker, have ever won the 
Federal Duck Stamp Contest five times, including James' own brother 
Joseph.
  Mr. Speaker, I once again extend my sincere congratulations to James 
Hautman. Minnesotans are proud to see such a gifted artist from our 
home State get recognized and use his talents for such a great cause. 
We wish him the best in his future.
