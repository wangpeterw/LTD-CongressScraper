                      TRUMPCARE, BUT AT WHAT COST?

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, Senate Republicans have negotiated their 
TrumpCare bill in the dark, and that is just where it should have 
stayed. And just wait until the CBO score comes out next week.
  Knowing that this bill will cause immeasurable harm to millions of 
American families who will lose their coverage and protections while 
facing higher costs, I do not understand how anyone could support it.
  We constantly hear from our Republican colleagues that TrumpCare 
keeps their promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act. So you keep that 
misguided promise, but at what cost?
  We are talking about the lives of real people, millions of real 
people. Aren't they worth more than just a tax cut for the rich?
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to scrap this disastrous 
bill. Let's work together to improve the Affordable Care Act and not 
destroy it.
