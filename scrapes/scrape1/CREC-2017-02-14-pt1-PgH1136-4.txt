                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Our fervent 
prayer, O God, is that people will learn to live together in 
reconciliation and respect, so that the terrors of war, and of 
dictatorial abuse, will be no more.
  Guide our hearts and minds, that every person of every place and 
background might focus on Your great gift of life, and so learn to live 
in unity.
  May Your special blessings be upon the Members of this assembly in 
the important, sometimes difficult, work they do. Give them wisdom and 
charity, that they might work together for the common good.
  May all that is done this day in the people's House be for Your 
greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
