                          WHERE IS THE HEARING

  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, in the wake of troubling events 
in the Trump White House, I have one simple question: Where is the 
hearing?
  In less than a month, we have watched the credibility and security of 
our democracy endangered by a descent into scandal, distrust, and an 
authoritative environment. What are we going to do about it?
  I serve as the top Democrat on the Oversight and Government Reform 
Committee's IT subcommittee, yet I have heard nothing about a hearing 
to investigate Russia's cyber attacks on our elections. Where is the 
hearing?
  Officials are hawking the First Daughter's private clothing line from 
the White House. Where is the hearing?
  I sit on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and we have not had a 
discussion on Russia's potential blackmailing of our President or 
former NSA Director Flynn. Where is the hearing?
  The President's tweets show an utter lack of respect for our free 
press and independent judicial system, hallmarks of our democracy. 
Where are the hearings?
  Russia, election hacking, unconstitutional Muslim bans, gag orders on 
public servants, unfinished and unfiled ethics paperwork, politically 
motivated witch hunts against scientists and reporters, blackmail from 
a foreign government, and the list goes on and on. All of these deserve 
answers so, once again, I ask, where is the hearing?
  The people of Illinois and the American people deserve to know. They 
deserve a hearing.
