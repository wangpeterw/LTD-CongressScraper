                      IN MEMORY OF DEPUTY LOCKLEAR

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Scotland 
County, North Carolina, Deputy Alexis ``Thunder Eagle'' Locklear, who 
was killed in the line of duty last Thursday while rushing to the aid 
of a fellow officer.
  Deputy Locklear was just 23 years old and had only been on the force 
for 10 months, yet those who knew him best said he died doing what he 
loved.
  My friend, Scotland County Sheriff Ralph Kersey, said that Deputy 
Locklear made friends everywhere he went. Sheriff Kersey said: ``He 
wanted to be a law enforcement officer, and he chose the Scotland 
County Sheriff's Office. It did not take a long time spending with 
Thunder to know that he would fit right in with this family.''
  Deputy Locklear leaves behind a 4-year-old daughter as well as his 
parents, grandparents, and six sisters.
  Last week, Scotland County lost a hero, but a hero remembered never 
dies in our hearts. Please join me in offering condolences to the 
Locklear family, Sheriff Kersey, and the Scotland County Sheriff's 
Office.
