                    SUPPORT CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Championing 
Healthy Kids Act.
  For years, programs such as CHIP and community health centers have 
been lifelines to underserved, especially rural communities: 9 million 
children rely on CHIP for health coverage; 25 million patients use 
community health centers; and 750 residency spots were created by 
teaching health centers to combat doctor shortages.
  Yet, despite months of assurances to work together, Democrats 
continue to stall the reauthorization. It is not unreasonable to ask 
Medicare recipients making over $500,000 to pay a little extra in 
premiums or to roll back lengthy enrollment periods so people can't 
game the system. It is certainly not unreasonable to ask lottery 
winners who hit the jackpot to forego Medicaid coverage.
  We can't afford any more delay. These programs are supported time 
after time in a bipartisan fashion. This bill is worthy of that same 
support. I urge my colleagues to come together to get this bill done 
this week.
