                             MEDICARE FRAUD

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed light on the issue 
of fraud and abuse in the Medicare program.
  Medicare is absolutely critical for seniors in my district and across 
the country. Not only is Medicare fraud an affront to hardworking 
taxpayers, it hurts the millions of seniors who rely on the program.
  Last week, the HHS inspector general announced the largest healthcare 
fraud takedown in history: 412 defendants were charged nationwide, 
including more than 80 cases in Florida, for Medicare fraud totaling 
about $1.3 billion in losses. That is why I introduced much-needed 
legislation to strengthen penalties against those who commit fraud in 
the Medicare program.
  The Medicare Civil and Criminal Penalties Update Act, H.R. 3245, 
cracks down on Medicare fraud and abuse by increasing civil and 
criminal fines. We must ensure the Medicare program is strong and 
sustainable for today's and tomorrow's beneficiaries.
