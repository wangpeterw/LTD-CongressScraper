 OBJECTING TO POLICY OF COLLECTING SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT INFORMATION OF 
                          NATURALIZED CITIZENS

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and prayers also go to 
the victims of the Las Vegas shooting.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to address another subject that, unfortunately, 
came up last week.
  Mr. Speaker, as one of ten naturalized United States citizens in 
Congress, I rise today to express strong objections to the Department 
of Homeland Security's new policy to collect the social media account 
information of naturalized citizens.
  In accordance with this new rule, the DHS will include social media 
alongside basic information, such as biometrics, Social Security 
numbers, and contact information in naturalization records. This is 
unprecedented.
  There is no evidence that tracking social media accounts of 
naturalized citizens will in any way make the United States more 
secure.
  Rather than target naturalized citizens, the President should work 
with Congress to reform our immigration system and ensure that all 
Americans, natural born or naturalized, are able to work, study, and 
pursue the American Dream.
