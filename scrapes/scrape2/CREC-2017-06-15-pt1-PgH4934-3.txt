                  SUPPORTING STATEHOOD OF PUERTO RICO

  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Alaska (Mr. Young) for 
his leadership on this effort, a Representative on the most recent 
State.
  I didn't want to take all of his time.
  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Will the gentleman yield?
  Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman from Alaska.
  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from 
Maryland, Steny Hoyer, for the support. It is going to take a lot of 
effort. There is a lot of naysayers out there. But, again, I believe so 
strongly that we treat every American equally.
  This is a civil rights issue, and they have voted 97 percent in favor 
of statehood. As you know, I led this battle with your help in 1997. We 
had a vote, and, with your side, I won by one vote. Puerto Rico and 
Alaska didn't go anywhere, but I ask every American to think about it.
  Let's make this the last colony. Let's make this the 51st State.
