                    UNDOING JOB-KILLING REGULATIONS

  (Mr. PEARCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, many times, people ask me: Just what is it 
about regulations that kills jobs? That is what we are involved in this 
week is undoing some of those regulations. I will be introducing one 
today to unwind a regulation that the BLM recently put into place.
  What happened is, over a year ago, for the first time in 40 years, we 
allowed Americans to export oil. We are diminishing the trade 
deficits--that is, we are making our economy stronger--by shipping to 
South American countries and to countries all over the world. It is 
good for American jobs. Then the BLM comes in and puts in its onshore 
oil and gas order No. 3 rule, which will make it more difficult for us 
to produce oil off of public lands. It simply shouldn't be there.
  We are introducing legislation today that will reject that as a 
bureaucratic entanglement of job creation in the country. That is as 
simple as we could be. We look forward to the support of the Members of 
the House.
