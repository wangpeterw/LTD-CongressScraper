                     GOVERNMENT FUNDING LEGISLATION

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I wish to respond to the 
President's latest tweets about the bipartisan, bicameral deal we just 
reached to fund the government through September.
  Members of both parties worked very hard to come to this agreement. 
There was a real spirit of cooperation. I thank Majority Leader 
McConnell and Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi, as well as Senators 
Cochran and Leahy and Congress Members Frelinghuysen and Lowey, all who 
worked together often until the wee hours of the morning to make this 
happen. We all spent a lot of time working on it, and I think we got a 
very good outcome. So when the President threw cold water on this deal 
and actually recommended a government shutdown, I was deeply 
disappointed. Here we saw Democrats and Republicans working together in 
the best traditions of the Senate, and the President disparages it in a 
way that is destructive, essentially saying: Let's have a shutdown.
  The President has been complaining about the lack of bipartisanship 
in Washington. Well, this deal is exactly how Washington should work 
when it is bipartisan. Both parties negotiated and came to an agreement 
on a piece of legislation we each can support. It is truly a shame that 
the President is degrading it because he didn't get 100 percent of what 
he wanted. Bipartisanship is best summed up by the Rolling Stones: You 
can't always get what you want--or at least everything you want.
