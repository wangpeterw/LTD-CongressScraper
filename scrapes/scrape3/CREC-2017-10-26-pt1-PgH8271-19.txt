            By Mrs. LAWRENCE:
        H.R. 4155.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
        Article I, Section 5, clause 2 provides that each house of 
     Congress ``may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.''
        Fourteenth Amendment, Section 5 provides Congress the 
     power ``to enforce'' the substantive guarantees of the 
     amendment, including the Due Process and Equal Protection 
     Clauses, by enacting ``appropriate legislation.'' The Supreme 
     Court has recognized that, under Section 5, Congress may both 
     proscribe unconstitutional conduct, as well as enact 
     legislation that remedies and deters violations of rights 
     guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment.
