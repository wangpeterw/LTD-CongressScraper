                        SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on Special Prosecutor Mueller, I want to 
take a moment to praise my friend from Virginia, Senator Mark Warner, 
vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, for his speech 
yesterday about Special Counsel Mueller. It was an eloquent speech. I 
would like to associate myself with the substance of his fine remarks. 
If the President were to fire Special Counsel Mueller, our country 
would face a constitutional crisis. As my colleague from Virginia said, 
it would cross a redline. Additionally, there are steps below that 
brash and brazen act that would also cross redlines here in Congress, 
as Senator Warner noted, including the use of the Presidential pardon 
on members of the Trump campaign who have been convicted, whether those 
pardons are intended to subvert the investigation or prevent testimony 
and further cooperation.
  So I say to my colleagues, just as firing Special Prosecutor Mueller 
would cross a redline, so would pardoning people like Manafort and 
Flynn. The bottom line is this: President Trump must allow this 
investigation to proceed without a scintilla of interference. He would 
be wise to listen to Senator Warner's speech yesterday and act 
accordingly.
