           CONGRATULATING ACCUWEATHER ON ITS 55TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate AccuWeather as it celebrates 55 years of serving 
communities, businesses, and institutions around the world.
  In 1962, Dr. Joel Myers founded AccuWeather to help people plan their 
lives, protect their businesses, and to make the most of their days.
  Dr. Myers has led an impressive career as a fellow of the National 
Meteorological Society and one of the top entrepreneurs in American 
history. Today, AccuWeather is the world's largest weather and digital 
media company, reaching nearly 2 billion people at least 29 million 
times each day. Proudly, it is headquartered right in State College, 
Pennsylvania.
  Throughout the years, the company has expanded its offices to New 
York, Montreal, and Tokyo, just to name a few, but it has always called 
Pennsylvania home, and it has been a major employer for decades in the 
Commonwealth.
  Over 55 years, AccuWeather continues to build upon its main mission: 
to improve people's lives.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate AccuWeather on 55 years of service, 
accuracy, trust, and protection they have offered to people around the 
world.
