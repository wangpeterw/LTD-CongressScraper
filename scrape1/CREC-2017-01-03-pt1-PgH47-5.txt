           By Mr. MASSIE:
       H.R. 34.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       This Act is justified by the lack of a mandate or assertion 
     of authority in the United States Constitution for the 
     federal government to establish the laws affected by this 
     Act; by Article One of the United States Constitution that 
     grants legislative powers; by the Second Amendment to the 
     United States Constitution that recognizes the right to bear 
     arms, and by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the United 
     States Constitution, which recognize that rights and powers 
     are retained and reserved by the people and to the States.
