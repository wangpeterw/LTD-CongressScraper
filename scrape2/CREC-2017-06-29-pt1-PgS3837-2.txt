                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, source of all goodness, use our lawmakers today for 
Your glory. Make them undaunted people who strive to know Your will and 
experience Your power. Provide them with exactly what they need to 
accomplish Your purposes. May they receive Heaven's approbation for 
their faithful service to You and country. Lord, transform their 
intractable problems with solutions from Your throne. We commit the 
work of this day to You, receiving Your strength to honor Your Name.
  And, Lord, we thank You for the faithfulness of our summer pages. 
Bless these young people as they prepare to leave us.
  We pray in Your generous Name. Amen.
