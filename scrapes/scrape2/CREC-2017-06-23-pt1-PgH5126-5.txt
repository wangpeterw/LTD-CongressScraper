     SENATE REPUBLICANS SHUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OUT OF AFFORDABLE 
                               HEALTHCARE

  (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
recently unveiled Senate healthcare repeal legislation. The Republicans 
have shut the American public out of their debate and, with this bill, 
they aim to shut them out of affordable healthcare, too.
  This bill sets us on a dangerous path backwards, back to a time when 
cancer patients could be kept out of coverage or kicked off of their 
insurance because the cost of their care was too high, and to a time 
where pregnancy could be considered a preexisting condition.
  Congress must work collaboratively to bring down insurance premium 
costs and work together toward insuring every American, but denying 
millions of people access to insurance by repealing protections for 
individuals with preexisting conditions, gutting Medicaid, and 
threatening the solvency of

the Medicare trust fund all in order to give the wealthiest Americans a 
tax cut is wrong.
  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reject this misguided proposal.
