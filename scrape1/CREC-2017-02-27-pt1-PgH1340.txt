      MOMENT OF SILENCE IN REMEMBRANCE OF KANSAS SHOOTING VICTIMS

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight, heartbroken, with my friends 
and colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to honor the life and 
memory of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, who was shot and killed last week in my 
district, as well as in support for Alok Madasani, who was injured, and 
Ian Grillot, whose heroism prevented this senseless tragedy from being 
much worse.
  I ask that my colleagues in the Chamber please join me for a moment 
of silence.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Guests in the gallery and Members will 
please rise for a moment of silence.
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, the man who perpetrated the attack in my 
district last week was filled with hate. He does not represent anything 
we believe in as Kansans and as Americans. Last night, our community 
sent the strong message that love will overcome hate.
  Thousands of concerned citizens in my district came together to 
support one another and our growing and vibrant Indian community in 
this time of great tragedy. We showed the world that our diverse 
political and religious views are what make our community and our 
country great.
  Mr. Speaker, in addition to this moment of silence, let us renew our 
commitment to treating each other with respect and embracing civility 
in our public discourse.
