             UNION COUNTY FREEHOLDER VERNELL WRIGHT RETIRES

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a public servant from my 
district in Union County, New Jersey, Freeholder Vernell Wright, on the 
occasion of her retirement.
  Freeholder Wright began her career in public service in 1966 as a 
title 1 teacher at Jefferson School in Union Township, New Jersey. For 
36 years, she helped educate the county's public schoolchildren.
  In 2012, the people of Union Township sent their beloved educator to 
represent them on the Union County Board of Chosen Freeholders.
  Freeholder Wright's legacy as an elected official is best 
characterized by her unselfish devotion to the constituents whom she 
represents. As recognition for her dedicated work and selfless service, 
she has been awarded New Jersey's Freeholder of the Year Award and 
Union County's Chester Holmes Humanitarian Award.
  Freeholder Wright is a model for the next generation of public 
servants.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me and the people back in 
Union County tonight at a dinner to honor Freeholder Wright's lifetime 
of service. I am honored to be her Member of Congress.
  God bless Freeholder Wright.
