                   HONORING THE LIFE OF GARRETT PAIZ

  (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of a local hero, 
Garrett Paiz, a Mecca native and firefighter, killed in the line of 
duty while fighting fires in northern California on October 16 at the 
age of 38.
  I grew up with Garrett's family. Garrett embodied the best values of 
service and sacrifice. He put others above self, willing to rush toward 
danger when others ran from it. He traveled to northern California with 
firefighters from around the country to battle the deadly fires 
threatening so many homes and families. Being a firefighter was his 
lifelong dream.
  He was humble, hardworking, and devoted to his family, and he was 
always smiling and laughing. Garrett had an adventurous nature and kind 
heart. He was always willing to do whatever was needed to take care of 
others.
  I join my wife, Monica, and the entire 36th Congressional District to 
mourn this heartbreaking loss and honor Garrett's legacy.
  To his wife, Bobbie; daughter, Terri Ann; parents, Judi and Armando; 
brother, Carlos; and sister, Cinthia; and the rest of the extended Paiz 
family, we support you, and we honor Garrett's dedication to selfless 
service. His life and sacrifice will never be forgotten.
