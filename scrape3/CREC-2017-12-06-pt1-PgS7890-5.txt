                     TRIBUTE TO GEORGE NINCEHELSER

   Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I recognize George 
Nincehelser, an intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all the hard 
work he has done on behalf of myself, my staff, and the State of South 
Dakota.
  George recently graduated from the University of Nebraska where he 
majored in criminal justice and received minors in Arabic, national 
security, and global studies. He is a dedicated and diligent worker who 
has been devoted to getting the most out of his internship experience 
and who has been a true asset to the office.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to George for all of the 
fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the years to 
come.
