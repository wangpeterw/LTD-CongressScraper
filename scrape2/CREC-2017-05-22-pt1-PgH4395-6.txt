                 PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST OVERSEAS VISIT

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, President Donald Trump 
gave a remarkable speech yesterday during his first overseas visit. 
Speaking to over 50 representatives from Muslim nations, the President 
outlined the future for positive relations between the United States 
and predominantly Muslim nations around the world.
  The President's remarks in Saudi Arabia were extraordinary. I was 
especially grateful to hear his call for unity of all people and all 
regional faiths--Islam, Christianity, and Judaism--as well as a strong 
condemnation of Islamic extremism and terrorism.
  President Trump remarked: ``We pray this special gathering may 
someday be remembered as the beginning of peace in the Middle East--and 
maybe, even all over the world. But this future can only be achieved 
through defeating terrorism and the ideology that drives it.'' The 
President also cited 95 percent of victims of terrorism are Muslim.
  I appreciate the warm welcome the President received in Saudi Arabia 
as he promotes peace through strength.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  Our sympathy to the family of Navy Captain Ken Clark of Swansea, 
South Carolina, a Naval Academy graduate of great service.
