                          HONORING SARA WOODS

  (Mr. BACON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I 
recognize a dedicated public servant from Nebraska. Sara Woods' 
contributions to our community as an educator, volunteer, and leader 
serve as a model for current and future generations across our Nation.
  Mrs. Woods has lived a life of service and inspiration impacting the 
community with her dedication. Throughout her educational career, she 
has encouraged her students to be engaged learners. Sara was crucial in 
the creation of many service organizations whose purpose is to equip, 
train, and encourage young leaders to serve their communities. She 
currently serves on the boards of several nonprofits in Omaha and works 
to improve conditions for youth, women, and the homeless.
  In recognition of her service, she received the University of 
Nebraska Omaha Chancellor's Award in 2005 and the YWCA Women of 
Distinction award in 2009.
  Sara now oversees the operation of the Barbara Weitz Community 
Engagement Center. She was involved in the creation and development of 
this institute, which works to combine great ideas and organizations 
with the boundless energy of the University of Nebraska Omaha campus.
  Mrs. Woods has helped cultivate the same passion for service in 
others and fostered stronger bonds within our community and beyond. We 
would do well to adopt her inspiring passion for public service.
