                        TRIBUTE TO AIDAN VERESS

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the honor of 
recognizing 14-year-old Aidan Veress for winning the Treasure State 
Spelling Bee for the second year in a row. Aidan is no stranger to 
success when it comes to spelling. He has competed in spelling bees 
since the second grade and has won the Park County Spelling Bee 3 years 
in a row.
  When asked about his preparation for success, Aidan talks about his 
love for reading. Beyond memorization of words, Aidan also studies 
pronunciation, the definitions, and even the rules for various 
languages. His advice for younger Montanans who wish to win spelling 
bees is this: Read often, study by yourself and with friends, properly 
enunciate, push yourself to grow your vocabulary, and stay calm.
  Aidan dreams of going to college 1 day and perhaps even working in a 
STEM field, but for right now, he is busy reading, hiking, camping, 
traveling, playing basketball and video games, and making Montana 
proud. This two-time State champ will represent Montana in the Scripps 
National Spelling Bee in Washington, DC, this May.
  Congratulations, Aidan, you make us Montana proud.
