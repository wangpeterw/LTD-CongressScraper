                EXCESSES OF MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address

the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, Bret Baier of Fox News has a 
new book called, ``Three Days in January.'' It is primarily about 
President Eisenhower's warnings against the excesses of the military-
industrial complex.
  Today, we have a military-industrial security complex that is more 
about money than it is about any realistic threat.
  I think President Eisenhower would be shocked at how far we have 
traveled down the road against which he warned us. Our new President 
has spoken out against the excessive, exorbitant cost of some of our 
newest military equipment and weapons systems.
  The only way we will ever bring these costs under control is if we 
stop the revolving door at the Pentagon, where the defense contractors 
hire all of the retired admirals and generals.
  President Eisenhower once said: Heaven help us if we ever have a 
President who doesn't know as much about the military as he did.
  We need more leaders who have the guts to say ``no'' to the excessive 
spending by the military-industrial complex.
