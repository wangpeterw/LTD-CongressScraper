                       AVOID GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

  (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge this Congress to work 
together to avoid a shutdown of the Federal Government this week.
  We must pass a clean funding bill that Members from both parties can 
support, without any ideological riders. We cannot allow the American 
public and central coast families in my district to foot the bill 
resulting from partisan gridlock. A shutdown would mean disrupting 
economic growth and potentially triggering job losses across the 
country, as we experienced in the partisan 2013 shutdown.
  A shutdown damages both our economy and national security. It is 
vital that this Congress put forward a clean funding resolution. It 
would be irresponsible for us to engage in partisan political games 
with the funding of our Federal Government.
