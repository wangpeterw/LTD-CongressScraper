                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2199

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the 
desk, and I ask for its first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 2199) to authorize appropriations for border 
     infrastructure construction, to provide conditional resident 
     status to certain aliens, and to amend the Immigration and 
     Nationality Act to include grounds of inadmissibility and 
     deportability for alien members of criminal gangs and 
     cartels, and for other purposes.

  Mr. GRASSLEY. I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place 
the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to 
my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The bill will be read for the second time on the next legislative 
day.

                          ____________________
