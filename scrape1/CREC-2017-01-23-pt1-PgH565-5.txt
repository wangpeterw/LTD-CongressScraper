                     FLOOD INSURANCE INTEGRITY ACT

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss important 
legislation I will soon be introducing in this Congress, the Flood 
Insurance Integrity Act.
  Flooding and flood insurance are major issues for Florida and my 
district. Our community along the coast is prone to experiencing 
hurricanes and tropical storms on a regular basis. Flood insurance is a 
must where we live.
  But right now, the National Flood Insurance Program bases its flood 
insurance rates on maps that can be 50 years or older. Many are 
completely out of date and often inaccurate. It is also one of the 
reasons that NFIP is over $23 billion in debt.
  The Flood Insurance Integrity Act will require an open and 
transparent annual review of flood maps. It sounds good.
  Americans who need flood insurance should be able to trust that their 
flood insurance premiums accurately reflect their flood risk. It is the 
least we can do. So that is why this bill seeks to do that.
