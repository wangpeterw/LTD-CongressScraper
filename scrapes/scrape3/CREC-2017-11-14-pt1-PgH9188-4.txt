                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Anthony K.R. Gibson, African Methodist Episcopal Zion 
Church, Indianapolis, Indiana, offered the following prayer:
  On this day and before this august body, we pause to prayerfully 
acknowledge Your presence in this place as the living God. There is 
none like You. Your dominion will never recess, and Your will will 
never end.
  On this day, O God, saturate this place with Your presence and fill 
this House with Your spirit. You have not given us the spirit of fear. 
You have given us the spirit of love, the spirit of compassionate 
authority, and the spirit of godly judgment.
  Holy Spirit, touch the hearts of our elected officials. Let 
everything done in this Chamber be for Your glory and for Your praise. 
We bless You in advance for the mercy and truth that will permeate from 
this House on this day and reach all areas of these United States and, 
indeed, the uttermost parts of the world.
  In Jesus' name we pray.
  Amen.
