              PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, we are seeing President Trump attempt to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act, both breaking his own promises and 
making it worse for American families.
  He promised to protect Americans with preexisting conditions, but any 
State could allow insurers to raise premiums for Americans with 
preexisting conditions and make their insurance too expensive to 
afford. Any State could jeopardize access to mental health, emergency, 
maternal, and prescription drug coverage. And any State could charge 
older workers an age tax that would devastate middle class families.

  The proposals will steal $1 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid in 
exchange for giveaways to the very wealthy and corporations.
  The President and Republicans are turning their backs both on their 
own rhetoric and the real needs and lives of American families.
