       H.R. 1742.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article V of the Constitution requires Congress to call a 
     convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution ``on 
     the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the 
     several states.'' In order to fulfill this obligation, 
     Congress has the authority to enact legislation to ensure 
     accurate recordkeeping of state applications submitted 
     pursuant to Article V.
