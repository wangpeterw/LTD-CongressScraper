                           WORLD AUTISM MONTH

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during World 
Autism Month to recognize and support all children and adults with 
autism spectrum disorder.
  Today, millions of adults and an estimated 1 out of every 68 children 
in the United States have been diagnosed with some form of autism 
spectrum disorder. Notwithstanding these diagnoses, Americans with 
autism make exceptional contributions across our Nation and around the 
world.
  Each April, Autism Speaks celebrates the start of its signature 
campaign, Light It Up Blue, along with the international autism 
community, in recognition of United Nations-designated World Autism 
Awareness Day, which was celebrated on April 2, and April as World 
Autism Month. Light It Up Blue is a unique global campaign to increase 
understanding and acceptance for people living with autism.
  Mr. Speaker, during World Autism Month, let us renew our commitment 
to support the entire international autism community, including 
children and adults with autism, their families, and caregivers. 
Together, we can increase access to information, encourage heightened 
understanding of autism, promote respect and dignity, and support the 
services that assist people with autism to reach their full potential.
