                CELEBRATING WOMEN'S SMALL BUSINESS MONTH

  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, throughout the month of October, we have 
celebrated the Women's Small Business Month.
  According to the National Women's Business Council, there are around 
9.8 million women-owned businesses in our country. Collectively, women-
owned businesses produce about $1.4 trillion in annual receipts and 
employ over 8 million employees, as this graphic shows.
  The largest number of women-owned businesses are in my home State of 
California. California has about 1.3 million women-owned firms. In 
addition, in my district, the cities of Stockton and Lodi were ranked 
by WalletHub in 2016 as the second best place in California for women 
entrepreneurs.
  Despite the challenges women-owned firms encounter, women 
entrepreneurs employ many residents that make up the vitality of our 
local communities across the United States. That is why I stand here 
today to acknowledge and celebrate women-owned small businesses such as 
the Valley Brewing Company in Stockton, California, owned by Kellie 
Jacobs, a friend of many years.
  Let's support and thank all of the women entrepreneurs in our country 
and honor all of these businesses.
