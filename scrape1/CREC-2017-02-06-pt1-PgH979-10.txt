         ARMY RECOGNITION FOR ARKANSAS CONGRESSMAN STEVE WOMACK

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the achievement of a 
true Arkansas leader, my colleague and friend, Representative Steve 
Womack.
  Early this year, Steve was awarded the Department of the Army's 
Decoration for Distinguished Civilian Service, which is the highest 
award the Secretary of the Army may bestow upon a civilian.
  Before being elected Representative for Arkansas' Third Congressional 
District, Steve dedicated most of his adult life to the Arkansas Army 
National Guard where he retired as a colonel after 30 years of service.

  He has been awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army 
Commendation Medal, and the Legion of Merit. His example is one all 
Americans and Arkansans can admire, and I treasure our work together 
here in the 115th Congress representing our State of Arkansas.
