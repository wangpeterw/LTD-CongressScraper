                                 PRAYER

  Pastor Rodney David Cannon, Frostproof Church of God, Frostproof, 
Florida, offered the following prayer:
  Creator God in Heaven, we thank You for this great Nation and for 
placing us in it for such a time as this. We humbly ask for Your wisdom 
and guidance in leading as we lay down our titles and take up the 
servant leader's towel. May we honor You by serving those across the 
aisle, across the street, and those around the world.
  Protect those who are protecting us.
  In the name of Your Son, Jesus, who taught us to pray by saying:
  Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom 
come, Thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day 
our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. 
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For Thine is 
the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.
  Amen.
