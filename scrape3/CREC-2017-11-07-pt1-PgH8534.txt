                          REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I have grave concerns with the so-called 
tax plan Republicans are peddling. It should be called the Republican 
tax scam. Working Americans are being sold a bill of goods. Let me be 
crystal clear: this plan will not cut taxes for working middle class 
families. This is a tax cut for Wall Street and a tax hike for Main 
Street. And what does your family get? More cuts to children's 
education, deep cuts to your healthcare, and deep cuts to lifesaving 
emergency services.
  Over 50 million taxpaying households will pay more taxes every April 
15, due to this tax scam. Let me repeat that another way. This tax scam 
gets rid of credits and deductions for the middle class and keeps 
loopholes for corporations to ship your jobs overseas.
  Mr. Speaker, I am completely opposed to this tax scam that cuts taxes 
for big corporations, and it forces big cuts to Medicare, education, 
and Social Security. This tax scam is wrong.
