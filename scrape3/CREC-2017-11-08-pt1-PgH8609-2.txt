                  DEMOCRATS WILL DELIVER A BETTER DEAL

  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, last night all throughout our great 
country, hatred lost in America; fear-mongering lost in America, race-
baiting lost in America, xenophobia lost in America, homophobia lost in 
America, Confederate monuments lost in America, the war on Medicaid 
lost in America, voter suppression lost in America, the Trump playbook 
lost in America, and the make America hate again agenda lost in 
America.
  Democrats will continue to focus on the economic well-being of the 
American people, will continue to fight for better jobs, better wages, 
and a better future for the American people.
  Democrats will continue to fight to deliver a better deal.
