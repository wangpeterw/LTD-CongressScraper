                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Lord of life and glory, bend Your ears to hear our prayers. Lord, 
deep inside, we long to be a part of something bigger than ourselves. 
Give our lawmakers the wisdom to discover Your purposes and the courage 
to obey Your commands. As they follow Your providential leading, may 
they discover also the reason You created them. As they strive to be 
instruments of Your glory, use them to do Your will on Earth, even as 
it is done in Heaven. Into each dark and trying hour, send the 
illumination of Your mercy and grace.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
