                            EDUCATION REFORM

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, back in 2015, Congress passed one of the most 
significant education reform legislation in decades. Even more 
impressive than repealing No Child Left Behind, scaling back the role 
of the Secretary of Education and restoring authority back to the 
States and local school districts was the fact that this legislation 
was bipartisan, bicameral, and signed into law by President Obama.
  But even so, this couldn't exempt our States and schools from the 
watchful eyes of Washington. President Obama's Department of Education 
unsurprisingly went over the line by expanding his authority, a role 
that Congress clearly did not allow for in the law.
  That is why today I am delighted to see the House pass H.J. Res. 57 
because we have to make the Department of Education follow the law as 
it was intended by Congress. The Every Student Succeeds Act was written 
to stop Federal micromanagement of our schools, and Congress is 
ensuring that that happens. For the last time, Washington bureaucrats 
do not belong in the classroom.
