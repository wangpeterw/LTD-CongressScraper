                        WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM

  (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, there are 20,000 open jobs in Kansas and 
an unemployment rate of 3 percent. This is a 16-year low for our State. 
However, we face only a 63 percent national workforce participation 
rate.
  Almost 40 percent of our country's labor force has given up on 
finding a job, or has lost motivation to work.
  In Kansas, a top concern I have heard over our 40 townhalls this year 
is the need for a stronger workforce.
  My colleagues and I must start work on a welfare to work program--a 
set of policies that will empower people to find a job that lifts them 
out of poverty and lifts their spirit with a sense of purpose.
  Let's empower those across the country to get the training they need 
for a rewarding career and a quality of life that turns the tide of 
poverty and uncertainty toward personal and societal prosperity.
