                      IN RECOGNITION OF BRIAN BERG

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, as the House co-chair of the bipartisan 
Paper and Packaging Caucus, I rise today to recognize an individual 
from my district who has dedicated his entire professional life to an 
industry that is the lifeblood of a rural community in my State, 
Toledo, Oregon. I am talking about Brian Berg, who, after 41 years with 
Georgia-Pacific, will be retiring Friday.
  For 50 years, GP has been an integral part of Lincoln County and a 
community partner, providing paper and packaging products that are used 
around the world.
  For over 41 years, Brian has been a leader at GP in helping ensure 
that the mill continues to thrive and be successful and provide for 
this community now and into the future.
  I want to thank Brian for his dedication, his service, and his 
commitment to an industry that has been critical to my district and 
many of my constituents. I wish you all the best and hope you get to 
enjoy some time with your lovely wife, Janet, and kids, Savannah, 
Ashley, and Riley.
