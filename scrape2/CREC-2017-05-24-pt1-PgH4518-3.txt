                     RECOGNIZING BRITNI BURLINGHAM

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud 
member of the Foster Youth Caucus, and also as part of a family that 
was involved in the foster care system.
  Today I have the opportunity to spend time with Britni Burlingham as 
part of the Annual Foster Youth Shadow Day.
  Britni is a social work major at Edinboro University in Pennsylvania. 
She is also a case aide for the Bair Foundation, a nonprofit 
organization that focuses on foster care and adoption.
  This profession is rewarding for Britni because she has a firsthand 
experience. She entered the foster care system when she was just 7 
years old.
  Britni has said that being able to work with children who have had 
similar experiences to hers is life-changing. She and her husband also 
provide a loving home to their two foster daughters.
  I am grateful that I can spend time today with Britni and hear about 
her positive experience with foster care. Her adoptive family built a 
strong foundation for her to achieve success in her own life.
  Mr. Speaker, this is what foster care is all about.
  I thank Britni for being here today, sharing her story and helping so 
many children overcome similar obstacles.
  Congratulations, Britni. We are all very proud of your success.
