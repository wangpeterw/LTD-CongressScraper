               MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS ARE SICK AND TIRED

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, middle class Americans are sick and tired; 
sick and tired of footing the bill so that rich-folk millionaires and 
billionaires can get another tax break.
  The Republicans' proposed tax reform plan is nothing but a tax cut 
for rich folks. It translates to increasing taxes for the poor and 
middle class families in our country. That means that families already 
struggling to make ends meet will have a tougher time making that car 
note, that mortgage, and gaining nothing in return.
  As a country, the GOP billionaire tax cut plan steals hundreds of 
billions of dollars from the U.S. Treasury. That means that we can't 
make crucial investments in infrastructure, job training, or research 
and development that would help give people a good-paying job.
  Reducing our tax base also translates into cuts to popular programs 
like Medicare. You know how much everybody likes that.
  The American people want tax reform, but not a plan that would 
literally jeopardize families' livelihoods. We must put middle class 
families first in this country, and the GOP tax plan fails to do that. 
We can and must do better for the American people.
