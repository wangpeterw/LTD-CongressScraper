                             NET NEUTRALITY

  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm against the 
Federal Communications Commission's misguided proposal to repeal net 
neutrality rules.
  Now, let me be clear. Net neutrality rules protect Americans' access 
to an open, free, and fair internet. The rules prevent internet 
companies from blocking websites or slowing down their load time simply 
because they disagree with what the website says. Repealing them would 
be undemocratic and very dangerous.
  What is worse, we know that gutting net neutrality would have a 
detrimental impact on communities of color. From entrepreneurs to 
social justice advocates, the internet has been a powerful tool for 
communities of color to help draw attention to injustices in our 
society.
  This new proposal will essentially kill this free expression and 
innovation. This is ridiculous. We can't allow democracy and access to 
the internet to be restricted in the name of corporate profits.
  I urge the FCC to reject this plan and stand with the vast majority 
of Americans who want to keep the internet open and free.
