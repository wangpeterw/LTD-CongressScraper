                    WILDFIRE IN OUR NATIONAL FORESTS

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, as our country reels from the devastation 
of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, another disaster ravages our Pacific 
Northwest. I rise today to once again bring attention to the problem 
that is decades in the making: wildfire in our national forests.
  The mismanagement of these forests over the last 30 years has 
destroyed the health of our beautiful national forests. Our land 
management agencies are paralyzed by litigation. Radical groups dictate 
the policy. As a result, our forests have never been in worse 
condition.
  Fuel loads in our forest are now so great, once a fire begins, there 
is little hope of being able to contain it.
  With 193 million acres in the National Forest System, nearly 40 
percent is vulnerable to wildfire, insects, disease, and in need of 
treatment; yet harvest levels on Federal lands remain low, with tree 
growth and mortality rates far exceeding removal.
  We need to change this, or this will happen. This is the Eagle Creek 
fire right outside the city of Portland by the Bridge of the Gods.
  Every year we don't act, the problem gets worse. We need to reform 
our forest management practices, and we need to do it now. Enough is 
enough.
