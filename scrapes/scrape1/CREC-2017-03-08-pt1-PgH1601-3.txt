                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We ask Your blessing upon us this day. During these days, the 
American people can see the difficulties of legislating for this great 
Nation of ours. Disagreements between and within parties emerge when 
important and sweeping laws are being considered.
  So also the push and pull of local, State, and national governmental 
interests and responsibilities can be seen to contribute to the 
enormity of our way of government. Be it health care or immigration, 
the wisdom of our Founders can perhaps be seen in their designing a 
governmental process that is difficult, resistant to hasty solutions, 
and demanding of those who engage.
  May the American people be patient with and supportive of this 
process, and may the Members of this House, especially, merit the trust 
of their constituents, those who voted for them and those who did not.
  And may all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and 
glory.
  Amen.
