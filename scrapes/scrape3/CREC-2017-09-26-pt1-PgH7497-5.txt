                       BOEING LEADERSHIP PROGRAM

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this morning I was 
grateful to join my fellow South Carolinian colleagues at the Boeing 
Leaders for the Second Century program. This program is dedicated to 
discussing leadership capabilities and better understanding public 
policy.
  Boeing has brought thousands of jobs to South Carolina, and we are 
grateful that they call us home.
  Additionally, I am thankful for the inspiring leadership of 
Charleston Vice President and General Manager Joan Robinson-Berry; 
Chairman, President, and CEO Dennis Muilenburg; Vice Chairman Raymond 
Conner; Executive Vice President Leanne Caret, as well as all who have 
joined us this morning from worldwide operations.
  I appreciate Boeing suppliers creating jobs in the Second 
Congressional District. This includes: Zeus, located in Orangeburg and 
Aiken; Prysmian of Lexington; Thermal Engineering of Columbia; and AGY 
of Aiken.
  When I think Boeing, I think jobs, and I look forward to continuing 
to work to bring jobs to South Carolina. Best wishes to the Boeing 
Company for successfully creating more jobs in South Carolina.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
