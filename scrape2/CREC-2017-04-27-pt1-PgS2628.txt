agreed to:

                              S. Res. 146

       Whereas, each year in the United States, El Dia de Los 
     Ninos--Celebrating Young Americans is recognized on April 30 
     as a day to affirm and recognize the importance of young 
     children in the United States;
       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the 
     people of the United States, and the well-being of children 
     and adolescents is emphasized as a top priority in the United 
     States;
       Whereas children and adolescents should be nurtured and 
     invested in to preserve and enhance economic prosperity, 
     democracy, and the spirit of the United States through the 
     free and open exchange of ideas;
       Whereas, according to data of the Bureau of the Census, 
     Hispanics are the youngest major racial or ethnic group in 
     the United States, as nearly \1/3\, or 17,900,000, of the 
     Hispanic population of the United States is younger than 18 
     years old, and approximately \1/4\, or 14,600,000, of the 
     Hispanic population of the United States are millennials (18 
     to 33 years old in 2014);
       Whereas the United States Hispanic population continues to 
     grow, representing the youngest and largest ethnic minority 
     group in the United States, and is a significant part of the 
     workforce of the United States, comprising future consumers, 
     taxpayers, and voters;
       Whereas, as the United States becomes more culturally and 
     ethnically diverse, the people of the United States must 
     strive to bring about cultural understanding and celebrate a 
     tradition that honors all children on April 30, 2017, El Dia 
     de Los Ninos--Celebrating Young Americans, a day that 
     acknowledges and shares traditions and customs with all 
     people in the United States;
       Whereas parents represent the center of teaching family 
     values, morality, life preparation, health, survival, and 
     culture;
       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children and 
     adolescents in the United States will help affirm the 
     significance of family, education, health, and community 
     among the people of the United States;
       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition for 
     the children of the United States will provide an opportunity 
     to reflect on their futures, to articulate their aspirations, 
     to find comfort and security in the support of their family 
     members, communities, and schools, and to grow to contribute 
     to the United States;
       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, which 
     serves as an advocate and a voice for children, will 
     celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2017, and has partnered 
     with States and cities throughout the United States for the 
     last 19 years, will declare April 30, 2017, as El Dia de Los 
     Ninos--Celebrating Young Americans, a day to bring 
     communities and Latinos together across the United States to 
     celebrate and uplift children; and
       Whereas the people of the United States should be 
     encouraged to celebrate the gifts of children and to help 
     children take their rightful place in the future of the 
     United States: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates April 30, 2017, as El Dia de Los Ninos--
     Celebrating Young Americans; and
       (2) calls on the people of the United States to join with 
     children, families, communities, churches, cities, and States 
     across the United States to observe the day with appropriate 
     ceremonies, including activities that--
       (A) center on children and are free or minimal in cost so 
     as to facilitate full participation of all people;
       (B) uplift and help children positively envision a path to 
     their futures by voicing their hopes and dreams;
       (C) offer opportunities for children of diverse backgrounds 
     to learn about the cultures of one another and to share 
     ideas;
       (D) include family members, especially extended and elderly 
     family members, so as to promote understanding and 
     communication between generations within families and to 
     enable young people to respect and benefit from the 
     experiences of, and learn from, their family elders;
       (E) enable diverse communities to build relationships; and
       (F) provide children with the long-term support the 
     children need to learn, develop, and become confident young 
     adults who are ready and eager to contribute to the United 
     States, a country the children believe in.
