           By Mr. LUETKEMEYER:
       H.R. 2565.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Additionally, Article 1, Section 7, Clause 2 of the 
     Constitution allows for every bill passed by the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate and signed by the President to 
     be codified into law; and therefore implicitly allows 
     Congress to repeal any bill that has been passed by both 
     chambers and signed into law by the President.
