                          FAA REAUTHORIZATION

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, last week Congress 
passed legislation to reauthorize the FAA, including its authority to 
collect and spend money for repairs and replacement parts for our air 
traffic control system. I am proud that we worked together to get this 
bill over the finish line. Now the FAA can continue to play a critical 
role in the Federal Government's response to the powerful hurricanes 
that have hit our country.
