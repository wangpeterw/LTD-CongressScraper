               FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF COMPLETE GOP CONTROL

  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today is the first anniversary of 
complete Republican control of our government--the President, the 
Senate, the House.
  When they wanted to deliver their tax plan, the largest transfer of 
wealth to the richest Americans, they could move with lightning speed. 
Bipartisanship? Democrats were completely shut out. Although, to be 
fair, Republicans didn't even know what they were voting on.
  DREAMers weren't here illegally until Donald Trump ended the DACA 
program. If the Republicans had the courage to allow bipartisan 
legislation on the floor to fix this problem, it would pass 
overwhelmingly.
  The Republicans had known for months that the important and popular 
CHIP program would end this fall. If they would allow the 
reauthorization on the floor, it would pass with 400 votes and save us 
$6 billion over the next 10 years.
  Republicans should use their complete control of government to 
govern. And if they can't agree amongst themselves and want our help, 
then work with us, but don't hold the American public and their 
government hostage to your most extreme Members and their radical 
ideas.
