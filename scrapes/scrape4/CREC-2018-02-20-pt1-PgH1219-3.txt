                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Michael Wilker, Lutheran Church of the Reformation, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  During this first week in the Christian season of Lent, let us begin 
this day turning to God and our neighbor to confess our sin.
  Most holy and merciful God, we confess to You and to one another, and 
before the whole company of heaven, that we have sinned by our fault, 
by our own fault, by our own most grievous fault, in thought, word, and 
deed, by what we have done and by what we have left undone. We have not 
loved You with our whole heart, and mind, and strength.
  We have not forgiven and freed others as we have been forgiven and 
freed.
  Restore us, O God, and let Your anger depart from us. Accomplish in 
us the work of Your salvation.
  Have mercy on us, almighty God. Forgive us all our sins, strengthen 
us in all goodness, and keep us in eternal life.
  Amen.
