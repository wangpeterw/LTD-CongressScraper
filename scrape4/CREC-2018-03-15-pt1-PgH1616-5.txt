                 HONORING DEPUTY DAVID LEE'SEAN MANNING

  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, it is with sadness that I rise today 
to honor the life and work of a young 24-year-old deputy sheriff from 
Edgecombe County, North Carolina, who was tragically killed during a 
traffic stop in his community on Sunday, March 11, 2018.
  Deputy David Lee'Sean Manning lost his life when his patrol vehicle 
crashed while engaged in the traffic stop.
  The elected sheriff of Edgecombe County, my friend, Sheriff Clee 
Atkinson, informed me that this loss has resulted in tremendous sadness 
for the Manning family and the entire law enforcement community, an 
emotion that we all certainly understand.
  On behalf of the United States House of Representatives and the 
750,000 citizens of North Carolina's First Congressional District, we 
honor the life and service of Deputy David Lee'Sean Manning.
  May God continue to embrace David's biological family, embrace his 
law enforcement family in the weeks and months to come, and give them 
the solace that they need to continue with their lives.
