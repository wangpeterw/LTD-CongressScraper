                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 552, R.D. James.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The clerk will report the nomination.

               Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Bill

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week Americans from all across the 
country--including many from Kentucky--came here to Washington to speak 
up for unborn children whom our legal system has denied the right to 
life. Now Congress has an opportunity to take a step forward.

  The United States is currently one of just seven countries--just 
seven--including China and North Korea, that permits elective abortions 
after 20 weeks. It is time we began to remedy this obvious and tragic 
moral wrong. The long-overdue legislation that we will be voting on 
soon would do just that.
  I am pleased to have filed cloture on this bill to protect unborn 
children who are capable of feeling pain. I am proud to cosponsor it, 
along with many of my colleagues, and I look forward to voting for it 
early next week.
