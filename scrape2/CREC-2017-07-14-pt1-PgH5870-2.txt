  BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, WELCOMES THE VIETNAM TRAVELING MEMORIAL 
                                  WALL

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, Bucks County, 
Pennsylvania, welcomes the Vietnam Traveling Memorial Wall to Penndel 
Memorial Field.
  Fifty years ago, many brave women and men from Bucks and Montgomery 
Counties were among the tens of thousands who would give their lives in 
the Vietnam war. The traveling wall is a large-scale replica of the 
memorial here in Washington, D.C. It moves around the Nation, providing 
remembrance and healing to local communities like Bucks County, where 
136 soldiers were killed or MIA during the Vietnam war.
  I am proud of the Penndel-Hulmeville Memorial Day Parade Committee, 
Ed Preston; Mike Fitzpatrick; Rich Rush; Vince and Lori Muscato; Mike 
Sodano; Tom Preston; Ray Mongillo; Walt Davidson; Vicki McLaughlin; 
Paul Shanahan; Paul and Alexandria Schnider; Dale Walton, Jr.; Carol 
Beauchamp; Greg Woodrow; and all the volunteers and veterans for their 
relentless effort to bring the Vietnam Traveling Memorial Wall to Bucks 
County.
  As we honor those who died in service of our Nation, we, too, thank 
all of those who have served, and we pause to thank and think of those 
who are defending our country today.
