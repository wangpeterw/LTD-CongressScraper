         CERTIFY THAT IRAN IS IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE JCPOA

  (Mr. CONNOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call upon President Trump 
to certify that Iran is in full compliance with the JCPOA, otherwise 
known as the Iran nuclear agreement. To decertify at this time will 
destabilize the ability of the United States to engage in international 
agreements, especially those we initiated ourselves.
  Our credibility is on the line, especially given the fact that the 
IAEA and the United Nations and the United States Government have 
certified that Iran is in compliance. It is in compliance on its 
centrifuges, enriched uranium, the production of the plutonium reactor 
itself.
  We want to make sure that we don't have a second nuclear front by 
decertifying Iran. It is important to the United States' interests, to 
the security of the world, and the security of Israel that this 
agreement be certified as in compliance.
