He has been a leader since a young age, and while serving our country in Vietnam, he earned a Purple Heart for his brave service.  Upon his return, James organized fellow workers at a plant in Henderson, North Carolina, before joining the AFL-CIO in 1974 as a director of Frontlash, an AFL-CIO youth group. Just a year later, the AFL-CIO recognized James' dedication to the fight for fair working conditions and promoted him to outreach director for the North Carolina federation, making him the first African American to hold a paid, full-time staff position with the State AFL-CIO federation.  After a brief stint working for his union in 1982, he began his position as the treasurer and secretary for North Carolina's AFL-A little over a decade later, James was elected as president and became the first African American to lead a State federation.

They fear deportation, Mr.Speaker, and they live with this fear because President Trump has decided that the Federal Government is going to break its promise and turn its back on  These are young men and women who did not break the law--they were brought to this country as children--who went to school here, who work here, and who pay taxes here.  The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program brought these young people out of the shadows and offered them some relief. It gave kids who grew up here and who truly believe that America is their home a chance to lead normal lives and chase their dreams.  The fact of the matter is, though, Mr.Speaker, that DACA did not go quite far enough. DREAMers are American by every measure except for their paperwork, and it is time that we offer them a path to citizenship.  That is why I am here today to call upon my colleagues to bring the Dream Act back to the floor for a vote--no policy riders, no packages, just a straight up-or-down vote. Because if there are Members of this Chamber who still believe that DREAMers should remain in the shadows and that they should not have a chance to join our Nation as citizens, then they should stand up and be counted.  Many of my colleagues here come from all walks of life. They have charted their own path, however difficult it may be to join this DREAMers have earned that chance to carve their own path, too. They have earned the right to live without fear and in peace as Passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, it is the moral thing to do, and, quite frankly, Mr.Speaker, it is the American thing to do.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgH7100.txt,2229,"DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES",2017,7,September

560,topic-id,862,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to express my dissatisfaction at the majority's failure to allow consideration of amendments I proposed to the appropriations bill that include funding for the The Rules Committee did not forward those items so my colleagues could consider and vote on them.[[Page H7092]]  My amendments represent beginning steps toward addressing what has become an intolerable level of noise from planes in my district. The amendments will not see debate in this body, however, despite the fact that noise affects the health, well-being, and economic livelihood of people in every part of the country, whether they are Republicans or  When Congress directed the FAA to update how we control our airways, we were promised that, by reworking the Nation's airspace and using satellite technology instead of radars, our Nation's flight system would become not only more efficient, but cleaner and quieter.  Next Generation systems were supposed to allow virtually automated air traffic control, eliminate circling overhead waiting for a landing slot, and facilitate smooth gliding flight descents without noisy engine power. Plus, planes would be able to stay higher longer, and FAA's published flight procedures would specify minimum altitudes over heavily populated areas, meant to ensure that effects on the ground were minimized.  That is not what we got. Eight of the country's busiest and most complex metropolitan areas, called metroplexes, have seen NextGen implementation so far. Phoenix, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C., are just a few of the metroplex victims who have decided to take legal action against the The D.Circuit Court recently ruled in the Phoenix case, noting that the FAA had not paid enough attention to the effects of its actions.  In every case, noise that used to be spread out across a wide area became concentrated over narrowed corridors, visiting misery on those living below. The best analogy I can offer is this: Imagine that all of the traffic using a 6-lane highway was narrowed to a single lane. The concentration of that much traffic would surely cause considerable problems.  Well, that is exactly what has happened in the southern California metroplex implementation. Areas that used to see planes flying overhead every 15 or 20 minutes now feel bombarded by flights as close together as every 3 minutes or less.  As you can imagine, sometimes those planes and narrowed highways might get too close together. Air traffic controllers have to keep minimum separation for the safety of all involved. But in order to adhere to that narrowed lane, controllers tell the pilots to deviate from the flight path by going downward. Sometimes they fly at half, or less, of what the minimum altitude is supposed to be. So planes that are supposed to fly at 6,000 feet may fly as low as 3,000 feet at a frequency of every 3 to 5 minutes. I hope that you can appreciate that that noise is intolerable.  Film production of all types, whether TV commercials, movies, or videos, is an economic driver in my district. The neighborhoods of the 37th Congressional District have been used to represent cities and towns across the continent.  Though you might not know it, I am sure you have seen both Culver City and the historic West Adams district, built over 100 years ago, in some of your favorite TV shows and movies. Unfortunately, the movie studios of Culver City and the homes of West Adams are directly under the new, narrowed flight path. Studios are complaining about having to move production from their back lots because of the noise.  I have elderly constituents who have lived in their neighborhoods for decades and who rely on income from location filming to help them remain in their homes. Film scouts have told them that the frequent loud plane traffic makes it impossible to film there anymore.  At this point, countless American and European health studies have demonstrated the harms that come from exposure to noise--and at much lower levels than that experienced by people on the ground. The arbitrary and outdated 65 decibel day/night level that the FAA uses to determine acceptable levels of exposure is calculated at an average of sound over a 24-hour period.  Parents with young children have told me that their kids' sleep patterns have been disrupted by unrelenting noise, enough to alter their academic performance.  A health clinic serving the affected areas has begun to investigate whether a spike in reported health problems, including poor control of chronic conditions like hypertension, can be related to the constant exposure to excessive noise.  The European Union standard for noise exposure at night is half of the U.level and is still cause for health concerns there.  In the absence of consideration of my amendments, I invite my colleagues to join me and nearly 40 other colleagues in the House Quiet Skies Caucus, which is working to make progress on this important issue.  My constituents and I know many of my colleagues' constituents are suffering under the burden of excessive airplane noise as a result of the implementation of the FAA's Next Generation project. We cannot and must not sacrifice the health of those on the ground in the name of airline efficiency.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgH7091-5.txt,1996,"PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3354, DEPARTMENT OF THE",2017,7,September

240,topic-id,566,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment seeks to preserve our current Clean Water Act protections for our rivers, streams, and wetlands. Our Nation's river systems and wetlands provide values that no other ecosystem can. These include: natural water quality improvement, flood protection, shoreline erosion control, recreation, general aesthetic appreciation, and natural products for our use at no cost.  Yet section 430 of this bill seeks to undermine the critical balance between protecting these waters and the day-to-day operations of our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and foresters. Under current law, farmers, ranchers, and foresters can carry out their normal operations in any waterbody without securing a Clean Water Act permit.  So what this means is farmers can continue to plow their fields, including potential wet areas that have been farmed for decades, plant their seeds, harvest their crops, without ever having to obtain approval under the Clean Water  Any normal farming, ranching, and forestry exemption is going to include minor limitations. For example, a farmer cannot use the current exemption to convert his farmland to a residential development without obtaining a permit. And a rancher can't use the exemption to plow under a wetland to expand his reach of grazing lands. And forestry operations cannot use this exemption to change the course of a local stream to improve drainage on their growing lands.  In short, the way the Clean Water Act currently operates is to allow normal ranching, farming, forestry operations to continue without a permit, unless the activities either change or convert the use of the waterbody to a new purpose, or impair the historic flow or reach of a stream or wetland.  So if the planned activity triggers any of these limitations, the current law requires the activity to obtain a permit. That is perfectly reasonable. But section 430 of this bill would, in essence, provide an absolute clean water exemption for impacts to any streams or wetlands that happen to be on agriculture, ranching, or forestry lands, regardless if they have any relation to these activities.  Mr.Chairman, this is a fundamental change to the Clean Water Act, and one where the impacts have never been explored. When the EPA was asked what the impact of this amendment would be, here was their response:       This amendment would be a significant departure from almost      40 years of implementation of the Clean Water Act by      eliminating the existing provision requiring that the      exemptions apply only to normal, as in established or      ongoing, farming practices.  This change could result in the loss or impairment of thousands of acres of valuable wetlands and other waters where land is converted to agriculture.  Mr.Chairman, we should not be using an appropriations bill to change Federal policy related to the protection of our Nation's rivers and streams. To the best of my knowledge, no hearings or investigations on the impacts of this provision have been held.[[Page H7150]]  If this Congress is interested in overturning almost 40 years of Clean Water Act precedent, regular order would require hearings before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which has sole jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act, and approval by that committee before consideration on the floor.  This rider is bad policy for the protection of our environment, for the protection of human health, and bad policy for the protection of our public safety.

First, it withdraws the Clean Water Second, and more importantly, it breaks procedure and creates a loophole so that the removal of the Clean Water Rule does not have to abide by the Administrative Procedure  In essence, we are creating a loophole to eliminate a rule, a rule requested by the Supreme Court and one that took several years to put together. This elimination without allowing tweaks, thoughtful removal, or comment is a radical and dangerous precedent.  In fact, 80 Members of Congress and I actually asked for an extension of the 30-day comment period to eliminate the Clean Water Rule to allow the American people to have a say. The Trump administration agreed with us and extended the comment period an additional 30 days. I don't get to say that too often.  So clearly, there is a desire for a comment period, as evidenced by our letter and the administration's decision to appropriately extend the comment period, but the language in this bill would eliminate that process completely.

The Environmental Protection Agency and the U.Army Corps      of Engineers (Corps) finalized the Clean Water Rule to      clarify the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water      The EPA and the Corps solicited comments on the Rule for      over 200 days. In accordance with Administrative Procedure      Act, the agencies first established a public comment period      for 90 days and extended the comment period twice in response      to extension requests. The final rule reflected over 1      million public comments on the proposal, the substantial      majority of which supported the Clean Water       The agencies also initiated an extensive public outreach      effort, including over 400 meetings across the nation with      various stakeholders, including but not limited to: states,      small businesses, farmers, academics, miners, energy      companies, counties, municipalities, environmental      organizations, and other federal agencies. The agencies      incorporated these comments into the final Clean Water       President Trump's Executive Order 13778 directs EPA and the      Corps to evaluate whether to revise or rescind the Clean      Water Rule, ``as appropriate and consistent with law.'' We      ask that as you examine the Clean Water Rule, like the prior      administration, you engage in a thoughtful and comprehensive      process bound in scientific fact.       Americans depend on clean water for their health and      livelihood. More than 117 million Americans rely upon      drinking water from public water systems that draw supply      from headwater, seasonal, or rain-dependent streams that were      vulnerable to pollution before the Clean Water As such,      the decision to roll back the Clean Water Rule cannot be made      in haste.       We are concerned that the EPA has provided limited time and      opportunity for stakeholder involvement and official public      comment. Any proposed rulemaking must include sufficient time      and participation to gather input from concerned and affected      parties, including those whose legal rights and      responsibilities will be affected by this effort. For      example, the 2015 Clean Water Rule provided legal certainty      that regulatory-defined water features, such as stormwater      control features, wastewater recycling structures, and      puddles, are not covered by the Clean Water However,      that certainty would be eliminated if the 2015 Clean Water      Rule were rescinded.       Given the history of engagement on this issue and the fact      that parties may be subject to greater regulatory uncertainty      by this effort, a comment period of 30 days does not allow      for meaningful engagement from the public and stakeholders.       The Clean Water Rule is robust and ensures that water      sources are protected by taking into account the connected      systems of water, from wetlands and seasonal bodies of water      to large rivers and lakes. The requirements of the Rule were      meticulously developed and addressed longstanding      uncertainty, improving our national commitment to protect not      only America's water, but the American people. If the Clean      Water Rule is revised or rescinded, the process must be      comprehensive and deliberative.       We ask that you take into consideration the opinions of the      American public by extending the comment period, allowing for      respectful debate. We look forward to hearing from you.

Mr.Chair, I include in the Record a letter from Members of Congress to Administrator Scott Pruitt opposing the proposed rule to rescind the Clean Water                                Congress of the United States,                                  Washington, DC, August 18, 2017.     Scott Pruitt,     Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington,                Dear Administrator Pruitt: We write in opposition to the      proposed rule rescinding the Clean Water Rule (Docket No.EPA-     HQ-OW-2017-0203), also called the Waters of the United States      (WOTUS) rule. Americans need an Environmental Protection      Agency that will use the best possible science to protect our      health and this nation's natural heritage. This rule to      rescind WOTUS and reports of plans to reduce protections      under the Clean Water Act are deeply concerning. Rather than      protecting Americans, these actions ignore science and      undermine our clean drinking water, our public health and our      outdoor recreation economy.       The Clean Water Rule finalized by the Obama Administration      protects the drinking water of roughly one-third of      117 million people rely on drinking water sources      fed by headwater, intermittent or ephemeral streams--     waterways protected under the Clean Water Rescinding      this rule puts Americans' health at risk by endangering their      drinking water.       Eliminating this rule also threatens our safe access to the      great outdoors and the outdoor recreation economy, which      generates $887 billion in consumer spending annually and      supports 7.6 million American jobs. Pollution in unprotected      streams and wetlands can threaten the health of the lakes and      rivers that our constituents use for swimming, boating and      other recreation. Wetlands protected under the Clean Water      Rule provide some of the country's best habitat for hunters      and anglers. As EPA Administrator, it is imperative to      protect the water bodies that our constituents use for      recreation, both to protect public health and the millions of      jobs these places have helped create.       Rescinding this clean water safeguard ignores science.      Years of research and peer-reviewed science have told us that      intermittent and ephemeral streams and wetlands provide      critical services, from filtering our drinking water to      protecting communities from flood and drought. They also      connect directly to major waterways, which means they can      pose a danger to drinking water and recreation if polluted or      degraded. The science is clear--what we do to these water      bodies impacts large, continuous water sources.       Americans agree that we should protect these waterways. The      previous Administration crafted the Clean Water Rule using      the comments of over one million Americans, the vast majority      of which were in support of the rule. Some opponents have      used scare tactics to confuse the public by stating that      there are new requirements for agriculture and that the rule      covers new types of waters. This is not the case. In reality,      the rule provides certainty over streams and wetlands that      have historically been covered by the Clean Water Act while      preserving agricultural and other common sense exemptions,      including for things like drainage ditches and stock watering      ponds on dry land.       The Clean Water Rule is a science-based rule that keeps our      communities safe and our natural resources protected--exactly      what Congress intended the Clean Water Act to do.

Mr.Chair, moving forward with permits for seismic airgun surveys for subsidy oil and gas deposits puts our vibrant Atlantic coast at risk.  I am a Virginia businessman, and I look at what seismic testing does. Congressman Rutherford and I led a bipartisan letter to the administration signed by over 100 of our colleagues expressing our concerns about seismic airgun blasting.  Our coastal economy relies on healthy ocean ecosystems, which generate $95 billion in gross domestic product, support nearly 1.4 million jobs each year. We have heard from countless businessowners, as Congressman Sanford has said, elected officials, residents all along our coasts who recognize and reject the risks.  NASA, the Department of Defense, the Florida Defense Support Task Force have all expressed concern that offshore oil and gas development will threaten their ability to perform critical activities.  The North, South, Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Councils, which are responsible for the management of fish stocks and habitats in Federal waters from Maine to Florida, also have significant concerns about the risks associated with offshore drilling and seismic airgun blasting.  So you have numerous fishing and tourism interests, including all the local chambers of commerce, tourism, restaurant associations, an alliance representing over 41,000 businesses, and 500,000 fishing families from Florida to Maine oppose offshore oil drilling activities as well.  Opening up the Atlantic to seismic testing and drilling jeopardizes our economy and these coastal economies in the most immediate terms.

It shows that the people's House is here, that we are working, and that we are meeting the needs of the American people. One of those is making certain that we fund the activity of this government, and that we do it in a responsible way.  I think that as I come to offer my amendment, that I offer every single year, on this piece of legislation, Mr.Chairman, it is very important to note that this Appropriations Committee has done a phenomenal job of reining in out-of-control spending.  One of the lessons that should have been learned over the past couple of years is that it is very clear the American people understand that Washington does not have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem. As I said, Washington does not have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem.  We know that the bureaucracy has an insatiable appetite for the taxpayers' money. We see it all of the time. It is why we are having a vote to raise the debt ceiling. It is why we are right at $20 trillion in debt. It is because the spending is, indeed, out of control.  The work that has been done by this committee to prepare these appropriations bills is so vitally important, and it is to be commended. I think we have to look at this Interior Appropriations bill and realize that last year it was a $32.28 billion bill. This year, they have worked that spending down to $31.4 billion, and that is, indeed, commendable. In this bill, they have cut the spending at the EPA a total of 27 percent, and that is, indeed, commendable.  The amendment that I bring forward tonight is to reduce that budget authority by an additional 1 percent. And I do this in calling for a penny-on-a-dollar cut, to challenge the bureaucracy to match the great work that has been done by our colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, as they have worked through to reduce what we spend to cut out waste, to look for fraud, to find ways that the taxpayer dollar is being abused, and to end that abuse.  And, indeed, we know that saving a penny on a dollar is something we can do. It is important to our children and grandchildren. Indeed, I think we have a moral responsibility to do that.  And there are areas where we can do this. I will give you a couple of examples where there is more that we could be doing.  One is in ceiling fan regulations through the Some of the regulations they have put on ceiling fans, which actually reduce energy consumption, are absolutely ridiculous. We know that they yield a benefit, especially for people that live in areas, like I live in, in  So while we recognize the vital work of the Department of the Interior, we also realize there are areas where more could be done to curb the waste, and where we could challenge the rank and file employees in these bureaucracies.

174,topic-id,607,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday I was standing next to John Lewis as we joined our Democratic colleagues from the House and the Senate who delivered a spirited message of resolve to fight Donald Trump's cruelty towards almost 800,000 young Americans and, of course, several million other members of their families, their friends, their employers, who all had their lives turned upside down by Trump's senseless, unnecessary decision.  Strange for somebody who professes to love the DREAMers, Trump is caught in his own trap. He clearly didn't know what he was doing, trying to figure out ways to pass responsibility for his decision on to others. But, of course, that is sort of what we have come to expect from someone who appears to care only for himself. He was afraid, even, to deliver the message himself. Typical of Donald Trump, he outsourced the decision to Jeff Sessions, who Trump spent most of the summer demeaning.  Now, I think there is a simple solution: take it back. Donald Trump is famous for mulligans on the golf course, do-overs. If he didn't like the shot, he would just do it again. Well, let's declare a DACA mulligan. Take it back. Yes, it might look foolish, but that really hasn't stopped him before.  In the meantime, the outrage builds: the community of faith, the business community, people across the country who are understanding the lunacy of this decision, its unfairness. But the most telling and powerful points are from the young DREAMers themselves.  My colleagues have delivered this message from people whom they have heard from in their districts. I have countless ones that have been shared with us.  Jamie, a 31-year-old father of two, a DACA recipient, was 12 when his family fled to the United States to escape poverty and corruption. For 9 years, he has dedicated his life to helping young people cope with these challenges. He is working with young people impacted by the issue, concerned about their mental health and their well-being.  Eddie arrived from Mexico as a 1-year-old baby. He really didn't understand the impact of being undocumented until he applied for college and was not eligible for Federal assistance, but eventually he attended and graduated from Portland State University; and he has become the first undocumented student admitted to Oregon Health & Science University School of Scheduled to graduate next year, he wants to be able to serve the community that raised him.  Karla, arrived as a 4-year-old, is currently a student, but whose concern is the message that is being sent to others whom she works with. DACA recipients are not all young professionals or valedictorians. Some work in fast-food restaurants and are struggling to get through community college.  She makes the point that some may call her a DREAMer, but she felt that the real DREAMers were her parents, who had the dream for her. They fought to come to this country to raise her and give her the opportunity to work, attend school, and live without fear of deportation.  These are compelling stories, Mr.Speaker, but the one that stands out in my mind most clearly was one of my first meetings after the election. I was meeting with a number of the young DREAMers, listening to their concerns, their apprehensions. The conversation stopped with one young man who just said, ``What country should I go to?'' He had choices to go to Canada or He was an accomplished student, ambitious.  ``What country should I go to?'' I must admit, at the time, I counseled him to not give up on the United States too quickly. I wonder what he thinks today.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgH7094.txt,99,"PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3354, DEPARTMENT OF THE",2017,7,September
169,topic-id,1744,"Mr.President, today I come to you after we have been able to pass out of the Appropriations Committee the bill to fund the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of I want to talk particularly about what happened in that funding, which is now out of committee and ready for the full Senate to act on it and then the Congress to act on it, as it relates to healthcare research.  We were able in our committee to have a bipartisan bill. I had a chance to begin to chair that committee 3 years ago. Senator Murray from Washington State is the leading Democrat on that committee. For the previous 6 years--the previous 5 years plus that first budget for which I was the chair--we weren't able to have a bipartisan bill. But the last 2 years, we have decided that we could figure out how to come together with this committee that actually appropriates about 30 percent of all the appropriated dollars that the Congress deals with and find a way to move forward in a bipartisan way. Certainly, Senator Murray is an important part of that partnership, and we were able to take our bill to the committee today.  Maybe the thing that we did that will have the most long-term significance in that bill was that, for the third year in a row, we were able to increase healthcare research at the National Institutes of Now, for the 12 years that ended 3 years ago, there had been zero increase in healthcare research in this country.  Research, whether it is ag research or health research or other research, is one of the things that the government has done for a long time and can really commit itself to in ways that the private sector cannot. So when you begin to hold back the healthcare research here, not only do people not have the same potential they have to have their health challenges met and their family health challenges met, but we also hold back our ability to move forward with lifesaving cures and lifesaving practices in an economy where that makes a difference and in a world where these things are changing quickly.  So just 3 years ago, the people who run the National Institutes of Health and researchers around the country said that, having had no increase in a dozen years, they were basically 22 percent behind where they had been 12 years earlier in just research buying power. Young researchers were leaving the field of research because they were[[Page S5079]]really disadvantaged in a world where research dollars were effectively going down and people who had had successful research before had a much better chance to know how to get and then to be awarded a grant that young researchers weren't getting.  So 2 years ago, last year, and again today--2 years ago and last year, successfully--the Congress said: Now we are going to make a substantial increase to healthcare research. It was $2 billion each of those 2 years, which was about a 6.6-percent increase in healthcare research. Today we proposed another $2 billion, and just like the previous 2 years, we really had no new money. So we had to figure out how to prioritize, eliminating programs. I think over the 3 years we have now eliminated over 30 programs that just simply weren't performing well or performing well enough to be a priority.  As the Presiding Officer and I have talked about before, when everything is a priority, nothing is really a priority. So we decided this is one of our priorities, and probably, we can safely suggest, a top priority for this committee now over the last 3 years. So we have gone from a 22-percent decline to where we are almost caught up to where the country was 15 years ago, in terms of buying power, with about a 20-percent increase in this one account in three budgets.  Again, I think it is important for us and the taxpayers to understand we did that because other things were carefully looked at and either had their amounts reduced or had their programs eliminated so we could look at the health research. In that 12-year period of time, there had been such a decline in commitment to health research that often the health research projects that were funded weren't funded in a way that allowed them to have success. At some Institutes at NIH, the success ratio was as low as 9 percent, and even when you are looking at everything, 9 percent is, frankly, too low.  I hope we are going to see some real breakthroughs as a part of that research. One of the areas that has been a part of that research has been the investment in Alzheimer's research. Every 68 seconds, someone in America develops Alzheimer's, and this is a disease that not only impacts in a dramatic way the person who has it but arguably impacts, in at least as dramatic a way, the people who care about them and do all they can to care for them. It is the most expensive disease in As our population gets older, more and more people get into that age realm where if something doesn't change, they are going to have Alzheimer's too.  Right now we are spending right at 250 billion tax dollars every year on Alzheimer's-related care. That is about half the defense budget. The estimate for 2050 is that if something doesn't change, we will be spending $1.1 trillion of today's dollars on Alzheimer's-related care.  We talk about big numbers here, and it is easy to get confused. That is a lot or that is half of that--what does that really mean? Well, $1.1 trillion is twice the defense budget. If you can get in your mind all we spend all over the world to defend the country, if we don't do something to change what is happening with Alzheimer's, we are going to be spending twice everything we spend to defend the country just on taxpayer-related Alzheimer's care.  The estimate on Alzheimer's, by the way, is that for every tax dollar spent on Alzheimer's, there are two private dollars spent and almost never covered by insurance. It has a dramatic impact on people, dramatic impact on their families, and a dramatic impact on taxpayers. We are spending about $1 on Alzheimer's research right now for every $125 we spend on Medicare and The biggest expenditure in those two funds of any disease is what we spend on Alzheimer's. Hopefully, we will see changes in that and begin to see things develop there.  Also, on the BRAIN Initiative, there has been nearly a 54-percent boost over last year's level in the BRAIN The BRAIN Initiative, as part of the 21st Century Cures legislation we voted for, is really developing a more complete understanding of brain function. It has the possibility of helping millions of people who suffer from a wide variety of neurological challenges, psychiatric and behavioral disorders, diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and traumatic brain injuries in addition to that. It is all part of what we can look at as part of the BRAIN Initiative for psychiatric disorders.  Remember, the estimate is that one out of every four adult Americans has a diagnosable and almost always treatable behavioral health issue. If you know that issue, if you know how the brain works in a better way, the treatment may be easier, better, more effective, and more long-term than it is now.  The National Cancer Institute is looking at the Precision Medicine This is where we utilize all we know now about the human genome and about environmental and lifestyle data to see if we can come up with solutions. Genomically, we didn't know any of this a generation ago, but with the human genome, now that we know what we know, we can look at how we individually are different than everybody else. There is a great feeling that in many cancers, there is a unique cancer-fighting agent for that unique cancer in you, but what you need to do is amp up that cancer-fighting agent. The Federal Drug Administration just last week approved the first T cell-amping treatment that would do that.  Senator Toomey and I went 2 years ago to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and saw the work that Carl June was doing, the groundbreaking work on leukemia. Again, he was amping up that fighting cell in patients whom everybody else had given up on and had great success and caused great optimism about what can happen there.  Tim Eberlein, director of the Siteman Cancer Center in Louis, testified before our subcommittee on the critical role of Federal support for looking at these kinds of things and seeing what can happen to make a difference.  He shared a story of one of his colleagues, Lukas Wartman, an oncologist and leukemia survivor, who had a relapse while, fortunately for him, he was a fellow at Washington Research performed a detailed analysis of Wartman's cancer genome profile. They identified an existing drug typically used to treat a different kind of cancer, but it targeted the kinds of genetic structures that Wartman had, and he is in remission. It enabled him to undergo a stem cell transplant. He is now continuing his work on behalf of other cancer patients.  Whether it is immunology--again, amping up of what you have to fight that unique challenge that you have, whether it is looking at the BRAIN Initiative, these are things that make a difference to families, they make a difference to taxpayers, they make a difference to our economy, and certainly we hope seeing the committee move forward today on what would be the third groundbreaking commitment by the Congress in recent years to make a difference here is an important thing.  I hope we get a chance to bring this bill so all the Senators get a chance, as our Members did today, to debate it, to amend it, but no matter what happens on the floor of the Senate, we will have a chance to talk to our colleagues in the House and, hopefully, once again, in the final appropriations bill this year, do what makes a difference.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Statues of Robert Lee and Jefferson Davis were erected across the United States in the post-Reconstruction era and during the civil rights movement as symbols of white suppression and defiance of Federal authority. They do not represent Southern heritage and those who advocate thus are engaging in revisionist history and are whitewashing our past.

The list of statues that would be removed includes Joseph Wheeler of Alabama, Uriah Milton Rose of Arkansas, Edmund Kirby Smith of Florida, Zebulon Vance of North Carolina, Alexander Hamilton Stephens of Georgia, Edward Douglas White of Louisiana, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, James Zachariah George of Mississippi, Wade Hampton of South Carolina, Robert Lee of Virginia, and John Kenna of West  The legislation would allow a State who selected the statue to be displayed in the collection to reclaim the statue if they pay for its transportation back to the If a State declines to reclaim it back, it would turn possession of the statue over to the Smithsonian, an institution that is more than capable of displaying the statues in the proper historical context and where a constructive dialogue can take place about our Nation's history.  I am grateful that this legislation is endorsed by organizations such as the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the NAACP Legal Defense  Some have argued that this will lead to the removal of other statues and monuments of prominent figures who played an important role in our Nation's history. That is plainly false. This bill only touches on those who were traitors against their Country and whose statues were erected as a symbol of white supremacy.  It is true that the Confederate Monument Removal Act does not remove certain statues in the Capitol that some people find offensive and who arguably should not be honored in such a way. For instance, the bill would not remove the statue of John Calhoun, a white supremacist and a vigorous defender of slavery. This is a conversation we as a Nation must have regarding how to best tell the truth of our past.  But surely we can all agree that people who took up arms against their Country should not be venerated in the Capitol, a place all Americans should feel welcomed, encouraged, and inspired. These statues must be moved not just because of who they were in the past, but because of who we are now as a Nation and who we must be to ensure an even better and brighter future for generations to come.  I am proud to introduce the Confederate Monument Removal Act and I urge its speedy passage.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgS5058.txt,2194,DREAM ACT AND OTHER WORK BEFORE THE SENATE,2017,7,September

Mr.Speaker, this threat against Guam and, indeed, our entire Nation, was inexcusable, and it demands firm condemnation from this House of  My resolution sends a clear message that North Korea's continued willful disregard for U.resolutions, international agreements, sanctions, and arms controls in pursuit of its illicit nuclear weapons program will not go unanswered by our government.  I remain fully confident in the defensive capabilities on Guam and in our region, but it is vital that we do all that we can to prevent a military conflict with North Korea and ensure that its regime does not continue down this path of reckless and destabilizing nuclear militarization.  I want to thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution with me, and I hope that the House leadership will quickly bring it to the floor for consideration, and I urge all the Members to support it.

3,topic-id,441,"Mr.Chairman, I rise for the opportunity to speak about my amendment to the State and Foreign Operations division of H.3354.  Mr.Chairman, we are facing some tough choices. Our Nation is nearly $20 trillion in debt. We are going to debate lifting the debt ceiling in the coming days. Simply put, we cannot afford to continue recklessly spending on duplicative and wasteful programs.  The United States Institute of Peace is a perfect example of a duplicative program that must be reexamined. The Institute's charter states that the organization was established to promote international peace and the resolution of conflict among the nations and peoples of the world without recourse to violence.  These are laudable and worthy goals, but it sounds a lot like the mission statement of another taxpayer-backed diplomatic organization, the United States Department of  The State Department's operational mission is to create a more secure, democratic, and prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and the international community. Why is Congress funding an independent think tank that supports the same mission as another Federal Government agency?  The U.Institute of Peace is far from the only organization on the ground working to foster peace across the globe. Since its inception, the U.Institute of Peace has awarded thousands of grants to other peace organizations. There are also more than 150 colleges and universities offering peace studies programs across the United  Why are we earmarking an additional $35.3 million in public funds to support a think tank that duplicates the State Department's mission, uses its public funds to support other peace-promoting organizations, and can raise millions of dollars in private funds to promote its own work?  For this reason, Members on both sides of the aisle have supported ending this program. In fact, this same amendment was offered by a Democratic member from New York to an appropriations bill in 2011. The amendment passed with a strong bipartisan vote.  The White House recently proposed eliminating Federal funding to the Institute noting that it duplicates not only other Federal programs but also nonprofit and private sector organizations.  In addition to the duplicative nature of its work, the Institute's authorization has expired. The underlying funding contained in the bill is not even allowed under House rules.  The authorization process is vital to ensuring that the American taxpayer is protected from waste. At the very least, we should withhold funding until the Institute is reauthorized.  Our kids and grandkids are relying on us to find a solution to this problem rather than continuing to dig the hole deeper. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

This would provide us more time to study whether offshore fracking is safe for the environment and public health.  In 2013, we learned that offshore fracking had been occurring off California's coast for more than two decades. In the Santa Barbara Channel alone, there have been more than a dozen documented instances of offshore fracking, yet we know very little about the environmental and health impacts this has had on our communities.

564,topic-id,1637,"Mr.President, I take this time to share with my colleagues a meeting that I had last Thursday in Montgomery County, MD, with CASA de We put together a roundtable discussion to talk about immigration and the need for immigration reform and the concerns we had about the current status of people who are concerned about what is happening with immigration enforcement. That was before the President had made his announcement on terminating the DACA Program, which is the program that provides relief for the Dreamers--those who have been in this country for a long period of time and know only America as their home.  I must tell you that, at that discussion I had last Thursday in Montgomery County, MD, the fear of uncertainty was clear to me. I talked to many families who were concerned about how the Trump administration was enforcing our current laws, what would be the resolution of the temporary protective status, TPS, under which people are here legally, and I had a chance to see firsthand some of the Dreamers who are here under the protection of the DACA  It was very clear to me that what the people in that meeting were looking for was leadership in Washington that recognized that it is in our national interest for us to provide the type of legal protection to these individuals who have made America their home--who took the risk to come here for a better life for their families.  These individuals came to this country--the Dreamers, who are the children, particularly--when they came with their parents. It was the parents' decision to try to find a better life for their children. They know only America as their country. They do not know the countries from which they have come. America is their own home. They have helped to build this great They have attended our schools. They have joined our military. They have joined our workforce. They are, truly, the future of  The DACA Program, which recently celebrated its fifth anniversary, provided protection for these Dreamers against their arbitrary removal. It applied only to those who had come to this country when they were younger than 16 years of age. They had to have been here before January 2007. They had to have gone through a background check to make sure that they had not violated any of our criminal statutes, and they had to have been enrolled in schools or our military. It was really dealing with young people who were innocent with regard to any of the violations of our immigration laws. It really dealt with individuals who had come to this country and had been part of  The DACA Program provided not only protection against their removal but gave them protection in the workforce. They were given documentation so that they could legally work here in the United States and get the protection of our labor laws and not be subjected to an underground economy or the abuses in the workforce that we sometimes see among immigrant families. So 800,000 children have taken advantage of the DACA In my State of Maryland, 10,000 are registered under the DACA  Then came President Trump's decision this past week to terminate the program in 6 months--terminate it now, as far as new DACA registrations--but to terminate this program. That immediately created uncertainty and fear for 800,000 individuals in this country and their families.  President Trump's decision is tragic in three ways. First, it has the potential of ripping families apart--800,000 people here in the United It creates uncertainty for those who are currently in the DACA It creates fear as to what tomorrow will bring, and it will drive many of these individuals into the shadows, into the underground, into protecting themselves against the enforcement of removal.  This decision by President Trump is tragic for a second reason. It will hurt our economy. The numbers in Maryland I think are somewhere around one-half of $1 billion to our State GDP from the Dreamers alone.  The Dreamers are part of our economy. They are adding to our economy. I got a phone call from one of our major employers in Maryland expressing grave concern about President Trump's decision and the impact it will have on that company and on our economy. These are individuals who have been trained in our schools, who have gone to our colleges, who have served in our military, and who are now adding to the economic strength of America through their employment and their innovation. It makes no sense from the point of view of our economy.  The third reason the President's decision is tragic is one that speaks to the strength of America--what makes America the great Nation it is. Yes, we are proud of those who serve in our military. We know that we have the strongest military in the world, and we are very proud of the way our military protects this country and provides global leadership. Yes, we are very proud of our economy and what it produces and the economic growth it provides for the people in this country and its engagement in the global economy. But what really makes America the unique, strong Nation that it is are our values, including what we stand for, our democratic institutions, the fact that we are the beacon of hope for people all over the world for providing opportunity. People can come to this country with dreams, and those dreams can become reality. That is what America's values are about.  President Trump's decision to end the DACA Program runs afoul of the principles that have made America the great Nation it is--a safe haven for those who are seeking refuge from persecution, a nation that embraces diversity and recognizes diversity as our strength. President Trump's decision to end the DACA Program runs afoul of[[Page S5027]]America's core values. It weakens us as a nation and certainly weakens our ability to lead globally with our values as we present them to the global community.  So, as a result of that decision, what do we need to do? Each one of us needs to stand up and be counted, to speak out about America and what makes this Nation the great Nation it is. Then, collectively, we need to take action to show the American people that we will stand up not just for the Dreamers--and we need to stand up for the Dreamers--but we will also stand up for the values that have made America the great Nation it is.  I support 1615, a bipartisan bill that has been introduced by Senator Durbin and Senator I thank both of our colleagues for their leadership in bringing that bill forward. That bill will provide protection for the Dreamers and for the DACA Program so that Congress can say: No, Mr.President, we do not want to terminate this program. This program is in our national security interests. This program is why America is the strong Nation that it is. It is not only right for 800,000 people; it is right for all people in this country.  This body showed great leadership a few years ago when we passed comprehensive immigration reform. I am for passing comprehensive immigration reform. Let's take care of and protect the Dreamers, and then let's work together to pass comprehensive immigration reform that we did just a few years ago that was never taken up in the House of  Let me close by telling a few stories about Dreamers in One story appeared in the Baltimore It begins:       Jesus Perez doesn't remember much about his journey to the      United States two decades ago, beyond his parents using a      simple phrase that would change the course of his life:      ``We're leaving.''       Perez was 5 when he left He's never been back.       Perez [is] now a 25-year-old research assistant at the      Johns Hopkins University in       For Perez, the DACA program was a ``relief'' that allowed      him to come out of the shadows. It also allowed him to take      the job at Hopkins, and to get a standard driver's license.       ``To now have it in limbo means that you either lose it      all, and restart all over      again--'' Perez said, trailing off. ``I'm not going to let      that happen. We will win in the end.''  I want Mr.Perez to know that we are going to fight here in the U.Senate, not just for his ability to remain here in the United States but for what that means for the strength of our country.  Our university community in Maryland has strongly supported the DACA Loh, president of the University of Maryland, College Park, called the decision ``antithetical to the core values'' of higher education. He vowed in a letter to students and staff to ``continue to identify all avenues available for offering support.''  Johns Hopkins University President Ron Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar reaffirmed the university's support for DACA, saying that Johns Hopkins University students directly impacted by the decision will be given the aid they need to complete their degrees. President Daniels and Provost Kumar said: ``The decision on DACA will not deter us from working to ensure that all members of our community can participate fully in our mission--the pursuit of excellence in education, discovery and service to the world.''  As President Loh and President Daniels fight on behalf of the DACA children, we need to also let the American people know that we are going to fight for what makes this Nation the great Nation that it is.  The Baltimore Sun also told the story of Monica Perez, who is one of dozens of Dreamers from Maryland who rallied near the White House on Tuesday to protest the decision. The 23-year-old Baltimore woman came to the United States from Mexico when she was 7 years old.

They have been law-abiding residents, they have learned English, and they pay taxes. They have secured jobs that support themselves and their families.  Our Government promised them that they would be protected if they came forward, and now the administration is breaking that promise. President Trump's actions with regard to DACA are an insult to America and are an insult to American values. This action is unjust, it is immoral, and it is without regard for basic fairness. Tearing apart the lives of these young people will make our Nation less safe and will harm our economy.  Ending DACA also does not make sense financially. In Pennsylvania alone, estimates are that ending DACA would cost Pennsylvania $357 million per year in GDP losses. Nationwide, the number is $460 billion from the GDP over the next decade. Ending DACA would remove approximately 685,000 workers from the U.economy. According to the Cato Institute, deporting DACA residents would cost more than $60 billion. Finally, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that 1.3 million young people enrolled in or eligible for DACA pay some $2 billion each year in State and local taxes.

She grew up in Pennsylvania and graduated from college. The United States is the only home she knows.  When I met Audrey, she was worried about the debate about immigration and immigration policy. The debate that we have been having in Washington mostly since January of this year was causing great fear and uncertainty in her community. Audrey is obviously concerned about the immigration debate and, in particular, what happens with  She has worked with Church World Services, an organization that helps resettle hundreds of refugees each year in They provide services to help new arrivals adjust to their new home and become successful members of their local neighborhoods.  Audrey is now a student at American University, pursuing her master's degree in international development--of course, after getting a college education as well.  This is This is who we are as a nation, where young people like Audrey have a chance to work hard and to succeed, to get an education and to contribute to the American economy and to the fabric of our society. We are a country in which hard-working young people who are working to better themselves and their community are given a chance to do so, in a sense, fulfilling or living that dream.  This program, DACA, has allowed almost 800,000 young people whose stories are very similar to Audrey's to grow up and thrive in It makes no sense to heartlessly remove Dreamers from a country they call home.

86,topic-id,664,"Mr.Speaker, I also want to spend a moment to speak about President Trump's decision to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It is one of the cruelest in Presidential actions in recent memory. This was a shameful moment for our country. America has always stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity, but not right now.  The DACA program has allowed nearly 800,000 DREAMers to work, study, and serve their communities and That includes nearly 1,300 DREAMers in my home State of Rhode  The DREAMers are workers and taxpayers. They pay $3 billion in taxes each year, including $2.6 million in my home They contribute $2 billion each year to Social Security and another $470 million to  They didn't choose to come here. They were brought here by their parents as very young children. They love this country. They share our values. They are contributing to their communities every single day.  They are young men and women like Lesdin Salazar, a 22-year-old Rhode Islander who came here from Guatemala with her parents when she was 7 years old. Lesdin was a high school junior when President Obama signed an executive order to establish She was later accepted to Rhode Island College, where she is paying out of pocket today to pursue a degree in teaching. Lesdin also works at Calcutt Middle School in Central Falls, Rhode Island, where she helps kids who need behavioral and emotional support, but she will have to give up this dream unless Congress acts.  The same is true of Ana Abigail Molina, a 27-year-old Rhode Islander who came to the United States when she was just 6 years old. Today Ana works at Thundermist Health Center and has dreams of going back to school to become a surgical technologist. And like so many DREAMers, Ana doesn't really remember much of the country where she was born. She considers herself an  Javier Juarez also considers himself an American, a young man who just graduated from Rhode Island College and is planning to attend graduate school on an academic scholarship at Brown University starting this fall. His dream is to one day attend Harvard Law  Javier has been living in Rhode Island for 18 years. Before DACA, he couldn't drive, get a good job, or go to college, but now he is the first member of his family to graduate from a 4-year university. He, too, will have to give up his American Dream unless Congress acts.  And finally, Maribel Rivera Sosa, who came to Rhode Island from Mexico at the age of 9. When she graduated high school 5 years ago, Maribel didn't think she would be able to attend college, but just days later, when President Obama established DACA, Maribel's opportunities became limitless. She was able to attend the Community College of Rhode Island while working three separate jobs. After earning an associate's degree, Maribel enrolled at Johnson & Wales University, and her dream is to earn a master's degree in health administration.  Who among us thinks that someone who works three jobs shouldn't be able to follow their dreams?  This is just cruel. President Trump is ripping apart hundreds of thousands of families and injecting chaos and uncertainty into the lives of members of our community who know no other home than If Congress doesn't replace DACA with the Dream Act, it will result in $460 billion in lost economic activity over the next decade, including $61 million in Rhode  Republicans in Congress need to bring the Dream Act to the floor right now. We need a permanent solution, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bipartisan Dream We need to bring that bill to the floor. Every Republican who disagrees with President Trump's actions needs to tell Speaker Ryan to bring the Dream Act to the floor.  This Congress must act in a manner worthy of a country that has inspired these young DREAMers and pass the Dream Act without delay.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgH7093.txt,2055,ORDER OF PROCEDURE,2017,7,September
390,topic-id,177,"Mr.Speaker, President Trump shielded Sheriff Joe Arpaio from a prison sentence for criminal contempt, despite Sheriff Arpaio's record of illegal racial profiling and abuse directed at immigrant communities.  The President's latest salvo in his war on immigrants is his tragic decision to end the DACA program, which has given nearly 800,000 innocent DREAMers, who want to be Americans, the opportunity to work and attend school.  In my native State of Virginia, we have more than 12,000 DREAMers, who contribute more than $711 million to our GDP every year--that is contribute.  These young, hardworking DREAMers, who see themselves as Americans, as do I, are contributing to our communities, creating jobs, serving in our military, teaching our children, and caring for our family members. President Trump would learn that if he ever sat down with them, as I have, and so many of my colleagues have, and broken bread with them, and listened to their fascinating, challenging, wonderful stories.  Ending DACA is self-defeating, hurts the American economy, and neglects all that makes America unique.

54,topic-id,1563,"Madam President, for better or worse, history repeats itself--sometimes much sooner than we would like. We now know that Florida officials, as well as those up the east coast of the United States, have begun ordering evacuations as Hurricane Irma has intensified into a category 5 storm which could make landfall this weekend.  It is my sincere hope that all residents of Florida will be safe, as well as those in other States affected by Irma, and that they take proper precautions. If there is one thing we learned from Hurricane Harvey, it is the importance of listening to local officials and leaders when it comes to evacuations and precautionary measures. But whatever happens, we are going to stand by the people of Florida and the Carolinas and others affected, just as they have stood by us in Texas and Louisiana as a result of Hurricane In the meantime, we pray that Irma's trajectory changes.  Down in Texas, of course, we are still thinking about another hurricane, and that is, of course, Hurricane It is hard to believe, but not even 2 weeks have passed since the storm first tore through our towns, great and small. Of course, communities are still reeling from the devastation.  One I visited earlier this week is the Meyerland neighborhood in It has been flooded three times in 3 years. On Monday, I visited the home of a single mom who survived several recent storms unscathed, but this time, Harvey found her home and destroyed it. There is a pile of debris on her front lawn, ready to be picked up by dump trucks. As a matter of fact, as you drive down the street, house after house after house, there are piles of furniture, clothing, drywall, and other debris that has been pulled up and discarded and is ready to be picked up by the dump trucks. Throughout the region, there are piles like that stacked up in Rockport, Aransas Pass, Lake Jackson, and West As recently as this week, let's remember, some of these places were still under mandatory evacuation orders as the rivers crested and higher waters moved downstream.  But here is my main point: As the rubble piles up and up and up, it is sometimes hard to see past the wreckage of the past weeks. Sometimes it is hard to see beyond what is right in front of you. That is why some simple words by historian David McCullough are good to keep in mind at times like this, as we continue to deal with Harvey's aftermath and worry what might follow with  McCullough said:       We think we live in difficult, uncertain times. We think we      have worries. We think our leaders face difficult decisions.      But so it has nearly always been.  He is right. We have been through tough times before. We certainly have been through tough times in storms like Harvey in Texas before. As a matter of fact, back almost a little over a century ago, on September 8, 1900, a hurricane like Harvey--a category 4 hurricane--slammed into the city of Galveston, with winds surpassing 135 miles per hour. Two-thirds of the city was destroyed, and approximately 10,000 people lost their lives--10,000 people. By comparison, so far the death toll of Harvey is 70. So we can be grateful the death toll that was experienced in Galveston was not repeated. Like Galveston, the city of Houston and the surrounding area will recover.  Of course, back in 1900, it took a couple of days for the world to find out what had happened because communication was not what it is now, but when word finally spread, America noticed. One little girl in Chicago sent 10 cents to help because that was all she had--10 cents. Well, that was probably worth a lot more back then than it is now, but it certainly is a lot for a little child. Her story reminds me of a 5-year-old boy in Philadelphia I heard about last week who set up a lemonade stand. Wearing a ``Houston Texans'' hat, he raised more than $400 for victims of Hurricane How remarkable.  What has changed since Galveston? Quite a bit. One crucial difference is that we have gotten a lot better at disaster prediction and response. As a matter of fact, my State--from the Governor on down to our local officials--plans for disasters like these and anticipates them, and it is that planning which has reduced the loss of life and gotten people out of harm's way.  Houston's $503 billion economy will hopefully bounce back quickly, and with our help, it should. The fourth largest city in the country is known for energy, and that is what we here in Washington must devote to ensuring that aid relief is expedited. Supplemental funding to aid the Harvey recovery needs to be voted on promptly. Our friends in the House did it yesterday, and now it will be our turn this afternoon.  The Senate will soon consider legislation that will keep the government's lights on until December 8 and increase the Nation's borrowing capacity. This is important because without lifting the debt limit, we couldn't vote for and send aid to the victims of Harvey because we would be bumping up against the debt ceiling.  More importantly, this afternoon we will consider $15 billion in new emergency funds. These will be available to Texas families who, like the woman I met in Meyerland, are removing their rugs and furniture and rebuilding the very walls of their homes. These funds include $7.4 billion to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, as well as $7.4 billion to HUD's Community Development Block Grant Program and $450 million for the Small Business Administration Disaster Loan  As large as these numbers are, with more than 100,000 people who have actually lost their homes, this is a downpayment, unfortunately, on what will be additional costs that Congress will have to vote on. As a matter of fact, after Hurricane Katrina, Congress voted on seven separate supplemental appropriations before the job was done. As I said, these are large numbers but not in the context of this unprecedented hurricane which dropped 50 inches of rain in 5 days on the city of Houston and the surrounding area. I hope my colleagues will keep in mind the scope of this catastrophe and deliver this funding to those whom Harvey has cost much more than just dollars.  Getting back to the Texas economy, which I mentioned just a second ago, I want to talk about how important it is to get my State back up and running, because it is so important to the U.economy.  As columnist Brett Stephens wrote last week, ``Economic growth isn't just a matter of parking lots paving over paradise.'' Companies oftentimes do real, tangible good. What matters for us today is that they underwrite safety[[Page S5029]]standards and fund scientific research, and they develop new technologies to warn us of impending storms and engineer new materials that make buildings more secure. That is probably one of the biggest reasons why the damage from Hurricane Harvey didn't compare to the damage from the Galveston hurricane of 1900--because of building standards, building codes, and new materials that have been devised to help make buildings more secure. That is why Harvey wasn't like Galveston in 1900, and in the days and weeks ahead, we need to remember how far we have come. That is not to say we still don't have a long way to go.  While the strong Texas economy is crucial to recovery efforts, education will be too. Thousands of Texas schoolchildren have been displaced by Hurricane Harvey, and many public school children are still wondering when their classrooms will be opened, if at all, or whether they will simply be transferred to other schools because their schools literally do not exist anymore.  Yesterday, I spoke with Mike Morath, commissioner of Texas public education, who told me about the many challenges schools in Texas are now facing. For example, an entire school district in Rockport, TX, is closed indefinitely, leaving more than 3,000 students without friends and teachers to go to school with. In the Houston Independent School District, more than 200 schools were affected by the flooding, with at least 50 suffering extensive damage.  Our healthcare facilities are also dealing with other concerns. Bill McKeon, president of the Texas Medical Center--one of the largest medical centers in the world--told us that his employees had problems getting to work due to road closures, debris, and families without homes and vehicles. When your office is in the world's biggest medical complex and employs more than 100,000 people, that is a big problem. It is a big problem, but we are going to deal with it.  Like Galveston in 1900, like New Orleans after Katrina, these storms humble us but provide us the way to show the human spirit and ingenuity that so routinely follows as we rebuild and recover.  Once again, David McCullough's words are useful. He said: ``A sense of history is an antidote to self-pity and self-importance.''  Colleagues, let's keep in mind those wise words of David McCullough as we weather this storm and brace ourselves for the next.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

In his 18 years as senior pastor at the Zion Progressive Missionary Baptist Church, he has been a dedicated disciple of Christ, giving his time, energy, and compassion to lifting up his congregation and the larger Petersburg community.  In addition to his duties as pastor of one of the largest churches in Pinellas County, Reverend Murphy has been a leader in economic revitalization efforts in south Petersburg, and in supporting job training and outreach programs for at-risk youth.

61,topic-id,1184,"Madam President, I am here today to urge the White House and the National Security Council to develop and deliver to Congress a clear, comprehensive U.strategy to address the urgent threat posed by North Korea's nuclear missile program.  I have submitted an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act--the annual national defense bill that we will consider soon--requiring that strategy within 90 days, and I hope all of my colleagues will support it when the time comes.  I am honored to colead two Senate panels that have been focused on this threat for years: the Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces--where I work with my colleague Senator Fischer to oversee our Nation's nuclear arsenal, missile defense systems, and nuclear nonproliferation programs--and the Banking Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance, where I work with Senator Ben Sasse to oversee the development and enforcement of U.sanctions laws.  In my role on these two panels, I have traveled to South Korea, the DMZ, and I have met with U.forces and foreign leaders to discuss our challenges and our options for overcoming them. I have worked with colleagues--both Republican and Democratic--to shape legislation to improve our homeland defenses, strengthen our military, and expand our sanctions in response to Kim Jong Un's dangerous behavior. I have sat in dozens of meetings, hearings, and classified briefings on the subject of North Korea's nuclear program and what we can do about it.  Just yesterday, every Member of the Senate had the opportunity to attend one of these briefings and hear from the leaders of the Pentagon, the State Department, and the Intelligence Community about our various efforts against Kim Jong I am sorry to say I walked away from yesterday's briefing with the same concern I had after every briefing on this subject in the past 8 months. We have operational plans for our military and scattered talks among our diplomats, but we need a substantive strategy.  With each passing week--at times, with each passing day--North Korea is making its intentions clear and its progress toward a nuclear-capable ICBM known to the entire world. We see missile tests with growing ranges, warhead tests with growing yields, test shots that fly over the territory of our allies, and threats that target U.territories. Kim Jong Un says he wants to shoot a nuclear-armed missile into the U.mainland. I take him at his word, as we all should.  In times like this, it is critical every move we make be a deliberate one that moves the ball forward toward the outcome we want, the outcome we need to achieve. We should be doing everything in our power to do that in a way that will not put America's sons and daughters, moms and dads, brothers and sisters who make up our Nation's military in harm's way unnecessarily.  There are more than 20,000 U.servicemembers in South At last count, more than 300 of them were from my home State of Another 40,000 U.troops are in Japan and nearly 4,000 on Guam, not to mention the thousands of sailors and marines aboard our vessels at sea in the region.  I have every confidence in the ability of these men and women to defend our Nation, but we owe it to them to make every appropriate effort to end this conflict in a way that doesn't unnecessarily put their lives at risk.  We talk a lot about a whole-of-government effort. That is not what we are seeing right now when it comes to our response to North I see a Treasury Department that needs to dramatically step up its sanctions enforcement to not just induce pain but to cripple North Korea's ability to progress further on its nuclear program.  I see a diplomatic corps grappling with the top national security priority in the Pacific--bar none--lacking the resources, the guidance, and the backing from Washington to do their jobs. I see a U.Embassy in Seoul with no I see a State Department without key positions filled in various areas, including arms control, nonproliferation, and Asian affairs. I see a Defense Department without an Assistant Secretary for Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities--or, for that matter, an Assistant Secretary for Asian and Pacific Security  We can do better, and we must do better. This is not a partisan critique. It is not fearmongering. It is not a call to arms. This is my effort to speak on this floor, before my colleagues and the country--a request we have all made to the White House many times. Give us a strategy on North Korea and let our country unite behind it.  The country is looking for leadership on this. The world is looking for leadership. Let's define our objectives based on the best interest and safety of our country and our allies and develop our strategy to achieve it. Let us work together across departments and agencies, across branches of government, and across party lines to get there.  This is way too important to not do that. No more mixed messages. No more bluster. We have to act. We can't afford to waste our efforts in chaos and disarray. We have to continue improving our missile defenses and be prepared to use them to protect our territory, the territory of our allies, and all of our people.  We have to sanction Chinese banks that do business with North We have to cut off the lifelines of the Kim regime, including oil supplies and foreign currency--not to topple the government but to eliminate their ability to continue down this murderous path.[[Page S5030]]  We have to be doing far more to get our partners in the region to do more--allies and competitors alike--in service of a goal we all share. There is ample support for all of these efforts in  Senator Fischer and I worked together to provide even more funding for missile defense than the President requested because it is so important. Senator Sasse and I have worked together to gather options from some of the Nation's best and brightest minds on how to shape sanctions that could actually impact North Korea's ability to continue their nuclear program, whether Kim Jong Un agrees to it or not.  I believe there will be ample support among our allies--and even our adversaries--around the world if we provide the kind of clear, forceful, and effective leadership America has always been known for in the past.  There is not a nation on Earth that is safer with the existence of North Korea's nuclear weapons program, and that includes North Korea itself. However hard the path forward may be, we can all agree that the status quo is not enough. It is not even close and will not continue to work.  We cannot fix that without a strategy. I am here today asking the administration--once again, reaching out our hand to them--to take that first essential step forward and asking my colleagues to support my amendment to the national defense bill to require the administration to submit a North Korea strategy to Congress within 90 days. We can do this together.  I yield back.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgS5029.txt,1850,"DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES",2017,7,September

We have a great deal of progress that we have made in making the air cleaner and reducing pollution, but we should continue to learn from the most recent science to continue to improve air quality. Instead, this bill delays needed public health protections like the ozone standard.  My amendment would strike language that delays the implementation of the new ozone standards until the year 2026. We don't have until 2026 to protect our children's lungs. We don't have until that time to protect our seniors who are most subject and vulnerable to respiratory harm.  The consequences of this pollution are real and significant, especially for ozone pollutants. Chronic exposure to ozone at the ground level is dangerous. It increases the risk of hospital admissions. In my district in Minnesota, we have a real epidemic of respiratory injuries known as asthma. North Minneapolis is mostly a low-income community of color and has the highest rates of poverty, unemployment, and asthma.  Our children deserve better. Allowing the implementation of these ozone standards will protect them.  I just want to say, Mr.Chairman, much is said on this House floor about job-killing regulations. As a person who believes in the right of a business to open up and make a profit, I also believe that business must absorb the cost that they impose on society as well.  This rule says you can take all the money you can possibly make as you expand and increase ground level ozone, but you don't ever have to pay the costs of the externalities and the health costs you impose on everybody else.

14,topic-id,456,"Mr.Chairman, let me start by thanking my colleagues and fellow co-chairs of the House Tuberculosis Elimination Caucus, Mr.Young of Alaska and Mr.Gene Green of I am grateful for their support of this measure and for their work to combat tuberculosis around the world. This bipartisan amendment would help move that work forward.  Mr.Chairman, America's investments in global health are not handouts. Combating disease around the world isn't just some pet project to make us feel good about ourselves. When we invest in global health, we are investing in our own security and leadership on the global stage. After all, infectious diseases don't respect borders, and when we fail to fight a dangerous illness or respond to a pandemic overseas, we risk having to respond once it reaches our shores.  At the same time, healthier communities are more protective, more stable communities. Healthier countries are stronger partners on the world stage. And when the United States helps to advance those conditions, we are showing the world what kind of country we are, what American values demand of us.  The reality is we should be investing more in these efforts. One area where we need a lot more support is in the fight against tuberculosis.  TB kills more people worldwide than any other infectious disease. This is especially heartbreaking, Mr.Chairman, because we know how to prevent TB, and we know how to cure it. We know how to cure it, and people are still dying. That is just unfathomable.  Yet, in 2015, 1.8 million people died from this disease, 10.5 million more became infected. One in ten TB patients is also HIV positive, making tuberculosis the top killer of people living with Countries with a high prevalence of TB can see their GDP shrink by 4 to 7 percent.  The World Health Organization tells us we need an additional $2 billion every year to control tuberculosis. My amendment would help to make up part of that shortfall, ramping up USAID's global health programs by $209 million. That would bring our investment in TB assistance to $450 million.                              {time}  1615  These efforts have a proven track record, Mr.In the countries where we are working on the problem, incidence of TB has dropped by nearly one-fifth since 2000, more than twice as fast as countries where we haven't been involved. That is tens of thousands of precious lives saved, and we played a major role in that.  My amendment won't wipe out this disease, Mr.Chairman, but it will save lives, it will build on past successes and move us in the direction of putting a stop to this killer once and for all.  I ask all Members to support this bipartisan amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

I certainly am a strong supporter of international narcotics funding, but the question is: Where do you put the money?  The International Narcotics funding account is well funded and even has money in the pipeline from previous years. Meanwhile, TB control is hugely underfunded and continues to kill more people worldwide than any other disease. That is why the funding is necessary.

550,topic-id,400,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment, unfortunately, would harm American leadership on the global stage, cutting our investment in the international organizations account by $10 million.  Mr.Chairman, this bill already underfunds diplomacy and development when we should be investing more in these critical components of our national security. Cutting resources for our work in international organizations would take us further in the wrong direction.  Just so we are clear about which international organizations we are talking about, they are NATO, the World Health Organization, and the International Atomic Energy  Do we really want to damage the effectiveness of these organizations and our ability to lead from within them?  Congress just passed critical sanctions on NATO is the main organization defending Europe against Vladimir Putin's aggression. But instead of bolstering the NATO alliance, this amendment would only reinforce the reluctance to support the North Atlantic Alliance by some in the administration. This should worry lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as Americans at home following the debate.  How about the World Health Organization? The last time I looked, the World Health Organization was fighting the Zika and Ebola outbreaks. Do[[Page H7124]]we now want to slash its funding and undermine its role of responding to the next major pandemic? I can assure you that the diseases we don't combat abroad today eventually will reach our shores.  North Korea is threatening the globe with nuclear weapons. Iran remains not far behind. So I cannot fathom why we would want to cut funding for the IAEA, given its crucial role in monitoring nuclear safety around the world.  Of course, this amendment would also reduce our support for the U.regular budget. Withholding this funding could cause the United States to fall behind at the U.N., further diminishing our standing in the world, calling into question our commitment as a global leader, and ceding ground to Vladimir Putin and others who are happy to expand their reach but who do not share our values.  In fact, even a senior administration official, our own Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has said on many occasions that while she supports efforts to reform the U.N., she does not support a ``slash and burn'' approach.

447,topic-id,2685,"Mr.President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for September 2017. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, 3. This information is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. The Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act,  My last filing can be found in the Record on July 12, 2017. The information contained in this report captures legislative activity since that filing through September 5, 2017.  Republican Budget Committee staff prepared tables 1-3 of this report.  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays under the most recently adopted budget resolution. This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the For this reporting period, 11 of the 16 authorizing committees are in compliance with their allocations, two fewer than my last report. Legislative activity during this reporting period brought both the Committee on the Judiciary, for a State compact relating to the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission, P.1l5-54, and the Committee on Foreign Relations, for the Countering America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act, P.115-44, out of compliance.  In total, authorizing committees are estimated to increase outlays by nearly $2 billion more than they were allocated over the fiscal year 2017-2026 period. The largest spending violation since the passage of the current budget resolution occurred during this reporting period. The VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017, P.115-46, increased budget authority by $2 billion and outlays by $1.9 billion over the fiscal year 2017-2026 window.  Tables 2-3 of this report, related to activities of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, remain unchanged from my previous report.  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget totals approved by the  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2017, which helps[[Page S5049]]enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA section 311. CBO's estimates show that current law levels of spending for fiscal year 2017 exceed the amounts assumed in the budget resolution for budget authority by $1.8 billion. However, levels for outlays remain nearly $6.4 billion below assumed levels. CBO also estimates that revenues are $1 million above assumed levels for fiscal year 2017 and $8 million above assumed levels over the fiscal year 2017-2026 period. Two pieces of legislation, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, P.115-52, and the Countering America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act, increased revenues this reporting period. The former increased revenues by $7 million over 10 years and the latter by $22 million over the same period.  Social Security levels are consistent with the budget resolution's fiscal year 2017 figures.  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The Senate's PAYGO scorecard currently shows increased deficits of $2.5 billion over the fiscal year 2016-2021 and $1.9 billion over fiscal year 2016-2026 periods. Over the fiscal year 2016-2021 period, legislation has been enacted that CBO estimates will increase outlays by $2.5 billion and reduce revenues by $20 million. Over the fiscal year 2016-2026 period, legislation has been enacted that CBO estimates will increase outlays by $1.9 billion and increase revenues by $3 million. The Senate's PAYGO rule is enforced by section 201 of 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.  Finally, included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate's budget enforcement activity on the floor. Three budget points of order have been raised since my last filing, and each was successful. All of these points of order occurred during the Senate's consideration of H.1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017.  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.

This report is submitted      under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the      Congressional Budget Act, as amended.       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues      are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of      3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for      Fiscal Year 2017.       Since our last letter dated July 12, 2017, the Congress has      cleared and the President has signed the VA Choice and      Quality Employment Act (Public Law 115-46). That act has      significant effects on budget authority in fiscal year 2017.           Sincerely,                                             Keith Hall,        TABLE 1.--SENATE CURRENT LEVEL REPORT FOR SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017, AS OF SEPTEMBER 5, 2017                                            [In billions of dollars]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                 Current Level                                                         Budget Resolution    Current Level      Over/Under (-)                                                                                                   Resolution----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------On-Budget    Budget Authority...................................            3,329.3            3,331.1                1.8    Outlays............................................            3,268.2            3,261.8               -6.4    Revenues...........................................            2,682.1            2,682.1                0.0Off-Budget    Social Security Outlays a..........................              805.4              805.4                0.0    Social Security Revenues...........................              826.0              826.0                0.0----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Source: Congressional Budget Office.[[Page S5050]] a Excludes administrative expenses paid from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the  Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund of the Social Security Administration, which are off-budget, but are  appropriated annually.

CBO estimated that for fiscal year 2017, these sections provided  a combined $872 million in budget authority, which would result in $256 million in outlays. However,  consistent with sections 1001-1004 of P.114-255, for the purposes of estimating the budgetary effects of  those provisions under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Budget Control Act) and  the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act), those amounts are  estimated to provide no budget authority or outlays.c For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as  approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a  result, current level does not include these items.d Periodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the budgetary levels in 3, pursuant to  various provisions of the resolution. The total for the Initial Senate Resolution shown below excludes $81,872  million in budget authority and $40,032 million in outlays assumed in 3 for non regular  discretionary spending, including spending that qualifies for adjustments to discretionary spending limits  pursuant to section 251(b) of the Deficit Control The total for the Revised Senate Resolution shown below  includes amounts for non regular discretionary spending:                                                                     Budget                                                                  Authority         Outlays          Revenues----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Initial Senate Resolution....................................        3,226,128        3,224,630        2,682,088Revisions:    Pursuant to sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional           103,161           43,541                0     Budget Act of 1974......................................                                                              --------------------------------------------------Revised Senate Resolution....................................        3,329,289        3,268,171        2,682,088----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TABLE 3.--SUMMARY OF THE SENATE PAY-AS-YOU-GO SCORECARD FOR THE 115TH                    CONGRESS, AS OF SEPTEMBER 5, 2017                        [In millions of dollars]------------------------------------------------------------------------                                        2016-2021          2016-2026------------------------------------------------------------------------Beginning Balance a...............                  0                  0Enacted Legislation b c d    Tested Ability to Leverage                      *                  *     Exceptional National Talent     Act of 2017 (P.115-1).....

488,topic-id,668,"Mr.President, yesterday, along with several of my colleagues, I introduced the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 2017. This bill would reauthorize a national program to improve the Nation's earthquake preparedness. Senators Murkowski, Gardner, Murray, Wyden, Harris, Merkley, and Cantwell are original cosponsors of this bill, and I thank them for their support.  I firmly believe that, when it comes to a catastrophic earthquake, it is not a matter of if it will occur, it is a matter of when. It is important that we recognize the threats posed by earthquakes and do all we can to plan for the worst. By reauthorizing the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, we will ensure that vital research, assistance to States, and development of early-warning systems continue.  Earthquakes threaten many areas in the United States--some densely populated, some not. The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program helps four Federal agencies--the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.Geological Survey, and the National Science Foundation--coordinate earthquake research and education activities, as well as develop and disseminate information and best practices in order to protect public safety. The most recent reauthorization expired in 2009.  While there is still much that we do not know about earthquakes, we do know that there are many actions that we can take to reduce earthquake risk. We can map active fault lines and utilize geological knowledge to inform where we build. Research can help architects to design buildings that are more earthquake-resistant, as well as ensure that critical infrastructure such as hospitals and powerplants are able to function after an earthquake strikes. Outreach and better coordination can help prepare response efforts, and developing an early-warning system is a critical tool to guard against severe loss of life.  The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act would enable earthquake-prone communities to better prepare and protect themselves by minimizing losses through infrastructure improvements and hazard and risk assessments.[[Page S5052]]  The key provisions of the bill would permanently reauthorize the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, NEHRP; remove outdated language related to earthquake prediction and instead emphasizes the continued development of earthquake early-warning systems through the Advanced National Seismic System; require the production of a set of maps showing active faults and folds, liquefaction susceptibility, and other hazards that can be induced by an earthquake, such as landslides; reduce various administrative burdens for Federal agencies that are disruptive to the essential mission of the program and improves data sharing between agencies; enhance coordination among Federal agencies and with State agencies; provide clear direction to the four Federal agencies charged with overseeing NEHRP--the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.Geological Survey, and the National Science Foundation--to continue working with States and private sector experts on performance-based design features; direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to implement a grant program to assist States with incorporating earthquakes in their hazard reduction portfolios; and direct the completion of a comprehensive assessment of the Nation's earthquake risk reduction progress, as well as remaining areas that require more funding.  The bill has the support of a wide array of groups, including the American Institute of Architects, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Association of American State Geologists, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, the Geological Society of America, the National Council of Structural Engineers Association, the National Emergency Management Association, the Seismological Society of America, and the Structural Engineers Association of I thank those groups for supporting this bill.  We have made much progress to create a more earthquake-resilient nation, but we can do more. This bill provides a positive step forward to ensure that we build on the work that has already been done and continue investing in policies that reduce the risk to life, property, and livelihoods as a result of an earthquake.  I thank the Senators who have joined me in cosponsoring this bill, and I urge the full Senate to promptly take up this bill and pass it as soon as possible.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgS5051-2.txt,1332,1845,2017,7,September

63,topic-id,752,"Mr.President, last month I spoke here about an amazing story I was told when I had the opportunity to host several veterans who survived the sinking of the USS Arizona during the attack on Pearl They recalled to me the incredible story of a true American hero named Joe George, and I would like to briefly remind everyone of that story now.  On December 7, 1941, Joe was a 26-year-old boatswain's mate second class aboard the repair ship USS Vestal in Pearl Harbor, That morning, the Vestal was moored alongside the USS  At 7:48 a.m., many sailors, including Joe, had just finished their breakfast when the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service attacked Pearl  As we know, the Arizona suffered a direct hit by a Japanese bomb that detonated in the ship's powder magazine. The resulting explosion sank the ship and claimed the lives of 1,177 servicemen.  During this unimaginable chaos and carnage, Joe George displayed stunning composure and courage. Joe spotted six sailors trapped in the control tower of the sinking USS These men were severely burned and were searching for a way to safety.  Those six wounded sailors were Seaman First Class Harold Kuhn, Seaman First Class Russell Lott, Gunner's Mate Third Class Earl Riner, Boatswain's Mate Second Class Alvin Dvork, Seaman First Class Donald Stratton, and Fire Controlman Third Class Lauren  Upon seeing these men, Joe threw a heaving line between the Vestal and the Arizona to rescue the wounded soldiers from the sinking ship. Suspended 40 feet in the air, the six sailors climbed 70 feet hand-over-hand across the rope to safety on board the These sailors did all this while enduring injuries so severe that two would succumb to their wounds in the weeks following the attack. As they struggled across the heavy line, Joe George remained close by, all the while encouraging the men to push on.  The four soldiers who survived their injuries each returned to serve with honor during World War II, and then went on to live long lives. Joe George's legacy of heroism will remain alive forever in the children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the four sailors who survived that infamous day thanks to Joe George's incredible bravery and service.  Joe George was never awarded a medal for his role in the rescue of these six sailors, although his commanding officer commended his courageous actions.  When I met one of the Arizona survivors who was rescued by Joe, he told me:       Joe George was never awarded anything for his bravery. He      is no longer with us, but I believe in his memory he should      be awarded the Navy  Lauren Bruner was another survivor Joe saved. He said to me:       The six of us would not have survived except for his      courage, in spite of being at high risk himself. He fully      deserves high commendations for his actions. I feel he should      be recognized for this courage and presented the Navy  In his own words during an interview in 1978, Joe said:       I'll tell you, the only thing I could tell you about that      day. . . . My conscience was my guide.  Well, his conscience was that of a hero. We need more people like Joe George in this world.  That is why today I am committed to honoring Joe and why I rise today with the honor and privilege to call for unanimous consent in the adoption of a resolution honoring Joseph Leon  Joe passed away in 1996, and it is long overdue that the Senate, the U.Navy, and a grateful nation honor the heroism of Boatswain's Mate Second Class Joseph Leon  God bless Joe George, whose immense courage and astounding composure serves as an example for the men and women in uniform who follow in his wake. Let us never forget their heroism and sacrifice.  I would like to thank my colleagues Senators Gardner, Lee, Cotton, McCaskill, and Bennet for joining me in this resolution and for helping to ensure its adoption here today.

My amendment simply prohibits the EPA from using its Chesapeake Bay total maximum daily load and the so-called watershed implementation plans to hijack States water quality strategies.  Over the last several years, the EPA has implemented a total maximum daily load blueprint for six States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which strictly limits the amount of nutrients that can enter the Chesapeake Through its implementation, the EPA has basically given every State in the watershed an ultimatum: either the State does exactly what the EPA says, or it faces the threat of an EPA takeover of its water quality programs.

135,topic-id,438,"Mr.Chairman, I appreciate the consideration of what was two amendments that we just merged into one because they went hand-in-glove.  My amendment restores critical funding to three additional Appalachian States, the same number of States currently funded by the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, for the reclamation of abandoned mine lands in conjunction with economic and community development and reuse goals.  Now, let me explain the program quickly.  This was the brainchild of Chairman Rogers a couple of years back, and what the idea was, originally, when they did the Abandoned Mine Land program, you could just restore the land. They came up with the concept in the hard-hit devastated areas of central Appalachia that we should not only allow it to be a restoration of the land, but that that land could be used and looked at as an economic purpose, a reuse the community could use for community development or economic development, and that was important.  Funding for these reclamation grants was first established in fiscal year 2016, but it was originally provided only to the three Appalachian States with the greatest amount of unfunded reclamation needs.  Unfortunately, that didn't, of course, reach all the States, and so last year, an additional three States were added, those States being Virginia, Ohio, Alabama, the original three being Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and  This year, as things were working through, Virginia, Ohio, and Alabama were not currently included. My amendment basically makes sure they are included. We have worked with the team on the Appropriations Committee to word it correctly. We think we have got it worded correctly so that we now have the ability to add in all three  I think this is important. Folks often say to us: Those of you in coal country, in central Appalachia, need to transition your economy. Well, we can't transition our economy if we have huge blocks of land which we can't use because they are unusable due to prior acts that left them in a condition where we know they need to be reclaimed, but you can't reclaim them looking at economic development.  So this is a way to retool. Chairman Rogers came up with it. We would like to extend it to the other States that would be greatly helped by this, the three that I mentioned previously, Ohio, Alabama, and Virginia, and that is what my amendments do.  I would ask all to support this amendment to help those areas that are economically devastated in central Appalachia and expand on a program which is already showing signs of success.

It ensures that polluters pay for the cleanup and the mess they have caused.  For over 35 years, EPA's Superfund Enforcement program has enabled thousands of site investigations at cleanups and has required viable responsible parties to either conduct the work or pay for the cleanups of these Superfund sites, in other words, hold parties accountable for the action and correction of their activities.                              {time}  1730  Any cuts to these funds clearly places corporate interests over that of the health and financial well-being of the American people.  According to the EPA, the Superfund Enforcement program's efforts to negotiate settlement agreements and issue order for cleanup work accounts for approximately 69 percent of all the cleanup work currently underway at Superfund sites around this country.  For every dollar the Superfund Enforcement program spends, private parties commit $8 toward cleanup work. The enforcement funding is essential in saving taxpayer dollars and the scarce resources of the Superfund trust fund to address truly abandoned and orphaned sites.  As of August 1, 2017, there were 1,845 Superfund sites in the country. These sites include dangerous and toxic substances not just in my backyard but in everybody's backyard.  Perhaps not surprisingly, Superfund sites tend to be located near lower income communities and around communities of color. Approximately 53 million people live within 3 miles of a Superfund site in this country, and 46 percent of them live in poorer communities and communities of color. Fifteen percent of those residents live below the poverty level.  According to a National Association of Clean Air Agencies report: ``Without EPA's enforcement, companies could avoid reporting, or minimize the reported amount of toxic materials released to the environment.''  Following one of the most catastrophic hurricanes to hit Texas, the EPA found that 13 Superfund sites have been flooded or could face damage as a result of Hurricane  Administrator Pruitt has repeatedly tried to justify his cuts to the agency by claiming that he wants the agency to go ``back to the basics.'' I can't think of anything more fundamental than cleaning up the most toxic sites in the Nation to protect the health of the people who live nearby in those communities.  Restoring the ability of the EPA to self-sustain its core mission should be a no-brainer for those on both sides of the aisle. In order to restore the funding, my amendment will make a modest cut to the BLM's oil and gas program. This program is a massive giveaway to the very polluters that have made the existence of the Superfund program a necessity.  Currently, 7,950 drilling permits are approved and not being used. There are 14.4 million acres of public land under lease and not producing. There is no justification to dole out more taxpayer money in order to expedite and speed up the permitting or leasing practices when we have that amount not being used and over close to 15 million acres under lease, as we speak.  A report by Oil Change International recently found that the U.Government provided about $6 billion annually in financial support to the oil, gas, and coal industries between 2013 and 2015. Meanwhile, oil giant ExxonMobil's profits more than doubled in the first quarter of this year, which equaled $4.1 billion in profits for just that one quarter. They certainly did not need more taxpayer money while communities across the United States continue to be exposed to toxic and hazardous pollution.

146,topic-id,449,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment will restore $1 million in cuts to the Environmental Justice program within the EPA, with an equivalent cut to leadership and administration within the DOI Office of the  In 1992, the program was created and originally called the Environmental Equity It was created after a series of releases of reports that revealed polluter sites were disproportionately located in low-income communities and communities of color.                              {time}  1815  With minimal support, the program has provided communities with leveraged resources to do things like revitalize neighborhoods, build health centers, expand affordable housing, create green space and recreation areas, and, more importantly, raise the awareness of the disproportionate treatment in both affected communities and decisionmakers.  Despite this success within the EPA for decades, we are not even close to dealing with the issue of environmental justice.  In 2016, the United States Commission on Civil Rights found that racial minorities and low-income communities are still disproportionately affected by the siting of waste disposal facilities, permitted emissions facilities, and that they often lack the political and financial clout to properly bargain with polluters when fighting a decision or seeking redress.  A report by the staff of the House Committee on Natural Resources found that clean water access and sanitation infrastructure on numerous reservations across the Nation more closely resemble developing countries than they do the rest of the Nearly half of all homes on Tribal land lack access to adequate drinking water, sewage, or solid waste disposal facilities. As a result, Native families often end up drinking unclean water that increases disease risks and impairs Tribal economic development.  Additionally, low-income communities of color have been on the frontline of Houston's petrochemical industry for decades, and when Harvey struck, they were some of the first to feel the effects as chemical plants caught fire, refineries began flaring toxins, and polluted floodwater went into their neighborhoods.  The EPA Office of Environmental Justice helps integrate concerns of these communities within the general activities of the agencies. This is not a program that can afford to be scaled back, especially as concerns of environmental justice continue to arise around Hurricane Harvey and now in Irma's path. It is critical that we protect frontline communities and communities of color from disparate impacts caused by environmental pollution. One million dollars is not a lot of[[Page H7144]]money for this task, but it reaffirms the significance of the office and our sense of equality.  Today I ask my colleagues to join in defense of these communities and show them that Congress cares about their public health, their housing, and their importance as people.  Mr.Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgH7135.txt,1708,INVESTING IN HEALTHCARE RESEARCH,2017,7,September

Mr.Chairman, I am proud to rise in support of this amendment to restore funding to the Environmental Justice program within the This program enables the agency to better assist frontline communities that are disproportionately impacted by pollution.  Low-income and minority communities face disproportionate levels of hazardous pollution and environmental contaminants due to where their members live and where they work.  The harms are real. For instance, higher levels of air pollution result in members of minority groups having higher death rates and higher numbers of emergency room visits and hospital stays.  As the cofounder and co-chair of the United for Climate and Environmental Justice Task Force, it is my mission to combat these environmental injustices and ensure frontline communities no longer bear the unequal burden of environmental, economic, and health harms.  That is why, Mr.Chairman, this amendment is so important.  The Environmental Justice program leverages Federal funds to greatly improve health and quality of life in our most vulnerable communities. Since the establishment of the program, communities have been better able to revitalize neighborhoods, build health centers, expand affordable housing, and create new green spaces and recreational areas.  I urge my colleagues to show low-income and minority communities that we care about their health, housing, and overall well-being by supporting the amendment.

30,topic-id,279,"Mr.Chair, yesterday, we voted $8 billion for the tragedies in the Gulf I wake up this morning and I find out we are supposed to vote for another $8 billion, which is fine. But I think, as a result, we should also look extra hard to find ways to see if, in the bill as it passed out of the Appropriations Committee, maybe we can spend a little less somewhere.  I have a very modest suggestion for cutting a little bit of spending here. I would like a 1 percent reduction in the Economic Support This was in the Trump budget, combined with another fund, and subject to a 40 percent cut, I think because President Trump wanted to make good on his promise to put America first.  I realize political reality is such that we will not get the 40 percent cut that President Trump wanted, but I ask for a small, approximately 1 percent, cut of $12 million.  Part of the money of the Economic Support Fund goes for universities abroad. Sometimes these universities have, like our own universities, a little bit of an anti-American, perhaps anti-Israeli bent; and for that reason, I think there is no question but that we should eagerly look forward to the chance to cut the spending in the Economic Support Fund by 1 percent, particularly in light of the fact that we have now a $20 trillion debt and, particularly, because later today, I bet, after spending $8 billion yesterday, we are going to go for another $8 billion today.

The purpose of my amendment is to prohibit use of funds made available by this act to implement, administer, and enforce the EPA's National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone rule, which was originally published on October 26, 2015.  This rule will make the standards more stringent in other places, in the State of Wisconsin, up and down Lake Michigan, including counties such as Sheboygan As you make these standards more stringent--first of all, it makes no sense because they don't take in the fact that there are areas like mine in which the ozone is coming from outside my district.  For example, Sheboygan County, whatever they do, I don't think they could ever meet those standards because there is so much ozone coming up from the Chicago area. But there is an effect to these standards as well.  The standards make it more difficult for industry along Lake Michigan to operate, to comply with the standards, putting us at a competitive disadvantage not only with other parts around the country, but a competitive disadvantage compared to other areas around the world with much more pollution than we have. Right now our ozone is much less than it was when I was a child. Quite frankly, when I was a child, nobody complained anyway.  Another thing about these ozone standards, it is something that people who are looking out for that not particularly wealthy people should pay attention to. When you aren't meeting the standards, it creates a situation in which your owners of automobiles have to have their cars tested every year. And sometimes these cars have to go through very expensive repairs to meet the standards.  Now, there are people who are going to think that is no big deal because they are maybe wealthy Congressmen and they need to buy a car every 3 or 4 years and they don't have a problem. But if you are somebody who has a 10- or 15-year-old car, maybe you can only afford to spend $500, $1,000 on a car, and then once a year you have to get the car tested. You flunk the test and you have to put $1,000 or $1,500 into it. No wonder we have some people in this country who can't get ahead as long as the environmental extremists are running the  So, in any event, I think it would be good if we don't spend any more money implementing this new rule. Give the EPA more time to reconsider this rule and come up with something a little bit more reasonable.[[Page H7178]]  Mr.Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.

458,topic-id,1125,"Mr.President, before we adjourned for the recess, I came to this lectern to issue a call for comity, cooperation, and compromise. My message that day was simple: If we are serious about legislating--if we are truly committed to doing the work the American people sent us here to do--then we must look beyond the horizon of our differences and find common ground.  Since January, this Congress has been its own worst enemy. It has been mired in the muck of its own making, bogged down by partisan squabbles and gripped by gridlock--the likes of which I have never seen in all my years of public service. I wish I could say the situation across the country is better, but sadly it isn't. The polarization we see in the Senate is only indicative of the division we see all around the The events of August threw that division into sharp relief, but it also showed us our ability to heal--our remarkable capacity to lay aside superficial differences in moments of crisis to come together as one.  In Charlottesville and Houston, August brought us a tale of two cities--one that showed us at once both the weaknesses and strengths of our great country.  In Charlottesville, we saw the worst of America on full display. In the violence, vitriol, and vulgar racism of Nazi demonstrators, we stared evil in the face, and in the terrorist attack that ensued, we saw the ideology of hatred brought to its logical endpoint. None of us will soon forget this attack on innocent civilians. I am sure, in the stagnant human air of that hot summer's day, we caught a glimpse of the darkness buried deep in the soul of  Charlottesville was more than a tragic event. It was a gut-check moment for all It was a national low point that demanded all of us to take stock of where we are as a society and where our rhetoric is taking us.  The men who perpetrated this horrific act of violence--whether by their words or by their actions--represent the dregs of a dying culture, but if the violence in Charlottesville showed America at its worst, then the rescue and recovery efforts in hurricane-ravaged Houston showed our country at its best.  Just 2 weeks after the brutality in Charlottesville, our Nation again watched in horror as Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, unleashing a flood of biblical proportions. Relentless rainfall battered the coast for days, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction and shattered life.  Harvey left behind unprecedented devastation, but it also gave us countless stories of hope and heroism. On national TV, we saw a weatherman rushing to the aid of a stranded driver, pulling the man to safety before the current could take him away. We saw everyday Texans wade in the neck-deep waters to form a human chain, saving the life of a stranger trapped in his car. We watched as three teenage boys navigated the streets of Houston in a fishing boat, driving from house to house to rescue their neighbors as the floodwaters poured in.  These are just a few stories among thousands more. These stories remind us of the hope and humanity borne of tragedy. They bear testament to the innate goodness of the American people, and they show us that, in moments of crisis, our capacity to come together for the good of our communities is really unparalleled.  Tragedies like those in Houston strip us of all that is superfluous, leaving behind only our common humanity. In the moments of peril that moved tens of thousands of Texans to band together to save their city, considerations of race, religion, class, or creed fell into complete irrelevance. The first responders, volunteers, and Good Samaritans who put their own lives at risk to rescue others served indiscriminately. They took no thought for whom they were helping--what their background or beliefs were. Houston's heroes saw only lives that needed saving, and they went to work.  If there is any good that comes of tragedy, it is that for a brief but beautiful moment, we are able to see each other as we truly are--not as Republicans or Democrats, rich or poor, Black or White, but as members of the same community, partakers of the same human condition and children of the same For a brief moment, we are able to see each other as  I pray that the hope of Houston may inspire all of us here in the I pray that we may look to the city's example in the work we have before us, setting aside our petty partisan differences to come together for the good of the I pray that, as Senators, we might see each other as friends and equals, partners and patriots, anxiously engaged in the important work of legislating. I pray that we can esteem each other by our mutual love for this great country, not by the R or D that follows our names.  Now, more than ever, we need strength and unity here in the The challenges we have before us are enormous. In the next few weeks alone, we need to secure emergency relief funding for the victims of Hurricane Harvey, raise the debt ceiling, fix our broken Tax Code, and find a way forward on immigration reform. Our to-do list just keeps growing.  Each of these items taken on its own is challenging, but taken as a whole, our agenda is daunting. But I truly believe we are up to the task. I truly believe we can step up to the plate, just as the people of Texas did, to tackle the challenges before us.  As I said before we broke for recess, the Senate is capable of so much more. I know because I have seen the Senate at its best. I have seen the Senate when it truly lived up to its reputation as the world's greatest deliberative body. I believe we can again see this body at its best.  My central message today is simple. We can do hard things. I know because we have done them before. So let's make laws, not excuses. Let's move forward on an agenda that puts the needs of America's families front and center.  This is an important pivotal time in our Nation's history. It is up to us to[[Page S5031]]make that pivotal time an important time, a successful time, and one where we are brought together to work as colleagues, rather than as opponents, which it has been far too much, as far as I am concerned, over the last number of years.  I hope that we can all get together and do a better job for  I yield the floor  The PRESIDING The Senator from                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgS5030-2.txt,1351,1845,2017,7,September

104,topic-id,168,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment helps our local communities preserve and restore important historic sites through a successful Federal-State partnership.  For more than 40 years, the Historic Preservation Fund has helped our States and Native Tribes leverage funds to revitalize communities and create opportunities for economic growth.  In my district, for example, the Historic Preservation Fund was recently used to rehabilitate Olympia's historic Stoker House, which is now home to a small clinic that provides much-needed mental health counseling services.  This year, funds were also used for Washington State's Youth Heritage Project in Tacoma, which introduced high school students to the maritime heritage of the Puget Sound region.  This amendment would simply restore Historic Preservation funding to last year's levels. It is a small but effective Federal program that deserves continued support.  This is a bipartisan amendment, and I am thankful to have the support of the co-chairs of the Historic Preservation Caucus, Congressmen Turner and Blumenauer, along with Congressmen Smith, Courtney, and  Mr.Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment.

172,topic-id,838,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today full of sorrow and hope for those caught in the cycle of addiction to heroin and opioids.  This destructive plague is taking aim at Americans across the country--young and old, rich and poor, rural and urban.  Nowhere is this more true than in the Chicagoland area, a hub for drug trafficking spreading across northern Illinois, the Midwest, and the United  The collar counties of Chicago have felt it strongly. This year, in Will County alone, there have been 61 accidental overdose cases and 44 deaths from heroin and fentanyl overdoses. This is an extremely discouraging pace, surpassing previous years.  The numbers are similar across the seven counties that I represent in the 14th Congressional Stories have been long untold, and it continues to gain national attention. It still haunts our communities today.  I got involved in this issue more than 3 years ago when I met Ken Chiakas, who lost his 17-year-old daughter Stephanie to a heroin overdose. Together, we launched our community action plan on heroin, an analysis of our community leadership forum on the problem, an audit of existing and proposed community partnerships, and the next steps for our communities, our State, and our county.  In the years following this initiative, I have hosted meetings with law enforcement officers, treatment center workers, advocates for patients and lost loved ones, State and local government officials, emergency room physicians, pharmacists, and drug manufacturers.  Last month, my staff and I traveled throughout McHenry and Lake Counties to hear from local officials firsthand who are experiencing this plague every single day.  Law enforcement first responders are on the front lines fighting drug traffickers and dealers. They are also saving lives by reviving abusers in the midst of an overdose through the use of naloxone. It is now common practice in these police and sheriff's departments to have naloxone ready to be deployed in the hands of capable and trained officers. Many lives have now been spared through its use  But even these encouraging numbers do not tell the whole story. Countless others live and struggle to fight heroin and opioid abuse every day in search of treatment and battling towards recovery. They know what it is like to face an overwhelming force controlling their lives. It affects their relationships, it affects their outlook on life, it affects their ability to obtain and keep quality jobs.  Local officials expressed great concern at the loss of workforce, and the many months and years of career advancement and experience those caught in addiction have lost. Businesses are concerned by their search for qualified workers that doesn't yield enough or any applicants. Families are concerned that, without adequate outpatient treatment, their loved ones are far more likely to relapse, compounding these workforce and community problems.  That is why, among other programs, Lake County law enforcement has worked hard to implement the ``A Way Out'' program. Police officers and sheriffs' deputies come into regular contact with those caught in heroin and opioid abuse, sometimes seeing the same offenders in police stations and prisons several times a month.  Many of these men and women want to be free but don't know how, and a police officer is the last person they think to ask for help. A Way Out empowers police officers and opioid users to work together to end the destructive cycle of abuse, dependency, arrest, and relapse.  The program is simple. Those who seriously want help can ask for it from a police officer or at a police station and can receive help without fear of arrest or inability to pay for treatment. Officers who see the destruction of opioids every day want to help.  All that is required is for the person seeking treatment to choose the path of recovery. Individual motivation is essential to success. As of last summer, 15 people at 8 different police departments have taken advantage of this initiative.  Similarly, DuPage County launched Project Connect, a prearrest program through which individuals who have been administered Narcan are immediately offered treatment options and a case manager to see these men and women through to recovery.  I am so encouraged by and proud of the success stories I hear throughout the 14th Congressional District every day. Hope is near when those in recovery see a vision of what their life can be like after dependency--a life filled with healthy relationships, challenging and meaningful work, and a clear sense of individual purpose.  We must do all we can to offer this hope to those still suffering from heroin and opioid addiction. Connecting affected individuals with the people and organizations best equipped to help them is paramount to overcoming this devastating epidemic.  It remains my goal to make northern Illinois the hub of the best minds and the best practices in heroin and opioid abuse prevention, treatment, and recovery. I look forward to sharing these[[Page H7097]]best practices and recommendations across other congressional districts and the communities that we are here to serve, and ultimately to see lives saved.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgH7096.txt,2015,PERSONAL STORIES OF DREAMERS IN PORTLAND,2017,7,September

283,topic-id,426,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment, which undercuts an important rule meant to protect our public lands and the species that inhabit them.  The National Park Service has an important mission, which is ``to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects in the wildlife by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.''  As a result of this mission, the National Park Service has implemented an important rule that protects a variety of species critical to the ecosystem in our national preserves in  In 1994, Alaska did pass a law that undercut those efforts by allowing for extreme predator control, which led to fringe practices that could hardly be called traditional hunting.  Now, the other side may argue that this amendment is a States' rights issue, but that simply isn't true. These are Federal lands and are, therefore, subject to Federal regulation.  These national lands are intended to be enjoyed by all Americans, including those who visit and hope to have the rare opportunity to see bears and wolves in their natural habitat.  Now, to be clear, Mr.Chairman, the rule that this amendment aims to reverse is not intended to ban hunting in its entirety. The rule simply regulates that there be no use of bait, which has been as extreme as grease-soaked doughnuts and bacon, allowing for point blank shots, no use of artificial light to spotlight black bear dens, no killing sows or bear cubs, no killing pups or wolves and coyotes during the denning season, no hunting of big game that is swimming, no use of dogs to hunt big game, and no predator control simply for the purpose of increasing stocks for human consumption.  Now, these are reasonable regulations that prevent cruel hunting practices. Let us be very clear, Mr.Chairman, that reversing this rule would actually be thumbing our noses at the voices of tens of thousands of citizens who took part in a public comment period process that was extensive.  Before the rule's adoption, the National Park Service held two separate comment periods which resulted in 26 public hearings, two teleconferences, and three tribal meetings. More than 70,000 public comments were received, and the majority of those supported the existing rule. Ignoring this process and the thoughtful public input would be a major slight to the democratic process and to everyone who participated.  These processes are in place to ensure that the voice of the people is heard, and circumventing this is unacceptable.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

288,topic-id,272,"Mr.Chairman, let me continue by saying that the reason I do feel strongly about this is I also believe that this amendment would be bad for the economy and for the people who depend on it.  Every year, wildlife watchers contribute more than $2 billion toward the economy. According to the National Park Service, in 2016, 2.8 million park visitors spent an estimated $2.8 billion in local gateway regions while visiting National Park Service lands in These expenditures supported a total of 18,900 jobs, $644.7 million in labor income, $1.1 billion in value added, and $1.9 billion in economic output in the Alaska economy.  I do believe--and the reason I am speaking up so strongly about this, we all have very strong perspectives on all sides. I do believe that we must do everything we can to preserve our natural lands and their inhabitants, particularly as climate change takes its toll all over the country and the world. In my home State of Washington, which I care deeply about, wildfires are destroying thousands of acres of land and threatening homes, while across the country residences of Houston are reeling from Hurricane Harvey and Floridians brace for Hurricane  We need to invest in our public lands for all Americans so that generations in the future can continue to enjoy the beauty that our country has to offer.

181,topic-id,1316,"Mr.President, I rise to speak briefly about the news this week that the President is terminating the Executive action protecting DACA recipients--Dreamers as we know them--but also putting the burden on the shoulders of this body, the article I branch, to find an appropriate solution.  The President often said as a candidate--and even in his early days as President--that he understood some things about these youngsters. He called them incredible kids, and he also said they would be fine. He did not use that language often in talking about immigrants so those were positive phrases that led many to hope he would continue the DACA Many in his administration wanted him to. Others in this body--this speaker wanted him to continue the program, but he announced he was terminating it in 6 months and asked Congress to step up.  I wanted to just tell you about a couple of youngsters I was with last week. I had a roundtable on DACA at Northern Virginia Community College, which is one of the largest and most diverse community colleges in the United I held that this last week. I had eight students. They were a fascinating mixture of young men and women. I just wanted to come and share some things about their stories because it demonstrates how these young people, these Dreamers, are a source of strength for our country and that we need to accommodate them.  Renata was one of my youngsters. She came to Virginia when she was 3 years old with her parents, her older brother, and sister. She graduated high school with an advanced diploma. Some of us know the International Baccalaureate diploma, which is rigorous. Now, with DACA, she is studying at George Mason, getting a degree in clinical psychology. She does brain injury research. She wants to do that research to hopefully help people like returning veterans who suffer from brain injuries.  Giancarla is a DACA recipient from She came here a decade ago to be reunited with her parents. She hadn't seen her parents in 7 years. She received DACA in 2012. She went to Radford University and graduated with a bachelor's degree in international economics. Giancarla described how she is so appreciative of where DACA has gotten her in life, but she told me the night before we met, she had a conversation with her sister. Her sister was in high school and calling her big sister to describe how scared she was about what would happen if DACA was taken away. She talked about her little sister as a hard-working and studious kid, and she is worried she will not be able to go to college anymore and may be separated from family.  Min is a young man who is a Korean-American born in Korea and a DACA recipient who is at George Mason studying cyber. He talked about his desire to serve the United States and help us with cyber expertise but how the removal of DACA could hurt his studies and could hurt his ability to get security clearances to be able to offer his talents to the country.  Gloria, the fifth of these examples--there were eight students there--is an[[Page S5041]]interesting young lady from She was born in England to Nigerian parents and brought here as a youngster. She will be the first DACA recipient in Virginia to graduate from law school, William and Mary Law She wants to graduate in December and help new Americans with immigration issues.  We talked about all kinds of concerns they have: deportation of themselves or family members, ability to get a driver's license, the ability to lawfully work and pay taxes--and all of these young people work and pay taxes right now--the ability to get instate tuition, which for many is the difference to being able to get a higher education. We talked about all of it, but we also talked about their love for this country, and the fact that for these young students, this country is all they know. Deportation back to a place they don't know is not really an option.  I was also happy to have at this roundtable--because we talked about there is no such thing as a DACA recipient without a DACA ally--parents, teachers, family members, attorneys. They have a support group, and it is really important to acknowledge them too. We had officials from George Mason University, a public, comprehensive university in Virginia; Northern Virginia Community College, one of our community colleges; Marymount College; Catholic University in Northern Virginia--all of these allies, as well as representatives from other groups.  The former publisher of the Washington Post, Don Graham, came. He is funding, with others, a scholarship program to help Dreamers cover cost gaps if they have to pay out-of-State tuition, and this is working to help hundreds of Dreamers across the country. We talked to them and expressed our thanks to them for what they are doing.  I also read stories this week--and I will say this and conclude--about other students. Juan is a 2017 graduate of Virginia Tech and now makes Blacksburg his home. He came to Virginia at age 5 and he said this:       It's really hard for me to think of myself as anything but      a Virginian and an It's really hard to have that      part of my identity detached from me.  That is how he views the reversal on  Guadelupe from the Shenandoah Valley--one of Virginia's very rural areas but has a significant number of DACA recipients. She started her freshman year at Bridgewater College, a small private college in the She says:       This is the only country I've ever known . . . I've pledged      my allegiance to the stars and stripes every day.  This is the country to which these young people pledge their allegiance, owe their allegiance, want to express and act to demonstrate their allegiance. They are doing it already. They are making us proud. We need to step up. It was my great pleasure in June 2013 to join with the Senators from New Mexico, from Vermont, and nearly 70 others on the floor to do a comprehensive immigration reform that included many things but included a protection for these It was part of the education of a naive, young Senator who was in my first year to think: Great, we did something in the I am sure the House will do something, but 4 years later, not only did they not ever take up our bill even in committee, they didn't even pass anything by way of comprehensive immigration reform that we could put in a conference together.  Now the weight of this is on our shoulders with 6 months. Talented students like these 800,000 nationwide, between 12,000 and 13,000 in Virginia, have that fear, that anxiety: Are we going to be forced back into the shadows or, worse, are we or our family members possibly going to be deported?  I will close and say these youngsters again pledge their allegiance to the United States, and they are demonstrating every day that we are richer as a nation because of them. Why would we not want to have these talented young people pledge allegiance to us rather than elsewhere? America has always succeeded because we have been a great magnet for talent--growing our own talent and celebrating it but willing to attract talent from around the world. The society that attracts talent in the 21st century is going to be the society that succeeds. The most precious resource in life right now is not oil. It is not water. It is talent. These Dreamers have it, and we should want it. I hope my colleagues will work together in a bipartisan way, both Houses, to provide a protection.  With that, I yield the floor and notice other colleagues here waiting to speak on the same topic.

The State Revolving Funds are a proven critical tool for States and local communities to make high priority water infrastructure investments that otherwise may not be feasible.  Earlier this year, Onondaga County in my district leveraged over $20 million in funding through the State Revolving Funds to upgrade the Syracuse-Metro sewage treatment plant to continue to improve the water quality of Onondaga Lake, which has made a remarkable recovery.  While I commend the Chairman for his work on this legislation, with the EPA estimating our national 20-year capital improvement need to be over $650 billion for drinking water and waste infrastructure combined, now is not the time to roll back this Federal funding.

To say otherwise is simply untrue. This President wants everyone in the United States to have clean drinking water. He supports this program, and for someone to say otherwise, it is just not true.  She also stated that robbing Peter to pay Paul is something that may be going on here. We are talking about clean drinking water, $250 million of clean drinking water, that would come out of the general fund. I would much rather see a little discomfort from bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., than to see people not have clean drinking water nationwide.  I want to reiterate the importance of supporting the effective State Revolving Fund program. It has done a great job nationwide, and we need in these tough fiscal times to find ways to make these things work. This is a way to do it. Take away from the general fund, take away from instances in which bureaucrats may not be able to rent the car of their choice or have the pencils that they choose or an upgraded computer.

They pick up the pieces of the precious things that we broke, the sacred resources we took for granted, the battles that we were too afraid to fight.  Time and again, by choice and by chance, they have not disappointed. Their broad shoulders carry twice as much twice as far. Their spines prove twice as sturdy as the adults meant to protect them.  American history is littered with the names of young men and women, and even boys and girls, forced to be heroes before their time: the patriots of D-day, memorialized in a statue called the Spirit of Youth in Normandy; 14-year-old Emmett Till, lynched by a lie; Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, all 14, and Carol Denise McNair, 11, four choir girls lost at the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in  The Children's Little boys and girls, kids, who dared defy Bull Connor's firehoses and attack dogs to be arrested and rearrested again and again as a Nation recoiled in horror.

444,topic-id,1813,"Mr.President, I am here today to talk about the DACA Program, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, which is very important in my We actually have 6,000 kids who have gone through that program.  As we all know, 800,000 young people who have lived in the United States since childhood are included and affected by this recent action by the administration, which I strongly oppose. These Dreamers were brought to the United States as children through no fault of their own and are working hard to educate themselves and contribute to our In fact, more than 97 percent of DACA recipients are now in school or in the workforce, and all DACA recipients are required to meet the program's education requirements. One recent study found that 72 percent of all DACA recipients who are currently in school are pursuing a bachelor's degree or higher. According to the American Association of Medical Colleges, more than 100 students with DACA status applied to medical school last year.  The young people who have benefited from DACA have often been in our country almost their entire lives after having been brought here as children. They are valuable members of our community, and they have contributed to our economy and to the fabric of our society. In fact, one recent study estimated that ending this policy would cost the country over $400 billion over the next 10 years.  Ending DACA, which has been in place since 2012, would create tremendous uncertainty and risk deportation for nearly 800,000 Dreamers who are studying and working across our  When I think of the Dreamers, I think of, first of all, the night that the Judiciary Committee, on a bipartisan basis, passed comprehensive immigration reform. There were Dreamers there. They were there late at night and had tears streaming down their faces. Then I think about the time that President Obama put DACA into place and made it so that they could come forward, sign up, and legally work. Now we are going to turn our backs on those same people, those people who were brought here through no fault of their own. Whether or not the current administration disagrees with the past administration, our country made a commitment to them that they could sign up for this program. Back when we passed comprehensive immigration reform, I felt that our committee--the Senators who voted for that bill, both Democrats and Republicans--made a commitment to them that day that we were going to work on their behalf. That is why this is so wrong.  I do appreciate that this morning the President said that he wants to work to pass this bill and that he said the DACA young people do not have to worry over the next 6 months about any actions taken against them. Those are, of course, good things. I just wish this had not happened in this way, but it did.  I am also not surprised that so many people have stood up in support of Senator Durbin and Senator Graham's bill, that so many Republicans, Democrats, leaders in business, leaders in labor, and religious leaders have stood up.  As we discuss the fate of these young people under DACA, I am reminded of someone who is not young--Joseph Medina, who is a decorated Army veteran and an immigrant who just celebrated his 103rd birthday this He is 103 years old. When I found him, he was a young 99 years old. The reason I found him was that we were talking about this very issue--about DACA and about kids, actually, today who want to serve in the military. As we know, through various ways, some of the DACA kids are courageously serving in our military right now. Of course, they will not be able to if they are deported, but just think that we are actually considering deporting people who are currently serving in our military.  In any case, let's go back 103 years ago or so--actually, maybe a little before that. Joseph Medina came to the United States from Mexico when he was only 5 years old. He did not actually know he was born outside of our country. He had been brought across the border as an orphan by his aunt and his stepfather, and he did not know that he had been born outside of the United He had lived his whole life in Sleepy Eye, MN, until he was in an Army boot camp in 1944. At that time, Joseph Medina wanted to serve our country, but he found out that he actually was undocumented.  In his own words to me, he said: Well, back then, the Army really wanted us. The Air Force wanted us. The Navy wanted us. Everyone wanted us.  So what did they do back then?[[Page S5044]]  He said: We would go over to Canada under, actually, the guidance of our military for 1 night.  He said he got to stay in a nice hotel. Then he came back, and he was a legal citizen. I have not looked into how they did this, but that is how they did it. That was, simply, back then.  Then what did Joseph Medina do? He went and served our country. He served under General MacArthur in the That is what he did. When he came back after bravely serving our country, he got married, and he had a boy. I met that guy. That guy served in the Vietnam war.  So we have a dad who served our country in World War II, and we have a son who served our country in Vietnam, all because at that time there were people who said: Do you know what? You were not brought over with any knowledge that you were even being brought over. You were only 5 years old.  They did not deport him when he wanted to serve in our military; they made him a citizen.  Joseph Medina came out here to Washington, DC, at the age of 99 to see the World War II Memorial for the first time. I stood there with him as he looked proudly as that memorial, along with two Dreamers, who were high school students, who actually wanted to sign up and serve in the Air Force, but they were barred from doing that under the way our laws worked at the time.  I am proud of Joe's service, but I even want more. Joe's spirit and his devotion to our country can continue on and be passed on to other generations. That is what this Dream Act is really all about. It is about other kids who were brought into this country without their knowledge and without their even understanding what was happening and allowing them to be part of that American dream.  America is a country created by immigrants. Immigrants have been part of our Nation's greatest achievements. We need to fix our broken immigration system. Of course we do. That is why I supported comprehensive reform so that we would have had money for order at the border, which would have created a very, very long glidepath to citizenship, but there also was a moral compass to that bill. It has been 4 years since we passed that bill, and as we all know, despite the bipartisan support in the Senate, the House failed to act.  By the way, despite reform being good for our economy, I always like to point out to people that of the Fortune 500 companies, 70 of them in America are headed up by immigrants. Of our U.Nobel laureates, 25 percent of them were born in other countries. We literally cut off talent when we cut off immigration.  In my own case, my great-grandparents on my dad's side came over from Slovenia to work in the iron ore mines. When he was in about the sixth grade, my grandpa had to quit school to go work to help raise his eight or nine brothers and sisters, but he always had this immigrant spirit. He never even graduated from high school, but he saved money in a coffee can so he could send my dad to college.  On my other side, my mother's parents--my grandparents--came over from My grandma came over when she was very young--I think at 3 years old. My grandpa came over when he was about 18. He was detained at Ellis Island because they had reached their quota of Swiss immigrants, so he put on his form that he was going to He did go to Canada, but he did not stay in He somehow got through to Wisconsin and was there as an undocumented alien, and he lived that way for 20 years. He married my grandma, had my mom and her brother.  When World War II came along, they required those aliens to register, so he had to register. That is when they found out how he had come in, and they still said that it was OK, that he could register. Then he was kind of emboldened, so he decided to sign up for citizenship. That was when they really looked into it, so he had to have a hearing. He made his case that he had lived here forever and had been there, had had two kids, worked his entire time at a pie shop, and they gave him citizenship. I still have that picture of his shining face with that bow tie. I wonder what would happen to him today if he were to come forward. I am not sure he would be made a citizen despite the long time he had spent in our country.  Now it has happened on both sides of my immigrant family.  My dad ended up being a newspaperman and got to interview everyone from Ginger Rogers, to Ronald Reagan, to Mike My mom became a teacher and taught second grade until she was 70 years old. And I stand before you as the first woman elected to the U.Senate from the State of  That is the immigrant story. That is a story of a family who came in, not in an easy way, with my grandpa in an uncertain status, clearly, when he came into the United So you ask me why I support these Dreamers?

This amendment would prohibit funds from contributing to a number of United Nations agencies that endlessly single out our ally, the State of Israel, for poor treatment.  There are numerous issues with these agencies, but as for UNRWA, the very size of the agency is an underlying problem. UNRWA was created to address the short-term needs of refugees, but it has perpetuated the problem.  As of July 1, 2014, UNRWA had 30,252 employees for 5\1/2\ million registered persons in a number of Middle Eastern countries and territories, compared to the U.High Commission for Refugees staff of 7,700 in 2013, which provides support for 42.9 million refugees in more than 100 countries.

428,topic-id,508,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It simply ensures that the U.Fish and Wildlife Service is following current law, specifically section 4(c)(2) of the Endangered Species Act, by conducting a review of all threatened and endangered plants and wildlife at least once every 5 years.  Time after time, the Federal Government refuses to follow the original intent of the Endangered Species The government designates land as critical habitat despite not meeting the ESA definition, and the government consistently refuses to remove plants and animals from threatened or endangered status even when these species are flourishing and are no longer in need of ESA protections.  But you may ask yourself: How does the government know when the species should be removed from the endangered or threatened list? How does the government know if a species is recovering? The answer can be found in the ESA and its requirement that the Federal Government review all plants or species that are currently listed as endangered or threatened every 5 years.  Under the act, the purpose of a 5-year review is to ensure that threatened or endangered species have the appropriate level of protection. The reviews assess each threatened and endangered species to determine whether its status has changed since the time of its listing or its last status review and whether its status should be changed or maintained.  Because the act grants extensive protection to a species, including harsh penalties for landowners and other citizens, it makes sense to regularly verify if a plant or animal is being properly classified or should be delisted. Despite this commonsense requirement, the U.Fish and Wildlife Service has acknowledged that it has neglected its responsibility to conduct the required reviews for hundreds of listed species.  By enforcing the 5-year review--which is in the law--my amendment will ensure that the U.Fish and Wildlife Service is using the best available and most current scientific information in implementing its responsibilities under that act, including incorporating new information through public comment and assessing ongoing conservation efforts.  Now, I am sure you will hear the ranking member say that the problem is that there is simply not enough money to comply with the law, but the reality is that megasettlements and overzealous regulators have caused the number of species listed under the endangered species list to balloon to unmanageable levels. For the recovery of a threatened or endangered species or plant to be successful, we must prioritize our limited resources to where they are most critically needed.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in ensuring that the U.Fish and Wildlife Service complies with the ESA and that we do not provide money in this bill that would violate current law.

Mr.Chairman, the Preble's meadow jumping mouse is a tiny rodent with a body approximately 3 inches long, a 4-to 6-inch-long tail, and large hind feet adapted for jumping. This largely nocturnal mouse lives primarily in streamside ecosystems along the foothills of southeastern Wyoming south to Colorado Springs, in my district, along the eastern ridge of the Front Range of  To evade predators, the mouse can jump, like a miniature kangaroo, up to 18 inches high. In 1998, it leaped onto the Endangered Species list, a move that has hindered development from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to  Among projects that have been affected: the Jeffco Parkway southeast of Rocky Flats, an expansion of Chatfield Reservoir, and housing developments in El Paso County along tributaries of Monument Builders, landowners, and local governments in affected areas have incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in added costs because of this mouse.  Protecting the Preble's mouse has even been placed ahead of protecting human life and property.  On September 11, 2013, Colorado experienced a major flood event that damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, important infrastructure, and public works projects. As a result of the Preble's mouse being listed as an endangered species, many restoration projects were delayed as Colorado sought a waiver. In fact, FEMA was so concerned that they sent out a notice that stated: ``Legally required review may cause some delay in projects undertaken in the Preble's mouse habitat.'' It went on to warn that ``local officials who proceed with projects without adhering to environmental laws risk fine and could lose Federal funding for their projects.''  While a waiver was essentially granted, the scientific evidence simply does not justify these delays or the millions of dollars in taxpayer money that go toward protecting a mouse that is actually part of a larger group that roams throughout half of the North American continent.  Scientific studies have concluded that the Preble's mouse does not warrant protection because it isn't a subspecies at all and is actually related to the Bear Lodge jumping mouse. Even the scientist that originally classified this mouse as a subspecies has since recanted his work and agrees that the Preble's mouse subspecies designation is no longer defensible.  Moreover, the Preble's mouse has a low conservation parity score. What that means is that hundreds of millions of dollars have already been spent on protection efforts that could have and should have been spent on other more sensitive species.  My amendment would correct this injustice that has been caused by the inaccurate listing of the Preble's meadow jumping mouse. It would refocus U.Fish and Wildlife Service's efforts on species that have been thoroughly scientifically vetted and that should be managed by the Endangered Species  This exact amendment was added to the fiscal year '16 Interior Appropriations bill by voice vote and was added to the fiscal year '17 bill by a bipartisan rollcall vote.

I don't believe it[[Page S5040]]is great heart when he abandons protections for our Nation's It is an unfortunate pattern, and I hope it changes, facing historic low approval ratings, the President desperately rallies his dwindling supporters by exploiting fear and resentment. Such conduct is shameful and unbecoming of the presidency, an office intended to represent our proudest ideals--not play to basest instincts. I have been here with every President since President Ford, both Republicans and We agreed on some things and disagreed on some things, but the Presidents have always seemed to want to present and represent America's proudest ideals.  We live in an unprecedented time when our President prefers to divide us, rather than unite us. Instead of honoring the sacrifice made by transgender individuals serving in our Armed Forces, President Trump decided to ban them from serving at all. When white supremacists violently rallied around hate in Charlottesville, resulting in the murder of Heather Heyer, the President equated those who promote bigotry with those who oppose it. There is no equation. The bigotry shown there and the hate shown there is wrong.  This week the President targets another vulnerable population--Dreamers are American by almost any definition. They came to the United States as children through no fault--and by no choice--of their own. Those of us who have had children or grandchildren know they don't make those kinds of choices. They play by our country's rules. They grow up. They have no criminal records, and seek only the chance to contribute to their communities and make them better. America is their home. Often, it is the only country they have ever known, just as my maternal grandparents came from Italy and found a home in Vermont or my great grandparents--paternal grandparents came from Ireland and found a home in They wanted that to be their home. That was the American dream. When you threaten the Dreamers, you threaten the American dream itself.  The President's attempt to justify this decision as deference to Congress or respect for our courts is disingenuous, at best. It strains reason that a President who signed 90 Executive actions in his first 100 days suddenly cares about deference to the Legislative It borders on laughable that a President who doggedly defends a Muslim ban found likely to be unconstitutional by multiple courts, is now cautious about the litigation risk of defending DACA in court.  Dreamers are our friends and neighbors. They are students in our schools and universities in all our They serve our country in the military. They are among the first responders who come to save your life when there is a fire. Consider, for example, Jesus Contreras, a Dreamer and a paramedic, who saved American lives during Hurricane If we had thrown him out, he wouldn't have been there saving those lives. The President's decision to end DACA is nothing but a cynical ploy to rally the anti-immigrant voices within his base while attempting to escape responsibility for deporting some of the most inspiring Americans in our country.  On Tuesday, I received a letter from Juan Conde, a DACA recipient and resident of Conde was brought to the United States by his mother as a child. In 2007, his mother lost her life battling cancer. This tragedy inspired him to find a way to help cancer patients like her. Unable to pursue his dream of being an oncologist due to his immigration status, he initially decided to pursue a Ph.in cancer research. But Conde wanted to treat cancer patients, not just study the disease. After receiving DACA status, he was able to pursue his dream of directly helping patients, applying to and being accepted into the University of Vermont's Larner College of Medicine, where he is currently pursuing his medical degree. He hopes to spend his career here in the United States treating cancer patients and researching the disease that has taken the lives of millions of Americans, including members of my own family.  Conde is the face of Dreamers have enormous potential and determination to contribute to the only country they have known since childhood. To deny them these opportunities because they were brought here as children by their parents would be cruel and inhumane, motivated more by the toxic xenophobia of this administration than by any coherent policy goals. Stories like Conde's reveal why President Trump's decision to rescind DACA is as senseless as it is callous.

We live in a world where 100-year storms seem to occur every year, so we have to invest in technology, conservation, and infrastructure that will mitigate further damage and make our communities more resilient in these crises.

The National Weather Service, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Sea Grant program, the Flood Map Modernization Program, Watershed Flood Prevention Operations, Regional Coastal Resilience Grants, Community Development Block Grants, and State and Local First Responder Grants--just to name a few--are all critical to these efforts.

This bill cuts $3 billion from the Pell Grant Surplus Program, $190 million in 21st Century Community Schools, and eliminates the comprehensive literacy program. All of these are critical education programs that predominantly help people and students of color.  I am also disappointed that this bill divests in our workforce, especially for communities of color, by eliminating the proven apprenticeship programs and cutting millions of our Nation's job training programs, including reintegration of ex-offenders--again, majority African-American and Latino ex-offenders--reentering into society. This budget cuts millions from that.  It refuses to make in order Congressman Bobby Scott's amendment to strike the prohibition against using Federal funds for transportation to desegregate public schools. We are talking, still, about desegregating public schools in 2017.  What is worse, I offered an amendment in Rules to combat these devastating cuts to communities of color, and Republicans refused to make them in order.

Mr.Speaker, we should not be trying to limit students of color access to education, which the Justice Department is trying to do. Affirmative action is critical to mitigating discriminatory practices that prevent students of color from being admitted into the schools of their choice. Attorney General Sessions needs to back off of this. I tried to do this through an amendment to send that message. Of course, that amendment was not made in order.  Congress can help, though, renew their faith in minority communities, and the minority communities can renew their faith in Congress by not accepting this Trump agenda and support clear policies that demonstrate to people of color that our lives also matter in Unfortunately, this spending bill does just the opposite.  So I hope the Members will understand the message that we are sending to communities of color. I just mentioned a few of the cuts that have been put into this bill. I hope that we work to rectify the problems with it.  It is past time to get back to regular order. It is past time to move each bill individually, also.

439,topic-id,394,"Mr.President, I have been doing a lot of thinking lately about the fascinating men and women of America's founding generation. I want to share with you one of their stories.  Jonas Phillips was a penniless Jewish immigrant to He was an indentured servant, a hard-working businessman, and an American patriot who served in the Philadelphia militia during the Revolutionary During the British occupation of New York City, he sneaked messages past the censors by writing notes in Yiddish, understanding that his adversaries wouldn't be able to understand or decipher it easily.  Years later, Phillips addressed a letter to George Washington and to other delegates at the Constitutional Convention assembled in He urged the delegates not to include a religious test in the Constitution as any kind of requirement for service for the Federal Government because no man, he wrote, should be ``deprived or abridged of any civil right, as a citizen, on account of his religious sentiments.''  Jonas Phillips wrote this letter for a reason. He wrote this because Pennsylvania, the State where he lived, required officials to swear that the New Testament was inspired by As a faithful Jewish person, Jonas Phillips could not do that.  ``By the above law,'' he wrote, ``a Jew is deprived of holding any public office or place of government.''  Thankfully, Jonas Phillips' letter--Jonas Phillips' prayer--ultimately would be answered. The Convention had voted unanimously to ban religious tests for Federal office. The language the Framers inserted into the Constitution was unequivocal upon this point. It said that ``no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.''  When the Founding Fathers wrote the word ``ever,'' they meant it. That word means something in the Constitution, and we need to protect it.  I feel the need to stress this point because of the conduct of some of my colleagues. Yesterday a Notre Dame law professor, Amy Coney Barrett, came before the Senate Judiciary Committee on which I serve. She had been nominated as a prominent legal scholar and lawyer in this country to be nominated as a circuit judge. That is why she was before our committee.  Her nomination has been endorsed by prominent legal scholars from across the political spectrum and across the country, including Neal Katyal, President Obama's Acting Solicitor General in the previous administration.

It would[[Page H7154]]make clear that two laws enacted several decades ago to manage the aftereffects of industrial toxic waste spills would not apply to everyday emissions that are simply a way of life on family farms.  A court decision earlier this year overturned the EPA exemption for agriculture from reporting requirements under the Superfund and emergency planning and community right-to-know laws. This court decision means that over 100,000 farmers and ranchers will be forced to report odor emissions from livestock and poultry manure.  If farmers and ranchers don't submit these reports, they face potential lawsuits from the government and any citizen who wishes to sue them, subjecting them to penalties as high as $53,907 per day for not filing paperwork. Farmers will lose time and money that would otherwise be spent growing our Nation's food supply.  Mr.Chairman, I think that it is important that I note that the Obama administration as well as the Bush administration defended this exemption. This is not a partisan issue.

Off the coast of my district, there are marine protected areas, State waters, Federal waters, and Department of Defense installations. We are a marine life hot spot--some of the best blue whale watching happens a few miles from our shore. We have a booming recreational fishing sector. We have a large shellfish aquaculture ranch that is now operating. We have beautiful beaches. We also have oil and gas activity with some rigs right near our shores. My district is also home to the Port of Long Beach, which is the second busiest port in the United  With so much activity happening, it simply makes sense to have the Navy at the table when NOAA is working on siting for a new aquaculture installation. It makes sense to have the fishery management council weigh in when oil rigs are being decommissioned, and it is a no-brainer that NOAA, the Coast Guard, and the ports all work together to get those massive ships in and out of port safely.  We want these collaborations to happen because we want to have a sustainable ocean economy, and by developing regional plans and having a framework for multistakeholder involvement, we can streamline this process and promote a robust ocean economy that also conserves our precious ocean resources.  Mr.Chairman, as we look to the future, the need for an overarching policy only grows. Issues like sea level rise and ocean acidification are too big and too serious for any one community or agency to tackle alone. Increased aquaculture development and new technologies for clean, local energy are creating economic opportunities but must be thoughtfully implemented.

601,topic-id,1582,"Mr.President, I encourage folks to take a close look at this picture of a forest ablaze in Right now, there are innumerable fires burning across our Some of them are called complexes--a fire complex. Maybe it is referred to as a single fire complex, but that means there may be 10 or 20 different fires within that area.  What we are seeing more and more with the changing climate, with climate disruption, is that we have lightning storms that sweep over our forests, will light up and create multiple fires at one time, and then, because the forest is so much drier, they burn fiercely.  Just last week, Mary and I were hoping to spend a couple days out on the Pacific Crest This is the trail that runs from Mexico to Canada, and we were planning to go down to the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument and experience some of that, but we couldn't because of the intense smoke from fires burning.  Fires in the middle of the State had shut down some of the Pacific Crest Trail near Jefferson, so we decided to go up to the northern end of the trail, the trail that plunges into the Columbia River at a place called Bridge of the Gods, Cascade Locks, and walk south. The plan was to go about 18 miles or so and then pick up the Eagle Creek Trail and come right back through to where we had started. But posted at the start of the Pacific Crest Trail was that the Eagle Creek Trail had been closed and that the loop was shut down due to the Indian Springs fire.  Well, we decided, OK, we can still at least do the first half and maybe continue walking on through to Lolo Pass on Mount Hood and then get a ride and come back around to where we were. The point is that all across Oregon, there were either blazes or smoke from blazes.  Oregon State is a plain, and it is not the only California, Washington, Montana, and parts of Idaho are burning up, and it is getting worse each year.  As we were considering how we were going to progress, we had to bypass a campground at Wahtum Lake because it was shut down. We had to camp on the side of a ridge that was just on the edge of the fire containment area. So we pitched our tent on a steep slope that had a little rock outcropping and a little bit of flat ground, basically about 3 feet by 6 feet. We settled down after a long day of hiking. We were absolutely exhausted.  About 1 in the morning, I woke up and I got a strong whiff of smoke. So I leapt out of the tent, and down below us on the slope last week was this glow. Immediately I was concerned that fire had leapt into the valley below us, and you do not want to be on a steep slope upstream from a fire, especially when that is the direction the wind is blowing--as it was.  I said to Mary: Wake up. Get out of the tent. We may have to make a run for it. And she jumped up.  The glow just stayed the same, and it turned out it wasn't a fire. It turned out that it was a landslide, and the Moon was illuminating that landslide and creating that glow on the slope below us. But we were terrified. You can imagine, if you are hiking through Oregon and suddenly there is a forest fire on the slope below you, you are going to run like crazy.  Well, there were a bunch of folks who were on that Eagle Creek Trail that I referred to, and they were on a section very near the Columbia gorge--that section that hadn't been shut down. They were walking south, but they couldn't go on through the Tunnel Falls area. They could go only a few miles in. But a couple of teenagers went up that trail and started throwing firecrackers, fireworks off the edge of a cliff, and it set the gorge on fire on that Eagle Creek  You can see how the Cascade Mountains plunge down to the Columbia River, and you can see here how that Eagle Creek Trail was lit up. There were 140 hikers trapped by this fire and the fire that Mary and I were dodging--the Indian Springs fire--and they had to retreat to the section of trail that actually goes through a tunnel that is drilled through the basalt. It has a waterfall next to it, and they were dropped supplies overnight before they could be brought out and escape this fire. This fire was raging so much, it had leapt the river--the Columbia River, the largest river by river flow volume in the United States of It had leapt this river to the State of These are just two of the fires of the many that are burning across the State of  There is also the Chetco Bar fire, which is even larger than the Eagle Creek fire. The Chetco Bar fire has continued and now has burned 176,000 acres of Douglas fir and oak and manzanita brush fields. There are 1,700 people working to contain this fire right now and, as of yesterday, it was just 5 percent contained. And, as of yesterday, the Eagle Creek Trail was just 5 percent contained.  Fires are a big problem that is just getting bigger. There are 65 large fires burning across the United States; 19 of those are in You can see how they are spaced out here. Both the Indian Springs fire and the Eagle Creek fire that I referred to are here, and you can see its position and how it leapt across the Columbia River into Washington  There are more in Washington State and more in California and Idaho and Montana going this way. Nineteen of those 65 big fires are represented right here. Another 23 are in nearby  Over the last decade, we have seen an average of about 50,000 forest fires in America each year, with an average of about 5\1/2\ million acres being burned. This year, we are already over 8 million acres, with a lot more acreage that will be burned in the weeks ahead. In Oregon, we have seen an average of about 493,000 acres a year burn. We are over 550,000 acres now--and counting.  So what happens during these intense fire years? What happens is we run out[[Page S5037]]of money to fight these fires, and then we engage something called fire borrowing. There is no FEMA for fires--no Federal Emergency Management Agency for fires. So the Forest Service says: Well, we must fight these fires. I can tell you that a tremendous number of helicopters and planes and ground crews are involved in this effort. It is very expensive to fight them.  We run out of money, and the Forest Service has to borrow from other accounts--from the hazardous fuels fund, which tries to reduce the amount of fuels that will create fires on the front end, so we decrease our effort on the front end in order to fight the fires on the back end.  Forest management funds, forest restoration funds, forest conservation funds, road maintenance funds, and funds that are designed to prepare for future timber sales--all of those are borrowed from. So I have been pushing, I have been fighting for us to get the funds now, right now, to make sure we don't engage in fire borrowing to have to address this challenge, and we have a compromise that has been worked out that is going to help. In the continuing resolution, the funds are based not on the amount the administration wanted but on the fiscal year 2017 level that included $400 million of buffer funds. One-quarter of what was authorized in fiscal year 2017 is now going to be available--and available retroactively--so that it can be used and spent in September, which is still in fiscal year 2017, so in immediate moments we will not have to engage in fire borrowing. That is a victory.  I thank the cochairs of the Appropriations Committee for working so hard to help us get this provision that will stop the fire borrowing problem in the short term. But in the near future, after we are into fiscal year 2018--into October--we will be short funds that were spent for fiscal year 2017, so that will be a challenge we will have to continue to address in the year to come.  We are all thinking a lot about Harvey and its impact on Houston and Texas, and we are all worried about Irma and the fact that it is hitting Puerto Rico, and it is aimed for But let's not forget the fires burning all over the United States at an unprecedented rate, which we need to make sure we address as well.  Under this provision I just mentioned--this compromise that will be helpful in the short term--the Office of Management and Budget has control, and we need to make sure they actually exercise that control and release those funds, so we will have to keep pushing.

Thus, I left Florida in the middle of the night to come back to make sure that it has my stamp of imprimatur on this legislation.  I am very glad that the majority leader has agreed to double the[[Page S5025]]amount, basically $7.5 billion for FEMA and another $7.5 billion for CDBG's, or community development block grants, both of which would be for natural disasters.

Looking at the pictures on anything going north out of Florida, the roads are jammed. The interstates and the turnpike are jammed. The phenomenon that is occurring is that people need gasoline and they are running out on the road, which adds all the more to the chaos. They are going to the gasoline stations and the gas stations are running out of gasoline. So I made an urgent plea yesterday, and I would make that to FEMA again, that we get gasoline into the State of Florida and down into the peninsula, so as the evacuation orders come along the coast, as the hurricane gets closer and closer, people will be able to flee.

479,topic-id,608,"Mr.Chairman, the Environmental Protection Agency spends as much as $50 million a year to employ nearly 200 armed agents at an average cost of $216,000 per year, per agent. In total, over the period from fiscal year 2006 to 2015, the EPA spent an estimated $715 million for its criminal enforcement program. This money could have been better spent on such things as improvement of our water systems.  These 200 special agents were equipped with guns and ammunition up to 30-millimeter, camouflage and other deceptive equipment, night vision, unmanned aircraft, and other military-style equipment.  A 2015 report by Open the Books, noted that EPA spent $24,700 on ammunition between 75-millimeter and 125-millimeter, and $23,000 on ammunition over 125-millimeter. It is difficult for me to imagine that the EPA has a legitimate use for ammunition of that size.  The EPA is just one of more than 70 Federal agencies that employ armed personnel, many of which most Americans would never associate with law enforcement. These include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, the Federal Reserve Board, and the National Institutes of Health, among others.  I think we need to take a step back and reevaluate whether arming the bureaucracy is the best way to ensure that our laws are enforced. Federal agencies should be able to demonstrate their need for armed personnel and, absent such a demonstration, should rely on local or State law enforcement when there is a need for armed protection.  My amendment would prohibit funding for EPA's armed agents and begin to address the troubling trend of militarization in our Federal agencies.  Claim: While I appreciate my colleague's concerns about the militarization of federal agencies, this amendment reaches too far.  Response: It is not my amendment, but the EPA that has reached too far. EPA is the poster child for government overreach, and they have clearly abused the police powers they've been granted.  Claim: This amendment puts EPA employees at risk of bodily harm. They deserve to come home to their families at night.  Response: I agree that every federal employee should be able to come home safe to their families and this amendment would not impact their ability to do so. EPA and any other federal agency that believes that their activities could result in a threat to their employees have the ability to coordinate armed protection with local or state or federal law enforcement.  Claim: This amendment would give criminals a free pass to pollute our air and water and ignore the laws on the books.  Response: My amendment would not hinder EPA's ability to enforce the laws on the books and no one wants to see our air and water polluted. However, we cannot ignore the facts that EPA's criminal enforcement division could be mistaken for a military operation at this point. I want to see our laws enforced, but I have serious doubts that it takes 200 heavily armed EPA agents to accomplish that goal.  Claim: We should have a debate over EPA's need for armed agents but this is not the correct venue for that debate. The debate should take place in the authorizing committees.  Response: That same argument could be applied to every limitation amendment offered to an appropriations bill, but that doesn't stop limitations from being offered and adopted. That said, I am happy to continue this debate should a bill reauthorizing these activities come up.  We recently increased funding for the Capitol Police by $29.2 million which could be more than covered by the reduction I am seeking to EPA Criminal  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

If there is a problem where armed agents or armed personnel are involved, they need to rely on people who are trained to deal with such situations.

So with all due respect, I want to make sure that it is understood that this is not a cut to the EPA's budget.

I intend to meet with Secretary I have known him for quite some time and have full confidence in his ability to lead the EPA in a much better direction than it has been over the last few years.  He inherited this problem. This is not an effort by the EPA to militarize. They already are militarized. This example I gave you from the State of Alabama is just one example of other instances in the State of Alabama, other instances around the country.  We depend on law enforcement to handle confrontational situations. I don't think anyone expects a Federal agency to have people who are trained to the degree that our law enforcement is to handle situations where someone might get injured or killed.  So it is, I think, totally appropriate for us at this point to redirect this funding, to remove this funding for armed agents, who, by the way, as I said early on, and if you want to see this report from Open the Books, we are purchasing 75-millimeter ammunition, 30-millimeter ammunition.

594,topic-id,1676,"Madam President, in Washington, we have a disease--or a syndrome rather. I call it the dinosaur syndrome: big hearts, small brains. Unfortunately, it is a recurring problem year after year, bill after bill, day after day.  In Washington, it is argued that you are more compassionate if you give away more of someone else's money. I would argue that true compassion is in giving your own money away. I would argue that truly rational policy is giving away money that you have. It is one thing to give away other people's money. It is another thing to give away money you do not even possess. As a country, we have a $20 trillion debt. We borrow $1 million every minute. Yet we are putting forward a bill to allocate $15 billion to those who are suffering from Harvey without paying for it and without finding the money from anywhere. We are simply adding it to our tab--adding it to our $20 trillion bill.  How did we get to $20 trillion in debt? Big hearts, small brains. Nobody has the courage to ask: Why don't we pay for it? Why don't we be legislators and stand up like men and women and say: Let's set priorities.  If it is a priority to help those in Texas--and I have great sympathy for those in My family is there. I have family members with 2 feet of water in their house so I have great sympathy for those who are in need, but there is no reason to be foolish. We shouldn't just borrow the money. Why don't we take the money from something less important?  My amendment, the America first amendment, would take the money from money we are going to send to foreign countries. We send billions and billions of dollars to countries that hate us. We send billions and billions of dollars to countries that burn our flag. I think it is a very simple choice, when we are looking at helping those in need in our country, that we quit sending money to other countries.  What my amendment would do would be to pay for the $15 billion in aid by taking it out of the foreign aid account. Who gets the money in the foreign aid account? What is it spent on? I will give you a couple of examples of what we spend our foreign aid on.  We spent billions of dollars--I think it is over $100 billion--on building roads in Afghanistan, blowing up roads in Afghanistan, building schools, blowing up schools, and then rebuilding all of them. Sometimes we blow them up, and sometimes someone else blows them up, but then we always go back and rebuild them. What about rebuilding our country? Why don't we look at our country and rebuild our infrastructure and rebuild our roads? For those who are flooded in Texas, let's help them, but let's help them by not sending the money to Pakistan and to other countries that do not even like us.  In the foreign aid account, we spent $273 million last year teaching people how to apply for more of our money. So it is not bad enough that they take your money and send it to foreign countries that do not even like us, but we teach these people how to apply for more of our money.  We had a televised cricket league that we spent $1 million on in Afghanistan--a televised cricket league. The only problem is, they don't really have any televisions. Why it is our obligation? Why is the U.taxpayer asked to pay for a cricket league in Afghanistan?[[Page S5034]]  We spent $45 million on a natural gas, gas station in Afghanistan--$45 million. It was estimated to cost a half a million dollars--86 times cost overruns. What does it serve up? Natural gas. Who has a car that runs on natural gas in Afghanistan? So we bought them cars. We bought them cars that run on natural gas. Then they had no money with which to buy the natural gas so we gave them credit cards to buy the natural gas. That is where your money is going. If you want to help the people in Texas or those people who may be hurt in Florida, why don't we quit sending the money overseas? These are the people who chant ``Death to America,'' and we send more money to them.  We spent money on home mortgages in We are spending money on home mortgages in Nigeria? We spent money on tourism in This is one of my favorites: We spent money teaching people in Kenya how to use  All I am asking is, Why don't we stand up like men and women, like real legislators? If we are going to have compassion for those in Texas, why don't we have the good wisdom not to just simply add it to our debt? In hysteria--everyone is hysterical--we must give, give, give someone else's money but not only that. We must give, give, give money we do not have. We are going to destroy our country. There have been people who have argued that our $20 trillion debt is the 1 threat to our national security.  So what I am asking is, Why don't we pay for this? Why don't we simply take some money that we were going to spend somewhere else, for something not as valuable in another country, and spend it here? You realize what is going to happen. I will proffer this amendment, and in all likelihood, the swamp--the establishment--will vote this down because they never want to cut a dime of spending. They are always compassionate. They have big hearts. They are willing to give away everybody else's money, but they are never ever willing to pay for it. This is both parties--both the Republican Party and the Democrat Watch the vote and see who is a conservative and who says we should pay for the aid for Harvey and who says, oh, no, that we should add it to the tab.  Where is the $15 billion going to come from? This year, we are going to run a $500 billion debt. There is no money. They are giving away your grandchildren's money to help people. People will say that is compassion, that we are going to help people now. Yet we are stealing it from our kids' futures, and we are stealing it from the future and the soundness of our country, and we are threatening the very security of our country with this enormous and elaborate debt.  Simply pay for it. Simply say: Do you know what? This year, we cannot be so compassionate to people who are wanting to get healthcare in We have USAID money going to Cambodia to help them get cost-effective or lower cost insurance. We could not even do anything with the healthcare in our country. We failed to act on it, but we are sending money to Cambodia to help them with their healthcare. Why don't we act here at home? Why don't we take care of our own problems before we think we can take care of everybody else's problems everywhere around the world?  So we will get a chance to vote today. My amendment will come up shortly, and it will simply say, yes, we are a big, rich country. We can help those in Texas, but we will pay for it by taking the money away from somewhere else in the budget that is less of a priority. We give hundreds of millions--really billions--of dollars to How much do they like us? Sometimes they help us, but sometimes they harbor the enemy. Sometimes they harbor whole networks of people who are plotting to kill us.  What do they think of Christianity in Pakistan? Asia Bibi is a She has been in jail for 5 years--on death row--for being a What do they think of helping us with bin Laden? They did not raise a finger to help us with bin Bin Laden lived among them for years and years and years, and when we finally got bin Laden, we got bin Laden with information from a doctor named Shakil What did Pakistan do to reward the doctor who helped us get bin Laden? Pakistan has him locked up for life in prison.  Really, we need to requestion whether this aid works at all to foreign countries, whether it is counterproductive, and whether we have it in the first place, but we should also ask an important question: Maybe that aid ought to be better spent at home. Maybe we ought to start rebuilding our country instead of always thinking we have to rebuild everybody else's country.  I think this amendment is so easy to decide, and I think the American people are behind me on this amendment. If we were to take this to a huge vote of the entire American public, I think 75 to 80 percent of the American public would say: Do you know what? Let's take care of our problems at home; let's don't send our money abroad. And I think we would win this battle.  Watch this vote because in Washington you will see the opposite. You will see three-fourths of this body or more say: Oh, no, we are not going to cut any spending to anyone. We could never cut foreign aid or welfare for foreign countries. We are just going to add it on to the tab. I, for one, want to be a loud voice to say that it is risking our country's future. It is risking the security of the United States to keep adding to a $20 trillion debt, no matter how good the cause is.  Remember, the next time a politician tells you that they are so compassionate because they want to give away more of someone else's money, ask them how much they gave of their own money if you want to judge their true compassion.

I also want to recognize Congressman Donovan, who is not able to be here today, but I offer this amendment along with him because it does seek to increase funding for the U.African Development Foundation by $15 million, bringing it up to the $30 million that it was awarded back in fiscal year `17.  The U.African Development Foundation is an independent U.government agency that excels at doing development differently. It uses small grants to focus on ventures in the fields of food security, healthcare, education, and technology. Our taxpayer money is maximized to its full potential, as host African governments invest a share of their own money in this grant program. These grant programs are leading to self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship in countries that are plagued by conflict across the world.  In fact, the Center for Global Development has ranked the USADF second only to the Millennium Challenge Corporation on the maximizing foreign efficiency scale.

410,topic-id,395,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  Onshore Order 3, put in place by the last administration, creates a number of unnecessary and duplicative burdens that cause energy production to be much more difficult.  Now, many people visualize that oil wells are drilled into the ground and then they just produce oil on their own; that it flows to the surface magically, and it remains unabated through the life of the oil well. It is not true at all.  What actually happens is that there is a pool of oil at the bottom of the well, and as it is produced, the production gets smaller each day until eventually the small production is classified as stripper well production.  Now, the Saudi Arabians, about every 10 years, come in and kill the stripper wells because that would be approximately 2 to 3 billion barrels of oil a year they could produce that would be shut down here.  In my home county of Lee County, New Mexico, we hunker down when we see these economic attacks coming, and we simply make it through; not because it is economic, not because it is productive, but because it is one of the few economic drivers of New Oil and gas provides about 40 percent of our teachers' pay, 40 percent of police pay. So it is just our way of life.  But the stripper wells are not extremely economic. So when this Onshore Order 3 came into place, it actually is assisting the Saudi Arabians to try to drive stripper wells out of existence because it is the small producers, it is the guys who will stay there and produce the wells when nobody has economic interest in them. They like sweeping up the crumbs off of the energy table.  So Onshore Order 3 puts in processes that require monitoring that is already provided at the point of sale. So it is not as if somehow the government's being cheated. It just is trying to squeeze more out of these uneconomic wells.  The estimates are that we have shut down a great number of those wells, affecting teachers' pay, affecting the economy of New Mexico, killing jobs.  So my amendment is very simple. It would prevent funds from being used to fund the BLM Onshore Order Rule 3.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

417,topic-id,410,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, the venting and flaring rule was, again, put in place by the last administration, intending for BLM to regulate methane. Historically, that had been regulated by the  Now, keep in mind that methane production from oil wells is down 21 percent since 1990, while production is going up. Production is going up, methane production is down. So we wonder why the administration came at the last second to put this rule into place.  Basically, the argument is exactly the same for opposing that venting and flaring rule that what is at stake are not the good wells. Those wells are going to produce in their economic with whatever burdens are placed on them. What is at stake are the stripper wells which, again, make up 2.6 billion barrels of production in the U.every day, 145 million barrels of production in the State of New So you can imagine the economic catastrophe if that 145 million barrels weren't available to the State to both tax and to provide jobs.  Again, 40 percent of New Mexico's pay, roughly the teachers' pay, the police pay, roughly that much comes from oil and gas production. You can do the math and see how much New Mexico would be affected if this venting and flaring rule continues to place the burden on the well.  The estimates are for each well that a cost of $60,000 is going to be required to come into compliance. Again, keep in mind that this rule comes after the methane is more carefully controlled today under greater production than it ever has been. The estimates are that we will lose thousands of wells if this venting and flaring rule continues.  Again, it is the stripper wells which are most at harm. If we lose the 2.6 billion barrels of stripper well production every year because of the high cost of implementation of the venting and flaring rule, that is going to mean we are less energy independent, that we rely more on outside sources. It is going to drive the price of gasoline up. The people who can afford it least are the people at the bottom of the economic ladder. They will be the ones penalized most by rising prices of gasoline and decreasing supplies of oil.

460,topic-id,2203,"Mr.President, we have had a lot of action today in the Senate, which is unusual here, and I wish to address it.  I would like to address this to the people in Texas, Louisiana, and to all of those who just experienced the devastating results and the impact of Hurricane Obviously, our hearts go out to those people, and, of course, we are going to do the right thing and help the people of Texas, which is just what we voted on today. But there is a bigger issue I want to speak to today. I relate to this personally because, just last year--almost exactly to the day--our family was evacuated from our home in South As I speak today, we were just notified today that my wife and mother-in-law, who are there today, will be evacuating this weekend from the south coast of Georgia, trying to get out of the way of the next hurricane--Hurricane Irma--which looks to be a very dangerous storm as well, coming into Florida over the next day or so.  But this crisis that we just saw in Texas and that we might see in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina with the next hurricane--Hurricane Irma--reminds us of a bigger issue. It reminds us that because of our inability to get our financial house in order and as a result of the debt crisis we have today, we are losing the right to do the right thing. Whether it is medical research, whether it is infrastructure, or whether it is education, whether it is funding our military, which we will deal with next week, we are losing the right to do the right thing. By that I mean our own financial intransigence over the last 16 years, primarily, but, I would say, ever since 1965, when we had the Great Society and the great War on Poverty, which has failed miserably. That was another great, sweeping, progressive, liberal program that failed to make any dent in our poverty rate in the United The poverty rate today is fundamentally the same as it was in the days when that bill was signed into law.  Because of our intransigence, our ability to appropriate money to deal with disasters like Hurricane Harvey and potentially Hurricane Irma and others is in danger. Moving forward, we just simply will not be able to continue to deal with these emergencies and crises if we don't have a functioning Federal Government that actually pays its bills and has its financial house in order.  The national debt is actually what pulled me into the political process. It is the reason I am in the Senate today.[[Page S5045]]The people of Georgia understand that this is an underlying crisis that we have been digging here for the last two decades and it simply has to be dealt with.  Today we have $20 trillion in debt. I call that a crisis because we do not have a plan to reduce that back to some reasonable percentage of our This is greater in size than the size of our entire economy. What is worse than that and what is more concerning is that over the next 30 years, we have over $130 trillion, by most estimates, of future unfunded liabilities coming at us like a freight train. That is Social Security, Medicare, pension benefits for Federal employees, and the interest on the debt, primarily.  Here we are dealing with this debt ceiling just today, and I would argue that the debt ceiling has been the most ineffective thing that I have seen in the Over 100 times it has been extended or increased, and it has not slowed down deficit spending in the It has not kept us from having a $20 trillion debt today.  Washington knew this was coming, by the way. We have raised or suspended this debt over 100 times to no avail. It hasn't slowed down the debt spending that we have been doing, particularly over the last two decades.  Two months ago in June, a group of Senators and I listed the debt ceiling as one of the key reasons why we thought we ought to stay here during the month of August, instead of going home and having our work period there, because we felt that this needed to be debated and that we needed to get to a long-term solution.  Exactly 3 months ago today, I stood right here in the Senate and laid out what I thought the real consequences of the debt would be. At that time I said:       Congress is the only enterprise I can find anywhere in the      world that funds its operations the way we fund this      government. The problem is we have a system that is      absolutely, totally broken. It is a fraud that is being      perpetrated on the American people.  I stand by that today. The American people know that this is a fraud perpetrated on them, and that is why I think we have seen change in leadership in the White Just three months later, we see our debt limit today being dealt with in a way that puts in jeopardy our ability to deal with these national disasters, such as hurricanes and fires. We heard just a few minutes ago about the devastating fires in the  Let's be clear. The United States cannot and will not default on our debts. It will not default on our obligations, but this debt ceiling issue should have already been resolved months before now. We actually hit this debt ceiling--just so everybody remembers--in March of this year. The Secretary of the Treasury has been using unusual measures--extraordinary measures, they call them--to keep the government funded during this period of uncertainty. In fact, we hit this debt ceiling at a time when we should have been dealing with the budget. But still today--as I stand here today--we do not have a budget for fiscal year 2018, and we have 15 days until the end of this fiscal year, or the end of September of this year--September 30.  Raising the debt ceiling now just until December 15 isn't what puts our country at risk. The debt ceiling is not the issue here. It is not the problem. It is the unbridled spending that both parties have succumbed to over the last two decades under two Presidents--one Republican and one Our government has grown from $2.4 trillion to $3.9 trillion. That is constant dollars. Neither party can point fingers at the other in terms of the explosion and the size of the Federal  What is worse, as I just said, is that over the next 30 years, our mandatory expenses--it is not our discretionary spending. Discretionary spending in the last 9 years has come down, largely because of the Budget Control Act and because of sequestration. Our discretionary spending has come down from about $1.5 trillion to just over $1 trillion last year. That $400 billion reduction, though, came on the back, primarily and largely, of our military.  The debt ceiling has to be dealt with, but it is not the driver of our problems. The budget process is the underlying release valve that causes this problem, and it allows both parties, particularly in the last 20 years, to spend money we don't have.  The budget process, as I have said before on this floor, has only worked four times in 43 years. We have to appropriate 12 bills a year to fund the Federal The average over that 43-year period is only 2\1/2\. That is the fraud that is being perpetrated on the American people. No other body--no other entity that I can find anywhere in the world--can get away with that. Yet here we are, kicking the can down the road again for another 3 months.  Fixing the budget process alone will not solve the debt crisis, but we will not solve the debt crisis unless and until we fix this broken budget process. We cannot ignore this any longer. We must stop piling up this debt on the backs of our kids and our grandkids.  The fix is readily available. This debt crisis is not something we can't solve. People say: Well, you can't touch Social Security and you can't touch Wait a minute. If we don't touch them, they are going to be broke in 14 short years. In 14 years, the trust funds of both Social Security and Medicare go to zero--zero. People will not be up here changing Members of this body at the rate they are now. It will be much accelerated.  The fix can be done. There are five areas that need attention, and any of these areas can have bipartisan solutions. I will not go into detail today. I will just highlight the five areas, but we have to deal with each one of these on their own merits. The budget process is broken and can be fixed. I believe we have right now, behind the scenes, Democrats and Republicans working together to find a bipartisan, politically neutral platform to present our arguments on both sides of the budget process and to create a budget that actually funds the Federal Government appropriately, without all of this drama and without a release valve of extra spending.  The second thing is redundant spending. We know that the GAO, or the General Accountability Office, and the Congressional Budget Office both agree that we have several hundred billion dollars in redundant agencies and redundant programs.  The third is to grow the economy. This is job one by this This President has said that job one of this administration this year is to do the things necessary with the regulatory environment and the tax environment to grow the economy.  The fourth area is to save Social Security--not to cut it but to save Social Security and save That can be done, and I believe there are bipartisan alternatives that we should be debating right now. In 2\1/2\ years, that has not come before this body, and I don't see it happening in the balance of this year.  The fifth area is that, while we debated healthcare most of this year, we debated the insurance side of healthcare for the individual market and Medicaid but what we never talked about--and we haven't under President Obama, President Bush, and, now, even under President Trump--in this Congress is that we have not dealt with the spiraling drivers of healthcare costs themselves--healthcare delivery, pharmaceuticals, and the fact that the neediest among us are getting the most expensive care in emergency rooms today unnecessarily.  Don't be misled. We are well into this debt crisis. This is not something that can be solved with a 10-year planning horizon. This is a situation where we need to tell the bond market and the world that we are committed to a 20-year or 30-year period in order to fix this debt crisis.  Ideas are coming from both sides of the aisle. One idea comes from the Democratic side that says: Let's pick a time in the future, put a stake in the ground about what target percentage of GDP our debt should be, and then develop a roadmap between today and that point in time in the future to commit ourselves to get there. I applaud that idea. I think that is a genuinely brilliant idea. It is something that other countries have done before and it is something that works.  I hope my colleagues will please remember that, today, every dollar we spend in our country's defense, which is about $600 billion directionally correct in our military and between $150 billion and $200 billion for our veterans,[[Page S5046]]and all domestic discretionary spending, or about $1.1 trillion--every dime of that--is borrowed money. Let me say that again. Every dollar we are spending on our defense, every dollar we spend on our veterans, and every dollar we spend on our discretionary domestic programs, like what we are doing here today, is borrowed money.  This simply cannot continue. I can't think of any taller order. Between now and the end of the year, as we debate the tax changes that we want to make to our Tax Code so that we can become competitive with the rest of the world, let's remember why we are debating that tax issue.  We are debating the tax issue to become competitive with the rest of the world, to grow the economy. That is one of five areas which need to be dealt with. Our regulatory work is the other area in that attempt to grow the economy. But we will not dig out of this debt crisis unless and until we fix our budget process, stop this redundant spending, save Social Security and Medicare, and fix the spiraling nature of our healthcare costs.  I can think of nothing--nothing--in our future the rest of this year that is more important than addressing this budget process as we look at tax and dealing with this long-term debt crisis that we have.

This amendment would prevent funds from being used to expand EPA authority pursuant to section 115 of the Clean Air  Now, this isn't an amendment to assail the Clean Air Act, but there is a flaw with it, which is section 115. That section of the Clean Air Act allows the EPA to mandate State emissions levels to whatever amount the agency deems appropriate if they find two things. They have to find that U.emissions endanger a foreign nation; and the endangered nation has a reciprocal agreement to prevent or control emissions in their own nation.  Now, it was previously argued that the Paris climate agreement met those requirements. When they wrote the Clean Air Act back in the 1970s, they never foresaw the Paris And the Paris Agreement is not a treaty. It is an agreement.  Fortunately, President Trump's decision to withdraw from the agreement has alleviated those prior concerns. Whether you agree with this President or the last one or the future President is immaterial. The point is that this portion of the law shouldn't exist. That authority shouldn't exist at the executive level, especially when we don't do treaties anymore.  Despite the temporary relief, the fact remains that section 115 of the Clean Air Act is just simply bad policy. Section 115 delegates an incredible amount of authority to the executive branch without any safeguards, without any oversight by the legislative branch.

498,topic-id,2280,"Mr.President, it is a tragedy that in the Presiding Officer's home State of Louisiana, in my State of Ohio, and around this country, girls and women, children and adults, are being trafficked online. Sex trafficking is really a stain on our country.  We have taken some actions in the U.Senate to deal with this. We passed four or five bills to increase prosecution of those who engage in this, to ensure that women who are victims are treated as such and not as criminals. We have talked about how to help find missing children. I have been involved in those efforts. We have a caucus here on trafficking which has gotten involved in these issues.  Here is the reality, as I see it. Unbelievably, in the 21st century, this practice of selling people is increasing, and it is increasing primarily because it has moved online, where it is, tragically, efficient.  We have learned, through an extensive investigation over the last couple of years, that there is one website online which handles most of the commercial sex business and most of the trafficking, and that is a website called backpage.com.  What we have done in the U.Senate by focusing on this issue is we tried to determine how do you turn the tide, begin to get to the point where, instead of hearing more and more stories about women and girls and sometimes boys being trafficked online, in fact, we are beginning to get to a situation where we can find ways to get those people into treatment and recovery, deal with their trauma, and begin to stop this horrendous practice. It is really taking away the God-given potential of those engaged in it. There is nothing more horrible than meeting a young girl who has been trafficked and hearing the horrendous stories.  I was recently back in Ohio and had the opportunity to visit with some victims. I remember one young woman in particular told me she was trafficked at age 9--starting at age 9--by her father. He would take her to Super Bowls out of town, and he would traffic her online in their hometown. Imagine the trauma and the heartbreak.  Typically, now it is connected also with heroin or fentanyl or prescription drugs or other opioids. In other words, these girls or women are often made dependent, in part, from their addiction, and the traffickers cruelly use that addiction to force them to do things they would never otherwise envision.  So we know that. We know this is happening. We know it is increasing. We know it is online. What do we do about it?  Unfortunately, as we have learned in our investigation, these websites online that engage in this are largely protected. They are immune from prosecution. They are immune from victims being able to get justice. They are denied justice because of a Federal law which protects these evil people who knowingly are engaged directly in sex trafficking. That is pretty amazing; isn't it? But that is what is happening.  Victims were denied justice just 2 weeks ago, when a judge in Sacramento, CA, dismissed pending charges against backpage.com--this group I talked about--because of what they cited, which is a broad immunity granted by a 1996 law called the Communications Decency  As the court saw it--and other courts have seen it--this law gives third-party website providers or publishers immunity from these kinds of heinous crimes, even if the website is participating in sex trafficking.  The court opinion made it clear, it is up to Congress to remedy this injustice, suggesting: ``If and until Congress sees fit to amend the immunity law, the broad reach of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act even applies to those alleged to support the exploitation of others by human trafficking.''  In other words, what the courts have said is, Congress, this is up to you. You passed legislation--I believe inadvertently--inadvertently--which provides this immunity and protection for these people who continue to engage and participate in--knowingly participate in trafficking, including of underaged girls.  This is just the most recent ruling in a string of judicial decisions that have defended backpage and the other sites from legal challenges, despite their clear involvement in this criminal activity.  In 2016, last year, the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of backpage in a case brought by three girls who were sold for sex on the site, but the court opinion noted that in order to fix the problem, ``the remedy is through legislation, not litigation.'' They called the practice what it is, immoral, but then they said the solution is not more litigation, it is legislation; in other words, Congress, get your act together--get your act together.  These court rulings underscore the need for us to get our act together and to do so with urgency because every day that goes by, more girls, more women are trafficked online, and this must stop.  Having met with dozens of sex trafficking victims, I asked them the question, of course: How did it get to this point? Were you trafficked by someone? How did you find yourself here?  Most of these victims--most of these victims--tell me the same story, which is backpage.com. Their trafficker has them, as they say, off the street corner onto the smart phone--and, again, tragically efficient, in the sense that they may be sold 10, 15, in one case, 20 times during a single evening. They deserve to know we will not passively let this injustice continue. They deserve to know Congress will step up and correct this Federal legislation which we passed in Congress 20-some years ago to deal with this issue.  In August, I visited the Oasis House in Dayton, Oasis is a wonderful place. They welcome up to 11 women at a time to live in a faith-based community which provides them incredible support. It helps deal with the trauma we talked about earlier, helps them to be moving from that trauma to independence. They are getting recovery and support there. So many of these women have had a transformation, and it is wonderful to see them back with their families or back at work.  Speaking with these victims, backpage came up--as it often does. It is just heartbreaking to hear what they had to say--but mostly they can't get justice; that the website that facilitated these crimes against them is off limits.  That is why, in July, after an 18-month investigation into online trafficking, I introduced--along with a number of my colleagues--legislation called Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Currently, we have 27 cosponsors in the We have only had this introduced while we have been in session for 2 weeks because we introduced[[Page S5047]]it just before the August recess, but Senator Richard Blumenthal, Senator John McCain, Senator Claire McCaskill, Senator John Cornyn, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, and more than 20 other Senators have joined in this effort to deal with the real problem, which is the growth of trafficking due to the online presence and specifically some of these websites like backpage.  The bill would make three narrowly crafted changes to what is called the Communications Decency Act to allow backpage and other websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking to be brought to justice.  First, it allows victims of sex trafficking to seek justice against websites. It does so by removing the law's unintended protection we talked about for online sex traffickers. Second, it helps law enforcement by allowing the prosecution of websites, again, that knowingly assist, support, or facilitate a violation of already existing Federal sex trafficking laws. There is already a law in place that makes it illegal to engage in sex trafficking. The exception is, again, these websites online that are protected by the Communications Decency So it basically says that you will be treated like others if you engage in, facilitate, and support it.  Finally, it lets State law enforcement--not just the Department of Justice--take legal action against these websites that violate Federal sex trafficking laws.  The Communications Decency Act, again, was enacted by Congress a couple decades ago--21 years ago--and now it needs to be brought into the 21st century. Again, it is an important piece of legislation, broadly speaking, but on this particular issue--inadvertently, I believe--it has allowed this incredible injustice to continue.  In my view, victims shouldn't have to wait one more day to get the justice they deserve. State and local prosecutors, those on the frontlines, should be able to prosecute backpage and others for their roles in these crimes.  The leading website for online sex trafficking has and will continue to escape legal justice for its active role in trafficking unless Congress acts. The solution is right in front of us. This bipartisan legislation will make the changes necessary. By the way, these are changes that a number of groups on the outside have called for and have strongly supported.  On August 15, I was proud to announce the support of 16 new Ohio organizations and officials who endorsed the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers The list includes anti-human trafficking advocates, human rights groups, State officials, and Ohio sex trafficking victims, among others. This is in addition to the list of dozens of national anti-human trafficking and law enforcement groups who have come out publicly in support of this bill. I appreciate them. I appreciate what the human trafficking advocacy groups do every day, trying to help these victims. I really appreciate our law enforcement officials, and the fact that organizations like the Fraternal Order of Police step forward to support this legislation is very important.  On August 16, the day after we had this endorsement from all these groups from Ohio, 50 attorneys general from across the United States--50, including Ohio's Mike DeWine--sent a letter to Congress asking for the Communications Decency Act to be changed to allow State and local authorities to hold backpage and other websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking accountable.  The letter stated, in part: ``It is both ironic and tragic that the CDA, which was intended to protect children from indecent material on the internet, is now used as a shield by those who profit from prostitution and crimes against children.''  They are right. Initially the Communications Decency Act was put in place to try to shield young people from pornography.  What these attorneys general are calling for and what this Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act will do is allow us to go after these websites. This bill will allow victims to get justice, as I said, and will do so in a way that protects internet companies that are doing the right thing. Notably, we preserve the Communications Decency Act's Good Samaritan provision, which protects those good actors who proactively block and screen for offensive material, shielding them from any possibility of frivolous lawsuits. That is important.  The good actors out there--and the vast majority of websites are good actors--have nothing to do with sex trafficking. In fact, many of them police their site for it. The Facebooks of the world and the Googles of the world are not the bad actors.  We are gaining momentum within the tech community, some of whom have concerns about changing the Communications Decency Just this week, we got a letter from Oracle, strongly supporting the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers They agreed that this narrowly crafted bill will hold the bad actors accountable while protecting well-intentioned websites.  Oracle's letter says, in part:       Your legislation does not, as suggested by the bill's      opponents, usher the end of the If enacted, it will      establish some measure of accountability for those that      cynically sell advertising but are unprepared to help curtail      sex trafficking.  Other tech companies have also joined in the fight to ensure that we can stop sex trafficking. I know they are going to follow Oracle's lead in publicly supporting this legislation.

I know that there are people at home that are thinking: Why would a Member of Congress, the most prestigious body in the world, be embarrassed, dumbfounded?  Well, I was always taught that if you show me your budget or if you show me your legislation, then you are showing me your values.  Representative Scott, my good friend from Virginia, had an amendment that would strike the prohibition that Federal funds could be used to desegregate our public schools in this country.  If you look at the GAO study, there are more schools now that are desegregated than in 1968. We can talk eloquently about the history of the House and what the Democrats did when they were in control and how many amendments were made in order. I am not talking about how many amendments. I am talking about a specifi amendment, a specific issue.  We are perpetuating segregation in the United States of America in our[[Page H7112]]public schools. We are not allowing the States to use funds to promote integration and diversity among our schools.  My State--and I will own this--is still the only State under a Federal desegregation order, because we have not completely desegregated our schools. We still have that ugly history.

362,topic-id,451,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I am proud to support the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, and I encourage my colleagues to support this rule.  As a pro-life conservative, I have long fought to make sure that taxpayers' dollars aren't being used to fund abortions or to fund abortion providers. Whether it is in the Appropriations Committee or here on the House floor, I have repeatedly made the cause for increasing protections for life under the law. Those fights haven't always been easy, and we haven't won every time. But Mr.Speaker, I am pleased that the appropriations bill before us does contain important pro-life provisions.  First, the bill states: ``None of the funds made available by this act may be used to conduct or support research using human fetal tissue if such tissue is obtained pursuant to an induced abortion.''  We all remember the 2015 scandal that revealed how Planned Parenthood officials were systematically altering abortion procedures in order to preserve the organs of babies to sell them to researchers. I said it at that time, and you don't have to be staunchly pro-life like me to be appalled by the thought of harvesting and trafficking aborted babies' body parts for profit.  Our bill will prevent these atrocities from removing any incentives abortion providers might have to harvest and sell babies' organs. Instead, the bill directs agencies to find research using modern, more efficient alternatives to human fetal tissue.  To be clear, I am a strong supporter of the National Institutes of Their research is critical for development of lifesaving medical breakthroughs. However, I believe we must set a clear line of distinction between what is acceptable and what is not.  Second, the bill expressly prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from steering Title X public health funding to abortion providers. Of course, the Hyde amendment has long made it against the law to actually pay for abortions with taxpayer dollars. But the Obama administration had a bad habit of pushing hundreds of millions of dollars to Planned Parenthood in forms of grants and reimbursements for other services. This amounts to a pipeline of funding propping up the Nation's largest abortion provider. It is an abuse of taxpayer money, and I am pleased that this bill cuts it off.  Mr.Speaker, I appreciate my chairman, Tom Cole, for including these important pro-life provisions in our base bill for the first time.                              {time}  1315  It represents real progress for the pro-life movement, and I will continue to fight to see it through the process.

I rise in opposition to this rule, which prohibits a vote of the House of Representatives on an amendment that would prevent the Department of Justice from using its power and resources to supersede all State laws that have legalized the medical use of cannabis.  For 3 years, States have been shielded from having the will of their voters and their people by a prohibition on the Department of Justice that would prevent the Department of Justice from thwarting the will of the people of the States by superceding those State laws when they have determined in the States that the medical use of marijuana should be permitted with their citizens.  The Rules Committee has, thus, been basically--it will be changing the law of the land for 3 years where the 50 States have been permitted, if they so chose, to have the medical use of marijuana.  After this vote, because of this rule, we have been prevented from again providing that prohibition that passed this House on a number of occasions that would prohibit the Department of Justice from superceding State law. In short, a vote for this rule is anti-States' rights. A vote for this rule is against permitting the people of your State to legalize the medical use of marijuana if the Federal Government, if the DOJ, decides.  A vote for this rule will, thus, prevent medical use of cannabis by our doctors in States that would like to permit their people to benefit from illegal use of medical marijuana.

Those $3 billion will immediately be transferred to the drug cartels in Mexico if this rule goes through. That is what it means.

Tropical storm conditions are expected in south Florida less than 48 hours after the time of this vote. Had I remained in Washington, DC, the earliest possible return to south Florida would have given me less than 12 hours to safely secure my home and my mother's home and otherwise prepare my family to face the brunt and the aftermath of a potentially catastrophic storm. Therefore, given these circumstances and the fact that my vote would not have been determinative of the outcome of the measures before the Senate, I felt the prudent course of action was to remain in south Florida, take appropriate actions to protect my family and helping to coordinate efforts between Federal, State, and local officials.  If I had been able to participate in today's Senate vote in Washington, I would have voted to approve the supplemental package before the Senate, but my vote would come despite significant reservations about some of the other items attached to this legislation.

Disaster relief is an appropriate function of the Federal Unlike some previous disaster relief legislation, these funds are to be spent immediately, and are properly targeted to assist the areas impacted by Hurricane Harvey and potentially Hurricane  The rest of this spending package, however, contains items that, under normal circumstances and offered separately, I have opposed.  I strongly disagree with the decision made by the administration to agree to pair funding for FEMA and emergency disaster relief to short-term extensions to the continuing resolution, the debt ceiling and the National Flood Insurance Program unaccompanied by significant reforms.  During my service in the Senate, my support for increasing the debt limit has consistently in the past and will again in the future be conditioned on meaningful spending reforms that address our long-term debt.  Absent extenuating circumstances such as the outbreak of the Zika virus last year, I have consistently opposed passage of short-term continuing resolutions because it is an incredibly inefficient way of spending taxpayer dollars and fails to provide the certainty required for effective planning.  I am frustrated that Congress has once again temporarily reauthorized the outdated National Flood Insurance Program without enacting a long-term solution that makes much-needed improvements for the people of Florida and places this vital program on a sustainable path.  It is shameful these necessary and important measures are not being considered separately. Linking them to funds needed to assist our fellow Americans recovering from a devastating natural disaster is a cynical effort to avoid subjecting these measures to the scrutiny and debate they merit.

Given that Texas continues to recover from the catastrophic effects of Hurricane Harvey and that the State of Florida is facing the most powerful Atlantic storm ever recorded, I have no choice but to support this measures, but I consider the manner in which this measure was structured, linking emergency disaster relief for victims which requires immediate action with other controversial measures we still have time to debate through the regular order, to be among the most politically cynical efforts I have ever witnessed.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgS5048-4.txt,2084,1845,2017,7,September

The $30 million that has been identified would be taken away from the Fulbright Program, which is one of the most effective programs of public diplomacy the United States has ever produced.  Authored by William Fulbright, it has established cultural exchange for decades between the United States and countries around the world and done so much good in terms of projecting American values abroad and inviting people from other countries to come here to the United States to learn about our Nation and what we stand for.  I admit that I am biased. I had the privilege and honor, back in 1984, to go to Greece on a Fulbright scholarship, and I saw firsthand the benefits of that program.  There are 37 current and former heads of state or government and 57 Nobel laureates who are alumni of the Fulbright The various programs of international cultural exchange are a signature of international exchange that we have in this country. It is really the crown jewel of those programs, and to take any money away from the program, I think, is a very serious mistake.

The program now operates in 165 countries around the world, and 49 of those countries match or exceed the funding that the United States puts into the program.  So, in other words, we have invited countries around the world to step up and partner with us through the Fulbright Program on international exchange. They have taken that invitation seriously, and they have put significant resources behind it, which has kept the program strong even though funding, recently, here in this country has been flat.  If anything, we should be increasing our investment in a program like this at a time when public diplomacy and making sure that people around the world understand who we are and what we stand for should be a number one priority.  I urge my colleagues, Mr.Chairman, to reject this amendment. I think it is a mistake.

595,topic-id,1366,"Madam President, Hurricane Harvey is a horrible tragedy. It has ruthlessly taken lives. It has taken diplomas and baby albums. It has taken homes and gardens and playgrounds. It has also given us many new pictures of volunteerism, heroism, and neighborliness, and God bless those many helping hands. It has also revealed the willingness, the advanced planning, and the hard work of many government employees in the State and local governments, in the National Guard, in FEMA, and beyond.  So what are we doing here today in this body? And what should we be doing? What is the specific duty of the U.Congress at this moment? We should provide emergency funding relief. We should provide emergency funding for FEMA and for related agencies. They are doing important work, and they need it.  The amount agreed upon by the administration and the House of Representatives on Tuesday--just 48 hours ago--was $7.8 billion. It passed noncontroversially. The vote was 419 to 3. They did the right thing. So let's approve it. Let's do the exact same thing. Let's let FEMA spend that $7 billion. It is important money. There is a genuine emergency. There is real need. I am a small government guy, but there is a clear and urgent governmental role in this moment, so we should do it.  But what we should not do are unrelated things that we will pretend are hurricane relief. We should not fool ourselves into pretending that the legislation on the floor today is actually doing what it says it does just because it has a certain name on the top of the legislation. What we are actually considering doing today in this body is much, much larger, much clunkier, and much less explicable or defensible to your and my constituents.  Do your constituents know, for example, that far less than half of all of the spending in this bill before us today is in any way related to emergency relief for Hurricane Harvey? Think about that. Do your constituents know that far less than half of the spending is actually related to hurricanes? Shouldn't they know that? Shouldn't they know that the vast majority of the money this body is going to spend today, under the pretend guise of an emergency in the Schumer-Pelosi-Trump bill, is not actually emergency spending at all?  Do your constituents know that we are using the hurricane as an excuse to extend the debt ceiling? Translated, that means we can't pay our credit card bill, so we are just going to take over the credit card company and change our credit limit without any discussion. We are not going to have any conversation about the fact that[[Page S5035]]we constantly spend more money than we have, and we have to borrow to do it.  There is a mechanism by which, when we hit up against our debt limit, we are supposed to pause and have a conversation, but we are not going to do that today. We are going to use the hurricane as an excuse to hide from that truth.  What we are really doing right now is borrowing from our kids. There is no other explanation for what we are doing. What we are doing is we are intergenerationally stealing. We are passing on debt to the next generation for current spending. We are not funding infrastructure here. We are not funding roads and bridges and IT systems and weapons systems. These are not things that could be called investments in the future.  Again, I am not talking about the hurricane spending. We should do all of the hurricane spending. But mostly what this bill is going to do is spend current priorities--current-year money--month over month, as we always do, but we are going to pass the price tag and the debt on to our kids, and we are going to hide from our constituents what we are actually doing. We are not going to admit it. We are not going to have a conversation about it. We are not going to have an honest accounting about how much money we are going to spend. What we are going to do is increase the odds that we will have a debt crisis soon. At the moment that comes, we will have another emergency that we will be able to use as an excuse to do things that we then also will not want accountability for.  We should separate these two things. We should do all of the hurricane spending. We should not do things that are not hurricane spending but, rather, are excuses to kick the can down the road on the nature of the obligations we are constantly incurring beyond our ability to pay.  What we are not doing in this body today is draining the swamp. What we are doing is running a whole bunch of hoses to the edge of the swamp, turning them on to the highest possible volume flow, and then turning our backs on the swamp and shouting that there is nothing to see here. That is what we are doing. We are doing the opposite of draining the swamp today.  Finally, do your constituents know that what we are doing today actually increases the likelihood of both a government shutdown and a government default in December? The odds of a government shutdown are up and the odds of a government default are up in  Do your constituents know that Chuck Schumer--whose title is minority leader, not majority leader--just made himself the most powerful man in America for the month of December? Chuck Schumer has made himself the key man in all negotiations in December because of the legislation we are going to pass today.  Do your voters know that real and fundamental tax reform is going to get less likely because of today?  What is going to happen today is that the calendar for the next 90 days will be laser-beam focused on that December shutdown and showdown, and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi now hold most of the cards for when we get to This is an embarrassing moment for a Republican-controlled Congress and a Republican administration.  Here is the good news. We still have an off-ramp before us. We can do better, and we have a legislative pathway to do better.  I have a motion at the table that is simple. It funds all of the emergency relief that the administration has requested for Hurricane Hear that clearly. What the House did yesterday morning that they negotiated Tuesday night funds all $7.8 billion that the administration says they need for hurricane relief. It passed 419 to 3. We can still pass that same legislation. That is it. That is what my legislation does. It doesn't do anything that is not hurricane relief and pretend it is hurricane relief; it just goes back to the bill that funds all of the hurricane relief that the administration says they need.  I am not offering lots of other stuff. I am not kicking the can down the road on the conversation that we should have tonight and tomorrow and Saturday and Sunday about the debt crisis we face. All I am trying to do is make a bill that says it is about hurricane relief, actually be about hurricane relief instead of a majority of other stuff masquerading as hurricane relief.  In short, if you want hurricane relief, this amendment is your vehicle to get to hurricane relief, not other pretend stuff calling itself hurricane relief. Just as the House did earlier this week in a 419-to-3 vote, we can do hurricane relief clear, plain, and simple, and we don't have to hide a whole bunch of other stuff in it.

320,topic-id,414,"Mr.President, yesterday, the congressional leadership and the President reached a bipartisan deal on three crucial issues: short-term aid for the victims of Hurricane Harvey, the debt ceiling, and government funding.  Alongside the aid package for Texas and Louisiana, the Senate will take up and pass an extension of government funding and the debt ceiling, both to December 15, although that may be modified to December 8, as I understand it. We all agreed to work together to avoid a default in December as well.  This is a good agreement for the American people, and everyone should breathe a huge sigh of relief. This agreement takes the threat of a shutdown and default off the table this month and will help us quickly get resources to FEMA and other agencies that are helping with rescue and recovery in the wake of Harvey and that will, in all likelihood, be needed in the wake of Irma as well.  The Nation has been clamoring for bipartisanship--for the two parties to work together to do the country's business--rather than to engage in needless brinksmanship. Yesterday's agreement was a ray of hope for both parties coming together on the big issues. Also, let it be a ray of hope that both parties can come together to help the  We Democrats have said from the very beginning of this Congress that we are willing to work with our Republican colleagues and the President for the good of the country so long as we do not sacrifice our principles. We have never been for obstruction for obstruction's sake, and we will never be for that. This agreement is a reminder that we do not always have to wait until the eleventh hour--risking shutdown, risking default--in order to compromise and do the right thing. Importantly, this agreement gives Congress a way forward on what are some of the thorniest issues this month, allowing us to move to other vital work.  The 3-month agreement is a compromise. In the past, so many of our colleagues have said: ``If the other party is President, we are not going to do anything to help.'' We did not want to say that. We did not want to say: ``It is all on you.'' We wanted to compromise. A compromise is just that--not dictating what should happen but working together. I give the President credit for understanding that in the Oval Office when Leader Pelosi and I made the compromise suggestion. I thank him for it.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgS5025-3.txt,1036,HURRICANE IRMA,2017,7,September

Let's put a clean Dream Act on the floor, which I believe would pass by a significant margin, and tell these hard-working Dreamers that they belong in this country, too--the country they want to be part of desperately. If the majority leader and Speaker do not offer a clean Dream Act, we Democrats will find other legislative vehicles to attach it to until it passes.  Let me say this. I spoke once again to the President this morning. He called and said that he wanted to help with the Dream There are many ways to help, and here are two. One is to persuade other Republican Senators to cosponsor the bill that has been introduced by Senators Durbin and We now have four Republican cosponsors, and we need more. There are many in the Senate who seem to be sympathetic to the Dream Maybe the President can help them get to cosponsor. The second is to urge my friend, the Republican leader from Kentucky, and the Speaker of the House, Mr.Ryan, to put the Dream Act on the floor We can get this[[Page S5026]]done and get it done quickly. We can end the anguish of so many Americans and make sure that our economy continues to move forward so that it is not needlessly ripped apart.  There is other work that we have to do in healthcare to shore up the marketplaces, particularly by guaranteeing the cost reduction programs. Discussions in the HELP Committee between my good friend, Chairman Alexander, and our great ranking member, Patty Murray, are proceeding in a bipartisan way in, perhaps, the new spirit of the moment--maybe longer than a moment, we hope and pray. I am hopeful that the full Senate, this month, will be able to take up and consider bipartisan legislation that emerges from the committee in order to stabilize and improve our healthcare system.  In a similar vein, we must consider a multiyear reauthorization of CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden--again, in a bipartisan action--are having a hearing on CHIP today in the Finance Committee, and that should be another matter of immediate priority for this  Of course, as the people of Florida brace for Hurricane Irma, and the people of Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands have gone through it now, the Senate must be prepared to quickly respond to that storm just as we are doing with We also have to take into account some of the other disasters that are occurring in States like Washington, Oregon, California, and Wildfires are raging out of control.

Because of the immediate and strong impact of Harvey and, it seems, Irma, we should not forget that our friends in the West will need disaster relief and will need it soon as well.

Of critical importance, the NEA has expanded their reach to help servicemembers who have been diagnosed with TBI, traumatic brain injury, and other psychological conditions. This new partnership is critically important.  The NEA Creative Forces Military Healing Arts Network is a collaboration with the Department of Defense which supports music, writing, and visual art therapy at military care facilities. They are finding that the best treatment for PTSD is yoga, which doesn't cost us anything.  The Creative Forces program places the creative arts therapies at the core of patient-centered care in military medical facilities and invests in research on the impacts and benefits of these innovative treatment methods. The cost-effective, noninvasive arts therapy of those programs rank consistently in the top five ``helpful'' and ``wish to continue'' programs on patient satisfaction surveys of the men and women who have gone through the programs, and over 85 percent of military patients said art therapy was helpful to their healing.  We may even be learning here that this might be the best thing, as Mr.Lance was pointing out, for autistic children.  But throughout the art therapy programs and the work that they are doing, our servicemen and -women are being able to transition away from the basketful of prescription drugs that they carry around with them and lived on and are rejoining their families and life. So when they wheel out of that healing, that psychological skill-building, self-expression, and self-esteem that comes from these programs, that obviously is certainly something that we need to continue.

350,topic-id,828,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, what is happening with the appropriations bills is unprecedented. After passing four appropriations bills earlier this year, we are now considering the remaining eight appropriations bills this week in 2 days. That means that we are debating the funding for roughly two-thirds of discretionary Federal spending bills in just over 4 days.  Has any Member here really had the time to read all 1,035 pages of these eight bills? Better yet, has anyone had time to read nearly all the thousand amendments and determine what the impact of each one would be?  This is the appropriations process we are talking about; the process that used to take us days and weeks and was perfectly open so that all Members of the House were able to propose amendments on the floor. These are the bills that fund programs that impact the life of every American every single day.  But we are not giving them any serious consideration they deserve, and the minority has been virtually, literally, I would say, shut out of the process altogether.  When the majority took control of Congress and the White House, they promised regular order. They have not only broken that promise, they have shattered it and stomped on it. Speaker Ryan is the only speaker in the history of tracking statistics to never have had a truly open rule.  An open rule would allow any Member to offer an amendment that complies with the standing rules of the House and the Budget Not a single one. A bad process, I believe, will lead to a bad product, and these bills are no exception. They are full of provisions that would do real harm to millions of  Inside these bills, the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, passed in the wake of the biggest recession since the Great Depression, would be tattered. The biggest banks still in control of the people who got us in trouble in the first place would be allowed to run roughshod over the economy again, paving the way for another Great Recession or worse.  Try as we could to find out what would be the substitute for Dodd-Frank to prevent them from doing that again, there is no answer they would be able to do it. Under Dodd-Frank, we have had a record-setting streak of more than 80 consecutive months of private sector job growth. Mr.Speaker, this growth didn't come despite this law; it came because of it.  There is also language here that would ramp up the majority's assault on women's health; provisions that would zero out funding for Title X, the Nation's only Federal program devoted to family planning. More than 4 million women depend on it for access to contraception.  The bills would also eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, which serves 2.5 million women and men every year. It is relied on not just for contraception, but for services like breast cancer screenings, wellness visits, and STI testing.  The bills would be truly destructive if they ever became law. They don't appear to have the necessary votes to pass the Senate, since there are not 60 Senators willing to vote for this legislation, and that would make one wonder why are we even going through this charade, because we have only 9 legislative days left in the month of During those 9 days, we need to raise the debt ceiling to pay the bills we have already incurred, to fund the government for the following year, to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program; the Perkins Loan Program, which many low-income students rely on for their college education; and, very importantly, the Federal Aviation All of those expire on September 30.  We also need to address the National Flood Insurance Program, which, on its current course, faces a shortfall of more than $25 billion. And that will expire at the end of this month.

When Speaker Ryan assumed the gavel, he promised to return to regular order and an open process. We have been waiting a mighty long time. Every time we offered an amendment to the bill before us in the Rules Committee, we asked that the rule be open; again, giving all Members a chance to affect that bill. Unanimously, we are voted against and we lose all those votes 9-4. That means that both sides will not be able to affect that bill and it means that regular order is as far away as it ever was.  Here we are, less than a month away from the end of the fiscal year, and we haven't passed a budget resolution through the We were supposed to have a budget through the House, the Senate, and the conference--the conference is necessary to reconcile the House and Senate bills--by April 15.  We blew through the debt limit in March and still have not dealt with that. We have yet to have a single open rule in the Rules Committee under the Speaker's leadership. Believe me, I am sure that an awful lot of Members of this House have something to say about what is going on.  It is no wonder that, according to the latest figures from Gallup, 79 percent of the public disapproves of how Congress is doing its job. No wonder.  CBS News highlighted that it costs the taxpayers an estimated $24 million a week to operate the House of They know that they are not getting their money's worth.  They needed 60 votes to repeal and replace healthcare, when there was no replacement in sight. I am not sure how to describe that as a legislative proposal, but what it sounds like to me is a hoax. We are going to fool you that we have really got a replacement here.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, the rule, and the bill. I hope that my good colleague, Mr.Woodall, and I can help fix this place to do a little better.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

513,topic-id,588,"Mr.Speaker, it happened on a Friday night, August 18, that Sergeant Sam Howard and Police Officer Matthew Baxter responded to a report of three suspicious persons around Palmway Street and Cypress Street in I remember hearing about it. It was unfortunate because a veteran, a marine who lived in our community, had a moment of post-traumatic stress disorder and ambushed these two Kissimmee police officers, killing one nearly instantly and the other only a little over a day later.  Officer Matthew Baxter was 27 years old. He grew up in Baltimore and moved to central Florida after high school. He had been with the department for only 3 years. He met his wife, Sadia, a detective of the Kissimmee Police Department, on the job. He left behind his wife and four young children, the youngest under a year old.  He was courageous and passionate in his devotion to public service, and he was known as a sharp dresser and as someone with overwhelming confidence.  Sergeant Richard ``Sam'' Howard was 36 years old, born and raised in He served in the Army and fought in He was a 10-year veteran of the department and a member of our SWAT team. He left his wife, Billie Jo, and teenage daughter, Unique, behind.  My wife and I got to visit his wife's classroom and brought supplies to her students, knowing how difficult it was.  He was a family man, hardworking, very optimistic, and quite the fast talker, as we were reminded by everybody during his wake.  There are moments like these that test our will, our strength, our compassion. There are moments like these that test our community and even our faith. And more than we can ever imagine, there are moments like these that test the families of Sergeant Sam Howard and Officer Matthew  We are here today and I am on the floor today to proclaim aloud what we already know in our hearts to be true. And make no mistake about it: these men were heroes, and we will never forget their sacrifices.  They are heroes because they got up every day and put on the Kissimmee Police uniform. They went out in our community every day to protect us. And, yes, they put themselves in harm's way every day to keep us safe.  These men are heroes because they were good family men. They were loving husbands, great fathers, and they were pillars of our community.                              {time}  1115  Yes, these men were heroes because when the moment came where they had to lay their lives on the line to protect our community, they did so without hesitation.  For those reasons, we will never forget Sergeant Sam Howard and Officer Matthew  On August 21, 2017, an American flag was flown over our Capitol in honor of Sergeant Howard, and on that same day, an American flag was flown over our Capitol in honor of Officer  These flags cannot take away the pain caused to their families. They cannot take away the pain caused to our community, to their fellow officers, and to the police department in general. But they were flown over our Nation's Capitol for a very good reason--to show that their lives matter, their sacrifices matter, and that their families matter.  For that, they remain in our hearts, they remain in our thoughts, and they will always be in our prayers.  God bless Sergeant Sam Howard, Officer Matthew Baxter, and their families.  God bless the city of Kissimmee, and God bless the United States of                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgH7099.txt,1E+14,"PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3354, DEPARTMENT OF THE",2017,7,September

I am honored to come here today and follow Senator Leahy and Senator Kaine and their speeches on I have also watched over the last couple of days, and I think almost every Democratic Senator has been down to the floor to speak with passion about this issue. I am just so proud of our caucus and our Members who have stood up and called the President on this issue.  Today, I stand with millions of Americans protesting the President's heartless decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program known as This inhumane and cruel decision threatens the hopes and aspirations of our country's young Dreamers, and there is no doubt it will harm the economy. I call on all Members of Congress--especially the Republican leadership--to act now and to act swiftly to keep families together and allow these kids to realize their huge potential by making DACA the law of the land. That is what we need to do, make DACA the law of the land. If the President will not do the right thing, then Congress must take action and Congress must do this.  Democrats, Republicans, and Independents across New Mexico and throughout our country agree that Dreamers deserve to live and work in the United According to a Morning Consult-Politico poll released this week, 76 percent support allowing them to stay--76 percent Democrats, Republicans, What a big number.  Most Americans agree that our Nation benefits from the contribution immigrants make in our communities and our economy. They believe our government should honor its promise to Many of these young people came here as small children and have not known any other country.  Take Roxana came to Santa Fe, NM, when she was 1 year old. She is now 22. She registered with DACA as soon as she could. She completed the paperwork, paid the fee, and she has complied with all of the requirements. She now works as a medical assistant with La Familia Medical Center in Santa La Familia is a great healthcare clinic. It provides excellent medical care to everyone in Santa Fe, including many immigrants and low-income patients.  Roxana loves her work at La Familia, and she loves being able to help her fellow immigrants. Roxana had plans to go to nursing school, but the President's action to end DACA jeopardizes those plans and puts them on hold. In Roxana's words, ``Santa Fe, NM, is my home. It's where I know people. It's where I've lived. It's where I've gone to school. It's where I've grown up. It's my life. It's something that is mine but doesn't truly belong to me.''  Those are her words. We must give Roxana and the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers what should truly belong to them.  Dreamers more than pull their economic weight in our country; 97 percent are employed or are in school or do both. They work in Fortune 500 companies and public schools. They labor on farms and dairies. They create businesses, volunteer in our communities, pay taxes, and pay into Social Security and Why would we choose to kick some of our most talented and most productive workers out of the country? Why kick some of our best and brightest young people out of this country?  Ending DACA would cause chaos for employers. Forcing these motivated young people out of work could cost us 700,000 jobs--as many as 30,000 a month. That adds up to $460.3 billion in economic output over the next 10 years. Medicare and Social Security contributions could drop by $24.6 billion over the same period of time.  One of those young people who contributes in New Mexico is Brandon came with his mother from Mexico to the United States when he[[Page S5042]]was 2 years old. Brandon goes to college and studies every day to be an architect, and he makes straight A's. He holds down a job to help support his family with medical bills and volunteers in his community. Brandon is grateful for the DACA Program that has given him the opportunity to work and pay taxes. Yes, he is grateful to pay taxes.  This President continues to divide our country like no other President we have known. Every day it is clear that his values are not in line with ours. I increasingly believe he is not fit to lead this great  His campaign began with anti-immigrant and racist rhetoric. He accused Mexican immigrants of being rapists and criminals, and his bigoted words have never stopped. He called for a wall along the entire border with Mexico--a wall that would cost billions of tax dollars and which border communities don't want. He called for a ban on Muslim refugees--turning our backs on people who are fighting terrorism and who value the freedoms that we have here in the United He tacitly accepted the support of the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and bigots in He pardoned a law enforcement officer who terrorized the Latino community in Maricopa County, AZ, with unconstitutional raids and who forced detainees into inhumane living situations.

70,topic-id,792,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak about the recent decision made by the Trump administration to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.  By ending the DACA program, this administration leaves 800,000 people, mostly young adults and children, without any legal protections.  DACA gives these individuals, most of whom were brought to the United States as very young children, the opportunity to work hard, study hard, sustain their families, and contribute to their communities. DACA recipients are taxpayers, they are students, they are soldiers, and they are our neighbors.  I would like to mention one DACA recipient that I know. Her name is Jacqueline was brought to the United States when she was 2 years old. She excelled in school and was an Advancement Via Individual Determination--or what we call AVID--student in high school. She did very well. She was a strong candidate for admission to many of our top universities.  When DACA was announced in 2012, it helped Jacqueline come out of the shadows and pursue her educational dreams. She did exactly that, and now she is a double major. She is doing very well. DACA gave Jacqueline and her family hope for a better future. It gave her a chance at the American  By ending DACA, this administration is taking away the hopes of 800,000 DREAMers like Jacqueline and threatening their deportation to countries that are very unfamiliar to them, places they may have never known--except, of course, when they were 2--and they have no family there.  I would like to thank the religious leaders who have come forward and have urged us to do the right thing and to pass a law to allow these kids and these young adults to stay here and to participate in our community as they have been doing.  I would like to read a letter now that was written by the religious leaders here in Washington to the       As leaders of the three Abrahamic faiths, we look to our      sacred texts and traditions in seeking to follow the way of      peace.       Our respective teachings are clear, and we speak with one      voice when we say:       Supporting the dreams of young immigrants in the United      States is consistent with the foundational values of our      Nation and with the moral imperative of extending hospitality      to the stranger, of caring for immigrants and children, and      of loving our neighbors as ourselves.       Nearly 1 million young immigrants have benefited from the      DACA program since its inception in 2012. Among that number,      many of the program recipients are members of our respective      faith communities as well as the communities we mentor in and      around the Nation's       We have witnessed firsthand the relief and pride in our      young people's faces as they finally came to feel validated      and safe by participating in a program that made them feel      more at home--in the only country that they have ever really      considered their home.       But now anxiety and fear for their future has returned.       We note that DACA has widespread support across the country      and among politicians who agree on little else, for good      reason. DACA has dramatically improved the lives of these      young people and the communities in which they live:[[Page H7100]]       Ninety-five percent of the DACA participants are working or      attend high school;       Sixty-eight percent of those working have seen their pay      increase and, thus, are paying higher taxes;       Fifty percent now have driver's licenses, which makes the      roads safer for everyone;       Fifty-four percent have purchased their first car; and       Twelve percent have purchased their first home.       Rescinding DACA would have a widespread, devastating impact      not only on a generation of industrious young people, but      also on their families, communities, and our society as a      whole.       Thus, we add our voices to those urging you, Mr.President,      to keep this policy in place until Congress puts in place a      permanent solution.       It is our collective prayer that in the coming months      congressional leaders work together to pass sensible and      comprehensive immigration reform that our country so      desperately needs, including making the DACA program      permanent.

530,topic-id,970,"Mr.Speaker, I was privileged to see something very special back in December of 1995 in Texas high school sports history.  Now, before you think this is a story of ``Friday Night Lights,'' it is not. This happened on the hardwood court of the Wilkerson Greines Activity Center in southeast Fort Four coaching legends on the court, all with 1,000 wins each: Morgan Wooten of DeMatha Catholic High School; Ralph Tasker, Hobbs High in New Mexico; Bill Kruger of Clear Lake High School just outside of Houston; and Coach Robert Hughes, Sr., of Dunbar High School located in Stop Six, They squared off in an extraordinary basketball game.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention that of these four coaching legends, Coach Hughes has the most wins with over 1,300 victories.[[Page H7098]]  Mr.Speaker, tomorrow, Friday September 8, will mark another special moment in basketball history for Coach Hughes as he is inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield,  Growing up in Fort Worth and having lived part of my childhood in Stop Six, I knew of Coach Hughes at a very young age. He was a legend before he retired. He is and was a master basketball strategist, coach, mentor to the boys he coached and the most prominent ambassador for high school sports in the State of  When you would go to a Dunbar basketball game and watch Coach Hughes work his craft, you ended up watching Coach Hughes as much as you watched the action on the floor. I saw this as a player that not only played against Coach Hughes, but also as a spectator and a fan for many, many years.  Hughes and his longtime trusted assistant, Leonadas Rambo, fielded some great teams to rack up over 1,300 victories. These wins were racked up at Dunbar High School and I.Terrell High School, which was shut down after desegregation.  Coach Hughes would pace the floor while his teams ran up and down the court at a swift pace. He usually gave them lots of latitude when they made mistakes that he felt could have been avoided by using better judgment. It didn't matter if you were the star point guard or the sixth man, he would stand up from the bench--and Coach Hughes always had his jacket unbuttoned--and with a look of disapproval on his face that was unmistakable, he would look down the bench--and I am going to say he would look down the bench with his signature look of tough love--and you knew that you were being pulled out of the game. There wasn't anything that your mom or dad could do for you.  That was the type of coach that Coach Hughes was. Coach Hughes earned the dedication of his players because of the excellence that he expected each and every day.  I will never forget in one Whataburger Basketball Tournament in Fort Worth when Dunbar was playing Oak Hill Academy from Mouth of Wilson, Oak Hill had at least five or six guys that were all over 6 foot 8, three of whom went on to major Division I careers at the University of Virginia and  Everybody at the gym that night, because Coach Hughes didn't have anybody over 6 foot 5, 6 foot 6, thought that Coach Hughes was outmatched. But with superior rebounding, patience, and good shot selection, Dunbar won the game. I was there, and I vividly remember the audience being shocked, but inspired, by the victory. But no one should have been surprised.  Once a reporter asked Coach Hughes who his favorite NBA player was, and it surprised everybody when he said Larry Bird was his favorite player. The reason why: he liked Larry's legendary rebounding, fundamentals, blocking out, scoring, the type of things that may not have been fancy but led to victories.  But that is who Coach Hughes was. That was the kind of excellence Robert Hughes brought to coaching Fort Worth ISD and boys basketball in the State of And due to that fierce competitive streak in Coach Hughes' Dunbar teams, they always made the playoffs.  I will never forget one day Coach Hughes was quoted in the paper saying that the people who worked in the neighborhood, who worked at the various jobs around town, at General Motors, Miller Brewery, and Lockheed, they would always save up their vacation time so they can go to the quarterfinals and regional games in Midland, because everybody knew that Dunbar was at least going that far. And he could say that because it was true, and his teams could back it up.  I will never forget one year when Dunbar didn't make it that far and Coach Hughes shared his scouting report with another school. I believe it was Southwest High He shared his scouting report with the coach from Southwest of the team they were getting ready to take on in the playoffs because he felt that at least the other team in the Fort Worth Independent School District should have the chance to advance. That is the kind of class act he was on the court and he still is off the court today.  The men that he made, Mr.Speaker, his former players include current winning high school basketball coaches and one of the top all-time assist leaders in high school and college sports history, James Cash, an I.Terrell graduate who was the first Black player in the Southwest Conference who went on to become the chair of the Harvard MBA program.

And when my State Division of Planning is highlighting the roads and bridges that we are going to lose to sea level rise and to storm surge, don't expect me to sit idly by.  There is a larger context, of course, for all of this. I am pretty Rhode Island-centric, but, boy, are we seeing a lot going on.  Let's start off with what is going on out We have an extraordinary wildfire situation happening in the American I am reading a news story here:       Wildfires burned across hundreds of thousands of acres in      the American and Canadian West this week, fueled by scorching      temperatures that are breaking heat and fire records across      the region.       In California, at least 15 cities have seen record-breaking      heat. The State has experienced its hottest summer on record.      San Francisco hit 106 degrees over the weekend, breaking its      previous high ever by 3 full degrees.       By the end of the day Tuesday, there were at least 81 large      fires blazing across 1.5 million acres of the U.West, from      Colorado, to California, and north to  ``These unprecedented extreme events are exactly the types of events that are more likely due to the global warming that has already occurred,'' say the scientists.       Studies find that a warmed global atmosphere with      increasingly clear human fingerprints will continue driving a      potent mix of heat and dryness that is projected to escalate      in the  The climate scientist at UCLA says: ``That's not a future projection, but an observational reality, and that is something that we expect to increase in the future. When we get these extremes, there is a human fingerprint.''  ``The increased occurrence of severe heat and the role of global warming on the occurrence of severe heat, that is already happening,'' said a Stanford scientific researcher.  This is not a fluke.       Nine of the 10 worst fire seasons in the past 50 years have      all happened since 2000. And 2015 was the worst fire s in      U.history, surpassing 10 million acres burned for the      first time ever recorded. So far this year, wildfires in the      U.are at 7.8 million acres, but the fire season is far      from over.  Researchers have shown that human-induced climate change accounted for about half the observed increase in fuel aridity, or forest dryness, that has been setting off these fires in the Western United States since 1979 and that this had nearly doubled the area of the U.West affected by forest fires since 1984.  The conclusion:       We know that global warming has already increased the      probability of unprecedented high temperatures in the western      U.S., including in And we know--  ``We know,'' the scientists say--     with high confidence that continued global warming will      continue to intensify those increases.       Last week in Montana, a 20-square-mile blaze burned the      historic Sperry Chalet, a hotel and dining room built in 1914      only reachable by trail.  It had been there for more than 100 years, but this is the fire that burned it down. This means a lot out at Glacier National       ``It's hard to think about the magnitude of what's      happened,'' the National Park Conservancy Executive Director      Doug Mitchell said.  One of the western fires even jumped the Columbia River to burn across into Washington--the Eagle Creek fire.  As the news said, in Oregon's Columbia River Gorge, a blaze known as the Eagle Creek Fire has jumped the Columbia River and is inching into the State of Washington, creating dramatic and dangerous scenes.  Another news report called this a devastating summer in which an area larger than a certain State has burned.  I would hate to have Rhode Island be used as the unit of measure, but that is what they said: An area larger than Rhode Island has burned this summer. And they are looking not just at the loss of the Sperry Chalet but potentially losing Lake McDonald Lodge--``a loss that would,'' says a historian who has worked at the lodge for years, ``be unimaginably devastating.''  ``These are some of the most remarkable buildings anywhere in the United States and they are an integral part of the Glacier experience and the Glacier tradition.''  They are either burned or at risk of burning.  If you are in those Western States, it is not just in the high, dry forests; if you go down to the oceans, climate change is whacking away at them too.  The Oregon and Washington razor clam fisheries are currently closed due to high levels of domoic acid. Domoic acid is a toxin that is produced by algae--the algae Pseudo-nitzchia--and algae are associated with climate change. For instance, a record-breaking red tide in 2015 was likely linked to climate change, and we are going to see a lot more of that in the future.  Now, of course, the dry part of what is happening in our climate has really been drowned out by what we are seeing on the wet part.  The New York Times recently ran an article saying:       Climate change doesn't cause extreme events, it amplifies      them. On the climate side of risk, we have unambiguous      evidence that the hazards are changing. Our emissions of      heat-trapping gases have already increased the likelihood and      severity of heat waves, extreme rainfalls, and storm surges.      Scientists can now even evaluate how much climate change has      increased the odds of individual extreme events, including      rainfall and flooding. We certainly understand the      mechanisms. Put simply, a warmer atmosphere can hold more      water, increasing the potential for heavy downpours.       Storm surge now occurs on top of sea level rise, increasing      flooding risks.  We know by the law of thermal expansion why the seas rise when they warm, and we have measured that they are warming with a very complicated device called the thermometer.       Warmer oceans in turn produce more intense hurricanes.  We know that as well, as has occurred in the North Atlantic and the gulf.  The article continues that ``unprecedented is increasingly the norm,'' and it notes that ``up to 8 feet of sea level rise is possible in this century.''  Rhode Island is in a unique place, so we are riding higher than average, and we are looking at potentially 9 feet of sea level rise.  Harvey has been an astonishing monster of a storm. It was described in one article as 9 trillion gallons of water, a hydraulic cube over downtown Houston 4 miles square and 2 miles high. And then the author said: ``The cube doubled to become the most extreme rain event in American history.''  Harvey, by the way, is the third 500-year flood in the Houston area in the past 3 years. It dumped enough water in southeastern Texas to equal almost 20 times the daily discharge of the Mississippi  So while the wildfires are burning out West, this astonishing set of deluges is happening elsewhere.[[Page S5081]]  Land temperatures, according to NOAA, were the hottest they have ever been in 1,651 months of recordkeeping. July also marked 384 months since the last colder-than-average month in NASA's database. So 384 months since we had a month that was colder than average, with July well warmer than average. The last 3 consecutive years--2014, 2015, and 2016--each set a new global record for warmth, according to  Politico writes: ``2016 confirmed as planet's hottest year,'' with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration documenting record-breaking global warming trends of 2016. The observed outcomes of swiftly rising temperatures include the highest sea levels ever recorded, extremes in rain cycles, and declines in global ice and snow cover, with last year the third in a row breaking global temperature records. ``Several markers such as land and ocean temperatures, sea level and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere broke records set just one year prior,'' the NOAA report said. ``The long-term climate change is like riding up an escalator over time, and things like El Nino and La Nina are like jumping up and down on that escalator,'' one of the NOAA scientists said.  So that is what we are seeing--the underlying trend of climate change raising temperatures, with El Nino and La Nina creating a variation like jumping up and down on that escalator.       Greenhouse gas concentrations are now higher than ever      recorded.       Global surface temperatures are the highest on record.       Sea levels are the highest they've ever been since record      keeping began.       Precipitation cycles are becoming more extreme.       Antarctic sea ice levels are lower than ever recorded.       Alpine glaciers have declined for 37 consecutive years.       There were more tropical cyclones. . . .  Something is going on, and that well-known far-left liberal outlet, USA Today, had its editorial board say the following:       Could proof grow any more powerful that humanity is      responsible for a dangerously warming planet?  It referenced the quadrennial National Climate Assessment:       Scientists from 13 federal agencies found that a rapid rise      in temperature since the 1980s in the United States      represents the warmest period in 1,500 years.  It quotes the report:       Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities,      especially emission of greenhouse gases, are primarily      responsible.       There are no alternative explanations.  Do you hear that? ``There are no alternative explanations,'' and it keeps coming down.  There was an article that came out while we were away on the great flood of 2016 in Louisiana: ``The worst rainstorm in a rainy state's history,'' the article called it.       In some places, more than 2 feet of rain fell over three      days. . . . Research has shown it was . . . clearly linked to      climate change.  There were two separate teams of scientists that linked Louisiana's great flood with climate change, and the State's own meteorologist, a gentleman named Barry Keim, a professor at Louisiana State University, said that aspects of the August storm were consistent with climate change, and that both of the climate studies so far have shown it likely that climate change likely had its fingerprints on that Louisiana disaster.  Indeed, in Louisiana, the State is mounting a massive battle against rising seas as well as floods. Along the coast, ``rising waters and escalating flood insurance rates,'' the article says, ``will drive thousands of families further inland, the state predicts, leaving behind homes''--these families are leaving behind homes--``they have known for generations,'' leaving behind ``places that have fundamentally shaped their identities.''  One of the Louisianans living in the area in question said: ``This is the first time that I can remember that a group came in and said it's not going to be all right.''       But over the next two generations [flooding in Louisiana      along the marshes and coastal] will happen at an alarming      scale, as the twin challenges of sinking land and rising seas      overtake ancestral homes at breakneck speed. In 50 years, the      state estimates Terrebonne parish, whose name means ``good      earth'' in the French that some of its residents still speak,      will lose 41 percent of its land mass.  Areas are obviously going to lose their tax bases, the report says, ``as rising waters and increasing flood insurance rates drive most locals out.''       The Louisiana planners had a leg up, since the      environmental changes here have been so swift that many      residents have seen land lost in their own lifetimes.  When you are seeing it happen before your eyes, it is not so easy to deny it. Indeed, it is affecting local markets, and ``new-gated communities advertise `higher elevations' on bright [advertising] banners facing the highway.''  In Louisiana:       What had been the worst-case scenario for land loss when      the legislature passed its 2012 version of the master plan      became the best-case scenario in the latest version, approved      by the legislature in June, thanks to updated sea-level rise      estimates.  So we are in We are in a Republican-controlled legislature, and they pass a master plan to address flooding in 2012. That master plan is based on a worst-case scenario. Just in the 5 years since then that worst-case scenario, the legislature has now updated that to become a best-case scenario, with the worst-case scenario far, far exceeding what they anticipated just as recently as 2012.  ``Climate change and water management practices could significantly alter the magnitude and variability of extreme flooding events, causing flooding to become nonstationary,'' said the article, ``Deciphering Deluges.''  We have to come up with new ways on how to cope with sea level rise, offshore storms, major tropical storms, downpours, and riverine flooding.  Right now, our colleague Bill Nelson has left us this afternoon after the vote to go back down to Florida because Hurricane Irma is steaming toward his Hurricane Irma is the most powerful storm ever recorded in the Atlantic Experts say Irma's strength is the result of unusually warm water for that part of the  Guess what global warming does. It raises ocean temperatures. Do you know how much of the excess heat created has gone into the oceans? About 93 percent--virtually all of it. Thank goodness for the oceans. Without them, we would already be baking in climate change. So 93 percent went into the oceans, but, of course, that raises ocean temperatures, and on go the storms.  If Irma stays on the forecast track and reaches the Florida Straits, the water there is warm enough that the already intense storm could become much worse, with wind speeds potentially reaching 225 mph, warned Kerry Emanuel, an MIT meteorology professor.  ``For the Florida Keys, if you were to create the worst case scenario, that is what we are looking at,'' Monroe County Emergency Operations Center Director Martin Senterfitt told CBS  Even Tropical Storm Emily some time ago dumped enough rain on Miami Beach--7 inches of rainfall over several hours--that the pumps meant to drain the area went offline for nearly an hour because the power was interrupted. The mayor, Tomas Regalado, used the flooding to make a case for a proposed $400 million bond initiative to help pump the water out. We have infrastructure demands that come from this disaster as well.  A pretty good summary came, again, from an article in the New York Times, an editorial piece.  What is going on?       First, hurricanes arise from warm waters, and the Gulf of      Mexico has warmed by two to four degrees Fahrenheit over the      long-term average. The result is more intense storms.       ``There is a general consensus that the frequency of high-     category (3, 4, and 5) hurricanes should increase as the      climate warms,'' Kerry Emmanuel, a hurricane expert at      M.I.T., tells me.       Second, as the air warms, it holds more water vapor, so the      storms dump more rain. That's why there's been a big increase      in heavy downpours. Nine of the top 10 years for heavy      downpours in the U.have occurred since 1990.  ``Climate change played a role in intensifying the winds and rainfall associated with Hurricane Harvey,'' says Charles Greene, a climate scientist at       Last year was the third in a row to set a record for      highest global average surface temperature, according to      The 10 years of greatest loss of sea ice are all in the      last decade. Houston has suffered three ``500-year floods''      in the last 3 years.  So the author asks the question: Why can't we all respect scientists' predictions about our cooking of our only[[Page S5082]]planet? How is it that we don't listen to the scientists on this, particularly right here in this room, in this Chamber?  There are two very interesting articles that came out while we were away that addressed this. One is about a phony group called the Cooler Heads Coalition, whose job is to call climate science a hoax and denounce environmentalists as global warming alarmists. They write letters, blast out emails, pressure lawmakers, sponsor seminars, appear on television. They even made a documentary movie.  This article in the Washington Post told the story behind this coalition. Obviously, the coalition, this Cooler Heads crowd, is paid for. ``The Cooler Heads have received more than $11 million in donations over the years from coal and oil companies.'' Who knew? ``They've taken in tens of millions from nonprofit foundations, such as those controlled by the wealthy Koch brothers. . . .'' Guess what. There is more fossil fuel money. The Koch brothers run a fossil fuel empire.       The Cooler Heads Coalition . . . are allied with industry      trade groups, public relations companies and lobbyists, all      of whom are working to influence public debate about global      warming.       Climate scientists said there is no doubt about the reality      of climate change and its consequences, including melting      polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and the intensification of      storms.  Benjamin Santer is a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National We are pretty proud of our National Laboratories, and we usually don't think people who are there are idiots or are fooling us or are part of a hoax. Santer, by the way, also received a MacArthur Foundation Genius award. He told the Washington Post that this Cooler Heads outfit is ``attempting to turn back the clock on knowledge and science.''  The history of this is rooted in a complex influence campaign that began in support of tobacco. The tobacco plan foreshadowed the tactics that Cooler Heads members would soon employ on climate change.  First, there were millions in contributions from affected industries, often laundered through front groups and through foundations. ``The same array of donors,'' the Washington Post reports, ``would help finance charities behind'' the fight against climate science.  They took the skills they learned, denying the health harms of tobacco, and moved that same technology of propaganda, influence, and politicking into climate change. The Competitive Enterprise Institute became the lead group in this Cooler Heads Coalition, taking over management of the coalition, joined by groups such as the Heartland The Heartland Institute is really a classy group. They are the ones that put up billboards comparing climate scientists to the That is the quality of debate we get out of the Heartland  Americans for Prosperity is another influential nonprofit organization, which is a front for--guess whom--the Koch brothers and Koch Industries; i.e., the fossil fuel industry. They got particularly cranked up by the Kyoto Protocol, and the story continues:       The energy industry went on a spending spree to thwart      Kyoto, devoting at least $13 million to public relations and      information campaigns in 1997. . . . The Cooler Heads      Coalition was in effect a loose confederation of groups with      the declared mission of countering ``the myths of global      warming.''  In early 1998, this Cooler Heads group met with energy industry executives and lobbyists in closed-door meetings at the American Petroleum Institute and began to soak up more money, and here is what the plan was. I am quoting from the story in the       One former Cooler Heads member, who spoke on the condition      of anonymity because of fear of a punitive backlash, said the      coalition's mission . . . was to . . . simulate a ``cacophony      of voices'' against climate-change science.       ``There's a whole web,'' the former member said [out to do      this].  The ExxonMobil Foundation, of course, had given millions to Cooler Heads members.  A 2009 IRS filing for the Competitive Enterprise Institute--the group that took over the coalition and managed it--inadvertently made public a filing that disclosed their funding from two coal mining companies, Ohio-based Murray Energy and Richmond-based Massey  ``Contributions to CEI during the Obama administration rose to $7.6 million in 2014.'' As the article continues, ``CEI and the Cooler Heads were just the tip of the spear. . . . [B]etween 2003 and 2010, energy companies, corporations and conservative foundations contributed hundreds of millions to 91 nonprofit `think tanks,' educational groups and associations involved in the fight against global-warming regulations.''  To put it mildly, as the expert who chronicled this concluded, ``This is a large-scale political effort.''  We have one last report from inside that large-scale political effort. This is the firsthand voice of the individual. His name is Jerry Here is what he says:       I used to be the number two person at the Cato  The Cato Institute is one of this constellation of rightwing groups that foment and support climate denial and receives money from fossil fuel interests.  He continues:       I was responsible for building our resistance to climate      action. . . . I discovered that a lot of the scientific      narratives I was offering were really dodgy. . . . [O]ne of      the people that I trusted the most was in the business of      consciously misrepresenting the debate. This really rattled      me.  He goes on.       [O]nce I started looking closely at a lot of the      convenient, plausible talking points I was offering they      began to fall apart. [I then turned to look at] economic      arguments.  He says:       This is pretty hard. It's a very difficult thing . . . to      find that you cannot trust any of the scientists that are      being offered to resist climate action.  This is the guy who used to lead the anti-climate action effort of the Cato Institute, saying it is a very difficult thing to find that you cannot trust any of the scientists who are being offered to resist climate action, and then the economists whom you have been relying on to put cautious remarks about cost-benefit are now all walking away from the game.  He goes on to say:       We got to the point . . . where you could not find an      academic economist who studies climate change who argued      against climate action--not one single one.  Here is his conclusion:       Believe it or not, libertarians and conservatives and      Republicans were put on this earth with the perfect answer to      climate change--harnessing markets and price signals via a      carbon tax or a carbon tax-like mechanism to reduce      greenhouse gas emission. We're perfectly placed to do that.       [What is it that] keeps Republicans from coming to the      conclusion that climate change doesn't just threaten polar      bears in the Arctic, it threatens the global economy, it      threatens capital flows, it threatens capitalism. . . . It's      not the Republican base, let me tell you.  There is poll after poll, survey after survey showing that most Republicans believe in doing something about climate.  He continues:       What prevents Republican politicians from acting is that      there are significant members in the Republican Party      Coalition who are denialist demanders.  They are not just climate deniers themselves, they are denialist demanders.       They have outsized influence in the party.  He says:       [T]he Koch-controlled Tea Party movement [has] held the GOP      by the throat.  By the way, if you were somebody who was trying to find some comfort in the widely reported phenomenon that 97 percent of climate scientists conclude the global warming is real and problematic for the planet and has been exacerbated by human activity, if you are comforting yourself that maybe the 3 percent were right, that the really smart place to place your bet for the future of the planet and our economy and our standing in the world is on those 3 percent--not take the 97 percent bet; no, take the 3-percent bet--if that is the way you are thinking, you got bad news.  Researchers tried to replicate the results of those 3 percent of papers. Guess what. They found biased, faulty results.  Katharine Hayhoe is an atmospheric scientist at Texas Tech She said this:       Every single one of those analyses had an error--in their      assumptions, methodology, or analysis--that, when corrected,      brought their results into line with the scientific      consensus.[[Page S5083]]  If you are hoping that 3 percent was somehow going to bail you out from having to face this crisis, that just blew up. There is no 3 percent.       Broadly, there were three main errors in the papers denying      climate change. Many had cherry-picked the results . . . some      that applied inappropriate ``curve-fitting'' [to try to step]      away from data until the points matched the curve of their      choosing.  This is my favorite.       Sometimes the papers just ignored physics altogether.  It has been quite a month with the West ablaze, Houston underwater, the most powerful storm ever measured in the Atlantic is headed our way, heat and rain and other measures breaking records year after year, multiple departments of governments aligning to warn us, and how does the Trump Administration respond?  The Energy department asked scientists to remove the word ``climate change'' from a grant proposal.       I have been asked to contact you to update the wording in      your proposal abstract to remove words such as ``global      warming'' or ``climate change.''  Not just one fluke. In March, POLITICO reported as follows:       [T]hat staff at the Department of Energy . . . were told      not to use the terms ``climate change,'' ``emissions      reduction'' or ``Paris Agreement.''  The Department put out a power grid study that has been long delayed, and in the power grid study, the words ``climate change'' never appeared. Wherever they were in earlier drafts, they got scrubbed. The only reference to climate is a reference to ``rescinding energy and climate-related policies.''  The EPA has been scrubbing the word ``climate change'' from its website. It removed its climate change page and then got hammered with a series of Freedom of Information Act requests as to what is going on with that so they quickly scrambled and published an archived version but buried it back in the website.  The Department of Interior has also removed discussions of the effects of global warming from several of its pages. The Department of Agriculture has emails showing how staff in their Natural Resources Conservation Service was coached by managers to avoid the term ``climate change'' and instead use other language.  That is where we are--all of those facts, the motive behind it, the fingerprints of the fossil fuel industry, the confessions by participants in those schemes. Where are we? In this room, silence. Nobody will talk about it because the power of the fossil fuel industry is so strong, the threats are so bloodcurdling that nobody dares. We cannot have a grownup, factual discussion about climate change in this building either. Of course, over in the Trump administration, they have completely thrown in the towel to the fossil fuel industry, and now we are hoping to dodge the problem by forbidding people from using the words ``climate change.'' It is pathetic.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgS5079.txt,1823,"PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3354, DEPARTMENT OF THE",2017,7,September

That has been 40 years ago now. I now see that however long that conversation happens, it lays the groundwork for what is going to be an even greater conversation here on the floor of the  Mr.Speaker, I am fond of saying that if you come to this institution on the right day, you are going to see a festival of democracy take place right here. Today is going to be one of those days.  If you were on the House floor yesterday, you saw us take up the first of these divisions in this appropriations bill. Today, because of the work that my friend from New York and I did with the rest of the members of the Rules Committee right up there last night, we are bringing to the floor the remaining four divisions of H.3354; 224 additional amendments. 224 additional amendments. Division A is the Interior section; division C is the Commerce, Justice, Science section; division D is the Financial Services section; division F is the Labor, HHS, and Education section.  When I was on the floor yesterday, Mr.Speaker, I talked about how proud I was of the work that we have all done here together. This annual appropriations process has been conducted in a more comprehensive fashion this year than in any other year in my memory.  When we get jammed, you end up with one of those long-term, yearlong continuing resolutions that shut out every Member's voice. In a good year, maybe, you end up with one of those giant leadership-negotiated White House and the leader of the House and the Senate omnibus appropriations bills that shut out all but two or three voices.  This year, the Appropriations Committee, beginning its work way back in April, has worked through every single appropriations bill one by one at the committee level, and we are seeing the culmination of that effort here on the floor today.  Mr.Speaker, it has been since 2010 that the House has finished its work before the September 30 fiscal year deadline. It was the 2009 calendar year. They were doing the work for the 2010 fiscal year. It is hard to get this done, and it doesn't happen because Democrats are successful or Republicans are[[Page H7107]]successful. It happens because the collaboration that we have together is successful, and we are seeing the result of that today.  If we pass the underlying rule, we will make in order those 224 amendments, we will begin that process of debating the last four divisions, and we will have the voices of this House heard.  We went until midnight last night, Mr.We went until midnight the night before that. I suspect midnight is going to seem early to us where we are headed over the next couple of days. But at the end of that process, Republicans, Democrats, folks from all regions of the country, are going to be able to look each other in the eye and know that--in a way that makes folks back home proud--we worked through each and every appropriations bill and we got our work done on time.  That is why I ran for Congress, Mr.Speaker, to deliver results back home, and that is why I am proud to be standing with my friend from New York today delivering on those promises.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-09-07-pt1-PgH7106-2.txt,2008,AMERICA CAN BE A FAIR AND COMPASSIONATE NATION,2017,7,September

That is why we both ran for Congress, to get that work done. I am incredibly optimistic that we will get that work done.  I wish from time to time we would celebrate our successes as fiercely as we observe our failures. My friend is absolutely right, there was a time in congressional history where appropriations bills came to the floor and any Member could offer any amendment they wanted at any time, and the process could go on for days or weeks or months.  To my friend's point, we can reminisce about those days and celebrate them, but we can't do it at the same time we observe the very limited deadlines that we have now trying to get work done.  It was back on August 24 that the Rules Committee created a deadline and said: We want to have every Member have their voice heard. We want to hear from every single Member on every single appropriations bill to understand what it is you would do differently to have the bills serve America better.  We created that deadline, Mr.Speaker, for exactly the reason my friend from New York suggested, and that is so folks would have the time to look at those amendments, to digest those amendments, to be thoughtful about those amendments.  Now, it turns out even in a body of 435 Members, you can have some repetitive ideas. It turns out a lot of us think a single amendment is a good idea. The Rules Committee looked at amendments and found multiple Members had exactly the same idea. In order to speed the process along, we let one of those Members offer the amendment; we asked the other Members not to.  That is not closing down the process. That is a good use of the American people's time, because we have so much that we must get done together.  Mr.Speaker, for folks who care about openness--and I am one of those Members--I just want to remind you that it is not just the 1,000-plus amendments we looked at in the Rules It is thousands upon thousands that were worked through the Appropriations Subcommittee process, and then the Appropriations full committee process.                              {time}  1300  The appropriations process is one of the best opportunities for any Member[[Page H7108]]in this Chamber to make their priorities known, act on those priorities, change the law of the land for the men and women they serve back home.

Just up the road from my hometown of Portland, the Eagle Creek fire has merged with the Indian Creek fire and spread over an area of more than 31,000 acres. What we have seen--again, just staggering in its implications--the fire jumped the Columbia River into Washington It is ravaging our iconic Columbia River This is a treasure beloved by the millions of people who visit every year and the people of my home  Next to me is a shot of the fire which has been burning in the Columbia River Gorge now for days. Although it appears the first sparks of the Eagle Creek fire were ignited by a young man, it is clear the inferno was accelerated by the unusual heat in early Now the lives and the homes of Gorge residents are under threat, and a world-renowned treasure in my home State has been devastated.  Sadly, this wildfire devastation this month has rippled across The Chetco Bar fire in Southwestern Oregon has consumed more than 167,000 acres--an area bigger than all of The Umpqua North fire east of Roseburg and the Milli fire in Central Oregon have torn through tens of thousands of acres each.  I could go on. The point is, my home State is getting pounded by these fires, and the West is getting pounded by these fires. The skies glow orange at night as the flames burn on. Families wake up to ash on their windshields. Schools are closed, and people have been warned to stay indoors because it is not safe to breathe the hazardous air.  On the Air Quality Index map from the Environmental Protection Agency--which I have here--you can see the effects of the nightmare which has settled in over most of Oregon, Idaho, Washington, and large parts of As I speak, there are a million and a half acres ablaze across Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, Wyoming, Nevada, and One-third of these burning acres are in my home State alone.

The victims of all these disasters and the communities that will continue to face these growing threats need the government to come up with smarter policies to try to prevent as much of this as possible. That is why I wanted to wrap up my remarks by way of talking about the bizarre way the Federal Government budgets for fighting fire.  In the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have led a bipartisan effort for years now. Senator Mike Crapo, the senior Senator from Idaho, and I had 260 groups--forestry groups, scientists, environmentalists--join us in the effort. What has happened over the years is the Federal Government has shorted prevention, and then, because of the conditions being hot and dry and lightning strikes or what have you, we have a big fire, and then the Federal Government, to put the fire out, borrows from the prevention fund, and the problem gets worse. That is what we call fire-borrowing. The reason I call it bizarre is that the idea of ripping off prevention, which we need most, defies common sense.  We have a dangerous, worsening cycle known as fire-borrowing. Shoddy budgeting today leads to bigger fires tomorrow, and it needs to stop.  I remember not long ago--because this does so much damage to natural resources policy--the distinguished minority leader of the Senate, Senator Schumer, signed on to our bill. We all wondered, well, what is the situation in New York? It turned out they had a problem with a bug and a baseball bat, and the natural resource agencies had trouble dealing with that challenge because so much of the funds had been frittered away with this broken system of fighting fire.  That is why I have now called on the President to include a funding fix in any request for an upcoming disaster aid package. Several of my western colleagues and I--Senators from both sides of the aisle--are calling on Leaders McConnell and Schumer today to include a fix in any disaster aid package that comes before this body.  As I said, this battle has gone on for years. I think I mentioned to my friend from New Mexico that this issue with respect to fire-borrowing has been the longest running battle since the Trojan It has gone on and on and each year wastes more and more money on a broken system of funding the fight against wildfires.  Senator Crapo has been an instrumental partner in this effort. He also has a proposal that in effect builds on what we have been working on for years in the Banking I support that proposal as well.  I want it understood that there is a lot that has to be dealt with here in the There have been some horrible disasters--Houston and now the South, with what Senator Nelson is going to wrestle with this weekend. We have a lot to do. But when we are talking about western communities getting hit by a wrecking ball, which is exactly what these mega-fires do, I want it understood that we western Senators, Democrats and Republicans, are going to be teaming up to make sure, as we said in our letter today to Leaders McConnell and Schumer, that a fire fix that is based on common sense, sensible practices to try to prevent fires to the greatest extent possible, has to be a focus of priority business in the Too many western communities--the kind I am going to see this weekend--are faced with destroyed homes, businesses, lost recreation dollars, lost timber revenue, cleanup costs, and forest and range land restoration efforts.  The West cannot wait any longer for Congress to break this dangerous cycle that defies common sense, shortchanges wildfire prevention, and does it year after year. What western Senators are going to do is work together in a bipartisan way, which is what you have to do when your constituents are faced with these kinds of problems. I can tell you, in Oregon or Montana or Idaho, when you have one of these mega-fires, nobody is sitting around waiting to hear about just the Democratic approach or the Republican approach; they want to know what the Federal Government is going to do to help these hard-hit western communities.  It is absolutely essential that the Senate act soon.
