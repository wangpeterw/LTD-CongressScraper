THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    Thank you. First of all, General, thank you _x000D_
for your service to our country and for your willingness to _x000D_
come back in and help with this new endeavor of great _x000D_
difficulty._x000D_
    I want to start out by just--I know we are not debating the _x000D_
authorization for use of force, but I do want to ask you _x000D_
because of your experience in these affairs in the past, it is _x000D_
my understanding from our review of the process that only two _x000D_
times in our history has Congress authorized the use of force _x000D_
with limitations, and both were United Nations peacekeeping _x000D_
missions. And so, the question that I would have now is, if our _x000D_
objective here is the defeat of ISIS, would it not be more _x000D_
prudent to authorize the Commander in Chief to move forward in _x000D_
that regard and allow him as Commander in Chief and any future _x000D_
Commander in Chief, whoever they may be, to decide what the _x000D_
appropriate strategy is moving forward to ultimately defeat _x000D_
them if that is the ultimate goal? What would be wrong with _x000D_
simply authorizing the President to defeat them?",rubio
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    No, I understand the strategy does. Just for _x000D_
purposes of an authorization from Congress, and I understand _x000D_
you have endorsed here today what the President wants to do, _x000D_
and I understand that perhaps that is what the President thinks _x000D_
he can get passed. But from a military point of view, would it _x000D_
not be more appropriate to simply authorize the President to do _x000D_
whatever it takes to defeat them?",rubio
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    Okay. My second question is, is it possible _x000D_
to defeat ISIS without them ultimately being defeated by _x000D_
someone on the ground? Someone is going to have to confront _x000D_
them eventually on the ground and defeat them there. If you can _x000D_
update us on efforts, and I have seen in the past some _x000D_
conversation among some of the regional countries, about the _x000D_
potential for a coalition of armed forces brought together--the _x000D_
Egyptians, the Turks, the Saudis, perhaps some of the kingdoms, _x000D_
Jordan, et cetera--who could provide a coalition of local _x000D_
forces who could play that role with significant U.S. _x000D_
assistance from the air, logistics, intelligence, et cetera. _x000D_
Has there been any progress made in that? Is that something _x000D_
that is actively being discussed with those nations?",rubio
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    Okay, I understand. So let me move on then _x000D_
to a separate topic, and that is the nature of this conflict. _x000D_
ISIS has already proven that they are going to move into--for a _x000D_
group to take root, and take hold, and actually be able to _x000D_
grow, they need ungoverned vacuum spaces that they can operate _x000D_
from. That is what perhaps has attracted them, for example, to _x000D_
Libya, not just the access to a port town, but the ability to _x000D_
operate uncontested in terms of another government, et cetera._x000D_
    It is important to understand that as this conflict _x000D_
continues, the possibility continues to grow that ISIS, in _x000D_
addition to being based in Syria and Iraq, will also look to _x000D_
other places where they can set up nodes operation. Libya is an _x000D_
example, but potentially training camps in Afghanistan. Any _x000D_
place where a vacuum opens up is an attractive and appealing _x000D_
place for them to move operations._x000D_
    And, therefore, as we put forth our strategy and as the _x000D_
Congress deliberates the authority it gives the President, that _x000D_
reality needs to be taken into account, correct?",rubio
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: BUILDING THE COALITION AND ENSURING MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS,2/25/2015,"    Okay. My last question is about the nature _x000D_
of this conflict. You know, it has been talked about in the _x000D_
past that ISIS is some sort of, and they certainly are, a group _x000D_
of monsters that take on these acts of extreme violence, but _x000D_
these are not just random acts of extreme violence. This is a _x000D_
group who has a--their barbarism has a purpose. At the end of _x000D_
the day it is to purify, in their mind, that region to their _x000D_
form of Islam at the exclusion not just of non-Sunni Islam, but _x000D_
especially of non-Islamic populations._x000D_
    And in that realm, it is clear that the Christians and _x000D_
Yazidis, but recently we have seen Christians in particular, _x000D_
are in increased danger in this region, and they specifically _x000D_
target Christian populations for barbarity, both as a way to _x000D_
shock the world, but also as an effort to carry out their _x000D_
ultimate goal of, in their mind, ``purifying the region for _x000D_
Islam.'' Is there a not deep religious component to ISIS' _x000D_
strategy here? They are clearly as part of their effort trying _x000D_
to, again, using a term they would use, not one that I _x000D_
necessarily enjoy using, but ``cleanse the region'' of infidels _x000D_
and non-believers. And in that realm they have specifically _x000D_
targeted Christians for these sorts of atrocities that they are _x000D_
committing on now an ongoing basis as we saw yesterday again.",rubio
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this _x000D_
hearing. At the outset, let me congratulate you for the title, _x000D_
``Ending Modern Slavery.'' That is exactly what it is. I have _x000D_
no problem with the term ``trafficking,'' except I think it _x000D_
sometimes sanitizes what we are talking about. ``Trafficking'' _x000D_
makes it sound like people are just being moved around from _x000D_
point A to point B. It is not the moving around as much as what _x000D_
happens once they get there. And I think ``modern slavery'' _x000D_
accurately assesses it._x000D_
    To that point, we have an ambassador at large for _x000D_
trafficking in persons--it should be an ambassador at large for _x000D_
ending human slavery or modern slavery--that has sat vacant for _x000D_
a number of--for quite a period of time. I hope that there will _x000D_
be a nomination and that we can get that confirmed because I _x000D_
think that is important in terms of the U.S.'s role around the _x000D_
world on this issue._x000D_
    I wanted to touch on two subjects. The first is, and we had _x000D_
not touched on this yet, but let me ask you this. There have _x000D_
also been reports of abuses in the diplomatic corps here in the _x000D_
United States. Do you have any unique insight into some of _x000D_
those abuses and how they have used their diplomatic status to _x000D_
bring--in some instances we have seen here in Washington, to _x000D_
see domestic workers that are actually being not compensated _x000D_
and held against their will?",rubio
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    I know that sex trafficking and sex slavery _x000D_
gets a lot of attention and rightfully so. I want to talk about _x000D_
that. My point is that it is the labor slavery that really is _x000D_
still the predominant number, and it can happen anywhere. I _x000D_
mean, people would be shocked at how prevalent it is here _x000D_
domestically._x000D_
    I wanted to ask you domestically for a moment in the United _x000D_
States about three topics. The first is on the sex slavery _x000D_
side. Do you have any sort of insight about how many, _x000D_
particularly women, but even children, obviously women. Let me _x000D_
focus on that first, the adult women, who are in the trade now _x000D_
could be considered people that are being trafficked and/or _x000D_
held against their will? It is my personal view that virtually _x000D_
all of them are one way or another because coercion is not _x000D_
necessarily someone holding a gun to your head or someone _x000D_
refusing to pay you. But things like drug addiction are used as _x000D_
a tool. Things like fear of escape, even psychologically. It _x000D_
has been my experience in the interaction I have had with law _x000D_
enforcement involved in this that you should consider virtually _x000D_
every woman in that industry as being a victim of slavery _x000D_
basically.",rubio
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    The reason why I ask you this, and I wanted _x000D_
you to comment as well, Ms. Blau, there are publications in the _x000D_
United States that openly advertise on their pages for these _x000D_
services. And, in fact, the same publications, like ``Village _x000D_
Voice,'' that have gone on to write articles ridiculing this _x000D_
whole notion that there is human slavery in the United States--_x000D_
that there is slavery in the United States with regards to the _x000D_
sex trade. And there has been all sorts of actions taken here _x000D_
to condemn that._x000D_
    And the reason why I ask you that question is because _x000D_
oftentimes when law enforcement interacts, for example, with _x000D_
women that are being--that are in prostitution and have, in my _x000D_
opinion, been coerced into it either through drug addiction, _x000D_
abuse, or a combination thereof, there is a debate within the _x000D_
law enforcement community about whether they should be treated _x000D_
as perpetrators or as victims. And we have had this debate in _x000D_
Florida as well._x000D_
    When you interact with someone that you basically have _x000D_
found at a brothel or, in some instances, some of these massage _x000D_
parlors and so forth, the debate has been should we arrest _x000D_
them, and put them in jail, and treat them as a perpetrator, or _x000D_
should we pull them out of that environment, put them into a _x000D_
safe place where they can realize that there is an escape for _x000D_
them, and they can break that pattern. And we have gotten a lot _x000D_
of pushback from both law enforcement and prosecutorial _x000D_
agencies who believe that it is important to treat them as a _x000D_
perpetrator first, that that is the only way you are going to _x000D_
get them see differently._x000D_
    Do you have an opinion on the right way to address that, _x000D_
because it has been--it is an issue of controversy in the law _x000D_
enforcement community?",rubio
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    I know I am out of time. In your experience, _x000D_
the majority of people from abroad that are here in the _x000D_
commercial sex industry, did they know they were coming to that _x000D_
industry when they were brought?",rubio
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,    Okay.,rubio
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,"    False pretense. They thought they were _x000D_
coming here to make a commercial product, and they ended up _x000D_
trapped in this industry.",rubio
ENDING MODERN SLAVERY: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD?,2/4/2015,    Thank you.,rubio
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Thank you, Mr. Chairman._x000D_
    Secretary Blinken, much of this debate here today has been _x000D_
about the role of Congress and our need to trust in the ability _x000D_
of the administration to craft a good deal, and in the fact _x000D_
that we are going to be consulted. That was the question that _x000D_
you asked._x000D_
    So I want to take you back to the last time you were before _x000D_
this committee, and I asked you a question at that time, during _x000D_
your nomination, about whether there would be any unilateral _x000D_
changes or changes in Cuba policy. And your answer, and I want _x000D_
to quote it to you, it said, ``Anything that in the future that _x000D_
might be done on Cuba would be done in full consultation, with _x000D_
the real meaning of the word `consultation' that I just alluded _x000D_
to, with this committee.'' You told me that the last time you _x000D_
were before this committee._x000D_
    Who did you consult with on this committee? Or who did the _x000D_
administration consult with on this committee before it _x000D_
announced the changes on the 17th of December?",rubio
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Did you consult with the chairman of the _x000D_
committee?",rubio
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,    Who were the members who were consulted?,rubio
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Mr. Chairman, you were the chairman at the _x000D_
time, were you consulted?",rubio
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    And the reason why this is relevant is we _x000D_
are being told that we are going to be in the loop on _x000D_
everything that is happening with Iran. We have an example very _x000D_
recently that we were not in the loop._x000D_
    But you were aware at the time that these conversations _x000D_
were occurring with the Cubans, were you not?",rubio
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,    It was not more delicate than this.,rubio
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    But I am not quarreling with the Alan Gross _x000D_
release. I am quarreling with the policy changes that were _x000D_
made._x000D_
    Why it is relevant to Iran is that we are being asked to _x000D_
trust that we are going to be fully consulted. The use of the _x000D_
word ``consultation'' as it has been defined by the _x000D_
administration in the last instance that I just cited is _x000D_
problematic._x000D_
    I do not want to make this all about Cuba, not to belabor _x000D_
the point, but I also asked whether there would be any changes _x000D_
in policy absent democratic order. I asked you whether the _x000D_
changes, when you say move forward, move forward on democratic _x000D_
reforms, not simply economic reforms, and you said not simply _x000D_
economic reforms._x000D_
    And clearly, we do not see any democratic reforms. There _x000D_
was release of 53 political prisoners. Fourteen had already _x000D_
been released on December 17. One of them had been released _x000D_
almost a full year before December 17. Four had fully completed _x000D_
their sentences. Five have been rearrested. And since the deal _x000D_
was done on the 17th, 200 new political arrests have occurred _x000D_
in Cuba._x000D_
    But here is why that is relevant to this, because we are _x000D_
being asked as a Congress to sit tight, because we are going to _x000D_
be fully consulted. And it sounds like the only people who are _x000D_
going to be fully consulted are the people who agree with the _x000D_
administration. And if you do not agree with the _x000D_
administration, then you will just be notified._x000D_
    My second point goes to the question that both Senator _x000D_
Udall asked about who is in charge, but also what Senator _x000D_
Johnson asked about why the Iranians would undergo so much pain _x000D_
in pursuit of this._x000D_
    The answer to who is in charge, unless you dispute it, is, _x000D_
ultimately, who is in charge is who they call the supreme _x000D_
leader, the ayatollah. Is that accurate?",rubio
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    All right. Can they possibly agree to a _x000D_
change of the kind we are contemplating without his approval, _x000D_
given the support he has in their legislative branch?",rubio
IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: STATUS OF TALKS AND THE ROLE OF CONGRESS,1/21/2015,"    Highly unlikely. So who is this ayatollah? _x000D_
Well, the ayatollah is not simply a head of state as we _x000D_
normally see it, the head of a nation-state. He is a radical _x000D_
cleric who, first of all, he does not just view Iran as a _x000D_
nation-state. He views Iran as a cause, as Henry Kissinger has _x000D_
described it. The cause is to eventually have the entire world _x000D_
living under the flag of Islam. That is actually stated in _x000D_
their constitution._x000D_
    It goes further and states that the ayatollah is not just _x000D_
the leader of Iran. He is the leader of all Muslims in the _x000D_
world._x000D_
    Is that not accurate? That is his position and title._x000D_
    So Iran is where he lives, but he views his mandate as _x000D_
extending to the whole world. But it goes beyond this. These _x000D_
are unambiguous statements on their part. He does not just view _x000D_
himself as a cleric. He views himself as the temporary fill-in _x000D_
for the 13th imam, the Mahdi, who under Shia, his _x000D_
interpretation of Shia, and I think the mainstream _x000D_
interpretation of Shia, is an imam that is currently in _x000D_
occultation who will emerge one day in the world and govern the _x000D_
entire world under the flag of Islam. Their stated purpose for _x000D_
the state of Iran is to serve as a base for that effort _x000D_
throughout the world._x000D_
    That is what motivates him. We are ascribing to his regime _x000D_
nation-state characteristics of a normal country that has a _x000D_
cost-benefit analysis about what is in the national interest of _x000D_
Iran. I do not dispute that there might be some political _x000D_
leaders in Iran who hold those views, but the ayatollah, the _x000D_
supreme leader, he does not view it that way. He views it as _x000D_
not just his calling, but his obligation to bring about the _x000D_
arrival of the 13th imam and to unify the world under the flag _x000D_
of radical Islam as he defines it._x000D_
    Here is why that is important. Under his clerical _x000D_
interpretation, and that of many in Shia, the 13th imam cannot _x000D_
emerge until there is a cataclysmic showdown between the Muslim _x000D_
and non-Muslim world. And when a country led by a person who _x000D_
wants there to be a cataclysmic showdown between the Muslim and _x000D_
non-Muslim world has designs on a nuclear weapon, now we have _x000D_
cause for great concern._x000D_
    And that is why they expand their military capability, and _x000D_
that is why they want a nuclear weapon._x000D_
    Now what they have shown is some crafty ability. They _x000D_
reject everything that is not Islamic in the world. They reject _x000D_
the legitimacy of the U.N. They reject the legitimacy of the _x000D_
United States. But they are very crafty. They accept the _x000D_
benefits of the international order--for example, their seat at _x000D_
the U.N.--but while still being able to reject their _x000D_
obligations under that international order._x000D_
    So what have they done with all that? Well, let us go _x000D_
through the timeline. In 2003, the position of the world was no _x000D_
enrichment. Then it became, you can enrich up to 20 percent. _x000D_
Then it became, you can enrich over 20 percent, as long as you _x000D_
send it overseas. Now it is, you can enrich up to 20 percent in _x000D_
Iran, as long as it is for a research facility._x000D_
    So if you go by the timeline of what they have been able to _x000D_
achieve over the last 10 years, it is pretty impressive how _x000D_
they have been able to use this process. In another 5 years, _x000D_
maybe we will build the bomb for them, at the rate this is _x000D_
going._x000D_
    In the meantime, the other two components of a nuclear _x000D_
program move forward unabated. A weapon design, you can buy _x000D_
that. You can buy that. You can buy a weapons design right now. _x000D_
Heck, you can download it online, potentially, if it is a crude _x000D_
weapon._x000D_
    And the missile program continues unabated. They continue _x000D_
to test long-range missile capabilities, not to mention adding _x000D_
to their already considerable conventional weapons capability._x000D_
    So this is why we are very concerned and have a right to be _x000D_
concerned. This is not a traditional nation-state undergoing a _x000D_
cost-benefit analysis. This is a cleric-led regime, a clerical _x000D_
government, with a clear intent of ultimately one day unifying _x000D_
the entire world under the flag of their radical version of _x000D_
Islam, led by someone who believes that will only happen after _x000D_
a cataclysmic showdown with the West._x000D_
    So we have real reasons to be deeply concerned and _x000D_
skeptical about the ability to reach any arrangement, and real _x000D_
reasons to believe that they are willing to accept short-term _x000D_
suspensions because their long-term view is that at the end of _x000D_
the day they are going to be at that showdown point. And if _x000D_
they have nuclear weapons, they are even better off than they _x000D_
would normally be._x000D_
    And that is why we are so skeptical about this deal. We are _x000D_
not dealing with Belgium here. We are not deal dealing with _x000D_
Luxembourg. We are dealing with a radical cleric with a radical _x000D_
view of his obligation and role in the world. And he wants _x000D_
nuclear weapons to be able to do it._x000D_
    And I believe that ultimately, I think no one here could _x000D_
dispute that, ultimately, even if they agree to a short _x000D_
suspension, that is their goal in the long term._x000D_
    And as the North Koreans have shown, you can agree to all _x000D_
sorts of short-term suspensions, and you can always invent a _x000D_
pretext for why now I need the weapon, because of hostilities _x000D_
of the West, because it is time for the hidden imam to emerge, _x000D_
whatever._x000D_
    And that is what we are concerned about. They will retain _x000D_
all the infrastructure that it takes to enrich. They will have _x000D_
a weapons design. They will have a delivery system in the _x000D_
missiles. And at some point, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, they _x000D_
build a weapon and now the world is at their mercy. That is why _x000D_
we are so skeptical.",rubio
