               CONGRATULATING ELLWOOD NATIONAL CRANKSHAFT

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Ellwood National Crankshaft on receiving STAR certification in the OSHA 
Voluntary Protection Program.
  Ellwood National Crankshaft, located in Irvine, Pennsylvania, is a 
unique manufacturer of new and reconditioned crankshafts for medium-
speed engines in the 800- to 6,000-horsepower range.
  Mr. Speaker, in order to attain this distinguished certification, a 
facility has met or exceeded the performance-based criteria for a 
managed safety and health system. It also passed the rigorous onsite 
evaluation conducted by a team of OSHA safety and health experts.
  This recognition is even more significant, knowing that Ellwood 
National Crankshaft is one of only a few forging and process safety 
management facilities to obtain the STAR status. Its motto, ``Injury 
free every day,'' echoes the importance of safety throughout the plant.
  I commend Ellwood National Crankshaft for making safety a top 
priority. Everyone wins when there are fewer days missed due to 
injuries or illness.
  Congratulations on earning this prestigious certification and for 
placing such a high standard on the welfare of all the people employed 
at Ellwood National Crankshaft.
