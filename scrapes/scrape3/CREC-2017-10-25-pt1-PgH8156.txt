                         SPARTA, NORTH CAROLINA

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, Forbes magazine recently discovered something 
many of us have known for a long time, which is that Sparta, North 
Carolina, is a wonderful place to live and work.
  Sparta, located in Alleghany County, is a wonderful community made up 
of people with vision, strong work ethic, big hearts, and dreams.
  Forbes encouraged young entrepreneurs to move to seven locations 
around the country--and, in particular, to Sparta--for the high-speed 
fiber internet and relatively low cost of living. This would allow 
innovators and job creators to live affordably and work globally.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a great reason to move to Sparta, but it is not 
the only reason. I urge entrepreneurs and families to live in Sparta 
for the wonderful quality of life, sense of community, and incredible 
heart that makes this town a wonderful place to call home.
