                         NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today we learned that former FBI 
Director James Comey documented his conversations with President Trump 
in a series of memos. In one memo, Mr. Comey claims that, after 
clearing the room, President Trump asked him to end the investigation 
of General Michael Flynn. If true, this assault on the rule of law 
would be a violation of our democracy unseen since Watergate.
  What comes next is uncertain, but investigations into this matter 
must begin, as those into the President's Russia ties must continue. 
All the Comey memos should be turned over to Congress. Any unclassified 
memos should be released to the public, and President Trump should 
submit to investigators any tapes with which he threatened Mr. Comey. 
Lastly, Congress and the American public must hear Mr. Comey testify 
publicly and under oath.
  The time has come when silence is no longer denial, it becomes 
complicity. Now is the time to act, and to do otherwise is only to 
delay the truth.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
