               AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT MAKES US INSECURE

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the American 
Health Care Act and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
  Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act 7 years ago, in my 
district, the uninsured rate has dropped from 19 percent to 9 percent. 
In my district, there has been the creation and the funding of 6,500 
jobs in local hospitals and rural healthcare clinics.
  Yet, despite this progress in my community and across our country, 
the majority wants to replace the ACA with a quickly and carelessly 
crafted AHCA.
  If the AHCA becomes law, in my district, 56,000 people will lose 
their healthcare coverage. In Salinas, hardworking families will pay 
more than $3,000 for healthcare coverage; and in Santa Cruz, low-income 
senior citizens will be stripped of $10,000 worth of subsidies.
  Yes, the ACA does have its faults, but we should come together to 
thoughtfully fix it. But it is not just about money; it is about 
people. And it is not just about people; it is about the security that 
the ACA provides people to live their daily lives.
  Mr. Speaker, the AHCA makes us insecure, and that is why I am voting 
against it.
