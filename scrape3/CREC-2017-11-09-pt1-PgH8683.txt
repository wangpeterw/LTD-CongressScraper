                   HONORING THE LIFE OF DARREN DRAKE

  (Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of 32-year-old 
Darren Drake from New Milford, New Jersey, whose promising life was cut 
short in last month's tragic and senseless act of ISIS-inspired lone-
wolf terror in Manhattan.
  Darren was one of our best and brightest, and a son of New Jersey 
through and through. A hardworking project manager at Moody's and a 
lifelong Jets fan, Darren earned more than three degrees from New 
Jersey universities. Not only was he driven and accomplished, Darren 
was also a committed public servant, serving as president of the New 
Milford School Board.
  Darren was beloved. It was intensely moving to see so much of the 
North Jersey community come together at his wake and funeral last week 
and this week.
  To his parents, Jimmy and Barbara, and everyone whose life he 
touched, I want to express my deepest condolences. Darren's death is 
our profound loss. He packed more into his years than most do in a 
lifetime. His life enriched our lives beyond measure.
  No act of terror will ever be able to diminish the bright and burning 
love he had for his home, my State, and our country. I will spend my 
days here fighting terrorism at home and abroad in Darren's honor.
  May God rest his soul.
