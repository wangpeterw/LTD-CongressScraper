       TERMINATION OF TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS FOR EL SALVADOR

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
President's cruel decision to terminate temporary protected status for 
El Salvador, hurting 200,000 people and their 193,000 U.S. citizen 
children.
  Mr. Speaker, many of these people have lived alongside us as friends 
and neighbors for decades. It is unfathomable that the administration 
would deport people back to one of the most dangerous parts of the 
world.
  When it comes to the rights and lives of immigrants, we cannot be 
silent. Defending temporary protected status to protect those fleeing 
war, disease, and natural disasters is a priority that crosses party 
lines and political barriers. That is why, last month, I joined my 
colleagues from both sides of the aisle to introduce the ASPIRE-TPS Act 
that would help bring justice for immigrants who are deeply woven into 
the fabric of our society. It is apparent that congressional action is 
necessary now more than ever to protect people with TPS.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help 
us advance bipartisan legislation to protect the hundreds of thousands 
of people who rely on these protections.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Comer). Members are reminded to refrain 
from engaging in personalities toward the President.
