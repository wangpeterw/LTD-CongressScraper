                CONGRATULATING AND HONORING MIKE FREMONT

  (Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and honor a 
great Cincinnatian and avid marathoner, Mike Fremont, for accomplishing 
something pretty amazing. A little over a week ago, Mike set the world 
record for his age group at Cincinnati's Flying Pig Half-Marathon.
  By the way, he is 95 years old. Thirteen miles at the age of 95. And 
he had previously held the world record for a 90-year-old marathoner, 
which he set 5 years ago in Huntington, West Virginia.
  Mike's passion for running and a healthy lifestyle kicked in when he 
was only 70 years old and given only 3 months to live after being 
diagnosed with an advanced form of cancer.
  I have known Mike since my time on the Cincinnati City Council back 
30 years ago, including involvement with the Mill Creek Restoration 
Project. He is an amazing Cincinnatian and ought to be an inspiration 
to all who hear of his accomplishments.
  Congratulations, Mike. You have made all Cincinnatians proud.
