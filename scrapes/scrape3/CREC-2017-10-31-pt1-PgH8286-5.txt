       DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A HEALTH ISSUE AND A CRIMINAL MATTER

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Suzanne thought that Jason was the 
perfect boyfriend. He was protective, loving, and attentive. But after 
he moved in with Suzanne, she noticed his darker side. He became 
obsessive, jealous, and enraged. He began shoving and striking her. 
Once, he pushed her so hard her head smashed against the wall.
  Fed up with his excuses, she made him leave, but her safety was short 
lived. One night as Suzanne returned home with friends, Jason ambushed 
her and forced her into the house at knifepoint. Horrified, her friends 
ran into the street to flag down the police.
  Despite Suzanne's pleas, Jason stomped on her face and neck until she 
was unconscious. Then she later woke up to find him pouring boiling 
water over her body. About that time, the police broke in and saved her 
life.
  Mr. Speaker, this month is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. 
Domestic violence is a health issue, and it is also a criminal matter. 
As my grandmother used to say: ``You never hurt somebody you claim you 
love.''

  And that is just the way it is.
