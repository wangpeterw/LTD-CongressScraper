                               MUSLIM BAN

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, whatever you call the 
President's recent executive orders, the reality is that they 
constitute a Muslim ban.
  Yesterday, one of my constituents was crossing the border into San 
Diego when he was singled out for having brown skin. He was asked by a 
CBP agent if he was Muslim as he stood in line. Well, in fact, he is an 
Indian-American man who got his citizenship mere months ago, and he was 
so proud to become a U.S. citizen because it meant that he could 
finally vote in our elections.
  His wife called our office, horrified at how casually her husband's 
civil rights had been violated, and she told us that she was scared now 
to travel with her kids because she didn't want to tell them that they 
shouldn't talk to any agents at the airport. Her voice wavered as she 
explained that she has lived here for 45 years, but this is the first 
time she ever felt scared because of her skin color.
  Mr. Speaker, I demand--in fact, we all should demand--that President 
Trump rescind these discriminatory orders immediately and that my 
Republican colleagues stand up against these un-American policies.
