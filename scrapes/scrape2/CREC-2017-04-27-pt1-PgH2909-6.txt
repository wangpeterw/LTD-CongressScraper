                              NORTH KOREA

  (Mr. KHANNA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)

  Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise out of a concern of this 
administration's policies to North Korea. I urge the administration to 
look at recent history.
  From 1994 to 2002, North Korea was not developing plutonium and there 
was no threat of medium- or long-range ballistic missiles. That was 
under President Clinton's leadership because President Clinton had come 
up with a deal to buy the medium- and long-range missiles from North 
Korea.
  Then what happened?
  President Bush came and disregarded both deals and put North Korea 
under the axis of evil, even though they had no relationship to 9/11. 
It was a mistake of foreign policy.
  We know the solution to North Korea. We know they have an army of 
200,000. They have 15,000 places of nuclear weapons. There is not a 
militaristic solution. The solution is to go back to the direct 
diplomacy that President Clinton had and to have South Korea engage in 
that diplomatic solution.
  There is an answer to North Korea. We cannot play games with this 
issue when President Clinton showed the framework.
