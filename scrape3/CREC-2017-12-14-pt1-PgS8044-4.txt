                     ``MEMOIRS OF A STATE INTERN''

 Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I submit for the Record a 
poem written by one of my Georgia interns, Mr. Dalton Kane of Suwanee, 
GA, a student at the University of Georgia.
  ``Memoirs of a Senate Intern'' by Dalton Kane, a.k.a. ``Dolvin'':

       The sound of footsteps echoes throughout the halls of the 
     Russell Building as senators hurry to and fro before a 
     salient vote. Chiefs of staff fervently address the concerns 
     of elite constituents while legislative staff assistants 
     frantically seek out last-minute details of the bill. 
     Meanwhile, back home in the district, case workers tirelessly 
     assist constituents with their government agency-based woes 
     and field reps travel all across the state to ensure every 
     voice is heard. Behind the scenes, an IT guy (who's probably 
     a die-hard liberal) labors ceaselessly to make it all happen. 
     This is democracy in action- the realization of a three-
     hundred-year-old experiment that connects the government to 
     its people. Yet, there is one important link to this 
     Constitutional dream that has been forgotten. That link is 
     the Senate intern.

       Located at the lowest echelon of power, the senate intern 
     watches his phone light up like a Christmas tree as the 
     constituency descends upon the office. He answers call after 
     call with the simple reassurance that it will be passed on. 
     Yet, as the mountain of the constituency begins to overwhelm 
     him, he may slowly start to lose hope. However, as he glances 
     at the Reagan portrait hanging before him, he knows that he 
     is the gate between the senator and his constituency, and he 
     must carry on. And I Dalton, aka Dolvin, have come to find 
     myself in this valued position fall semester of 2017.
