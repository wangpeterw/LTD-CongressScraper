            By Mr. SESSIONS:
        H.R. 2117.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article I, section 8, clause 3 of the United States 
     Constitution (relating to Congress' power to regulate 
     commerce . . . among the several states . . .). The United 
     States Congress initially enacted ERISA under the Commerce 
     Clause in order to stabilize employee pension plans that 
     employees carry with them across state lines. This bill 
     modifies ERISA and is thus a regulation of commerce--
     specifically pension plans--among more than one state.
