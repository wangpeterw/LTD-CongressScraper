                    INDIVIDUAL TAXES WILL NOT GO UP

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I want to share with you a letter that was 
received in the Rules Committee last night.
  It is a letter actually addressed to Chairman Kevin Brady of the Ways 
and Means Committee. It is from the Joint Committee on Taxation. It is 
a long letter. I will not read all of it. Some of it is difficult to 
understand, but let me pick out the important points.
  In each case, the taxpayers' total income tax liability is lower. 
Here is their concluding paragraph:

       In its totality, the combined effect of the tax rate and 
     the income threshold and amendments made by the bill, along 
     with the increase in the standard deduction, would not, in 
     and of themselves, result in an increase in the amount of tax 
     imposed on virtually any filer as a result of these changes.

  Translation: no one's taxes go up; not 36 million; not 3,600; not 36. 
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, that number is zero, Mr. 
Speaker.
