                         REMEMBERING GARY LEWIS

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life 
of Mr. Gary Lewis who passed away on November 20 at 65 years of age.
  Mr. Lewis was well known in Jesup, Georgia, for serving his community 
with his dentistry practice. For years in Jesup, he served all corners 
of his town with quality dental care, and, after his retirement, Dr. 
Hugh Armstrong continued his legacy of dentistry.
  Mr. Lewis' dedication to his community is exemplified by his work 
with Help a Child Smile Mobile Dental Program. In this program, Mr. 
Lewis would go into schools and use his expertise as a dentist, free of 
charge, to serve students whose parents may not have the funds, the 
time, or the ability to regularly take their child to a dentist.
  Outside of dentistry, Mr. Lewis enjoyed hunting and fishing and was 
an active member of the Jesup Primitive Baptist Church.
  I know the entire Jesup community will miss Mr. Lewis' bright spirit 
and helping hand.
