  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues to 
please join the Urban Agriculture Production Act of 2017, a bipartisan 
measure that bolsters local farming and inspires communities to create 
food production systems that stimulate development and healthy eating.
  There are more than 23 million people in food-desert neighborhoods 
across our country where there are no stores within 1 mile to buy 
healthy food. Without healthy options, people are relegated to eating 
unhealthy, processed, junk food because that is all that is available 
and affordable.
  Communities that lack access to fresh, nutritious, affordable foods 
are also facing growing epidemics of obesity-related diseases such as 
hypertension, high blood pressure, and diabetes. This bill is a step to 
correct this unacceptable trend.
  Community gardens, greenhouses, farmers' markets, hoop houses, and 
other local food initiatives tend to be the best outlets to purchase 
local fresh

foods. Our bill builds on these local successes by expanding local 
farming in nontraditional agricultural areas like our cities and towns.
  Mr. Speaker, urban food production should be part of America's 
solution for healthier communities. I hope my colleagues will join me 
in helping to unleash the power of our communities to produce healthier 
foods for the future. Let's make it happen.
