                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O Lord our God, we are grateful for Your marvelous works and power. 
Keep us from becoming weary in doing what is right, as You remind us 
that a harvest of blessings is certain. Give strength to our lawmakers 
and bless them with Your peace. We praise You that You are the strength 
of our lives and we need not fear for the future. As You guide our 
Senators with Your wisdom, create in them a hunger and thirst for 
righteousness, preparing them to be filled with Your Divine 
nourishment. Lord, thank You for not withholding blessings from those 
who walk upright.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
