                    PEOPLE VOTED BASED ON PRINCIPLES

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I got buoyed in a little 
dance step in my walk, not because of partisan politics, but because 
people in America voted. They voted throughout the Nation and they made 
sizeable changes, not even on partisan politics, but what I love, about 
principles. Principles of rejecting divisiveness, the misinterpretation 
of the Constitution, and the wonderment of this Nation is what these 
voters stood for.
  I also believe they recognize that they wanted direction that really 
worked for them. If we pass the tax bill, they didn't want it to be a 
tax scam where millions of middle class Americans would pay an increase 
in taxes or they couldn't deduct their medical expenses or student 
interest rates.
  The vote yesterday was for a new direction, not for any of us to take 
it for granted, but for us to recognize that it is time now for the 
American people to lead. I am so grateful for the democracy of this 
Nation and for the values of the American people. They made a 
difference yesterday. Thank you for voting.
