           RECOGNIZING GRANDVIEW HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL

  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Grandview 
High School girls basketball team from Aurora, Colorado. The Wolves 
triumphed in their 61-32 victory over Lakewood High School in the 
Colorado 5A State Championship.
  Grandview finished the season with an impressive 27-1 record and 
celebrated the culmination of their season with the first girls 
basketball State championship win for their school.
  Senior Michaela Onyenwere walked off the court with a game-high of 25 
points and 8 rebounds.
  During the championship game, the Grandview Wolves proved that with 
hard work, dedication, and perseverance anything is possible. The team 
was led to the championship title through the committed leadership of 
their coach, Josh Ulitzky, and his commendable staff.
  Again, congratulations to the Grandview High School girls basketball 
team on their continued success and for their victory in the Colorado 
5A State Championship.
