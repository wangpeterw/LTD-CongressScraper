                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT

  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report for March 2017. The report compares current-law 
levels of spending and revenues with the

[[Page S1537]]

amounts the Senate agreed to in the budget resolution for fiscal year 
2017, S. Con. Res. 3. This information is necessary for the Senate 
Budget Committee to determine whether budget points of order lie 
against pending legislation. It has been prepared by the Republican 
staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget 
Office, CBO, pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget 
Act, CBA.
  My last filing, which was based on enforceable levels relative to the 
fiscal year 2016 budget resolution, S. Con. Res. 11, and the Bipartisan 
Budget Act of 2015, P.L. 114-74, can be found in the Record for 
November 16, 2016. The information contained in this report for fiscal 
year 2017 is current through February 27, 2017.
  Tables 1-3 of this report are prepared by my staff on the Budget 
Committee.
  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee 
exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays 
under the most recently adopted budget resolution. This information is 
used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, CBA. All committees are in compliance 
with their allocations assumed in the budget resolution and match the 
levels that I included in the allocation enforcement filing of January 
17, 2017.
  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on 
Appropriations exceeds or is below the statutory spending limits for 
fiscal year 2017. This information is used to determine points of order 
related to the spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. 
As the Federal Government is currently operating under the terms of the 
latest continuing resolution and temporary funding is not included in 
enforcement totals, this scorecard shows $543.5 billion in security and 
$415.2 billion in nonsecurity budget authority remain available for 
full-year appropriations.
  Table 3 tracks compliance with the fiscal year 2017 limit for overall 
changes in mandatory programs, CHIMPS, in appropriations bills, 
established in the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution. The limit for 
this fiscal year is $19.1 billion. To date, there are no recorded CHIMP 
entries on this scorecard. Division A of the Further Continuing and 
Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, P.L. 114-254, included a 
qualifying CHIMP, $170 million, but the Appropriations Committee 
included a provision to prevent its budgetary effects from being 
entered onto the scorecard. This exclusion was the first of its kind 
since the creation of the new rule in 2015. This information is used 
for determining points of order under section 3103 of that resolution.
  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican 
staff, I am submitting tables from CBO, which I will use for 
enforcement of budget totals agreed to by the Congress.
  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2017. This 
information is used to enforce aggregate spending levels in budget 
resolutions under section 311 of the CBA.
  For fiscal year 2017, CBO annualizes the temporary effects of the 
latest continuing resolution that provides funding through April 28, 
2017. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the Budget Committee 
excludes this temporary funding. As such, the committee views current-
law levels as being $953 billion and $583.2 billion below budget 
resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively. 
Revenues are consistent with the levels assumed in the budget 
resolution. Finally, Social Security outlays and revenues are at the 
levels assumed in S. Con. Res. 3.
  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate 
pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. Following passage of the budget resolution 
in January, I reset the Senate's PAYGO scorecard to zero. Since passage 
of the resolution, there have been no laws enacted that have a 
significant effect on the Federal Government's budget deficit over 
either the 6- or 11-year periods. The Senate's PAYGO rule is enforced 
by section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget 
resolution.
  Finally, included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate's 
budget enforcement activity on the floor. No budget points of order 
have been raised since the passage of the budget resolution.
  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.
  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in 
the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                                                    U.S. Congress,


                                  Congressional Budget Office,

                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 2017.
     Hon. Mike Enzi,
     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,
     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of 
     Congressional action on the fiscal year 2017 budget and is 
     current through February 27, 2017. This report is submitted 
     under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the 
     Congressional Budget Act, as amended.
       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues 
     are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of 
     S. Con. Res. 3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 
     Fiscal Year 2017.
       Since our last letter dated November 16, 2016, the Congress 
     has cleared and the President has signed the Further 
     Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 
     (Public Law 114-254). That act has significant effects on 
     budget authority and outlays in fiscal year 2017.
           Sincerely,
                                                       Keith Hall.
       Enclosure.

  purposes. These amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:


 
                                                                    Budget
                                                                  Authority-        Outlays-         Revenues
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations                 -2--             -1--                0
 Act, 2017 (P.L. 114-254)--..................................
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
c Division A of P.L. 114-254 contains the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017, which provides funding
  for those agencies within the jurisdiction of 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills through April 28,
  2017; those amounts are shown under the ``Continuing Resolution'' section of this table. Certain provisions in
  Division A provide funding until or beyond the end of fiscal year 2017; those amounts are shown in the
  ``Previously Enacted'' section of this table. In addition, Division B of P.L. 114-254 contains the Security
  Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, which provides funding until or beyond the end of fiscal year 2017 for
  overseas contingency operations; those amounts are shown under the ``Previously Enacted'' section of this
  table.
d Sections 193-195 of Division A of P.L. 114-254 provided funding, available until expended, for innovation
  projects and state responses to opioid abuse. CB0 estimates that, for fiscal year 2017:
The $20 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 193 would result in an additional $5
  million in outlays for FDA innovation projects;
The $352 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 194 would result in an additional $91
  million in outlays for NIH innovation projects;
The $500 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 195 would result in an additional $160
  million in outlays for state response to opioid abuse.
Consistent with sections 1001-1004 of P.L. 114-255, for the purposes of estimating the discretionary budget
  authority and outlays for these provisions under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974 and the
  Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Act of 1985, these amounts are estimated to provide no budget authority
  or outlays.
e For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as
  approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a
  result, current level does not include these items.
f Excludes $81,872 million in budget authority and $40,032 million in outlays assumed in S. Con. Res. 3 for non
  regular discretionary spending, including spending that qualifies for adjustments to discretionary spending
  limits pursuant to section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, that is
  not yet allocated to the Senate Committee on Appropriations.
