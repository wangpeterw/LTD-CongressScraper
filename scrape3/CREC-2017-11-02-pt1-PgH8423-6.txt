                               TAX REFORM

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, today House Republicans introduced H.R. 1, 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
  This day has been a long time coming. Since Republicans gained the 
majority in 2011, there have been numerous congressional hearings and 
briefings, feedback from constituents on

what tax reform might look like, and even the introduction of a 
comprehensive reform bill introduced in the last Congress. Republicans 
campaigned on a better way to tax reform in specified areas for reform, 
and we followed that up earlier this year with a framework document 
setting forth our principles.
  Today is the culmination of more than 6 years of work, but our work 
is not done. Now Members of Congress and the public will have the 
opportunity to study the legislation in detail. When all the dust 
settles, two questions will remain:
  Will this put more money in the average American's pocket?
  Will this put America in a much better position in the global economy 
and allow us to finally break through years of stagnation with much 
healthier growth, more jobs, and higher incomes?
  That should be our focus. I encourage everyone to visit 
fairandsimple.gop, and I look forward to a real debate on how tax 
reform and tax cuts will relight opportunities for all Americans.
