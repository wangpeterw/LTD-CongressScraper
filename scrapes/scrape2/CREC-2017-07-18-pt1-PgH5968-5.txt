                  RECOGNIZING BINGHAMTON RUMBLE PONIES

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Binghamton 
Rumble Ponies, the Double-A affiliate of the New York Mets, who 
recently invited me to throw out the first pitch at their Fourth of 
July celebration.
  Previously known as the Binghamton Mets, this is the first season 
that the Rumble Ponies have galloped onto the field at NYSEG Stadium 
with their new name.
  Binghamton, New York, has the unique distinction of being the 
carousel capital of the world. While there are fewer than 170 antique 
carousels in the United States and Canada, 6 of them are in Binghamton 
and the surrounding region. It is this proud local distinction to which 
the Rumble Ponies owe their name.
  I also had the pleasure of watching the game with Jeff Wilpon, the 
owner of the New York Mets. I know I speak for everyone in the Southern 
Tier when I say that it is time to ``Saddle up for Funn.''
