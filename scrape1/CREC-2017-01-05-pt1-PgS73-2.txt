                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O Lord, as our lips are open in prayer, so may our hearts be open to 
receive Your Spirit. Help us to bow to Your will and live lives devoted 
to Your providential leading.
  Lord, bless our Senators in their work. Let faith, hope, and love 
abound in their lives. Help them to seek to heal the hurt in our Nation 
and world and to be forces for harmony and goodness. Remind them that 
they will be judged by their fruits and that You require them to be 
productive and faithful. May they seek to serve rather than be served, 
following Your example of humility and sacrifice. Open their minds and 
give them a vision of the unlimited possibilities available to those 
who trust You as their guide.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
