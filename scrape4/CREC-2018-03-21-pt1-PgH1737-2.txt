                        INSULT TO OUR PRINCIPLES

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege of being 
involved in a number of international organizations representing the 
United States. We are defined by our love, appreciation for democracy, 
and for selling that around the world.
  The call that was made by the Commander in Chief yesterday to 
Vladimir Putin, whose election was a failure, at best, was an insult to 
our principles and our values. This is the leader of a country alleged 
to have used poison gas on ally soil in London, trying to kill two 
individuals; had the interaction in Ukraine with the bringing down of 
the plane; and incarcerating many people in Russia because of their 
views.
  I think this is a poor statement for a country that promotes 
democracy. The world looks to us and seeks to be, in many instances, 
like America. They value our concern for human rights and our value of 
democracy. They wait for us to stand up against despots like Vladimir 
Putin, yet the President of the United States gives him a jolly 
congratulations for an election that was not an election.
