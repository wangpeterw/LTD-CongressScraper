          PAYING TRIBUTE TO BOONE COUNTY DEPUTY JACOB PICKETT

  (Mr. ROKITA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Hoosier hero who 
paid the ultimate sacrifice. Deputy Jacob Pickett of the Boone County 
Sheriff's Office was killed in the line of duty on March 2, 2018.
  Jacob was a 5-year veteran in law enforcement and served as the 
leader in the department's K-9 unit. He held the ranking of sheriff 
deputy in Boone County.
  One of Indiana's finest, Jacob is a hero and acted selflessly on the 
day that took an unexpected and fatal turn. But he died doing what he 
was trained to do: protecting the thin blue line and keeping the 
community he loved safe from harm's grasp, and he did that that day.
  Boone County citizens and all Hoosiers mourn over the loss of Jacob, 
who was known as a man of integrity and compassion.
  Jacob leaves behind his wife, Jennifer, two young children, and his 
K-9 partner, Brik, to carry on his legacy of service to fellow 
Hoosiers. His sacrifice will never be forgotten.
  As the Gospel of Matthew says:

       Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called 
     children of God.

  Rest in peace, Deputy Pickett.
