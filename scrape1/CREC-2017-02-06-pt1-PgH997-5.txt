                    OPPOSE THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL BAN

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, earlier today I joined members of my 
community to discuss the impact of President Trump's Muslim and refugee 
ban.
  I wanted to read from a statement given by one of my constituents who 
participated in the discussion today. Her name is Nureed. She wrote:

       I have always been grateful for being an American and for 
     the sacrifice my parents made to afford me my American Dream. 
     Yet, every day, since the Republican nominee for President 
     was announced, I have feared for my safety and the safety of 
     my little children.
       I hold my breath every day praying that the day will not 
     come that I need to flee my home for fear of retribution or, 
     worse, because of my faith.

  Mr. Speaker, Nureed is an American who realized the American Dream. 
She is not a threat to this Nation, nor are her young children a threat 
to this Nation.
  President Trump wants to shut the door to the American Dream. He is 
tearing apart the fabric of this Nation before our eyes. I urge my 
Republican colleagues to remember Nureed's words and to oppose the 
President's unconstitutional ban.
