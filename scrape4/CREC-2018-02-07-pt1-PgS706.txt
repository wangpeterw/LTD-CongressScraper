                                 ______
                                 

 SENATE RESOLUTION 395--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT AMBUSH 
 MARKETING ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE UNITED STATES OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC 
                                 TEAMS

  Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bennet, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. 
Gardner) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

                              S. Res. 395

       Whereas the 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games will 
     occur on February 9, 2018, through February 25, 2018, and 
     March 9, 2018, through March 18, 2018, respectively, in 
     PyeongChang, South Korea;
       Whereas approximately 3,000 athletes representing 90 
     nations across 7 sports are expected at the Olympic Winter 
     Games PyeongChang 2018 and 670 athletes representing 
     approximately 45 nations across 5 sports at the Paralympic 
     Winter Games PyeongChang 2018;
       Whereas American athletes have spent countless days, 
     months, and years training to earn a spot on the United 
     States Olympic or Paralympic teams;
       Whereas the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act (36 
     U.S.C. 220501 et seq.)--
       (1) established the United States Olympic Committee as the 
     coordinating body for all Olympic and Paralympic athletic 
     activity in the United States;
       (2) gave the United States Olympic Committee the exclusive 
     right in the United States to use the words ``Olympic'', 
     ``Olympiad'', ``Paralympic'', and ``Paralympiad'', the emblem 
     of the United States Olympic Committee, and the symbols of 
     the International Olympic Committee and the International 
     Paralympic Committee; and
       (3) empowered the United States Olympic Committee to 
     authorize sponsors that contribute to the United States 
     Olympic or Paralympic teams to use any trademark, symbol, 
     insignia, or emblem of the International Olympic Committee, 
     the International Paralympic Committee, the Pan-American 
     Sports Organization, or the United States Olympic Committee;

       Whereas Team USA is significantly funded by 35 sponsors who 
     ensure that the United States has the best Olympic and 
     Paralympic teams possible;
       Whereas in recent years, a number of entities in the United 
     States have engaged in marketing strategies that appear to 
     affiliate themselves with the Olympic and Paralympic Games 
     without becoming official sponsors of Team USA;
       Whereas any ambush marketing in violation of the Lanham Act 
     (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.) undermines sponsorship activities 
     and creates consumer confusion around official Olympic and 
     Paralympic sponsors; and
       Whereas ambush marketing impedes the goals of the Ted 
     Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act (36 U.S.C. 220501 et 
     seq.) to fund the United States Olympic and Paralympic teams 
     through official sponsorships: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
       (1) official sponsor support is critical to the success of 
     Team USA at all international competitions; and
       (2) ambush marketing adversely affects the United States 
     Olympic and Paralympic teams and their ability to attract and 
     retain corporate sponsorships.
