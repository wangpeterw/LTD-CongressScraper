                 CONGRATULATING TRINI GARZA HIGH SCHOOL

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Trini Garza 
High School for earning the designation of National Title I 
Distinguished School for the 2016-2017 school year.
  This exclusive designation is given to high-poverty schools that 
excel in either student performance or for its work to close the 
achievement gap. Garza, with a student body that is 86 percent 
economically disadvantaged, was one of 34 schools across the Nation to 
be praised ``for its exceptional student performance for two or more 
consecutive years.''
  Garza's designation would not be possible without the strong 
partnerships of its educators, parents, students, and the Oak Cliff 
community in Dallas. Each of you have made sure that we are doing our 
part to empower our future leaders with the tools they need to succeed.
  Congratulations, Trini Garza High School, for your well-deserved 
recognition.
