                              SOUTH SUDAN

  (Ms. BASS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, last month, the U.N. declared a famine in 
parts of South Sudan. As I rise today, more than 100,000 men, women, 
and children there are facing immediate starvation. Arguably, this was 
an avoidable crisis.
  Internal conflicts have worsened the dire living conditions for the 
people of South Sudan, and the government of the Republic of South 
Sudan must live up to its promise and ensure access to the most 
vulnerable communities by humanitarian organizations. According to 
recent estimates, without immediate action, an additional 5.5 million 
people living in South Sudan will experience famine.
  Although we haven't yet seen the President's budget, it is reported 
that there is a 37 percent decrease in foreign aid. This could include 
severe cuts to humanitarian funding.
  In this regard, I introduced H. Res. 187 in support of the efforts by 
USAID and other providers of humanitarian assistance in the 
international community. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to support this bipartisan resolution, and, by doing so, begin an 
end to this crisis.
