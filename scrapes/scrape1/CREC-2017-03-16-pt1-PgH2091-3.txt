                   HOUSE REPUBLICANS FULFILL PROMISE

  (Mr. WILSON of SOUTH CAROLINA asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, an editorial last week in 
the Post and Courier of Charleston cites ``GOP health bill a start,'' 
which provided accurate insight into how the American Health Care Act 
is the first step in a three-step approach on how to put patients back 
in control of health care.
  The editorial states: ``Any flaws not withstanding, it's an important 
step forward for the GOP to put a fully fleshed-out healthcare bill on 
the table. . . . But there is certainly cause for optimism that a 
tweaked . . . healthcare bill can at least bandage and begin to cure 
some of the festering wounds left by ObamaCare. . . .
  ``Republicans have a chance to make things right. They have a chance 
to help more Americans afford health care in a sustainable and 
responsible way. They have the chance to place more healthcare 
decisions in the hands of patients and doctors and fewer in the hands 
of government.
  ``The bill introduced on Tuesday is a first step in the right 
direction. . . .''
  I appreciate the positive vision of Speaker Paul Ryan with President 
Donald Trump and his team of OMB Director Mick Mulvaney and HHS 
Secretary Tom Price.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism to defeat Islamic 
extremist terrorists.
