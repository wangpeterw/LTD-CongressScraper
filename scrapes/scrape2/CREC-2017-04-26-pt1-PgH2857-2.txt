       CONGRATULATING CONGRESSMAN STEVE STIVERS ON HIS PROMOTION

  (Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues in 
the Ohio delegation, to congratulate Congressman Steve Stivers on his 
promotion from colonel to brigadier general of the Ohio National Guard.
  Ohio is a State rich in history and a long list of American leaders 
who call it home. Steve's promotion marks another milestone in our 
great State's history.
  Steve Stivers, a native of Ripley, Ohio, and proud Ohio State 
Buckeye, is the first brigadier general since Rutherford B. Hayes to 
represent Ohio in Congress.
  Rutherford B. Hayes represented my district, the Second District of 
Ohio, from 1865 to 1867, before going on to serve as Governor of Ohio 
and then President of the United States.
  On behalf of the Ohio delegation, we offer congratulations and our 
gratitude for Steve's service.
  Mr. Speaker, Steve Stivers' leadership adds to our State's storied 
legacy of servant leaders and citizen soldiers. Our State and our 
Nation are fortunate that Steve Stivers has dedicated his life to 
defending the cause of freedom both in the ranks of the National Guard 
and in the Halls of Congress.
