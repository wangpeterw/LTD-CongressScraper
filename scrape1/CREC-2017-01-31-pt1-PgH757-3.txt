                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of the universe, thank You for giving us another day.
  It is Your nature to hold us in Your living presence always. It is 
our nature to think of You or of others only momentarily or in passing.
  Be with each of us that we may be our very best and prove ourselves 
worthy of Your love and Your grace.
  Bless the Members of this people's House in their work and 
deliberations today that they might merit the trust of the American 
people and manifest the strength of our Republican democracy to the 
nations of the world.
  As the new administration finds its footing and settles into its 
governing principles, may this assembly assist by remaining faithful to 
its constitutional responsibilities with the help of Your grace and 
wisdom.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.
