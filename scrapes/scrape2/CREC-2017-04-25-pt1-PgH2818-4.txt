                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  The House returns from a long recess meeting with constituents as 
concerns about budget, taxes, and immigration, among others, reveal the 
considerable divisions both in Congress and among the American populace 
as well.
  As opinions and emotions surge loudly and with little indication of 
easy solution, we take this quiet moment to ask Your blessing upon the 
Members of this people's House.
  Give each Member peace and quiet discernment to work toward common 
solutions that might ease our divisions and open the way to new hope 
and confidence that we as a nation will continue to shine as an example 
for all the world to emulate.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
