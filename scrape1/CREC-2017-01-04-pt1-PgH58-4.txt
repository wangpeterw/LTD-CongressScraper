  The Chaplain, the ReverendPatrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We thank Youfor the joy, excitement, and ceremony of yesterday, when 
the 115th Congress convened. It was a celebration of the 
ongoingAmerican experiment of participatory democracy and the peaceful 
shifting of power.
  Today begins the work of that Congress,when the difficulties facing 
our Nation, and some communities especially, come into focus. We ask 
again an abundance of Yourwisdom for the Members of the people's House.
  May we be forever grateful for the blessings our Nation enjoys 
andappropriately generous with what we have to help those among us who 
are in need.
  May all that is done this day be for Yourgreater honor and glory.
  Amen.
