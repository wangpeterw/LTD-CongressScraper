                 CONGRATULATING THE EDEN PRAIRIE EAGLES

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Eden 
Prairie High School girls lacrosse team for recently winning their 
third consecutive State title.
  The Eagles showed perseverance and grit by overcoming an early 
deficit to The Blake School in the championship game. It was the ninth 
meeting between these two schools in the State's final in a 10-year 
period. Eden Prairie rallied back to win 16-10, giving them the State 
title.
  The girls' drive for another championship led them to have a 20-1 
overall record, the number one ranking in the State, finishing 19th in 
the country.
  Senior Naomi Rogge and sophomore Abby Johnson both carried the team 
by scoring four and six goals, respectively.
  These student athletes work extremely hard, Mr. Speaker, not only on 
the lacrosse field, but also in the classroom. Our community is very 
proud of their hard work and dedication, and I am delighted to share 
that these young women rose to the occasion and claimed yet another 
championship.
  Congratulations to the Eden Prairie Eagles on their win.
