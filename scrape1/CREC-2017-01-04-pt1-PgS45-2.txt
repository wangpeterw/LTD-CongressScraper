                         TRIBUTE TO LARRY CLARK

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the first time in three decades, 
the Kentucky General Assembly began their regularsession this month 
without the fiery voice and passionate character of State 
Representative Larry Clark. After an impressivecareer, Representative 
Clark started a new adventure: retirement. He will be remembered for 
many accomplishments in Frankfort,among them that he never missed a 
single floor vote.
  Despite our differences, Representative Clark and I both care deeply 
for Kentucky. As speaker pro tempore of the house, hechampioned the 
merger of the Louisville and Jefferson County governments, an issue I 
fought for when I was the countyjudge/executive. We also share a 
passion for the University of Louisville, and Representative Clark has 
a record of achievementson behalf of the school.
  I join the Kentucky General Assembly in congratulating Representative 
Clark on his career of public service. He dedicatedmany years to 
Kentucky, and I wish him well in retirement.
