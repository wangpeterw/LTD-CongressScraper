      RECOGNIZING THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF BOY SCOUT TROOP 14

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Boy Scout Troop 14 of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, on its centennial 
celebration.
  Troop 14 is the oldest consecutively chartered troop in the 
Susquehanna Council Boy Scouts of America. Saint John's-Newberry United 
Methodist Church has been its sponsor for these 100 years.
  Troop 14 has provided scouting to boys in Newberry and the 
surrounding area. Impressively, the troop has produced 127 Eagle Scouts 
during that time. It has been through the efforts of many that the 
troop has been and continues to be an active and strong unit. For 100 
years, Troop 14 has helped scores of Boy Scouts build a more 
conscientious, responsible, and productive society.
  The Boy Scouts of America is one of the Nation's largest and most 
prominent values-based youth development organizations, providing 
programs for young people that build character, train them in the 
responsibilities of participating citizenship, and develop personal 
fitness.
  Mr. Speaker, along with my colleague,  Tom Marino, I commend Troop 14 
on its centennial celebration for building so many future leaders by 
combining educational activities and lifelong values with fun. I wish 
them the very best on this milestone occasion and look forward to 
another 100 years of excellence.
