      SUPPORT FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA, IRAN, AND NORTH KOREA

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. Wagner) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support of the 
Russia, Iran, and North Korea Sanctions Act. These countries actively 
undermine U.S. national security and threaten the safety and freedoms 
we enjoy in the United States.
  Yesterday, Congress acted swiftly, voting 419-3 to defend the 
interests of the American people. I commend the leadership of House 
Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Royce and Majority Leader McCarthy 
for moving forward strong, meaningful legislation targeting the regimes 
carrying out brutal human rights violations against vulnerable peoples 
across the globe and threatening our national security.
  The Obama administration, time and again, failed to hold these 
regimes accountable, and the outcomes of that inaction have had lasting 
ramifications on global stability and security.
  U.S. officials are warning that North Korea will soon be able to 
launch a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile. And, to be 
clear, North Korea will soon have the capacity to kill American 
citizens on American soil. These are alarming developments and the 
United States must act aggressively to strengthen our own missile 
defense and immediately restrict North Korea's access to cash.
  Murderous, tyrannical regimes have no place in the world, and I am 
confident that these bills will hold corrupt dictators accountable and 
advance justice for some of the world's most repressed populations.
