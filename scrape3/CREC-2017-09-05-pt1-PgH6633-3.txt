                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear Lord, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  In the wake of a great American holiday, we ask Your special blessing 
on American workers: those fortunate to have jobs during these 
difficult economic times, and those desiring work. May they know and be 
confident of the nobility and sacredness of their labor.
  Lord, the task facing the Nation's Congress is a difficult one, which 
will call upon each Member to consider what is best for American 
workers first. It is the challenge facing all Americans.
  Give the Members wisdom in their work, that our economy might 
continue to rebound, and our countrymen and -women throughout these 
United States be able to provide for their families to build lives we 
have all come to expect for our citizens.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
