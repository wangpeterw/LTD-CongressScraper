         RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION MUST CONTINUE IN HOUSE UNIMPEDED

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, yesterday we learned that the first 
charges of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation had been filed 
against President Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his 
business associate Rick Gates.
  But just as importantly, we learned that former Trump campaign 
foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to 
the FBI about his attempts to contact the Russian Government. The 
investigation is gaining momentum and must go on.
  In the Senate, Majority Leader McConnell has refused to commit floor 
time to legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller's investigation 
from outside interference. If the Senate refuses to act, the House 
must. It is imperative that we allow the investigation into Russian 
interference in our democracy to continue unimpeded and unhindered.
  Yesterday's news may be the first public revelations, but they cannot 
be the last. The investigation into the Russian Government's attempts 
to sabotage our democracy must continue. I urge Speaker Ryan and the 
House leadership to commit to safeguarding the independence and 
integrity of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation.
