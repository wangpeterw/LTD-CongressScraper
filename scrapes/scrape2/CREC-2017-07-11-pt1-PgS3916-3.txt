                   RECOGNIZING THE ALCHEMIST BREWERY

 Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, my staff recently had the pleasure 
of visiting with Jen Kimmich of The Alchemist Brewery in Stowe, VT.
  The Alchemist owners Jen and John Kimmich are model employers who 
have shown considerable dedication toward creating positive working 
conditions for their employees. Their workers receive excellent 
benefits and working conditions, including livable wages, paid sick 
days, vacation time, health insurance, wellness opportunities, paid 
family leave, and generous retirement benefits. The Alchemist not only 
produces an internationally award-winning product, but it has also 
fostered a workplace culture where people are put before profits.
  Further, I would like to thank Jen for her statewide leadership 
championing workers' rights. She serves on the State Workforce 
Development Board helping to create opportunities for good jobs in 
Vermont. Through her volunteer work with Main Street Alliance, Jen has 
advocated for paid sick leave and paid family leave legislation.
  I also commend the company for developing The Alchemist Foundation.

The Foundation provides college scholarships and career pathway 
opportunities for area youth.
  I am grateful for all that they do for their employees, their 
community, and the entire State of Vermont. Companies across the Nation 
should follow in The Alchemist's footsteps by supporting workers' 
rights and creating a positive workplace.
