                    PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks President Donald 
Trump's first 100 days in office. While President Trump has claimed 
that this is the most productive any President has been, he has not met 
his own deadlines that were set during his campaign and subsequent 
victory.
  Since day one, this administration has pursued only works that 
represent the detriment to this country and our democracy. He has made 
outlandish, hateful, and harmful healthcare proposals. He has plans to 
gut the Federal budget in exchange for tax cuts for his wealthy 
friends. He has rolled back the progress made by the Department of 
Justice under the previous administration. He and his family continue 
to make money off of his position, and he has used the Congressional 
Review Act to roll back protections for our environment, public 
education, gun safety, and women's rights.
  We are 100 days in, and we have over 4,000 more days to go. Mr. 
President, Mr. Speaker, and the residents of New Jersey's 12th 
Congressional District, we are counting down those days.
