              SHORE UP FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, I had a chance to go out 
in the district and look at the conditions of our flood control system 
in northern California, which, I am sure, is reflective of a lot of the 
systems across this country. One particular area I was shown has had 10 
feet of levee eaten away just since the end of December. This points 
out, with recent legislation that has been passed--good legislation--
that we still aren't, by any means, close to fulfilling our 
infrastructure needs.
  Our flood control systems all over the country and in my own district 
in northern California need immediate results. We expect a great amount 
of rain. I know we complain about drought in California--feast or 
famine--but we need to continue to shore up these systems here because, 
otherwise, it will place communities in danger from the high flows we 
could get.
  With so much rain forecasted in the near future and with our lakes 
getting full, there won't be a place to put that water. We need this 
infrastructure, and we need the Army Corps and everybody to be on board 
with fully developing and permitting these projects and getting the 
money going. Urgency is needed.
