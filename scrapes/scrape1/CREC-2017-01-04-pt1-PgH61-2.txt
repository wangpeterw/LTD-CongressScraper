                  THE MEDIA COULD PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE

  (Mr. SMITHof Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the national liberal media continue 
to promote a divided America. This is largelya result of their chosen 
candidate not winning the Presidential election. Since 91 percent of 
the media's coverage of President-elect Trump was negative, it is no 
surprise that they still see America in a negative light.
  But the media could play a muchmore constructive role. They could 
report the good news that Americans are more confident about the future 
than they have beenin 20 years. They could report on President-elect 
Trump's ability to attract individuals of competence and experience to 
hisadministration. They could report on his fresh approach and new 
ideas for, yes, making America great again.
  Let's hope themedia will put aside their bias and give the American 
people the facts, untainted by personal animosity. If they do, our 
countrywill be better for it.
