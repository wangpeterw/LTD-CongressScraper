                       RECOGNIZING NESTOR GARCIA

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, at about 2 a.m. this morning, our HPD, 
Houston Police Department, faced a tragic incident of one of our 
officers who was participating in a stop along with other officers on 
I-59 South. Unfortunately, a driver who paid no attention to the 
flashing lights and the work of these officers sped through and hit 
Nestor Garcia.
  My last word was that he was in surgery, with his family, and that 
all of those who could be there--the chief and the mayor--were at the 
hospital with him.
  So I simply stand to ask for prayers for Nestor Garcia and his family 
and indicate that we are well aware of the work of the outstanding 
police and fire departments during Hurricane Harvey and all of the 
time. I wish him the best and strongest recovery as a young man who 
just entered the police department and just graduated. I know that our 
prayers will help him and his family.
