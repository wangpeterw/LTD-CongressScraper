             ENDING GLOBAL HUNGER WITH RISE AGAINST HUNGER

  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, Rise Against Hunger, under the 
leadership of Rod Brooks, is a charitable organization committed to 
ending global hunger by 2030. They partner with other charities, faith-
based organizations, and corporations to host meal-packaging events 
across the country where volunteers assemble nutritious meals that are 
sent to over 40 countries.
  On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to participate in a Rise Against 
Hunger meal-packaging event sponsored by The Kraft Heinz Company. I 
joined 100 volunteers to package 7,500 meals that will reach hungry 
families across the globe.
  Last year alone, Rise Against Hunger engaged over 387,000 volunteers 
at over 3,000 events nationwide to assemble over 64 million meals that 
reached nearly 1.1 million hungry people.
  I applaud Kraft Heinz and its CEO, Bernardo Hees, for their 
commitment to packing 1 billion meals over the next 5 years. I 
appreciate all that Rise Against Hunger does to address chronic 
malnutrition and alleviate poverty worldwide.
  Working together, we can end hunger now.
