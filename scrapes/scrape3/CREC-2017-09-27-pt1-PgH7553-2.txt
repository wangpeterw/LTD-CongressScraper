                             General Leave

  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill currently 
under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Florida?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Irma's direct hit to the lower and middle Keys 
was devastating to my district. Many lost everything to the storm's 
130-mile-an-hour winds and significant storm surge. Some lost their 
lives.
  But fortunately, the Keys' recovery is well underway, and the 
resiliency and generosity of Conchs and other south Florida residents 
have been on display before, during, and after the storm.
  While facing the prospects of receiving the full force of the storm, 
Key West police and fire departments decided to remain on the ground, 
risking their personal safety. They wanted to be there for their 
neighbors when the storm had passed.
  Navy personnel, under the leadership of Captain Bobby Baker, who 
sacrifice for our country every day, once again answered the call to 
serve and stayed behind to ensure they would be there to get the 
runways open and ready to receive aid. Coast Guard Captain Jeff Janszen 
also stayed to make sure the Port of Key West could open.
  Two days after the storm had passed, I visited with both of these 
leaders. They were working tirelessly to stand up their bases and had 
not yet checked on the interior of their own homes.
  Monroe County Sheriff Rick Ramsay rode out the storm at the Marathon 
shelter because he felt it was his responsibility to be there to 
protect his community. Officials from local municipalities from the 
city of Key West

[[Page H7560]]

to Ocean Reef have been working around the clock with their teams to 
get utilities up and running, roads cleared, and government offices 
operational.
  I am grateful to our first responders and all the public officials 
and employees who have been working hard to serve the people of the 
Florida Keys.
  I also want to thank my office's Florida Keys director, Nicole 
Rapanos, who has dedicated long hours to assist our constituents and 
our neighbors in the Keys so that they can get the resources they need. 
I am grateful for her dedication to her neighbors and proud to have her 
on my staff.
  Community organizations are also playing an instrumental role in the 
Keys' recovery. Nonprofit groups like Star of the Sea Outreach, Rotary 
Club of Key West, and the Florida Keys Outreach Coalition, just to name 
a few, have been volunteering their time, coordinating donations, and 
serving direct relief to the community.
  Private companies and small businesses have also stepped up to help. 
Robert Spottswood, whose family owns the Marriott Beachside, opened up 
the hotel to first responders, Navy personnel, and others who chose to 
ride out the storm.
  Baby's Coffee, which was left with its own damage from the storm, was 
providing their entire stock to residents of Key West, along with hot 
meals and coffee.
  Ikon Builders and UDT have brought supplies to the food banks and 
donation distribution centers. The Marathon EOC, which has been 
operating 24/7 and where approximately one-third of employees had lost 
their homes, these people continued working to help in recovery and 
rebuilding, and the list goes on.
  On the individual level, people have gone above and beyond to show 
their true Conch spirit. They have shared their own supplies and taken 
time to go help neighbors. The outpouring of support from local heroes 
in the Florida Keys has been so extraordinary, I could be here all day 
telling the stories of thousands upon thousands of acts of kindness. 
This powerful sense of community and humanity is one of the many 
reasons I am proud to represent these local heroes.
  Mr. Speaker, clearly the Keys' recovery is well underway. Tourism 
will be opening up again next week, nearly 3 weeks earlier than 
anticipated. I have no doubt continued recovery efforts will make the 
Florida Keys an even greater one-of-its-kind paradise Americans from 
across the country and people from all over the world have come to 
love.
  But the truth is, the Keys' tourism-based economy has been stalled, 
and perhaps the greatest devastation is the financial strain on 
individuals, families, and small entrepreneurs. Many of those facing 
hardship are themselves working to assist their fellow survivors, 
putting their personal interests aside. This community is doing its 
part to help their own, Mr. Speaker.
  Now it is time for Congress to do our part to help our fellow 
Americans in my district and in similar communities throughout my home 
State of Florida, in Texas, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands.
  When we debated this bill on Monday, I told my colleagues about how 
the tax credit for wages would allow small business owners like Owen, a 
crab and lobster fisherman whose traps were destroyed in the storm, to 
claim a tax credit for 40 percent of employee wages, up to $6,000 per 
employee, helping him get his team back to work as soon as possible.
  This legislation would also allow up to 415,000 hurricane survivors 
in Miami-Dade and nearly 7,500 in Monroe County keep more of their 
paycheck by referring to earned income from the immediately preceding 
year for purposes of determining the earned income tax credit.

  We are also making it easier for taxpayers to deduct more of the 
costs from the extensive property damage these storms left behind and 
allowing anyone struggling with initial recovery efforts to have 
immediate access to their retirement savings without penalty.
  Lastly, this legislation will encourage more American businesses and 
individuals to continue generously supporting qualified hurricane 
relief organizations by lifting caps on charitable giving to these 
groups.
  Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico need Congress to act. On Monday, 
this bill was derailed by political games, posturing, and name calling. 
I hope that will not be the case today because my constituents and 
those in other communities like my district don't have time to wait. 
This tax relief package deserves bipartisan support from my colleagues.
  I want to thank Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means Committee staff 
for allowing me to shape this legislation for the benefit of south 
Florida residents, especially those in Monroe County who were hardest 
hit by Hurricane Irma. I want to thank Chairman Sessions and the Rules 
Committee for making in order my amendment that will provide additional 
benefits that are critical for our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico and 
the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands. In the aftermath of Hurricane 
Maria, they are facing a terribly difficult uphill battle to rebuild 
their communities. I stand in complete solidarity with my friends 
Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon 
of Puerto Rico, and will work to get them everything they need to 
rebuild their communities. I hope for their sake we can finally get 
this done today.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, first I want to acknowledge those individuals that Mr. 
Curbelo pointed out and congratulate them for their courage and their 
kindness as they attempt to get southern Florida back on its feet.
  But the key phrase here that my friend from Florida mentioned was the 
following: Now it is time for us to do our part.
  ``Our part'' calls for a much more vigorous effort, a much more 
robust investment, and it could, it should, be done now. We don't have 
to wait to get this done. We don't have to parcel this out in the small 
amounts that are being suggested.
  Now, earlier this week, I rose in opposition to H.R. 3823, the 
Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act, as well. 
Today, I am disappointed to say that I am not going to support today's 
updated version of the legislation either, based on the word ``more.''
  I take no issue with a clean 6-month extension of the FAA expenditure 
authority, but today's bill includes an extensive list of extraneous 
provisions.
  If we are to include extraneous measures on this must-pass 
legislation, then the process of compiling the bill should have been 
done in a bipartisan manner. Instead, our Republican friends assembled 
their near-term priorities barely, if at all, consulting the Democratic 
minority, even though many of these issues are indeed bipartisan.
  Worse, rather than work together to solve what is rapidly becoming an 
American humanitarian crisis, they chose to take most of the day off to 
unveil the tax cut for the wealthiest people in America.
  The priorities at this moment are misguided. As I noted earlier this 
week, while I support the disaster tax relief in this bill, the package 
is plainly insufficient. I had hoped that we might work together in a 
manner on these provisions, but that has not occurred.
  Traditionally, in this body, we honored and used to respect what is 
known as the national principle. It was a code of honor that bound us 
together when one part of the Nation was beset by disaster. Whether it 
was an earthquake in California, a hurricane in North Carolina, a 
tornado in Massachusetts, floods in Missouri, or forest fires in 
Alabama, we did not ask about gender, race, geography. We simply said 
the national principle prevails and the Federal Government will offer a 
robust response.

                              {time}  1745

  We are failing in that respect to set the precedent today. Instead, 
unfortunately, this disaster relief package that we will consider does 
not provide the comprehensive package of incentives and relief that 
will drive investment and speed up recovery in American communities in 
Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the devastation across 
Puerto Rico.

[[Page H7561]]

  These hurricanes left massive devastation in their wake, and the 
ongoing situation in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are dire. 
The situation not only justifies but demands a comprehensive package of 
incentives and relief to help these communities and their residents get 
back to their feet.
  Republicans will hide behind an amendment they added to the Rules 
Committee last night. It is really a fig leaf, amounting to $68 per 
person in tax relief. We can do much more for our American brothers and 
sisters in the Caribbean, especially given that the administration 
continues to drag its feet in terms of sending an emergency 
supplemental request. That should be done forthwith. We can do better, 
and we must do better.
  They are making vague assurances that we will get around to 
considering a more extensive package later, but delay and uncertainty 
will make the situation worse, not better.
  Today's package should have included other powerful and proven tax 
incentives that we have extended in the past disaster recovery efforts 
consistently. I consider this a missed opportunity.
  We need to do more to help our fellow Americans recover from these 
tragedies. Therefore, I intend to oppose this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), the distinguished chairman of the 
Ways and Means Committee.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Mr. Curbelo 
for his leadership in crafting this disaster relief package for our 
communities, and Chairman Shuster for his leadership on this bill as 
well.
  I rise today not only on behalf of the people in my district in Texas 
who have been just hammered, but on behalf of everyone in Texas, Puerto 
Rico, Florida, and the Virgin Islands, who have been devastated by this 
fall's destructive hurricanes.
  These are people who desperately need the support of our bill, the 
Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act. Hundreds of 
thousands of families have lost everything, even loved ones. This bill 
will help them begin to recover through meaningful, targeted tax relief 
they need now.
  Earlier this week, as communities continued to be decimated by 
record-high wind gusts, flooding, and storm surges, regrettably, my 
House Democratic friends opposed this critical bill, putting politics 
above the very people they represent.
  I stand here today to say we all have to do better. We have to show 
the Nation we can stand together in times of great tragedy to help each 
other and our neighbors, just as our people did in our district in the 
aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge support for this bill.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, my heart goes out, as all of us, to those 
impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. I am committed to 
providing the resources necessary for Federal response and recovery.
  We all voted for the money a week and a half ago. That took 3 days. 
Other storms in the past took 3 months, so let's set the record 
straight.
  I am pleased to support aid to those affected by Harvey, Irma, Maria, 
and I will continue to do so. We urgently need to deliver relief and 
assistance to those currently impacted by Hurricane Maria in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, where the entire island has lost power 
and many are without water.
  I can't support a bill before us today which is not even close to 
providing the robust relief that Puerto Rico needs. You know it, and we 
know it. The Congress and this administration need to step up, help 
Puerto Rico recover.
  I plan to reintroduce legislation to extend the earned income tax 
credit to residents of Puerto Rico, and I hope my colleagues will 
support it.
  The bill before us today completely circumvented the committee 
process. I am not a process person, but this bill did not have any 
hearing, despite the fact that myself and my Republican colleague from 
New York, Mr. Reed, have had legislation on comprehensive disaster 
relief for the last 5 years.
  I want to address something my good friend from Texas, the chairman 
of the Ways and Means Committee, put out yesterday in response to my 
position and others. He said that Democrats were using hurricane relief 
as a ``bargaining chip'' and ``playing politics'' to enact our own 
agenda. He also tweeted that we were ``sick,'' which I can only hope 
was tweeted by an overzealous staffer.
  This is where I usually fly off the handle, but I am going to keep 
cool, I am going to keep calm, and I am going to make sure that I am a 
real American, not judging people on where they live. I promised myself 
I would stay calm for the rest of what I have to say.
  My only agenda, Mr. Speaker, is to help those who have been hurt by 
disasters, regardless of where in the United States they live, 
regardless of what they look like, regardless of how they cook their 
food. If that is a political agenda, I don't know what world we are 
living in.
  As for ``playing politics,'' as I mentioned, the gentleman from New 
York and I introduced the National Disaster Tax Relief Act to take 
politics out of the process, to avoid having to have debates like 
these.
  Congress shouldn't pick and choose who gets disaster relief and who 
doesn't based on political whims. Tax relief should not be reserved 
only for victims of a storm that happened to impact the home district--
--
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman.
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, this bill needlessly pits residents of 
Texas and Florida against residents of New York, New Jersey, 
Connecticut, Louisiana, West Virginia, Utah, and other States. We 
should treat everyone fairly, and the Reed-Pascrell bill would do that.
  Tax relief provisions would kick in automatically for federally 
declared disaster situations, even in Montana, even in Alaska. We 
should not play favorites when it comes to helping those in need.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman.
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, so let's be clear about who is playing 
politics here. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut continue to feel 
the effects of Hurricane Sandy, just as Carolinians, Utahns, people 
from West Virginia and Louisiana still feel the effects of the major 
floods of 2015 and 2016. This is true in many other States.
  So while this bill takes a few provisions from our bill, it does not 
get into the real meat and potatoes as to how we can help everybody. 
This bill doesn't do enough in the first place, and it doesn't include 
victims of other disasters.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to demand robust and fair disaster 
tax relief. And if that is politics, so be it. I plead guilty. I want 
fairness.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the House 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3823.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to be very clear what is at stake if Congress 
fails to pass the FAA extension. Starting on October 1, no aviation 
taxes will be collected. Approximately $40 million of revenue will be 
lost each day; the revenue that would have been used for airport 
infrastructure funding and the FAA's important safety, operational, and 
research functions.
  No new Airport Improvement Program grants will be issued to airports 
in the communities across the country.
  All FAA accounts funded out of the aviation trust fund--the 
Facilities and Equipment; AIP; Research, Engineering, and Development 
accounts--will be impacted.
  Thousands of employees will be furloughed and some will be required 
to show up to work for no pay.
  We must also be clear on the impact to hurricane recovery efforts 
currently underway by the FAA and funded from the Facilities and 
Equipment account,

[[Page H7562]]

including those in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
  The FAA is currently trying to restore radars, navigational aids, and 
other equipment damaged during Hurricane Maria. This is happening while 
stranded passengers in the San Juan airport wait without air-
conditioning and electricity for flights off the island.
  The FAA technicians are working around the clock to restore services, 
but because of the extent of the damage and the challenges of the 
terrain where equipment is located, it is difficult to determine when 
full restoration will happen.
  For instance, as we debate this bill, technicians are making their 
way to a long-range radar site on a mountain in Puerto Rico. The last 
two miles to the site through the rainforest are impassable, so the 
technicians are using chainsaws to clear a path for themselves and 
their replacement equipment. The radar and navigation equipment are 
critical for the safe operation of flights.
  We will have plenty of time to debate aviation policy in the coming 
weeks, and I look forward to it. But the FAA extension we are 
considering this week is not a pawn in a Washington game of political 
brinksmanship.
  It is time for Congress to ensure the FAA's authorities, funding, and 
disaster recovery efforts continue uninterrupted in order to help those 
impacted by the hurricanes that are desperately needed.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this critical 
legislation.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. DeFazio), who is the ranking member of the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee.
  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, this would be the fourth FAA extension in 2 
years. It didn't have to be this way. We had a bill come out of the 
committee in the last Congress and this Congress that was bipartisan 
except for one provision; that is the privatization of the Air Traffic 
Organization.
  Now, there is a citizen group out there called Citizens for On Time 
Flights--actually, Airlines for America funds this--who are saying that 
we have to fly these old zigzag routes with 1950s' radar, and if only 
we, the airlines--the same airlines, by the way, that have had their 
dispatch and reservation systems go down 39 times in the last 2 years. 
The national air traffic system hasn't gone down in the last 2 years.
  But, anyway, they could do better, they say--or Citizens for On Time 
Flights say. But, unfortunately, it is based on lies.
  We have deployed a system where we could fly planes closer together. 
It is operational, actually, but the airlines haven't purchased the 
equipment to use it, and they are not going to purchase that equipment 
until 2020 or after.
  So they are saying the FAA is dragging its feet; the FAA is over 
budget; the FAA is this, the FAA is that. No. Actually, it is the 
airlines that haven't purchased the equipment to use that system.
  Now, the other most egregious part of this privatization proposal is 
the Ways and Means Committee, Chairman Brady, has decided to give 
taxing authority to the private corporation. Now, they are not going to 
call it taxes. It is fees. Okay.
  But right now we finance our Air Traffic Organization with a 7\1/2\ 
percent tax, a progressive tax; the more expensive your ticket, the 
more you pay. That is how we finance, predominantly, our Air Traffic 
Organization.

  Well, this bill repeals that ticket tax. First thing that happens is 
the airlines raise their tickets by 7\1/2\ percent. They already did 
that once 5 years ago when there was a temporary lapse. Only two 
airlines didn't, Spirit and Alaska. Everybody else grabbed the money 
and ran, $400 billion.
  So Congress repeals the ticket tax. They raise prices 7\1/2\ percent, 
and then they would get three seats on the board. Three seats will go 
to direct airlines interests to decide what passengers and how people 
will pay to use the national airspace. So they, in all probability, 
will come up with a head tax.
  So, in addition to paying $7 billion a year for baggage fees, now we 
are going to start charging people to use the national airspace with a 
flat tax. So, hey, that is a big, great win for the people with first 
class tickets. The people, of course, who have got a $100 coach seat 
are now going to be paying more like 20 percent or 25 percent. And the 
person with a $2,000 ticket is going to pay, basically, 3-point-
something percent.
  So this is all really unfortunate because we could have passed 
already out of this House a bipartisan bill, sent it to the Senate. 
Instead of trying to jam them with this bill that is loaded down with 
riders, we would be jamming them with good, long-term policy for the 
FAA and the traveling public and the aviation industry in America.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman.
  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr Speaker, we have already heard from the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who is a member of the committee, who is 
going to oppose the bill because of provisions regarding private flood 
insurance. He thinks it will cause Federal flood insurance to collapse. 
And the two Senators from Louisiana who they are attempting to jam with 
this bill are saying they are going to oppose the bill and block it in 
the Senate. So we may end up with no continuing authorization for the 
FAA because they wanted to put these flood insurance provisions and 
other riders on this bill instead of passing them as separate 
legislation.

                              {time}  1800

  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), the distinguished 
chairman of the House Republican Conference.
  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and for his tremendous leadership on this important 
legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport 
and Airway Extension Act of 2017. It also includes a 3-month extension 
for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. This is an important 
program for many of the Tribes that I represent in my district.
  It is also a 3-month extension of the Teaching Health Center Graduate 
Medical Education program that is set to expire at the end of this 
week.
  It is estimated that we could have a national doctor shortage of 
23,000 by 2025, and when you look at the rural areas like mine in 
eastern Washington, it is especially stark. We know primary care saves 
lives, and that is why it is so important to include these provisions 
in the long-term reauthorization of the THCGME program.
  This program specially trains residents in some of the larger 
shortage areas; and when you compare it to the traditional Medicare 
program, the Teaching Health Center residents are 3\1/2\ times more 
likely to practice primary care, twice as likely to work in rural 
areas, and 2\1/2\ times more likely to work in the underserved areas.
  It is a part of the solution in solving our primary care crisis, but 
it must be funded. That is why it is so important to continue this 
funding and this legislation. Without the funding, the program will 
unravel. The centers could be forced to ramp down. Residents could be 
terminated, and some centers may be shut down and their programs 
eliminated altogether.
  I encourage my colleagues to recognize the importance of this program 
and encourage them to continue working with me on a long-term solution 
that ensures the future success of this vital program.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from 
Massachusetts for his leadership. He has been particularly helpful in 
thinking through how we can work together on the multiple crises that 
Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico are facing.
  Let me thank the manager of the bill for working on these issues as 
well.
  Let me first of all indicate, as I have done earlier today, that I 
understand that the FAA extension is a clean extension which I will 
support, recognizing the international airport that is in my district. 
But again, I will seek the important leadership on the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee, and particularly, the ranking

[[Page H7563]]

member, when it comes to dealing with not supporting privatization of 
air traffic controllers.
  I want to speak specifically to the hurricane tax relief. As I do so, 
let me particularly make mention that I had hoped this bill would have 
an extension of the CHIP program and the community health centers. 
Maybe we can work on that, because I know in many of our communities 
impacted by the hurricanes, those elements are important, community 
health centers, and, certainly, the Children's Health Insurance 
Program.
  I do want to make a point to say that I wish we could have gone 
further. I know that there were at least 21 different tax credits or 
exemptions that we could have had to help those who are impacted by the 
hurricanes, but these, I want to cite and say that I appreciate them 
being utilized for my constituents now.
  The bill would provide tax credit deductions and other relief to 
taxpayers in disaster areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and 
Maria. Most measures would apply to taxpayers in parts of Florida, 
Puerto Rico, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
  In particular, access to one's retirement funds, the bill would waive 
the 10 percent penalty on each distribution from retirement accounts 
for taxpayers in affected areas. Individuals will be eligible to make 
the withdrawal if their primary residence was in one of the disaster 
areas as of the date of the storm and they sustained an economic loss.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from Texas.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the bill would increase the size of a 
loan an individual can take from their employee retirement fund under 
the retirement plan loans. It would also provide a credit for 
businesses that were rendered inoperable by the hurricanes but that 
retained employees, and on the charitable deduction for those who are 
giving dollars between the 23rd and December 31.
  What I would like to do, Mr. Speaker, is to look at some form of a 
disaster relief tax scheme, if you will, to enhance what we are doing 
now and to listen, where we can do this in a bipartisan way, working 
with Mr. Neal, working with the chairman of the committee, and really 
making sure we have a long-term response to the journey that my 
constituents and others will have to take.
  I close by saying that now we are up to 185,000 homes that have been 
severely damaged or damaged. We have got problems with mortgage 
deductions and a number of other issues, and, therefore, I am hoping we 
can work together.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman).
  Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3823, the Disaster 
Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017, which provides 
additional time to debate the future of our Nation's air traffic 
control system.
  Earlier this week, I visited Charlotte Douglas' air traffic control 
tower and learned firsthand from the controllers about the importance 
of modernizing our traffic control system. Fortunately, Chairman Bill 
Shuster exercised leadership through spearheading H.R. 2997, the 21st 
Century AIRR Act, that does just that, by shifting the current 
bureaucratic and broken air traffic control to a stakeholder-managed, 
not-for-profit corporation. With NextGen projected to ultimately cost 
$120 billion, it is imperative that we fix our air traffic control in 
this Congress.

  Importantly, the 21st Century AIRR Act also strengthens air service 
in rural communities through ensuring that general aviation will have 
full access to U.S. airspace. It advances the remote air traffic 
control tower program, which means that rural communities are fully 
integrated into our Nation's air traffic control system.
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues on this 
critical issue facing the Fifth District of South Carolina.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. Velazquez), and I must tell you that anybody who has 
witnessed her heartfelt advocacy on behalf of the people of Puerto Rico 
in the last 24 hours would be moved. I also would say that nobody in 
this Chamber knows more about what has happened in Puerto Rico right 
now than the gentlewoman from New York, Nydia Velazquez.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I really 
appreciate those kind words.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill. As we all know, many 
people are hurting in the areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, 
and Maria. Sadly, the response by the administration has been bumbling, 
inexcusably weak, and inadequate.
  While some of the proposals in the bill are needed, these measures 
are necessary, but far from sufficient to help Puerto Rico recover. If 
anything, these half steps are an insult to the American citizens 
living in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
  Puerto Rico is hurting. They do not need legislative lip service 
passed just so that the majority can claim they are helping. Instead of 
taking real and meaningful steps to provide much-needed relief for 
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, this bill ignores the challenges 
they face.
  Providing personal casualty assistance and penalty-free withdrawals 
from retirement accounts is commendable, but not for Puerto Rico. Just 
under half the island is living in poverty, and the average median 
income is under $20,000. In fact, 67 percent of workers have no money 
left to save for retirement after paying bills, and only one in five 
workers is contributing to retirement savings.
  So I ask you, what savings will they pull from, and how and when will 
this happen? American citizens in Puerto Rico cannot even get cash out 
of an ATM without waiting hours in line. Providing funds based on the 
assessed value of those provisions for Puerto Rico is insufficient. It 
is a fig leaf offered by Republicans so that they can check it off 
their list.
  In order to truly help the many victims affected by the hurricanes, 
Congress needs to start by providing the economic support required to 
recover.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from New York.
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, this bill is unworkable for Puerto Rico 
as it stands now. I applaud the effort and speed with which this was 
drafted, but it must be strengthened to truly address the needs of 
Americans in these disaster areas.
  Even today, I got a call from the most important medical institution, 
and they are running out of antibiotics. The veterans hospital that 
treats 200,000 soldiers who have participated in every war, they do not 
have access to healthcare. This is how we honor their service? No, Mr. 
Speaker.
  Vote down this legislation.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, you just heard the eloquent testimony from Ms. Velazquez 
about what the people of Puerto Rico are facing right now.
  I wish that the majority would have approached this process 
differently. The reauthorization of the FAA could have been a simple, 
straightforward exercise. It could have and should have been a 
bipartisan effort. They saddled the FAA with unrelated partisan 
priorities, incorporated with little input from Democrats, and 
presented a weak tax package to address the recent major national 
disasters.
  As I said when a version of this bill came up earlier this week, I 
wish the disaster tax relief section were better designed and more 
extensive. This updated bill still doesn't provide adequate relief to 
the affected families and communities who desperately need it. You just 
heard from Ms. Velazquez on that basis.
  While waiving penalties on the withdrawal of retirement savings and 
expanding EITC and child tax credit provisions are helpful, the 
majority inexplicably left out some of the most economically powerful 
tax incentives on the shelf, including those that would be helpful to 
rebuild devastated infrastructure.
  Given this damage and the needs of hard-hit areas, especially the 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, I cannot understand why we are not 
including proven

[[Page H7564]]

assistance contained in previous disaster tax packages as we did to our 
family and friends in places like Texas and Louisiana.
  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, I truly deplore the way some colleagues have decided to 
politicize such a sensitive, urgent, and important issue.
  There are people in my community who are suffering, who lost their 
homes, yet they are still working hard to help their neighbors rebuild. 
For them to find out that this institution would oppose a measure to 
help them because some colleagues think it is just not good enough--
now, you heard them. They recognize there is a lot of good in this 
package, but it is not enough.

  I am the Representative of the district that was hit the hardest by 
Hurricane Irma. Chairman Brady was here. He has been working hard back 
home to help his community recover while managing his responsibilities 
here as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He is calling for 
passage of this legislation that he sponsored.
  Also putting their names on this legislation, Jenniffer Gonzalez-
Colon, the Resident Commissioner elected by Puerto Ricans on the island 
to this Chamber, she has added her name to this legislation.
  Also, Stacey Plaskett, a member of the minority who represents the 
Virgin Islands, she has added her name to the amendment we filed to 
make this legislation even stronger.
  So the Members representing the districts that were hit the hardest, 
where people are suffering--and the gentlewoman from New York is 
absolutely correct; the suffering in Puerto Rico cannot be compared to 
anything else that we are seeing here on the mainland--their 
representatives want to see this legislation pass, but some of our 
colleagues say it is just not good enough. So because this is not good 
enough for them, people should get nothing.
  We wonder. We wonder why so many Americans don't trust this 
institution, why so many Americans are frustrated with the politics in 
this country: because if it isn't perfect, if it isn't exactly what I 
want, then I am against it.

                              {time}  1815

  Now, fortunately, not all of the Members of the minority agree with 
this. When we first had this vote on Monday, 26 Democrats voted in 
favor of the legislation. And I thank them--not just for me, but on 
behalf of all of my constituents, the people of the Florida Keys, south 
Florida, and, of course, the people of Texas, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, 
and U.S. Virgin Islands. I thank my Democratic colleagues and all of my 
Republican colleagues that supported this package. I invite more 
Members from both parties to support this package today because this is 
not the time to play political games.
  Now, I understand some people here are frustrated about what may have 
happened in the past. I wasn't here, and I belong to a new generation 
of Members of this institution. Quite frankly, I think none of us on 
either side is interested in relitigating the old fights and the old 
debates. We want to see the solutions for today and tomorrow.
  The people of Florida--Monroe County, the Florida Keys, and Miami-
Dade--the people of Texas, Louisiana, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto 
Rico, they need us now. They need this solution now.
  Can we do more later?
  Absolutely. Everyone knows that this Chamber and the other will soon 
consider additional funding for FEMA--much-needed funding. I will 
support a robust package for FEMA because the agency is strained and it 
is working hard to help people all over this country and out in the 
Atlantic.
  But to say that this is not good enough, so instead we will do 
nothing is just unacceptable.
  I urge my colleagues to reconsider because I think it is important 
that we send a message of national unity to help those who are hurting. 
If we can do more in the future, we will and we should.
  So, Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just thank all of my colleagues 
that understand how urgent this situation is, how much pain and 
suffering are being experienced in these communities, and I ask them 
respectfully to please support this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for the Committee on Ways and Means 
has expired.
  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, we have all seen the terrible tragedy and suffering from 
Harvey, Irma, and Maria. We have seen the shattered homes, and we have 
seen the shattered lives. I have been to Houston and my native Texas to 
visit with a number of the victims.
  There are many tragedies, Mr. Speaker, out of these hurricanes and 
flooding, but one of the tragedies--one of the tragedies--is that in 
Harris County, where Houston is, 80 percent of the homes that were 
flooded didn't have flood insurance.
  Now, why didn't they have flood insurance, Mr. Speaker?
  I believe one of the reasons is because we have a government monopoly 
called the National Flood Insurance Program. Many people don't even 
know of its existence. Many people think they were safe because they 
were 3 feet outside of the government designated 100-year floodplain. 
Many thought that somehow this was simply rolled into their homeowners' 
insurance policy, but it wasn't.
  So, Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity to make sure that people have 
more affordable options for flood insurance.
  Wouldn't it be wonderful that for every time you saw a life insurance 
commercial or an auto insurance commercial, you saw something about 
flood insurance to help educate the American people about the need for 
this basic insurance policy?
  We could see the savings occur as people rolled this into their 
homeowners' policy.
  In the very small portion of the market, Mr. Speaker, where there is 
competition, people are saving not just hundreds of dollars, but 
thousands of dollars.
  We have heard from the Megoulas family in Pennsylvania: ``NFIP 
insurance would have cost me $2,700 a year, but I was able to find 
private coverage for only $718. . . . ''
  We heard from the Cyr family, also of Pennsylvania: ``I have 
benefited from switching to private market flood insurance from FEMA. I 
save about $1,000 per year.''
  So, Mr. Speaker, there is a piece of legislation known as the Flood 
Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act, also known as Ross-
Castor. I want to thank my colleague from Florida (Mr. Ross) for his 
leadership on this issue. It is very simple. It simply clarifies 
congressional intent that people ought to have more options.
  In particular, Mr. Speaker, as people begin to rebuild after these 
hurricanes, they need better options for flood insurance, particularly 
with the NFIP $30 billion in debt, facing another bailout, and facing 
an uncertain future. Now we need to take care of that.
  That is why I have proposed, along with Chairman Duffy, a 5-year, 
long-term reauthorization. We are currently operating under a temporary 
90-day authorization. But as we do, let's work on something that we can 
all agree on. The last time this bill came up in the House, Mr. 
Speaker, 419-0. It has recently come out of the Financial Services 
Committee 58-0.
  I am not sure you can get that kind of vote tally for a Mother's Day 
resolution. It is bipartisan. It is the very definition of bipartisan.
  So let's take one important step today to help the victims of Harvey, 
Irma, and Maria as they begin to rebuild their homes, to have more 
flood insurance options, more affordable insurance options. As we work 
through what we might disagree on in the NFIP authorization, let's pass 
today what we can agree on and help the victims today.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume.

  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this bill, which began as 
a must-pass reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration but 
has

[[Page H7565]]

now become a Christmas tree for unrelated Republican priorities.
  Puerto Rico is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis following 
Hurricane Maria that is being exacerbated by Trump's and Congress' 
failure to adequately respond. Tens of thousands in Texas and Florida 
are just beginning to pick up the pieces following Hurricanes Harvey 
and Irma. Yet, other than the small initial down payment of disaster 
aid we passed--which I might add Chairman Hensarling voted against--
Congress has yet to pass a single policy reform that will actually 
improve the lives of any of those who found themselves in harm's way.
  This is the first time in this Congress that we are debating a flood 
insurance policy change on the House floor. However, this is not a 
policy change that would address the resilience of the Flood Insurance 
Program, help families to recover, or improve our country's response to 
natural disasters. No. The Republican response to the catastrophic 
storms of these last 2 months is to muscle through the expansion of 
private flood insurance, which has long been sought by the insurance 
industry.
  Now, let me be clear. I don't oppose this policy. I voted for it last 
Congress and I voted for it when we marked it up in committee this 
year. But moving this bill at this time, while ignoring all the other 
policy responses needed but the Flood Insurance Program and the ongoing 
natural disasters in our country, is simply irresponsible.
  The NFIP will expire on December 8 of this year, and we still lack a 
credible plan to ensure that it is reauthorized for the long term. 
Therefore, I will oppose any and all efforts to break apart the debate 
on substantive reforms to the NFIP from the reauthorization debate we 
should so desperately be having.
  The bill before us today does absolutely nothing to address the 
stability of the NFIP, which is in jeopardy following a devastating 
series of catastrophic hurricanes across several States and U.S. 
territories. We know that we will need to increase the NFIP's borrowing 
authority so that policyholders from Harvey, Irma, and Maria can be 
made whole, but the chairman has no plan to deal with the debt, 
frequently telling those of us who have urged him to consider debt 
forgiveness to just forget about that idea.
  I have long called for Congress to forgive NFIP's debt, particularly 
because of the unsustainable burden placed on policyholders paying 
hundreds of millions of dollars a year just on the interest for the 
government to pay itself back. Flood insurance is already unaffordable.
  So why are we continuing to make it worse by saddling policyholders 
with interest on a debt that will never be repaid?
  We need thoughtful, comprehensive solutions to a long-term 
reauthorization that addresses the debt, affordability, mapping, and 
mitigation. That is not what we have before us today.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Ross), who is the author of the bipartisan Flood Insurance 
Market Parity and Modernization Act, which passed this body in the last 
Congress 419-0. He is the vice chairman of the Housing and Insurance 
Subcommittee and the real leader for affordable private flood 
insurance.
  Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport 
and Airway Extension Act of 2017, and I urge my colleagues to vote in 
favor of this desperately needed legislation.
  Included in this bill are two provisions that are particularly 
important to my constituents in central Florida. One is tax relief for 
families and small businesses recovering from the destruction of 
Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and Irma. The other is language taken from my 
legislation, the Private Flood Insurance Market Development Act, which 
will allow private sector insurers to compete with the National Flood 
Insurance Program.
  The catastrophic impact of the three major hurricanes is 
heartbreaking and tragic. However, it has been inspiring to witness the 
outpouring of charity and goodwill from our communities in response.
  Now it is time for this Congress to rise to the occasion. The tax 
relief for disaster victims in this legislation is a great first step.
  This bill will help individuals in the disaster areas keep their 
jobs, support retirement savers paying for recovery, encourage 
charitable contributions to help victims, and put more money in the 
pockets of families trying to get their lives back on track after 
having lost everything.
  To deny our constituents this relief because it is not enough is 
simply irresponsible. To be sure, I agree that more aid will likely be 
needed.
  But is that really a good excuse to do nothing?
  I certainly don't think so.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill isn't just about providing immediate relief. 
Thankfully, it also provides some measure of long-term relief to 
communities vulnerable to floods--the most costly of all natural 
disasters.
  Thanks to the inclusion of my legislation, H.R. 1422, this bill will 
provide consumers with more options and lower costs in the flood 
insurance marketplace as well as help to reduce the unacceptable number 
of homes not insured for flood losses.
  Last Congress, this House passed nearly identical legislation by a 
vote of 419-0. That is why I was so disheartened to hear some 
characterize this reform as a long-time Republican priority. This isn't 
a Republican priority, and it is not a Democratic priority. This is a 
national priority.
  The NFIP is more than $25 billion in debt and runs an annual deficit 
of $1.4 billion. Folks, this is an insurance company on the brink of 
being unable to pay out claims to policyholders without another 
taxpayer bailout.
  The NFIP desperately needs to off-load some of its risk, and we can 
help by allowing the private sector to do what it does best: compete 
for customers by offering better service, lower prices, and more 
comprehensive coverage.
  I understand some of my colleagues think competition will destabilize 
the NFIP. First, we need to be clear that the NFIP in its current state 
is beleaguered, it is not stable, and it is not sustainable. Reforms 
must be made.
  Second, I would urge my colleagues to recognize that by forcing 
nearly all of the flood risk in this Nation into a single, government-
run insurance program, we contribute to the NFIP's bloated and unstable 
risk portfolio.

                              {time}  1830

  So the NFIP needs some help, and consumers need competition. More 
coverage options will help make flood insurance an attractive 
investment for everyone, thereby reducing the number of uninsured 
homes.
  With the NFIP alone, our constituents are severely limited. For 
example, an NFIP policy only covers up to $250,000 of damages.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 15 
seconds.
  Mr. ROSS. In addition, NFIP policies do not cover homeowners 
displaced by living expenses.
  Mr. Speaker, this legislation has an untold number of supporters. I 
include in the Record a letter from 15 major insurance, housing, 
banking, and trade associations in support of the private flood 
insurance provisions in H.R. 3823.

                                               September 26, 2017.
     Hon. Paul Ryan,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,
     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The undersigned trades 
     and organizations strongly support the ``Development of a 
     Private Flood Insurance Market'' title of H.R. 3823, the 
     Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 
     2017. This package includes bipartisan, clarifying language, 
     introduced by Representative Dennis A. Ross (FL-15) and 
     Representative Kathy Castor (FL-14), to increase acceptance 
     of private flood insurance products. This will increase flood 
     insurance options for consumers, thereby providing more 
     competition and coverage options to families and businesses.
       The Ross-Castor language passed the House last year by a 
     vote of 419-0, and it was ordered reported out of the House 
     Financial Services Committee in June by a vote of 58-0. The 
     bipartisan fix clarifies what is already in federal law 
     (following the passage of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance 
     Reform Act of 2012 and reinforced in the Homeowners Flood 
     Insurance Affordability Act of 2014) intended by Congress to 
     allow lenders to accept private flood insurance in lieu of 
     federal

[[Page H7566]]

     coverage to satisfy the mandatory purchase requirement.
       The undersigned trades and organizations strongly support 
     inclusion of the bipartisan Ross-Castor language in the 
     Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 
     2017 that allows consumers the choice of government or 
     private flood insurance coverage. We ask for you to vote in 
     favor of this important legislative package when it is 
     considered by the House of Representatives.
           Sincerely,
       Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI)
       Reinsurance Association of America (RAA)
       National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC)

     (NAFCU).

  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott), a senior member of the 
Financial Services Committee.
  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, let me start off by letting 
the America people know fully why we Democrats on this side of the 
aisle are opposed to this bill.
  Nobody has worked as hard as Democrats on this bill, Mr. Speaker, but 
the reason we object to it is that the flood insurance part of this 
bill was a result of cherry-picking items that they wanted. The 
American people deserve better than that. Then they attach it to an FAA 
bill with a 6-month extension. That is no way to treat the issues that 
we have today.
  All you have got to do is click on the television and look at what is 
happening to American citizens in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas. And you 
are going to put something where they cherry-picked this together to 
solve this particular problem?
  There is no sense of urgency here, Mr. Speaker.
  Another reason is that, unlike all of our other disaster tax credit 
relief packages, every time we have had an expansion added to the bill, 
we expanded these tax credits for low-income people, expanded the tax 
credits for the new markets area for people to immediately come in and 
invest. Not in this bill. There is no expansion in this bill.
  My friends over there talk about bipartisanship. My middle name is 
bipartisanship. There is nobody on that committee who works harder for 
bipartisanship than David Scott.
  But the one piece of bipartisanship--our amendment that I worked 
feverishly on with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), in which 
we were able to address the issue of the penalties of expense on those 
poor people who chose to have their monthly installments there and not 
be punished for it.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman 
an additional 30 seconds.
  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. We worked together on that and cut that 
cost in half. That one bipartisan piece of endeavor in our Financial 
Services Committee is not even included in this bill. That is why we 
are opposed to it.
  Let's treat the American people the way they deserve. There is no 
better time. You are talking about expanding the help. Our people, 
American citizens in Puerto Rico, Florida, and Texas, deserve for us to 
have a complete flood insurance program, not piecemeal.
  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R. 3823.
  First, I would like to mention I have deep concerns over Republicans' 
failure to extend vital healthcare programs that expire this Saturday, 
including important bipartisan programs like CHIP, Community Health 
Centers, and the National Health Service Corps. If we fail to act, 
access to affordable and quality care for children and vulnerable 
populations nationwide will be jeopardized.
  However, I want to focus on another issue that is extremely important 
to my constituents: flood insurance.
  This bill would undermine efforts to comprehensively reform the 
National Flood Insurance Program by allowing the development of a 
private flood insurance market while not confronting challenges to 
NFIP, like increasing affordability, investing in mitigation, and 
ensuring transparency and accountability. It would not even reauthorize 
the flood insurance program, which is due to expire on December 8; or 
raise its borrowing authority, which is due to run out in the coming 
weeks and could impact claims from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.
  When Superstorm Sandy devastated New Jersey 5 years ago, some of the 
hardest hit communities were in my district, and the NFIP did not help 
them the way it should have. Too many of my constituents are still 
dealing with high premiums, inaccurate flood maps, or still waiting for 
their Sandy claims appeals to be decided.
  That is why I helped introduce the bipartisan SAFE NFIP 
Reauthorization Act, which would reauthorize the program, cap premium 
rate increases, authorize funding for more flood mapping, reform the 
appeals process, and cap the compensation of flood insurance companies. 
These are changes that we must pursue. The legislation we consider does 
none of this.
  Mr. Speaker, we should be working together to comprehensively improve 
the NFIP. Doing anything less is an abdication of our responsibility. I 
encourage all of my colleagues to oppose this legislation and work 
towards meaningful flood insurance reform.
  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of 
my time to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), a true expert on 
flood insurance issues.
  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk during this discussion 
about the flood insurance program, about making sure we are providing 
for the hurricane victims. There is talk about the FAA.
  Let me be clear: we support the FAA. We support making sure that we 
provide all the resources necessary for the hurricane victims, from 
Hurricanes Irma, Harvey, and Maria. Where things are getting distorted 
is that this bill includes extraneous provisions that will actually 
undermine these very objectives.
  I want to explain.
  Under the legislation that has been attached--the flood insurance 
legislation--it does allow private insurers to come in, which all of us 
support, but not in a vacuum. What is going to happen when you do this 
in a vacuum is that you are going to cause premiums to be diverted from 
the program.

  This is the program where these people have been paying premiums for 
years, and the program is not going to have the resources to pay their 
claims, which means it is going to have to borrow more money, which is 
going to make the premiums go up even greater.
  You are going to see the private insurers come in and cherry-pick 
low- and moderate-risk policies, which is only going to leave the high-
risk policies in the program trying to pay a debt and not having a 
diverse portfolio of low-, moderate-, and high-risk policies.
  This is a flawed approach. It needs to be addressed on December 9, 
when this current program expires. We should be addressing this 
holistically.
  I want to say it again. Those of you who have hurricane victims are 
undermining their very recovery by supporting this legislation.
  One of the other major flaws is this, Mr. Speaker. This shows 
flooding in Louisiana last year, flooding in Texas this year.
  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.

[[Page H7567]]

Duffy), chairman of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee and a leader 
on flood insurance in the House today.
  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment and thank Ms. Castor 
and Mr. Ross for their hard work on this legislation.
  There are some here in this body who have said: if we let free 
markets into the National Flood Insurance Program that is run by the 
Federal Government, you are going to undermine the premiums that come 
into the national flood insurance pool.
  It is $25 billion in debt and is structured in a way where premiums 
can't rise. This doesn't undermine the program.
  What we are doing is saying: Listen, if you are in the National Flood 
Insurance Program right now, the way it is structured, there is only 
one place you can buy insurance. But this is a provision that will open 
up the market and let private companies come in and offer families 
better policies at better prices. If they don't, you can stay in the 
NFIP. You don't have to go private. You can stay government. But you 
give people a choice.
  It is like saying: Listen, you have to keep the United States Postal 
Service as your one carrier. You can't have FedEx or UPS. You don't get 
those choices.
  People want a choice. In Houston, instead of having only 20 percent 
of the people who had coverage, you might have had 40, 50, or 60 
percent of the people who would have had coverage. More people would 
have had protection.
  I have got to tell you, I am disappointed in the partisanship.
  I am going to quote a person I rarely quote, but a person I truly 
like. She once said in the process of this bill: ``This is an example 
of real compromise.''
  Then, on the substance of the bill, this fine woman from California 
said: ``We can have the opportunity for our constituents to have some 
choice. I think that is real compromise, that is substantive 
compromise, that is meaningful compromise, and that is the kind of 
compromise that reasonable people can engage in.''
  Mr. Speaker, that was the gentlewoman from California, who is now in 
opposition to this bill.
  When this came up by itself--the same bill--last Congress, everyone 
voted for it. When it came up in committee, everyone voted for it. 
Democrats and Republicans voted for this bill because they knew that it 
was going to offer more choice and better prices to American families. 
That is why it was bipartisan.
  I think this is a moment where our Congress can stand together on 
behalf of the American people who don't have flood insurance, who don't 
have a reasonably priced policy. Let's stand with them today and pass 
the Ross-Castor bill. By the way, Ross and Castor are both from 
Florida. Two Florida Members, Republican and Democrat, came together.
  Let's get it done, Mr. Speaker.
  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 538, the previous question is ordered on 
the bill, as amended.
  Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further consideration of H.R. 
3823 is postponed.

                          ____________________
