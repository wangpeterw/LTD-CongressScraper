                              POLICE WEEK

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the law enforcement 
community, I rise today to recognize the service and the profound 
commitment of our police officers around our great Nation.
  The dedication and sacrifice of our blue line deserves to be 
respected every day. National Police Week gives us all the opportunity 
to stand together in support for those in blue and to recommit 
ourselves to the ideals and laws of our Nation that they are tasked to 
uphold.
  National Police Week is a special time to unite nationwide to honor 
those who sacrifice so much to protect our neighborhoods and our loved 
ones. To those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of 
duty, we as a nation stand eternally grateful.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize National Police Week 2017 and 
to join with the millions of proud Americans throughout our country to 
thank our law enforcement members for their continued service and 
sacrifice.
