      MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING FORMER REPRESENTATIVE JAY DICKEY

  (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of 
former Congressman Jay Dickey, who represented the Fourth District of 
Arkansas for 8 years. In the days since Congressman Dickey's death last 
week at the age of 77, tributes have poured in, with many noting his 
sense of civic duty, his love of family, and, most of all, his faith in 
God.
  If you spent much time with Jay, you likely reached a point in the 
conversation where he would pause and ask a pointed question: When you 
die, where will you spend eternity?
  I remember Jay asking me that question, and when I quickly responded 
``Heaven,'' he didn't let me off easy, as he followed up with: How do 
you know? After which, we had a long discussion sharing our common 
faith in Christ.
  There are current Members of this House who served with Jay, the 
first Republican to represent Arkansas' Fourth Congressional District. 
Regardless of political party, he was a representative of all 
Arkansans, and he genuinely cared about people.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask the Members of the House to join me and the 
Members of the Arkansas congressional delegation in observing a moment 
of silence in remembrance of Congressman Jay Dickey.
