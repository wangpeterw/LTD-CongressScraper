                RECOGNIZING PASTOR TIM BURT'S RETIREMENT

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
Pastor Tim Burt on his retirement. Pastor Burt has a long record of 
service to his community.
  He founded American Infant Care Products, which came up with the 
fold-down infant changing tables found in many restrooms today, helping 
families of all sorts by providing a convenient way to care for their 
children.
  But he also has now served as associate pastor at Living Word 
Christian Center in Brooklyn Park since 1989, establishing a small 
group ministry. In this capacity, Pastor Burt oversaw visitor and 
public relations, pastoral care, and leadership and volunteer 
departments. His dedication to our community has certainly inspired 
many Minnesotans over the years.
  Pastor Burt also served as the Minnesota State director for 
Christians United for Israel, where he developed a statewide network of 
leaders passionate about Israel, and has led a trip of fellow pastors 
to that country.
  Mr. Speaker, as we recognize Pastor Tim Burt's retirement, we are 
extremely grateful and proud of the work he has done. I wish he and 
Renee the very best in their future endeavors.
