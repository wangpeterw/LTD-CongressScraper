              HONORING THE LIFE OF PATRICK LOWERY COGGINS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Katko) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a young man 
from my district, Patrick Lowery Coggins. Pat recently passed away at 
the young age of 27 after a courageous and lifelong battle with 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
  Despite the challenges he faced, Pat lived a full and inspirational 
life, graduating from high school and college and then returning home 
to work in communications for the Syracuse Chiefs AAA baseball team.
  I had the distinct honor and privilege of meeting Pat when he and his 
Central New York United teammates won the National Power Wheelchair 
Soccer Tournament in 2015. Pat and his teammates were incredible 
advocates for increased opportunities for individuals with 
disabilities.
  And I might add that I got in one of those power wheelchairs and 
tried to do what Pat did playing soccer, and it was not easy. So I 
commend him for his skill in that regard as well.

                              {time}  1015

  Pat was beloved by his family, friends, coworkers, and so many in our 
community. He made a lasting and positive impact on all who knew and 
loved him.
  In Pat's memory, and for all of those who suffer from rare and 
incurable diseases, we must continue to invest in research, treatments, 
and cures.
  Rest in peace, Pat.
