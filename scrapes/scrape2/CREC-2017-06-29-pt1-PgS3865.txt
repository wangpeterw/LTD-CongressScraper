  SENATE RESOLUTION 215--DESIGNATING JULY 14, 2017, AS COLLECTOR CAR 
APPRECIATION DAY AND RECOGNIZING THAT THE COLLECTION AND RESTORATION OF 
   HISTORIC AND CLASSIC CARS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF PRESERVING THE 
 TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENTS AND CULTURAL HERITAGE OF THE UNITED STATES

  Mr. BURR (for himself and Mr. Tester) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 215

       Whereas many people in the United States maintain classic 
     automobiles as a pastime and do so with great passion and as 
     a means of individual expression;
       Whereas the Senate recognizes the effect that the more than 
     100-year history of the automobile has had on the economic 
     progress of the United States and supports wholeheartedly all 
     activities involved in the restoration and exhibition of 
     classic automobiles;
       Whereas the collection, restoration, and preservation of 
     automobiles is an activity shared across generations and 
     across all segments of society;
       Whereas thousands of local car clubs and related businesses 
     have been instrumental in preserving a historic part of the 
     heritage of the United States by encouraging the restoration 
     and exhibition of such vintage works of art;
       Whereas automotive restoration provides well-paying, high-
     skilled jobs for people in all 50 States; and
       Whereas automobiles have provided the inspiration for 
     music, photography, cinema, fashion, and other artistic 
     pursuits that have become part of the popular culture of the 
     United States: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates July 14, 2017, as ``Collector Car 
     Appreciation Day'';
       (2) recognizes that the collection and restoration of 
     historic and classic cars is an important part of preserving 
     the technological achievements and cultural heritage of the 
     United States; and
       (3) encourages the people of the United States to engage in 
     events and commemorations of Collector Car Appreciation Day 
     that create opportunities for collector car owners to educate 
     young people about the importance of preserving the cultural 
     heritage of the United States, including through the 
     collection and restoration of collector cars.
