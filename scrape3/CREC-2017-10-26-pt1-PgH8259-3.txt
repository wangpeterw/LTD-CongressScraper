              OFFICER CRAIG LEHNER LIVED A LIFE OF HEROISM

  (Mr. COLLINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Officer 
Craig Lehner, a Buffalo police officer who lived a life of heroism and 
who tragically died during a recent training exercise on the Niagara 
River.
  Officer Lehner was a 9-year veteran of the Buffalo Police Department, 
serving on the underwater recovery team, and also serving as a K-9 
officer. His partner, a 4-year-old German Shepherd named Shield, served 
alongside him.
  Officer Lehner served our country for 16 years as an Army National 
Guard military police officer. Having served in Iraq and Guantanamo 
Bay, he was a well-decorated staff sergeant, awarded more than a dozen 
medals for his bravery and military achievements.
  Officer Lehner made the ultimate sacrifice, and we will be forever 
grateful for his service. He will be remembered for his bravery and 
keeping Americans safe both abroad and in western New York.
  I offer condolences to his mother, Kathleen, and all of his surviving 
family during this very difficult time.
