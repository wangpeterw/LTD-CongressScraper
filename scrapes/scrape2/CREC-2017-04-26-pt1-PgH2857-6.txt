       CONGRATULATING CONGRESSMAN STEVE STIVERS ON HIS PROMOTION

  (Mr. RENACCI asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, today I want to congratulate my colleague, 
my friend, and fellow Buckeye, Congressman Steve Stivers, on his 
promotion to brigadier general. I am thankful to be joined by my 
colleagues in the House and our Senators, Senator Brown and Senator 
Portman, as we applaud our colleague.
  He is the first Ohio National Guard officer in more than 100 years to 
concurrently serve as a Member of Congress and one of the few people in 
U.S. history to have held both positions simultaneously. Congressman 
Stivers joined the National Guard in 1985, and has served for over 30 
years.
  I, and many other Ohioans, appreciate his years of service, both in 
the military and in the United States Congress.

  Congratulations, Brigadier General Stivers, and thank you for your 
service.
