                         TRIBUTE TO DAN KNUTSON

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Dan Knutson, an 
intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all of the hard work he has 
done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Dan is a graduate of Lincoln High School in Sioux Falls, SD, and a 
recent graduate of Augustana University, having earned a degree in 
psychology. He is a dedicated worker who has been committed to getting 
the most out of his experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Dan Knutson for all of 
the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the years 
to come.
