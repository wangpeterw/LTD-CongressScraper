                  ALZHEIMER'S & BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the month of June 
as Alzheimer's & Brain Awareness Month and to highlight the need for 
continued investment, innovation, research, and lifesaving cures for 
diseases like Alzheimer's that affect every family and every 
neighborhood in America.
  Right now, more than 5 million Americans are living with this 
terrible disease, with someone new developing symptoms every 66 
seconds. Studies have shown that number could rise as high as 16 
million people by 2020.
  This year, the cost of treating Alzheimer's and other dementias will 
cost Americans nearly $260 billion. By 2050, estimates are that those 
costs will rise to more than $1.1 trillion. To put that in perspective, 
as a nation, we are only spending slightly more than $30 billion, 
total, in researching cures for not only Alzheimer's, but cancer, heart 
disease, Parkinson's, diabetes--literally, all other diseases combined.
  So this month serves not only to raise awareness about Alzheimer's, 
but also for us to renew our commitment to research. Mr. Speaker, we 
must find a cure for the millions of Americans struggling with 
Alzheimer's, and it is up to us to provide the resources to do it.
