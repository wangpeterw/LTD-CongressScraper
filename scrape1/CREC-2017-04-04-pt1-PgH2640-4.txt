              RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF HENRY HALGREN

  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to recognize 
the achievement of Henry Halgren from Fort Collins, Colorado. Henry is 
a sixth grader at Liberty Common School, a middle school, a public 
charter school that is very high-performing in my district. He is the 
victor from all of Colorado in the National Geographic Bee this last 
week.
  He competed against over 100 kids at the University of Denver, and he 
was able to answer as a sixth grader the following question: Altamira 
Cave, known for its prehistoric paintings, is found in the province of 
Cantabria in the north part of what European country?
  Henry knew that the answer was Spain. He got it right. He won a 
$30,000 scholarship to CU, some prize money, and an atlas.
  I am proud to say he will be coming here to Washington, D.C., to 
represent the Second Congressional District of Colorado in May. And if 
he is able to win against the competitors from other States, the prize 
for that is a $50,000 scholarship and a family tour to the Galapagos 
Islands.
  Congratulations not only to Henry, but to all the participants who 
showed such a keen interest in learning about the world around them and 
about our planet.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Henry and his family and 
everybody who participates in furthering the knowledge about geography.
