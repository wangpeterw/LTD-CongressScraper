                RECOGNIZING VALLEY VIEW CHAROLAIS RANCH

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President. I would like to offer my 
congratulations to Valley View Charolais Ranch on their 50th Annual 
Bull Sale and cowherd. Valley View Charolais have some of the most 
proven and popular bloodlines available. They have been bred for ease 
of calving, fertility, milk, and mothering ability, as well as 
performance. Valley View Charolais Ranch's efforts to produce animals 
that will make money for all that are involved, including the producer, 
the cowman, and the packer, have been proven. Their commitment to 
producing quality 2-year-old bulls despite trends, drought, blizzards, 
fighting grasshoppers, irrigation water, and cattle price cycles, is 
remarkable and demonstrates their true dedication.
  I commend the Westphal Family for all the dedication and passion they 
have poured into the industry to be one of the Nation's leading 
breeders of purebred Charolais cattle and for selling 2-year-old 
Charolais bulls for 50 years.
