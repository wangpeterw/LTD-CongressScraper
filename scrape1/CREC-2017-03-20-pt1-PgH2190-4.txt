  a first food use are covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food use application and
  retain the same decision time review period as the new active ingredient or first food use application. The
  application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of
  five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is
  submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to
  the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that
  are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time. In
  the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any subsequent
  application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed
  labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and
  decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that
  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject
  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was
  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's
  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not
  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the
  new active ingredient or first food use application.
(3) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.

  However, if a new use application only proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no
  amendments in the application, then review of one new product application is covered by the new use fee. All
  such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the new use decision review time.
  Any application for a new product or an amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to
  submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its decision review time and (c)
  containing the same new uses, will be deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a separate
  registration service fee and new decision review time for a new use. If the new-use application includes non-
  food (indoor and/or outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is due for each type
  of new use and the longest decision review time applies to all of the new uses requested in the application.
  Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the
  applicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application after completion of the technical
  deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full
  registration service fee for the new use application.

(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in any application for a new active ingredient or
  a first food use are covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food use application and
  retain the same decision time review period as the new active ingredient or first food use application. The
  application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of
  five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is
  submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to
  the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that
  are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time. In
  the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any subsequent
  application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed
  labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and
  decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that
  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject
  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was
  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's
  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not
  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the
  new active ingredient or first food use application.
(3) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.
(4) Amendment applications to add the revised use pattern(s) to registered product labels are covered by the
  base fee for the category. All items in the covered application must be submitted together in one package.
  Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the
  amendment application package is subject to the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert
  approval. However, if an amendment application only proposes to register the amendment for a new product and
  there are no amendments in the application, then review of one new product application is covered by the base
  fee. All such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the category decision
  review time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) An application for a new end-use product using a source of active ingredient that (a) is not yet registered
  but (b) has an application pending with the Agency for review, will be considered an application for a new
  product with an unregistered source of active ingredient.
(3) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.
(4) For the purposes of classifying proposed registration actions into PRIA categories, ``pest(s) requiring
  efficacy'' are: public health pests listed in PR Notice 2002-1, livestock pests (e.g. Horn flies, Stable
  flies), wood-destroying pests (e.g. termites, carpenter ants, wood-boring beetles) and certain invasive
  species (e.g. Asian Longhorned beetle, Emerald Ashborer). This list may be updated/refined as invasive pest
  needs arise. To determine the number of pests for the PRIA categories, pests have been placed into groups
  (general; e.g., cockroaches) and pest specific (specifically a test species). If seeking a label claim against
  a pest group (general), use the group listing below and each group will count as 1. The general pests groups
  are: mites, dust mites, chiggers, ticks, hard ticks, soft ticks, cattle ticks, scorpions, spiders, centipedes,
  lice, fleas, cockroaches, keds, bot flies, screwworms, filth flies, blow flies, house flies, flesh flies,
  mosquitoes, biting flies, horse flies, stable flies, deer flies, sand flies, biting midges, black flies, true
  bugs, bed bugs, stinging bees, wasps, yellow jackets, hornets, ants (excluding carpenter ants), fire and
  harvester ants, wood destroying beetles, carpenter ants, termites, subterranean termites, dry wood termites,
  arboreal termites, damp wood termites and invasive species. If seeking a claim against a specific pest without
  a general claim then each specific pest will count as 1.

(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in any application for a new active ingredient or
  a first food use are covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food use application and
  retain the same decision time review period as the new active ingredient or first food use application. The
  application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of
  five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is
  submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to
  the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that
  are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time. In
  the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any subsequent
  application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed
  labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and
  decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that
  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject
  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was
  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's
  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not
  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the
  new active ingredient or first food use application.

(3) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.

(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in any application for a new active ingredient or
  a first food use are covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food use application and
  retain the same decision time review period as the new active ingredient or first food use application. The
  application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of
  five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is
  submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to
  the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that
  are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time. In
  the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any subsequent
  application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed
  labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and
  decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that
  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject
  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was
  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's
  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not
  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the
  new active ingredient or first food use application.
(3) If EPA data rules are amended to newly require clearance under section 408 of the FFDCA for an ingredient of
  an antimicrobial product where such ingredient was not previously subject to such a clearance, then review of
  the data for such clearance of such product is not subject to a registration service fee for the tolerance
  action for two years from the effective date of the rule.
(4) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.
(5) Amendment applications to add the new use(s) to registered product labels are covered by the base fee for
  the new use(s). All items in the covered application must be submitted together in one package. Each
  application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new
  use application package is subject to the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval.
  However, if a new use application only proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no
  amendments in the application, then review of one new product application is covered by the new use fee. All
  such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the new use decision review time.
  Any application for a new product or an amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to
  submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its decision review time and (c)
  containing the same new uses, will be deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a separate
  registration service fee and new decision review time for a new use. If the new-use application includes non-
  food (indoor and/or outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is due for each type
  of new use and the longest decision review time applies to all of the new uses requested in the application.
  Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the
  applicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application after completion of the technical
  deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full
  registration service fee for the new use application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) An application for a new end-use product using a source of active ingredient that (a) is not yet registered
  but (b) has an application pending with the Agency for review, will be considered an application for a new
  product with an unregistered source of active ingredient.
(3) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.
(4)(a) EPA-initiated amendments shall not be charged registration service fees. (b) Registrant-initiated fast-
  track amendments are to be completed within the timelines specified in FIFRA Section 3(c)(3)(B) and are not
  subject to registration service fees. (c) Registrant-initiated fast-track amendments handled by the
  Antimicrobials Division are to be completed within the timelines specified in FIFRA Section 3(h) and are not
  subject to registration service fees. (d) Registrant initiated amendments submitted by notification under PR
  Notices, such as PR Notice 98-10, continue under PR Notice timelines and are not subject to registration
  service fees. (e) Submissions with data and requiring data review are subject to registration service fees.
(5) The applicant must identify the substantially similar product if opting to use cite-all or the selective
  method to support acute toxicity data requirements.
(6) Once a submission for a new product with public health organisms has been submitted and classified in either
  A540 or A541, additional organisms submitted for the same product before expiration of the first submission's
  original decision review time period will result in reclassification of both the original and subsequent
  submission into the appropriate new category based on the sum of the number or organisms in both submissions.
  A reclassification would result in a new PRIA start date and require additional fees to meet the fee of the
  new category.
(7) Once a submission for a label amendment with public health organisms has been submitted and classified in
  either A570 or A573, additional organisms submitted for the same product before expiration of the first
  submission's original decision review time period will result in reclassification of both the original and
  subsequent submission into the appropriate new category based on the sum of the number or organisms in both
  submissions. A reclassification would result in a new PRIA start date and require additional fees to meet the
  fee of the new category.

  decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that
  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject
  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was
  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's

(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in any application for a new active ingredient or
  a first food use are covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food use application and
  retain the same decision time review period as the new active ingredient or first food use application. The
  application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of
  five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is
  submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to
  the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that
  are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time. In
  the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any subsequent
  application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed
  labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and
  decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that
  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject
  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was
  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's
  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not
  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the
  new active ingredient or first food use application.
(3) Amendment applications to add the new use(s) to registered product labels are covered by the base fee for
  the new use(s). All items in the covered application must be submitted together in one package. Each
  application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new
  use application package is subject to the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval.
  However, if a new use application only proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no
  amendments in the application, then review of one new product application is covered by the new use fee. All
  such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the new use decision review time.
  Any application for a new product or an amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to
  submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its decision review time and (c)
  containing the same new uses, will be deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a separate
  registration service fee and new decision review time for a new use. If the new-use application includes non-
  food (indoor and/or outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is due for each type
  of new use and the longest decision review time applies to all of the new uses requested in the application.
  Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the
  applicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application after completion of the technical
  deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full
  registration service fee for the new use application.
(4) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.

(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in any application for a new active ingredient or
  a first food use are covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food use application and
  retain the same decision time review period as the new active ingredient or first food use application. The
  application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of
  five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is
  submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to
  the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that
  are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time. In
  the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any subsequent
  application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed
  labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and
  decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that
  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject
  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was
  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's
  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not
  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the
  new active ingredient or first food use application.
(3) An application for a new end-use product using a source of active ingredient that (a) is not yet registered
  but (b) has an application pending with the Agency for review, will be considered an application for a new
  product with an unregistered source of active ingredient.
(4) (a) EPA-initiated amendments shall not be charged registration service fees. (b) Registrant-initiated fast-
  track amendments are to be completed within the timelines specified in FIFRA Section 3(c)(3)(B) and are not
  subject to registration service fees. (c) Registrant-initiated fast-track amendments handled by the
  Antimicrobials Division are to be completed within the timelines specified in FIFRA Section 3(h) and are not
  subject to registration service fees. (d) Registrant initiated amendments submitted by notification under PR
  Notices, such as PR Notice 98-10, continue under PR Notice timelines and are not subject to registration
  service fees. (e) Submissions with data and requiring data review are subject to registration service fees.
(5) Amendment applications to add the new use(s) to registered product labels are covered by the base fee for
  the new use(s). All items in the covered application must be submitted together in one package. Each
  application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new
  use application package is subject to the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval.
  However, if a new use application only proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no
  amendments in the application, then review of one new product application is covered by the new use fee. All
  such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the new use decision review time.
  Any application for a new product or an amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to
  submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its decision review time and (c)
  containing the same new uses, will be deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a separate
  registration service fee and new decision review time for a new use. If the new-use application includes non-
  food (indoor and/or outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is due for each type
  of new use and the longest decision review time applies to all of the new uses requested in the application.
  Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the
  applicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application after completion of the technical
  deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full
  registration service fee for the new use application.
(6) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-

  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.

(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) New PIP = a PIP with an active ingredient that has not been registered.
(3) Registered PIP = a PIP with an active ingredient that is currently registered.
(4) Transfer registered PIP through conventional breeding for new food/feed use, such as from field corn to
  sweet corn.
(5) The scientific data involved in this category are complex. EPA often seeks technical advice from the
  Scientific Advisory Panel on risks that pesticides pose to wildlife, farm workers, pesticide applicators, non-
  target species, as well as insect resistance, and novel scientific issues surrounding new technologies. The
  scientists of the SAP neither make nor recommend policy decisions. They provide advice on the science used to
  make these decisions. Their advice is invaluable to the EPA as it strives to protect humans and the
  environment from risks posed by pesticides. Due to the time it takes to schedule and prepare for meetings with
  the SAP, additional time and costs are needed.
(6) Registered PIPs stacked through conventional breeding.
(7) Deployment of a registered PIP with a different IRM plan (e.g., seed blend).
(8) The negotiated acreage cap will depend upon EPA's determination of the potential environmental exposure,
  risk(s) to non-target organisms, and the risk of targeted pest developing resistance to the pesticidal
  substance. The uncertainty of these risks may reduce the allowable acreage, based upon the quantity and type
  of non-target organism data submitted and the lack of insect resistance management data, which is usually not
  required for seed-increase registrations. Registrants are encouraged to consult with EPA prior to submission
  of a registration application in this category.
(9) Application can be submitted prior to or concurrently with an application for commercial registration.
(10) For example, IRM plan modifications that are applicant-initiated.
(11) EPA-initiated amendments shall not be charged fees.
(12) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.

(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) If another covered application is submitted that depends upon an application to approve an inert ingredient,
  each application will be subject to its respective registration service fee. The decision review time line for
  both submissions will be the longest of the associated applications. If the application covers multiple
  ingredients grouped by EPA into one chemical class, a single registration service fee will be assessed for
  approval of those ingredients.
(3) If EPA data rules are amended to newly require clearance under section 408 of the FFDCA for an ingredient of
  an antimicrobial product where such ingredient was not previously subject to such a clearance, then review of
  the data for such clearance of such product is not subject to a registration service fee for the tolerance
  action for two years from the effective date of the rule.
(4) Any other covered application that is associated with and dependent on the HSRB review will be subject to
  its separate registration service fee. The decision review times for the associated actions run concurrently,
  but will end at the date of the latest review time.
(5) Any other covered application that is associated with and dependent on the SAP review will be subject to its
  separate registration service fee. The decision review time for the associated action will be extended by the
  decision review time for the SAP review.
(6) An application for a new end-use product using a source of active ingredient that (a) is not yet registered
  but (b) has an application pending with the Agency for review, will be considered an application for a new
  product with an unregistered source of active ingredient.
(7) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.
(8) If a new safener is submitted in the same package as a new active ingredient, and that new active ingredient
  is determined to be reduced risk, then the safener would get the same reduced timeframe as the new active
  ingredient.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from

  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.


                             General Leave

  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Illinois?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, and the gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta), my 
good friend and colleague, I rise in strong support as the author of 
H.R. 1029, the Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act of 2017, also 
known as PRIA. It is not every day in Washington that we see a 
bipartisan bill come to the House floor that is supported by both 
industry and industry advocates, but PRIA is that bill, Madam Speaker.
  PRIA initially passed in 2003, establishing a new section of the 
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, or FIFRA, which 
put in place a fee schedule for registering pesticides with the EPA. 
More specifically, PRIA constructed time frames for when the EPA was 
required to make a determination on pesticide registrations. The goal 
of PRIA was to create a more predictable and effective evaluation 
process for pesticide decisionmaking by coupling the collection of fees 
with specific decision review periods. It also promoted shorter 
decision review periods for reduced-risk pesticides.
  The nature of PRIA is very technical, but the widespread benefits 
across industries has gained it consistent bipartisan support. PRIA is 
backed by a broad coalition comprised of the companies that rely on the 
registration process and also labor and environmental advocates. Each 
member of this broad coalition had a seat at the table when the 
Committee on Agriculture held a roundtable discussing the merits of the 
bill last month before it passed unanimously out of our House Committee 
on Agriculture.
  This reauthorization bill that we are considering also provides a few 
modifications, including reasonable increases in registration fees, 
funding for good laboratory practices, and added efforts to promote 
transparency. Although it has generally been a 5-year authorization, 
this bill would extend PRIA for 7 years. A lengthened reauthorization, 
we believe, is appropriate because PRIA has been proven effective, it 
has enjoyed widespread, bipartisan support, and to date each 
reauthorization has only involved minor adjustments.
  PRIA expires on September 30 of this year, and I am glad to be 
presenting this bill well in advance of that expiration date because we 
need to provide folks with the certainty they need to conduct their 
business, educate farmworkers, and keep the communication with EPA open 
and transparent. This is the fourth time PRIA has come before Congress 
for reauthorization, and that is because it is working for everyone. It 
has always been a bipartisan effort, and we hope to continue that 
tradition. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this 
commonsense reauthorization.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                                         House of Representatives,


                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,

                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 2017.
     Hon. K. Michael Conaway,
     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Conaway: I write in regard to H.R. 1029, 
     Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act of 2017, which was 
     referred in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
     I wanted to notify you that the Committee will forgo action 
     on the bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House 
     floor for consideration.
       The Committee on Energy and Commerce takes this action with 
     our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of 
     H.R. 1029, the Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over 
     the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation 
     and will be appropriately consulted and involved as this or 
     similar legislation moves forward to address any remaining 
     issues within the Committee's jurisdiction. The Committee 
     also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate 
     number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving 
     this or similar legislation and asks that you support any 
     such request.
       I would appreciate your response confirming this

                                         House of Representatives,


                                     Committee on Agriculture,

                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 2017.
     Greg Walden,
     Committee on Energy and Commerce,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Walden: Thank you for your letter regarding 
     H.R. 1029, the ``Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act of 
     2017.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this 
     legislation before the House of Representatives, and 
     accordingly, understand that the Committee on Energy and 
     Commerce will forego action on the bill.
       The Committee on Agriculture concurs in the mutual 
     understanding that by foregoing consideration of the bill at 
     this time, the Committee on Energy and Commerce does not 
     waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in 
     this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, 
     should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would 
     support your request to have the Committee on Energy and 
     Commerce represented on the conference committee.

       I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional 
     Record during Floor consideration. I appreciate your 
     cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to 
     continuing to work the Committee on Energy and Commerce as 
     this bill moves through the legislative process.
           Sincerely,
                                               K. Michael Conaway,
                                                         Chairman.

  Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. I rise in support of H.R. 1029, the Pesticide Registration 
Enhancement Act of 2017.
  Once again, Madam Speaker, I stand before you to urge the passage of 
H.R. 1029. As we know, the Environmental Protection Agency is 
responsible for regulating the sale, use, and distribution of 
pesticides. To facilitate and expedite that pesticide approval process, 
pesticide manufacturers have long supplemented the EPA's annual budget. 
This system allows the products to be reviewed in a timely manner, 
without sacrificing environmental and safety protections. It is truly a 
win-win for both manufacturers and consumers, and, as you heard Mr. 
Davis speak about, it is a clear example of government at its best. It 
is exactly why I enjoy working on the Committee on Agriculture. It is 
exactly why I enjoy working with people such as Rodney Davis. We have a 
bipartisan, effective, public-private legislative solution for a more 
predictable pesticide evaluation process that literally helps 
everybody.
  The Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act, H.R. 1029, is an 
exceptional piece of legislation not only because it is supported by a 
unique coalition of pesticide registrants, environmental groups, and 
agricultural labor representatives, but H.R. 1029 provides a more 
effective, predictable, and transparent pesticide evaluation process. 
It promotes shorter review periods for reduced-risk pesticides and 
enhances scientific and regulatory activities related to farmworker 
protection.
  My district on the central coast of California is not only bountiful 
in its agriculture, it is absolutely beautiful with its environment. 
Therefore, we on the central coast work hard to find that balance of 
being known as the salad bowl of the world and one of the most scenic 
places in the world. That is why our agriculture producers are the most 
thoughtful stewards of the land and recognize the need to protect the 
environment and the natural resources.
  This legislation facilitates that balance. This legislation provides 
a unique coalition building and encourages the agriculture industry to 
work with environmentalists. Thus, H.R. 1029 helps all of us who live 
and work in our community and, ultimately, our country. That is why I 
am absolutely honored to speak in this debate, humbled to share the 
floor with Representative Davis, and why I urge all my colleagues to 
support this bill.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the 
balance of my time.
  Madam Speaker, this is exactly why we are here today in a bipartisan 
way. The gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta) said it right: this 
affects his industry, and it affects his home area. As he likes to say, 
it is the salad bowl of America. I have been there, and I have seen the 
crops they grow. The crops I grow are much different in central 
Illinois, the crops that are grown by the farmers that I am proud to 
represent, but they all have to have a successful PRIA reauthorization 
to be able to grow those foods that we here in America continue to feed 
the world with and that we see in our grocery stores and on our 
supermarket shelves.
  Madam Speaker, I want to say thank you because this bill is 
essential, as we in central Illinois go out and take care of things 
such as making sure the weeds don't pop up in our yards. Every single 
small business that decides to put down product and pesticides to 
ensure that lawns in central Illinois continue to prosper as the spring 
and summer unfold, this is essential to their success.
  This is essential to our farmers, who are looking to get their fields 
ready to go plant, the stewards of the land, the best stewards of the 
land, as Congressman Panetta said. It assures them that they are going 
to be able to get that seed into the ground and, with the hope and 
prayers of rain and moisture, that it is going to grow and that we are 
still going to have a marketplace for those products.
  The risk that our farmers take every single year, when they risk and 
leverage their family incomes in many cases, in hopes that a seed is 
going to grow and a plant is going to grow, and they are going to be 
able to sell that, they need the certainty that this bill will actually 
give them. That is why I am proud to be here as the author, proud to 
stand with my colleagues.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1029, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
