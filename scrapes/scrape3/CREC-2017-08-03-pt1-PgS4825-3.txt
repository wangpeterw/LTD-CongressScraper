          150TH ANNIVERSARY OF NEW LIGHT BEULAH BAPTIST CHURCH

 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and 
honor New Light Beulah Baptist Church in Hopkins, SC, for their 150th 
anniversary, which will be celebrated on August 11 to 13, 2017.
  New Light Beulah Baptist Church was established in 1867 when 665 
African-American members of Beulah Baptist Church chose to separate 
from the White members and began independent rule. Despite the 
sanctuary burning to the ground in 1916, the church thrived and 
expanded. Since then, several other churches have been formed out of 
New Light Beulah Baptist. In 2015, the members accepted Dr. Malcolm 
Taylor as their pastor, and over 360 members call New Light Beulah 
their place of worship today.
  In August 2017, New Light Beulah Baptist Church will be the first 
African-American church in the lower Richland community to be 
registered in the National Register of Historic Places. The church has 
remained committed to its mission, and I encourage all South 
Carolinians to recognize the rich history of the church and its 
contribution to the Palmetto State. I acknowledge and celebrate the 
church's 150 years of independence as a congregation faithfully serving 
their community.
