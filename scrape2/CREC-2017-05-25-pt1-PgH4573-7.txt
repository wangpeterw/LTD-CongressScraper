                        BUDGET CUTS TO EDUCATION

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
budget released by President Trump. It is cruel and shortsighted in the 
extreme: cutting essential investments driving job creation, protecting 
our environment, funding breakthrough cures, and providing a safety net 
for the neediest among us.
  Among the most objectionable are the President's cuts to education. 
Funds used for college work-study programs, loan forgiveness for those 
who enter public service, and dollars used by schools for mental health 
will not just be cut but be eliminated. For example, 21st century 
community learning centers, which offer learning opportunities during 
nonschool hours for those from our neediest communities, would be 
completely eliminated.
  We know these programs work. An evaluation showed program 
participation improved math and English grades by 30 to 40 percent. In 
my district, Waukegan Community School District Number 60 uses these 
funds to offer an extended day program at seven schools to increase 
academic achievement and build life skills.
  Mr. Speaker, this budget irresponsibly mortgages our future by 
shortchanging our children. I urge my colleagues to reject this budget. 
Let's work together to chart a path that ensures our Nation's 
prosperity.
