CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL MISSOURI'S WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM

  (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 
University of Central Missouri's women's soccer team on winning the 
NCAA Division II national championship. This is the Jennies first NCAA 
women's soccer national championship in program history.
  The Jennies completed the season with a perfect record of 26 and 0, 
making them only the third women's Division II national champion to 
finish a

season with a perfect record. The team's 26 wins set a new single-
season NCAA Division II women's record.
  In addition to winning the national championship, the Jennies had 
five athletes join the Division II Conference Commissioners Association 
All-American teams.
  The team's outstanding accomplishments mark a great milestone for the 
University of Central Missouri's athletics department and its head 
coach of 11 years, Lewis Theobald.
  Please join me in congratulating the Central Missouri Jennies on this 
momentous achievement.
