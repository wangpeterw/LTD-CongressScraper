                        STAND WITH THE DREAMERS

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say to DREAMers, their 
parents, and TPS holders from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and 
Honduras: I stand with you.
  To date, over 15,000 young people have lost DACA due to congressional 
inaction, and the lives of over 800,000 young people are being used as 
a bargaining chip.
  For what? A wall?
  So stop playing with the people's lives. Enough is enough. Let's pass 
the Dream Act now.
