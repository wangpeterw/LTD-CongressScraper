                     REJECT THE NEW HEALTHCARE BILL

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, word coming out of the White 
House and House Republicans is that there is a new healthcare bill, and 
this bill would obliterate the patient protections for preexisting 
conditions and eviscerate essential benefits and cost controls.
  Under the new healthcare scam, insurance companies could opt out of 
all consumer protections. In other words, insurance companies could 
write fake policies with big premiums and little or no coverage.
  Mr. Speaker, under this plan, a parent of a kid who is struck with 
childhood cancer could still buy a policy, but the policy is worthless 
because the policy would not have to cover their children's cancer 
treatment.
  This is how House Republicans and the insurance lobby plan to get out 
from under their obligation to cover preexisting conditions.
  This means more power for the insurance companies and less protection 
for good people, the American people, who play by the rules. This plan 
should be rejected again. It is deceitful, cold, cruel, and wrong.
