         TAX REFORM ISN'T ABOUT PERCENTAGES, IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, when we 
talk about the Tax Code, it is easy to get bogged down in numbers. But 
tax reform isn't about percentages, it is about people.
  It is about small-business owners like Sean Register, in Georgia's 
First Congressional District, who wants to grow his business that has 
been his passion for much of his life.
  Mr. Register is the sole owner of Register International, a shipping 
business in Bryan County, Georgia: a type of business very important to 
the Coastal Empire's economy.
  Mr. Register worked hard to guide his business through the 2008 
financial crisis, but, in the economic downturn, was forced to lay off 
employees, leaving himself as the only one remaining. Now, he would 
like to hire employees but needs a little push to be able to afford the 
extra help.
  With our tax reform plan, Mr. Register will have the ability to grow 
his business and provide much-needed jobs to citizens in the First 
District.
  Tax reform has many faces, more than 300 million, and every single 
one of them inspires our work in Congress as progrowth tax reform. We 
will get this done for them.
