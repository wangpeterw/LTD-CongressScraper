           RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SPILLWAY AT THE OROVILLE DAM

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, after the near disaster we had in Butte 
County, near Oroville, with the breakage of the spillway at Oroville 
Dam, I am very happy to congratulate the folks of Kiewit Construction, 
and so many others, on their reconstruction of the spillway, phase 1. 
We will have a working, viable spillway for this upcoming rainy season, 
if needed, due to the intense and incredible efforts to rebuild that 
project.
  If you had seen the size of, basically, the canyon that was carved 
out where the old spillway stood from having to release water to keep 
the lake level, in February, at a safe level, you would see how amazing 
it was, the work that was done in order to rebuild that spillway in its 
current phase. It will be able to handle 100,000 CFS and be able to 
keep the lake stable for the upcoming year.
  However, we do need to have balance in the process and have that lake 
be able to store enough water for California's needs this coming year, 
because we will still have those needs in 2018, and not drain the lake 
all the way because of an overcautious thought process.
  So congratulations on a viable lake that works for all.
