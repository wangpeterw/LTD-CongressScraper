               RECOGNIZING THE DEBBIE'S DREAM FOUNDATION

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight the Debbie's 
Dream Foundation, an organization in south Florida that seeks to make 
the cure for stomach cancer a reality while also supporting patients, 
families, and caregivers who are impacted by this disease.
  According to the NIH, Mr. Speaker, there are nearly 100,000 people 
living with stomach cancer in our great Nation, but despite these 
alarming numbers, Americans diagnosed with stomach cancer face a 
challenging battle, as it is difficult to find reliable information, 
good treatments, and valuable resources. Here is where Debbie's Dream 
Foundation steps in.
  Debbie's Dream Foundation works with local communities, businesses, 
government agencies, and the scientific community to raise awareness 
about stomach cancer and promote research and cutting-edge treatment to 
improve the lives of those afflicted with this cancer.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Debbie Zelman, the founder of this 
great organization, who is also undergoing treatment for this disease, 
for turning this tragedy into a positive change for others suffering 
from stomach cancer.
  I also want to thank very much Debbie's wonderful parents and all of 
the advocates for their lifesaving efforts and unwavering commitment to 
defeat stomach cancer once and for all.
