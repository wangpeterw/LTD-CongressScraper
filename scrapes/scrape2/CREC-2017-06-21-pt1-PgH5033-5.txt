             HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE FAILING TO DO THEIR JOBS

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, perhaps it is not surprising that the House 
Republicans haven't put forward a budget, despite passing their 
deadline more than 2 months ago.
  It has been nearly 800 days since the House Republicans agreed to a 
budget. Hat-tip to the Huffington Post's Matt Fuller for that fun fact.
  What we are seeing is an ongoing inability of House Republicans to do 
their job. Republicans have introduced no jobs bill, given no 
indication whether they will lift the debt ceiling to avoid default, 
and offered no responsible spending legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, this is dysfunction at its worst. The American people 
sent us here to deliver results on jobs, on healthcare, on security.
  I urge my Republican colleagues to take that responsibility seriously 
and to work with Democrats to achieve progress. I know we can.
