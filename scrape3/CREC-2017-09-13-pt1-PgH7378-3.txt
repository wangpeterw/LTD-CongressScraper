              REMEMBERING WAYZATA OFFICER WILLIAM MATHEWS

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, Minnesota and the entire Wayzata community 
are grieving after the death of Police Officer William Mathews this 
past Friday. He was responding to a 911 call to collect hazardous 
debris along the highway when he was tragically struck by a car and 
killed.
  Officer Mathews was well-known for his service in the Wayzata and the 
Long Lake community where children often would come out to greet him as 
he drove through their neighborhood to say hello while he was on 
patrol. He served on police forces throughout the State of Minnesota 
for two decades in various capacities and was a 9-year veteran of the 
Wayzata police force. He had been a firearms instructor, a field 
training officer, and a reserve coordinator, and was in every way a 
true public servant.
  But as dedicated a police officer as Officer Mathews was, he was an 
even more devoted husband and father. We mourn with his wife, Shawn, 
and 7-year-old son, Wyatt.
  Mr. Speaker, our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line 
every single day in more ways than we can imagine to keep us safe. 
Officer Mathews lost his life in service to his community, and he will 
not be forgotten.
