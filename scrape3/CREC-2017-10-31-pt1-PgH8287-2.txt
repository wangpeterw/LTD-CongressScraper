             HONORING THE LIFE OF SENATOR ARNETT GIRARDEAU

  (Mr. LAWSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and 
legacy of former Florida Senator Dr. Arnett Girardeau, who passed away 
last Thursday.
  Senator Girardeau represented Jacksonville in the Florida 
Legislature. He was among the first African Americans to serve in the 
Florida Senate, and the first African American to serve as a senate 
president pro tempore.
  During the 16 years that he served in the Florida Legislature, he 
provided principled leadership and service to our State, to our 
country, and he served as a role model of excellence to many of us who 
would follow in his footsteps.
  As a young legislator, Senator Girardeau helped to mentor me and many 
of my other colleagues in north Florida. He was a founding member and 
chairman of the Florida Conference of Black State Legislators.
  We extend our condolences to not only his wife, Carolyn, but 
especially to his family. He truly was an outstanding leader and a 
trailblazer in the State of Florida.
