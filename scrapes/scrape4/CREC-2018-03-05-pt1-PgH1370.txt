                        HONORING PASTOR ED SEARS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 30 minutes.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Grace Baptist Church, in Winston-
Salem, North Carolina, paid tribute to its pastor of the past 37 years, 
Ed Sears, and his wife, Linda. Pastor Sears is transitioning out of his 
role as senior pastor, and the members of the church, along with people 
from across the State, met to acknowledge the leadership and 
inspiration provided by Pastor Sears.
  Pastor Sears is known as a servant of God who is held in high esteem 
by all who know him and his reputation. He is a person who made those 
around him feel loved. There is general agreement that the love that he 
shows others is a result of his commitment to and his relationship with 
Jesus Christ.
  He has made a difference in the lives of thousands of others to whom 
he ministered whenever they were in need. He has been totally committed 
to his ministry and been a true role model for us all.
  As he retires from a full-time ministry to face health challenges, we 
wish him well. We know that he will deal with these challenges in the 
same way he has lived his life thus far, with honor, integrity, 
strength, and faith that will inspire others.
  May God continue to bless you, Pastor Sears.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
