        HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN CAMBODIA

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House

[[Page H1224]]

for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, last week, Congressman Steve Chabot and 
I, as the co-chairs of the Cambodia Caucus, called upon Secretary 
Tillerson and the administration to prioritize human rights, democracy, 
and the rule of law in Cambodia.
  Just days later, Sam Rainsy, the leader of the opposition party in 
Cambodia, resigned in the face of a proposed bill that would dissolve 
the opposition party if he continued to lead the party.
  This law on political parties would give the government far-reaching 
powers to suspend political parties at will. I urge the Cambodian 
National Assembly to set aside this undemocratic law that dangerously 
moves Cambodia toward being a one-party state, and to allow the 
Cambodian people to freely choose their own leaders.
