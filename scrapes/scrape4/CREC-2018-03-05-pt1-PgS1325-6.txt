                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, we will vote on the 
nominations of three more talented individuals today whom the President 
has asked to serve as Federal district judges: Karen Scholer for the 
Northern District of Texas, Tilman Self for the Middle District of 
Georgia, and Terry Doughty for the Western District of Louisiana. These 
are three excellent nominees, and I encourage all of our colleagues to 
vote in support of each of them.
