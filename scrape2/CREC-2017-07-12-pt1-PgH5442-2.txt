                    HOUSE COMBATS HUMAN TRAFFICKING

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today the House of 
Representatives will consider three critical bills that will continue 
efforts to reduce and eliminate human trafficking and implement a 
stronger detection system for American families.
  I appreciate the leadership of Congressman Chris Smith, Congressman 
Tim Walberg, and Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler for their work to build a 
more effective system to apprehend traffickers.
  As we take steps at the national level to prevent trafficking, equip 
local officials, and support vulnerable communities, I am grateful that 
the South Carolina Human Trafficking Task Force led by State Attorney 
General Alan Wilson has been a pioneer in statewide efforts to combat 
human trafficking. Under his leadership, South Carolina has one of the 
strongest human trafficking laws in the country and has successfully 
worked for prosecution, protection, prevention, and partnership.
  I am encouraged by South Carolina's commitment to protecting the 
dignity, freedom, and human rights of all citizens, and I hope their 
success can build a model for other States.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
