    CONGRATULATIONS TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE ADVOCATE JEANNIE CASTELLS

  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the tireless 
dedication of one of New Jersey's greatest Alzheimer's awareness 
advocates, Jeannie Castells of Lambertville, Hunterdon County.
  Jeannie has served as a congressional ambassador for the Alzheimer's 
Association since 2014, meeting with Members of Congress here on 
Capitol Hill, holding educational events in which I have participated 
in Congressional District Seven, and organizing fundraisers like the 
Walk to End Alzheimer's.
  Unfortunately, Jeannie's advocacy does not come without tragedy 
because the disease has claimed the lives of both her mother and her 
husband.
  And Jeannie's family is not alone, Mr. Speaker. Alzheimer's is the 
Nation's sixth leading cause of death. More than 5 million Americans 
are currently living with Alzheimer's, and as many as 16 million 
Americans are estimated to have Alzheimer's by 2050.
  That is why in June, Alzheimer's Awareness Month, I urge advocates 
around the country, like Jeannie, to continue to fight for Alzheimer's 
research funding. We are on the verge of a breakthrough, and with your 
help, we will certainly find one.
