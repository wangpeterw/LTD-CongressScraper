                TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S TIES WITH RUSSIA

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to continue the call for an 
independent commission to investigate the President's ties with Russia.
  Congress has the responsibility to ensure we investigate these 
matters appropriately. We must provide the American people with 
answers, transparency, and accountability. We know that there are 
issues with the House Intelligence Committee on the Republican side, so 
it is time that we ask for an independent commission to take the lead.
  Let's be honest, at the end of the day, you are the company you keep. 
So far, President Trump's team has included a national security adviser 
who was paid by Russian companies to appear at Russian events, a former 
campaign manager who had a multimillion-dollar contract to advance 
Putin's agenda, and now we have the issues again with the Republican 
side of the Intelligence Committee to cover up tracks left by the Trump 
administration.
  As we further untangle the web created by Trump and his team, it is 
clear that some Republicans are fearful of what potential 
investigations may reveal. The American people deserve answers.
