                         TRIBUTE TO ORRIN HATCH

  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, on one final matter, Mr. President, yesterday a 
very distinguished Senator announced his intention to retire at the end 
of this Congress. For more than 40 years, Senator Orrin Hatch has 
served the people of Utah in this body. He is not only our President 
pro tempore, but, as we celebrated last year, Senator Hatch is also the 
longest serving Republican Senator in the history of the United States.
  During this historic tenure, Senator Hatch has chaired three key 
committees. He has amassed deep expertise across all manner of policy 
issues, and he has built a truly remarkable resume of accomplishments 
on behalf of the American people.
  Senator Hatch has defended our national security and our religious 
freedom. He has fought to protect Americans with disabilities and to 
shepherd fine judges onto our courts. Just last month, as Senate 
Finance Committee chairman, he played an integral role in passing the 
most significant tax reform law in more than 30 years.
  Senator Hatch's colleagues here will be sorry to see him retire. I 
will miss his friendship, but I know his wife Elaine and his beloved 
family will be glad to welcome him home.
  Fortunately, it is not yet time to say farewell. This institution and 
the American people will benefit greatly from the Senator's wisdom and 
famous work ethic for one more year before his retirement.
