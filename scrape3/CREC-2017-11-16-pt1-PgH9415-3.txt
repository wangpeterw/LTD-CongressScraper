                 TAX BREAK FOR THE WEALTHIEST AMONG US

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, what happened today on this floor was a 
massive tax break for the wealthiest people in our country.
  Over half of the tax dollars will go to people in the upper 1 percent 
of the income strata. The big pot of gold at the end is eliminating the 
inheritance tax by the year 2024, so that the heirs of the richest will 
get millions and hundreds of millions and billions in tax relief.
  This bill should have been geared toward the middle class. The middle 
class is getting tip change from a cheap restaurant, while the 
millionaires and billionaires are getting away with no AMT tax, changed 
rates at the top, and inheritance tax changes.
  They get the money. The middle class gets shafted. It is a con job. 
It is a shame.
