                      PAYING TRIBUTE TO TIM FRABLE

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, America lost a hero this week, and I lost 
a friend.
  Tim Frable trained at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana and flew 
missions in a P-51 over Japan during World War II. During one mission, 
he had to ditch into the Pacific. He and a wing mate floated for days 
before being rescued.
  Tim was my science teacher in junior high school. He told his ocean 
rescue story in 5-minute installments at the end of class each day. 
Because of his storytelling, no one missed class.
  Tim loved Montana. In 1976, he brought me and 17 other classmates 
from Pennsylvania to Red Lodge to

hike into the back country. We hiked to Black Canyon Lake, Grasshopper 
Glacier, Froze-to-Death Plateau, and onto the Absaroka Lake Plateau.
  Tim had a tremendous impact on many lives in his 93 years, including 
my own. I will always be grateful for his service to our country and 
for his dedication as a teacher. I will miss my friend Tim Frable.
