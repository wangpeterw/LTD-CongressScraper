                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Lord our God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  The prophet Isaiah warns us: O Lord, unless we acknowledge You as 
Lord with living faith and lasting reverence, we go adrift.
  You have raised us and reared us. Our pets know their owners, our 
appetites know where to be fed, yet there are times when we do not know 
where to turn unless we truly belong to You.
  As Your people, should we hear You call us: `` . . . a sinful nation, 
a people laden with wickedness, an evil race, corrupt children,'' 
should we run away from You? Or toward You?
  In those times, is it You we fear and cannot face? Or is it the truth 
about ourselves? Strengthen us that we may be drawn into the truth by 
You, now and always.
  May all we do in the people's House be for Your greater honor and 
glory.
  Amen.
