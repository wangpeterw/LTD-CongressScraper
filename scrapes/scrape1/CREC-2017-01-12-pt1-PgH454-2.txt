            REPEALING ACA WITHOUT A REPLACEMENT IS DANGEROUS

  (Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise because I offered an 
amendment to the budget resolution bill that is going to be upfor a 
vote tomorrow. The amendment that I offered was a statement of policy 
that repealing the Affordable Care Act without areplacement is 
dangerous and irresponsible. This is a bipartisan sentiment.
  Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, stated: ``I have 
great concerns that we inject a level of greatuncertainty into an 
already uncertain environment if we don't give people a clear 
indication as to what will come once werepeal.''
  I don't support a repeal, but people in my district cannot afford to 
go without health care in the 44th CongressionalDistrict.
  I urge my colleagues to think about this, to think and to listen to 
their Republican colleagues. We need to see areplacement plan.
