        HELP IS ON THE WAY TO PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I sit as the chairman of the Subcommittee 
on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs that deals directly with 
the jurisdiction of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and other territories 
of the U.S.
  We had a very good briefing this week led by Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon 
from Puerto Rico, as well as Stacey Plaskett of the Virgin Islands. It 
was very important information. As we all know of the difficult 
situation, especially we are seeing so much in Puerto Rico as well as 
the Virgin Islands; President Trump visiting Puerto Rico this week.
  Help is on the way. Indeed, it has been on the way, and we need to 
just keep pushing to rebuild that infrastructure and push out into the 
islands where the need is still felt.
  So we know, we see, we are aware, and we will keep working to achieve 
positive results in the short term as well, as we look at the situation 
with Puerto Rico and the difficulty with PREPA, the power company, and 
other

issues that we will address as a committee in order to have a long-
term, positive solution for the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico and what 
they need.
