                         AMERICA CAN DO BETTER

  (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, this is the Republican bill: a trillion 
dollars in lost health care for millions; at the same time, a trillion 
dollars in tax breaks, mostly for the very wealthy and corporations.
  The Republican majority says their bill is to provide patient-
centered health care, but for patients there is no healthcare center 
when there is no insurance.
  The Republican bill robs millions of needed insurance for their 
health and, in many cases, would rob them of their life.
  The Republican plan would create death panels for numerous unknown 
Americans.
  This is not our America. America can do better. We must.
