                            CLASSIFIED MEMO

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the House 
Intelligence Committee for voting to release the classified memo 
alleging misconduct by senior FBI officials involved in the Russian 
probe. Chairman Nunes has done a great job of steering this through 
evenhandedly, with dignity, and with the ultimate goal of fairness in 
mind.
  I also thank the President for approving the release of the memo, as 
well.
  The contents of this document are troubling. I previously joined many 
of my colleagues in urging the committee to release this memo to the 
public, as they have demanded.
  This is not an attempt to undermine anything. This document outlines 
some very serious misconduct at a very high level at a powerful 
government agency, and the American people have the right to know.
  Contrary to the narrative created before its release, this memo in no 
way jeopardizes our national security but, indeed, shines a light on a 
lot of misconduct.
  As promised, the committee today approved releasing the Democratic 
version of the memo. That is fair. We will let the people compare them.
