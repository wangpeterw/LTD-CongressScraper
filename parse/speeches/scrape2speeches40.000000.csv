14265,topic-id,1089,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to help deliver a message from American families to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. The American people have sent a clear message to The message is that they do not want us to go forward with this partisan--and mean--healthcare repeal bill. But, incredibly, we are today about to embark on a vote to do the exact opposite.  What is happening in Washington this week is that we are completely ignoring the message that Wisconsinites and the hard-working American families across this country have sent for us to hear. Haven't you been listening?  To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, have you been listening to the calls pouring in from families in your States? Have you been listening to the voices of parents and their children, the schoolteachers and doctors, and the working people who are daily struggling to get ahead? These messages have been sent to They have been sent loudly and for too many months--in fact, for too many months for you to possibly not have heard them. The American people don't want to pay more for less care. They don't want the age tax or the higher premiums this plan is offering. People with preexisting conditions don't want to be thrown into a high-risk pool or priced out of the coverage they have today. They don't want bare-bones insurance that doesn't cover the essential services and lifesaving care they may need. They don't want their loved ones who depend on Medicare for nursing home care or their disabled children who rely on Medicaid funding at school to have their care put at risk through caps and cuts. The American people don't want a plan that will make things worse.  It is hard for me to believe that Washington hasn't heard this message because I have been listening.  I have been listening to people like Jean is from Baraboo, She told me that she is scared because her Crohn's disease would cost her a fortune if her preexisting conditions were not covered. She told me that she needs the healthcare she has today because ``my husband ruptured a disk in his back that prevented him from getting a job that promised us coverage. So now he works multiple jobs.''  I have been listening to Mary from Kenosha, I met with Mary recently, and she told me about her son Kyle, at a young age, was diagnosed on the autism spectrum and was never expected to learn to even speak. When Kyle was 7, medical professionals spoke with Mary and said that Kyle might have to be removed from his home and left to be cared for in an institution. But Mary had hope, and thanks to Medicaid, Kyle was able to receive some very specialized medical therapy for his autism, and he was able to remain at home. He was able to receive an education. He was able to get his driver's license, and now Kyle is attending college.  Mary is terrified, nonetheless, that this bill's drastic cuts to Medicaid would rob Kyle of the care he needs to achieve the independence that he has worked so hard for during his entire life. Mary told me about her concern for so many other families with similar situations.  I have been listening to Greg is from Stoddard, He has no idea how he and other older Wisconsinites will be able to afford higher costs for healthcare. Greg's sons, both of whom have diabetes, are already struggling with skyrocketing insulin prices.  I have been listening to the Schaumberg family in Seymour, Their daughter Zoe was born with a congenital heart defect. She had to have open heart surgery at 5 days of age. Now, Zoe is guaranteed coverage without being denied or charged more, but Zoe's parents are scared that this repeal plan will make things worse. When Zoe's mom, Chelsey Schaumberg, was told about how this plan would weaken the guaranteed protections and care that people have today, she said[[Page S4155]]this in her letter to me: ``To me, it's like they're taking the American Dream from her . . . kids in Wisconsin with preexisting conditions . . . are counting on you to protect that right.''  This isn't right. This isn't fair. It is not who we are.  If my colleagues who have been drafting this plan behind closed doors have not been listening to the messages of fear and anxiety from the American people, maybe they will listen to why this proposal is very personal to me.  When I was 9 years old, I got sick. I got really sick. I was in the hospital for 3 months. Following getting out of the hospital, I required significant followup care for nearly a year before I regained my full strength and fully recovered.  But when it came to health insurance, it was like I had a scarlet letter. My grandparents, who raised me, couldn't find a policy that would cover me, not from any insurer and not at any price. They had to pay for my care out of pocket, and I can tell you they made some major sacrifices to do so, all because I was a child who had been branded with those terrifying words ``preexisting condition.''  So what are we doing here? It is time to stop the partisan nonsense. The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take away people's healthcare. They sent me to fight for people like Zoe, Kyle, and What I hear from people in Wisconsin is that they want us working together to protect the care people have and to make it more affordable.  We should be working together to lower costs like skyrocketing prescription drug prices. We should be working together to strengthen the insurance market and give people more options. But we should not be working on partisan repeal legislation that will make things worse, that will leave millions uninsured, that will make healthcare more expensive, and that will price families out of the care they have today.  It is time we listened to the messages that are being sent to It is time we worked together across the partisan aisle to do our jobs--the jobs the American people sent us here to do on their behalf.  I hope the congressional majority will join me and my colleagues to work together to strengthen healthcare and to move our country forward.  I thank the body.  I yield the floor.

14256,topic-id,1279,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for being here. We have been out here many a night, talking about the importance of I so appreciate his leadership in the Senate on this very important issue. He has been a champion of the Children's Health Insurance Program and has been a voice amongst all Senators in making sure that people have access to healthcare. I so appreciate being out here with him tonight.  I don't really appreciate being here right at this moment. I am really flabbergasted. Why are we here at this moment? Why are we here? I am pretty sure that President Trump, when he was candidate Trump, put in a tweet that he would not cut Yet that is the proposal we are talking about.  No matter what the proposal is--repeal, the House bill, the proposal scored by CBO or some Senate alternative on junk insurance--they all are a cut to Medicaid, so I am not sure how we are here. I am not sure how we are here when the Vice President at the time campaigned, I am sure, against the Affordable Care Act and then became Governor of Indiana and implemented Medicaid expansion in his own After saying that he was against the Affordable Care Act, he implemented Medicaid expansion. I am sure people in his home State said: If you want to take care of people, if you want to raise our standard of living, if you want to keep down the costs of healthcare delivery and private insurance, put people on coverage so that they aren't driving up the cost of uncompensated care.  So how are we here? How are we here when our House colleagues came up with a proposal that basically cuts 23 million people off of healthcare--including 15 million people on Medicaid--after working with the President, who said that he didn't want to cut Medicaid, and the Vice President, who basically campaigned against it and then went ahead and expanded it?  I can't believe how many times I have been on the Senate floor, and I haven't seen one of my colleagues come down here and talk about solutions that they are proposing. I just hear them come and talk about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and kicking millions of people off of the healthcare they currently have.  Tonight, I can imagine there are many people across the United States of America who are like me, thinking, how could this be happening? How could we be sitting here tonight, not knowing what the Senate is going to vote on, not knowing whether they are going to repeal their health insurance, not knowing where their Senators stand or even if the Senator knows what proposal they are voting on? Yet I can tell you this: More than 70 percent of the American people think the ideas that have now been put forth by the House and the Senate Republicans and the President do not work. They are not the way to increase access to healthcare and drive down the cost of private insurance in the insurance market.  You don't have to take my word for it. I am looking at a statement by Ohio's Republican Governor, John I worked with John Kasich in the House of He was a budget hawk. He wanted to figure out how to make things work. So I trust that, as Governor, he is a fiscal steward about how to get things done when he says: ``Until Congress can step back from political gamesmanship and come together with a workable, bipartisan plan, it is a mistake for the Senate to proceed with a vote on Tuesday and force a one-sided deal that the American people are clearly against.''  So why are we here? Why are we here when a President promised that he wasn't going to cut Medicaid, a Vice President said that he was against the bill but then went and did Medicaid expansion? The people in the United States responded very clearly that they are not interested in cutting millions of people off of health insurance because they know that, even if it doesn't affect their family, it doesn't make common sense for keeping down the costs of healthcare.  So I ask my colleagues to stop and think about the people in the United States of America who are clearly scared to death about what is going to happen tomorrow. They are scared that someone in their family or that they, the provider for their family, are not going to be able to provide insurance.  If you are so brave, come down here and volunteer, as an amendment, to cut all of us--cut the Senate off of our access to health insurance until we come up with some idea that you think is so terrific. I doubt you will come and propose that. You wouldn't want your family cut off of healthcare.  I meet people like Emily Talbot, who came to visit me from Seattle Children's Hospital, who at age 6 was diagnosed with a condition that affected her brain tissues and spinal canal. She was from Idaho, and she was referred to Seattle Children's because it is the pediatric referral center for our region. Thanks to Medicaid, she saw 11 different pediatric subspecialists and had 13 brain surgeries and 7 back surgeries. Her mom told me that without Medicaid and without the prohibition on lifetime caps, she wouldn't have access to healthcare today.  Is that what my Republican colleagues want to say tomorrow, that ``we don't really know for sure how we are going to do this, we don't really know what works, but even though we said we weren't going to cut Medicaid, we are going to cut people off of health insurance who currently have coverage?''  I think the reason why people like these Governors from Republican States have been willing to speak out against this proposal and raise their concerns is because they have to be a steward of Medicaid, and they have to be fiscally responsible. So they know there are better ways.  When I talk to the regional hospitals in my State, they tell me that covering more people under Medicaid has created downward pressure on price in the individual market. It has helped us.  So our solution cannot be decimating the Medicaid market. Our solution has to look at those in the individual market who don't have as much clout as a big employer or somebody who can buy in bulk and drive down their price. There are ways to address that issue.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on those solutions, but that is not what is being recommended tomorrow. Those solutions haven't been put forth, nor are they part of any of these proposals. So I ask my colleagues to not proceed.  The President promised he was not going to cut Medicaid, and now it is like you want somebody to jump off the cliff tomorrow, and you are saying: Oh, by the way, I will throw you a parachute on the way down. It doesn't work.  As my colleagues have said here tonight, it is time to give certainty to this population that we have a proposal that will help continue to give them access to care. I would say to my colleagues that taking a vote on politics when it is the lives and the healthcare access that so many millions of Americans seek--don't play politics with healthcare. Let's get a solution that works and works on both sides of the aisle.  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.

14255,topic-id,2644,"Mr.President, I rise tonight to speak about the healthcare legislation. I am grateful for the remarks of our colleague from Illinois, the great leader that he is, talking not only about the impact on his home State but on our country.  I think a lot of us, especially in the last couple of weeks, have had an opportunity both to debate healthcare and, probably more importantly, when we go home to be on the road, to go to places where folks are thinking about it very intensively.  Many people I had a chance to interact with and, really, to listen to on the road were folks in small towns and rural areas, especially, who probably didn't ever imagine they would have to engage in this kind of a discussion or debate. Coming into a conference room to have a discussion or a roundtable about healthcare is not what they do every day. They don't necessarily sit around to talk about a public policy issue. They usually have so much in their lives that keeps them busy and so many concerns and so many challenges that are weighing them down that they don't have any opportunity to have these kinds of conversations.  Many of them felt obligated to have these conversations. Many of them were motivated to speak out because of what would happen in their lives and usually in the life of someone in their family.  When I was in a number of counties the last couple of weeks, especially in rural areas, you would hear from a lot of moms and dads about their children, usually in this context: What will the Medicaid cuts mean for my child? In many cases, the child has a disability or more than one. Sometimes there is a series of complex disabilities--plural--and the mom or the dad is there to talk about it.  In these discussions, you hear a combination of sentiments and a combination of information. You hear sometimes a cataloging of what their daily life is like, what they do when they wake up in the morning and have to get that child or that young person ready for school if they have a disability or more than one disability. These parents become experts in all kinds of medical terminology and prescription drugs, and they become experts in assistive technology or equipment that allows their son or daughter to lead as full a life as possible.  For these families, this is real life. This isn't some debate in Washington that we engage in here. This is about real life. That is why the issue of Medicaid, I think, has been so prominent.  If we learned one thing over the last couple of months, it is that some people in Washington might have thought that Medicaid could be described as a ``them'' program. That is for someone else who is far away, and I don't have to worry about that. We found out that Medicaid is an ``us'' program. Medicaid is an American program.  It is one of the ways we come together as a nation and say: You are up against something that I might not be up against. You have a challenge that I might not have, but I am going to do my part to support that program to give you a chance.  If you are a child with a disability, we come together as a community, as a nation, and say we are going to help that child. We are going to do everything possible to make sure that child can lead a full life.  For many folks who are low income--they are working, but they don't have a very high income and don't have employer coverage--we say in that instance: You are someone we should try to help with a program that provides healthcare-- We say to seniors, if we believe, as we do, that you have given us so much--whether you fought our wars or worked in our factories or both, or taught our children, built the Nation, or built the middle class, and did all kinds of things for us--the least we can do is to make sure, if you need extra help getting into a nursing home or getting the benefit of long-term care, Medicaid will be there for you, without a doubt.  It is only until recently that a lot of those same families have had to ask the question: Will that program called Medicaid--that ``us'' program, not a ``them'' program--be there for my child who has a disability? Will that program be there for me and my family, because our income is such that we qualify for Medicaid and we need that help? Will that Medicaid be there for that older citizen who has given us so much, given so much to their family, given so much to the Nation? Will that program continue to be there to give them that little bit of extra help they might need to get into a nursing home?  Unfortunately for a lot of them, it is not a little bit. It is a lot, because they need that much help to have the benefit of long-term care.  I have read a number of letters on the floor over the weeks and months, and I will continue to do that. It is remarkable, though, how people have put their own stories on paper or they have been interviewed by a local newspaper or they have been on local television, or even national television, talking about their lives, talking about their children, talking about their worries, and also giving us the benefit of their hopes and their dreams for their children. They are hopes and dreams that would be thwarted in some instances by a vote we could take here. They are hopes and dreams that in some cases would be absolutely shattered if we took the wrong step on Medicaid and the wrong step on healthcare.  Obviously, I am not a supporter of the legislation before us. It seems like every time there is a change made, the legislation is either no better or a lot worse. The number of uninsured doesn't seem to budge.  The latest Congressional Budget Office determination--this is dated July 20, last It is a letter from the Congressional Budget Office, from[[Page S4143]]Director Keith Hall to Senator Mike Enzi, the chairman of the Senate Budget I am quoting from page 4. The Congressional Budget Office says in this letter:       According to CBO and JCT's estimates, in 2018, 15 million      more people would be uninsured under this legislation than      under current law. The increase in the number of uninsured      people relative to the number under current law would reach      19 million in 2020 and 22 million in 2026.  That is what the CBO tells us. Once again, we have that same number--that stubborn number--22 million people uninsured, and 15 of the 22 becoming uninsured in 2018, next year. It is an immediate impact, the likes of which and the gravity of which we can't even begin to imagine. Imagine that, in the course of 1 year or maybe 1\1/2\ years, 18 million people in the country are losing their healthcare, just when we made the advancement of having 20 million people covered between the time the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed and just in the last year or so.  We have made all that progress forward on coverage. One of the consequences--one of many but one of the consequences of this legislation--would be to wipe all that out. It is two or three steps forward and several steps backward. That alone makes no sense.  As I said, when people come to meetings across the State about this bill, it is remarkable what they will tell you about their own challenges. It has to be very difficult to stand in front of a group of relative strangers--and sometimes with media there--and express to you or express to the people in the room or to the people listening in an interview or otherwise their innermost fears. That has to be disturbing. It must be difficult to do, but they feel compelled to do it because they have never had to worry like this--never had to worry in the course of their lifetimes about a direct threat to the healthcare of their children, a direct threat to the healthcare that their family has.  I have notes here from a meeting just a couple of weeks ago. I will not say who the parents are; I don't have their permission. But I will say this: It was a parent in a county that is considered rural, a family that seems to be relatively secure in terms of their employment and everything else in their lives. After describing what Medicaid means to their family because they have a child with a disability, the mom talked about her own insurance. This is a common theme. The parent or parents have a good job or sometimes two good jobs, and they have insurance in most cases. Yet, because of the severity of the disability of their child, they have to have There is no choice. There is no way with 20 jobs that they could pay for the services that child needs--services, therapies, treatments. The good news is, we live in a country that has those available, but a lot of that will be ripped away if we pass this legislation.  Here is what this mom said when talking about what she is determined to do for her child. She said: It is not negotiable. That is what she said about what is provided to her child. She said that these are necessities. These aren't extra things. These aren't just add-ons to some other healthcare. These are absolute necessities. Then she went through and itemized and cataloged all the ways and all of the tools and benefits that her family receives from Medicaid so that her child, who has a severe disability, might have a shot to lead as full a life as possible.  The idea that this mother or anyone like her should have to come to a meeting in the United States of America and have to make an argument as to why those services should be preserved for her son or her daughter or any other member of her family--the idea that she should even have to make that argument is insulting to us as a country. We would be a different country if Medicaid were changed in the way some folks around here want to change it.  I have used the word ``decimation.'' That is exactly what it is. It would be decimation, and a lot of families' lives would be destroyed. This is real life for these families.  Even if someone could prove that a year from now or 5 years from now or 10 years from now, that mother and her family would be somehow walled off or protected--even if you could guarantee that, it is still wrong because she shouldn't have to worry for a minute. She should have no uncertainty about whether her child is going to have Medicaid going forward--her child with a profound disability. There should be no question. That child should get Medicaid today, tomorrow, and as long as they need it for the rest of their life because we are a great country. We do that in We can do it over and over again.  We can have the strongest economy. We can have the strongest military, and we can take care of those families, no matter what, no questions asked, whatever it takes because that is who we are as But there are some people around here who just don't believe that. To use that mom's word, they think it is all negotiable--that if it is the right year and the numbers line up, maybe we can help you.  We need a tax cut, apparently. That is what they argue. They need a tax cut for wealthy folks, so Medicaid is going to pay for that. To say that is insulting is a gross understatement. That is obscene. That is as close to uttering an obscenity as anything I can think of. So you bet we are going to fight when it comes to those kinds of decisions--fight against those kinds of cuts.  I mentioned that I had been on the road a good bit and have spent a lot of time in counties that are rural counties in Just to give you an example of the numbers, I live in a State that has 67 counties, and 48 of the 67 are rural. Those are our Pennsylvania counties. If you add up all of the individuals in those 48 rural counties in Pennsylvania who got insurance by way of the Medicaid expansion--or received insurance in the marketplaces in the intervening years between passage of the ACA and currently--just in those 48 counties, over 278,000 people have healthcare--278,266. I use a precise number because right down to the 66, it matters. Every single one of those individuals in those 48 rural counties should have an ironclad guarantee that no bill will pass the U.Senate that will rip away their healthcare, not for one person. That should be our promise to them.  That is the number of people covered, right? With the Medicaid expansion plus the marketplace, 278,266 residents of rural Pennsylvania are covered. If the Senate bill passed, here is at least one estimate of what would happen to those rural counties: 151,000-plus people. I will not use the exact number because it is an estimate. The estimate is that around 150,000 people would lose their health insurance. You move forward in rural Pennsylvania by over 278,000 people; then you take two steps backward and rip healthcare away from 150,000 in rural I haven't gotten to the big population centers. That is the reality in  Then if you break it down even further--these are just 11 rural counties that I visited in the month of July in addition to other counties. In 11 rural Pennsylvania counties--these are counties with very small populations. One of them, Forest County, which I was in this weekend, has a little more than 7,000 people in its total population. In these 11 rural Pennsylvania counties, 54,180 people have healthcare today because of Medicaid expansion, plus those who got it through the marketplace, so 54,180 get healthcare. What is the estimate of who would lose if the bill passed? It is 32,410. Let's call it 30,000, roughly, because it is an estimate. So 54,000 gain; then you rip it away from 30,000. Does that make any sense at all? Does that help the country? How are we stronger after that? How are we better off as a country or, in my case, as a State? How are the people of our Commonwealth better off when 30,000 in 11 rural counties lose their coverage--or 150,000 in 48 rural counties?  I know I am over my time, and I will wrap up because we have colleagues here. This is a pivotal moment. To say it is a pivotal moment for the Senate is a big understatement, but it is also, I think, a pivotal moment for the country. We are going to be on a different path than we have been for a long time. Usually what happens over time is that you are expanding protections, enlarging the number of people who are the beneficiaries of protections of one kind or another. In this case, we would be going in the wrong direction.  I hope our colleagues will think long and hard before they vote yes either to move forward to debate on a bill that is[[Page S4144]]deeply flawed or to vote for the bill itself.  I yield the floor.

From inspiring accounts that are driven by their work ethic to stories of sacrifice all in the name of growing their company, the Nation's small businesses are the true lifeblood of the American economy.                              {time}  1615  With over 29 million small businesses operating in the United States, they are responsible for two out of every three new jobs created in this country. However, their full potential is being held back by heavy-handed regulations and uncertainty. Unfortunately, their inability to access capital continues to prevent job creation and expansion.  As a way to increase access to capital, the Small Business Administration jump-starts and enhances the flow of venture and private equity capital through the Small Business Investment Company program, also known as the SBIC program.  Created in the 1958 Small Business Investment Act, the program utilizes a privately owned and SBA licensed model to increase access to capital. With over 300 SBICs operating in the country and more than $24 billion of capital under management, the program in fiscal year 2015 invested more than $5.4 billion in approximately 1,000 small businesses.  In 2015, I introduced a SBIC bill that focused on increasing the family of funds limit.  Similar to my 2015 legislation that was signed into law, the bill we have before us today concentrates on the individual leverage limit. Currently set at $150 million, the individual limit determines how much capital can be deployed by a SBIC that has only one fund under management. To better utilize this program and allow an increase in capital to small businesses, H.2333--the bill that we are considering here this afternoon--increases the individual leverage limit to $175 million.  I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Knight), the chairman of our Subcommittee on Contracting[[Page H6179]]and Workforce, for his leadership on this issue.  With access to capital being such a critical need for small business expansion and job creation, an increase in the individual leverage limit could deliver the needed capital that the next great American company is searching for.  This bill has broad bipartisan support and was favorably passed out of committee unanimously. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.2333.

Mr.Speaker, I rise to support 351, which condemns the violence and persecution against LGBT or perceived-to-be LGBT individuals in  This resolution is an example of the strong bipartisanship of the House Foreign Affairs Committee under the leadership of Chairman Ed Royce and Ranking Member Eliot I thank my good friend, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who has long been a champion of the dignity of all people around the world, for introducing 351. I also thank the chairman and ranking member for working with us to ensure this resolution was passed without delay and with the support of the full committee.  On April 1 of this year, the Novaya Gazeta, one of the few independent Russian newspapers, posted a chilling report detailing a concerted campaign by Chechen authorities to identify, round up, torture, and murder gay or perceived-to-be-gay men and women in the Chechen region of  Dozens of suspected LGBT men and some women have been rounded up with estimates of more than 100 people being detained, and at least three murdered, maybe many more. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the reports. When confronted with accusations, his spokesman denied there were any gay people in Chechnya, and explained that, ``If there were such people in Chechnya, law enforcement agencies wouldn't need to have anything to do with them because their relatives would send them somewhere from which there is no returning.''  In fact, there have been credible reports that Chechen authorities have forced family members of those detained or those suspected of being gay to commit ``honor killings'' or face violence and retaliation against their entire families.  Chechnya is a small, conservative region of Russia, and LGBT people there face a level of isolation and danger that is unthinkable to those of us living in the freedom of the United Even those who have managed to escape Chechnya continue to face danger from extended family members or Chechen authorities within Russia and even parts of  That is why it is so important that the United States work with our partners in Europe and assist in making sure that those fleeing the violence in Chechnya are relocated somewhere they can be safe. 351 condemns the violence and persecution against LGBT individuals in Chechnya and calls on Chechen officials to immediately cease the abduction, detention, and torture of individuals on the basis of their actual or suspected sexual orientation, and hold accountable all those involved in perpetrating such abuses.  Furthermore, this resolution calls on the government of the Russian Federation to protect the human rights of all its citizens, condemn the violence and persecution, investigate these crimes in Chechnya, and hold accountable all of those involved in perpetrating such abuses.  We must remember that President Kadyrov is a close ally of President Putin, and that the Russian Government has essentially sanctioned the atrocities that are being carried out on its soil. That is why it is so important that representatives of the United States Government, at the highest levels, raise this issue with President Putin and other Russian officials.  I was extremely disappointed when Secretary of State Tillerson appeared before the Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this month and admitted that neither he nor the President had raised this issue with anyone in the Russian The United States must make it clear that human rights abuses will not be tolerated.  The President, the Secretary of State, and other senior officials must raise this issue consistently with the Russian Government and make it clear that they must protect the lives and safety of all Russian citizens.  Additionally, the Trump administration must take steps to ensure that any Russian officials involved in these atrocities are being sanctioned under the Sergei Magnitsky Act and the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which we passed last year. Events like these are exactly why these bills were passed, to ensure that government officials involved in gross human rights abuses do not have the privilege of accessing American markets or traveling to the United  Furthermore, the administration should be working in concert with our European allies to ensure that Russia is being held to its international obligations and treaties. The lives of vulnerable men and women are at stake, and every day that we remain silent, we condemn more to a dark fate.  I am pleased that the House is considering this resolution tonight. I urge my colleagues to support it. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgH5214.txt,2055,SMALL BUSINESS WEEK,2017.0,27.0,June
14136,topic-id,476,"Mr.President, today I wish to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the town of Lebanon, Lebanon was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today, and this is a time to celebrate the generations of hard-working and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.  The year of Lebanon's incorporation, 1767, was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. For thousands of years, the land of fields, streams, and forests of what is now southwestern Maine was the home of the Abenaki, who called the area ``Towwoh,'' meaning ``a place to grind corn.'' The many archeological treasures unearthed in the region include a large ancient stone mortar used by the Abenaki for that very purpose.  In 1733, the Massachusetts General Court granted Towwoh Plantation to 60 colonists, and European settlement began. When the town was incorporated on June 11, 1767, the name Lebanon was chosen in reference to the Biblical land of fertile soil and towering trees.  With the Salmon Falls River and Little River providing power, Lebanon soon was home to many lumber, grain, and textile mills. The wealth produced by the land and by hard work and determination was invested in schools and churches to create a true community.  Among the many prominent residents of the town over the years was the Reverend Oren Burbank Cheney, who established the Lebanon Academy in 1849. His courage and vision as an outspoken opponent of slavery and advocate for full rights for women and Native Americans so impressed Boston industrialist Benjamin Bates that, when Bates College was established in Lewiston in 1864, the Reverend Cheney was named as the first president of the esteemed school.  The coming of the railroads in the late 1800s helped to make Lebanon a tourism destination, with fine hotels, inns, and restaurants. An early visitor was the famed Norwegian violinist, Ole Bornemann Bull, who performed a concert at one of the town's remarkable attractions, the enormous cavern entrance known as Gully Oven, in 1871. The virtuoso was so impressed by the acoustics of the natural amphitheater that he bought a home in Lebanon, becoming one of the town's first summer residents.  Today visitors and residents alike enjoy Lebanon's quiet parks, beautiful historic buildings, and exciting outdoor recreation opportunities. The energy and planning that are going into Lebanon's 250th anniversary celebration this July demonstrate the pride townspeople have in their town.  The celebration of Lebanon's 250th anniversary is not merely about the passing of time; it is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the people who, for longer than America has been a nation, have pulled together, cared for one another, and built a great community. Thanks to those who came before, Lebanon, ME, has a wonderful history. Thanks to those there today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-15-pt1-PgS3552.txt,2121,INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,15.0,June

14004,topic-id,1476,"Mr.President, I thank the senior Senator from Vermont for his kind words. We do agree, occasionally, about a few things. We are, in some ways I think, the odd couple when it comes to things like open government and freedom of information. We agree on those things, somebody, I would say, from the left end of the political spectrum and somebody like me from the right end of the political spectrum, which I find particularly gratifying, but there are a lot of other things we have different views on. That is not unusual or to be unexpected, but I enjoy working with him when we can find those areas of common ground to work on.                          Iran Sanctions Bill  Mr.President, last night, the Senate voted to move forward with tough, new sanctions to hold Iran accountable for its continued support of terrorism. The unanimous vote we had is a strong message to the world that the United States will not tolerate Iran's complicity on terror and a clear indicator of just how important this legislation is.  Just last month, Secretary of State Tillerson noted that ``Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terror.'' I would amend that slightly and say it is ``the'' leading state sponsor of terror.  The Secretary said he would be undertaking a review of the success or failure of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action--what we know as the lopsided nuclear deal President Obama inked with Iran--because, unfortunately, as we have seen, the Obama administration's deal, relative to Iran's nuclear aspirations, did zero--zero--to stop Iran's investment in terrorism around the world. As a matter of fact, it generated quite a bit of new cash which Iran could use to pay for acts of terrorism around the world. So the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, all but cemented the status of the state sponsor of terrorism as a future nuclear power.  I remember being in the House Chamber when Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel talked about this paving the way to Iran achieving a nuclear weapon, albeit some 10 years hence, which may seem like a long time to us, but if you are the nation of Israel, 10 years is right around the corner if you are living in that neighborhood and going to be in its crosshairs.[[Page S3422]]  Part of the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, released billions of dollars to the Iranian regime and empowered our adversary--our avowed enemy--to engage in even more terrorist activities abroad. Instead of weakening Iran, it actually bolstered Tehran's hostile capabilities. On top of that, President Obama pushed aside our strongest ally in the region--I mentioned Israel--in order to lay a gift at the feet of one of greatest antagonists of the United States, with little or no benefit to our That is why it is no surprise Iran continues to violate international restrictions against ballistic missile testing and illicit arms transfers, flying in the face of any promises that were made in the agreement.  Last year, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, confirming what we had all feared: ``Iran's ballistic missiles are inherently capable of delivering [weapons of mass destruction], and Tehran already has the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East.''  Under President Obama's nuclear deal, their conventional inventory and capability are essentially free to grow, and grow they have.  So what kind of deal was the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal? It was a lopsided deal. More importantly, it was a dangerous deal as well.  Of course, Iran's reach goes far beyond their own border. They support the Assad regime in Syria and the Houthi rebellion in Yemen, two groups which have continually encouraged violence against Americans and even murder of their own citizens.  Last month, on his way to Saudi Arabia, Secretary of Defense James Mattis confirmed that Iranian-supplied missiles were being fired by the Houthis into Saudi So not only is Iran breaking the nuclear deal but also U.Security Council resolutions as well.  In Syria, Iran continues to prop up and shield the Butcher of Damascus, Bashar al-Assad, even after he has brutally used chemical weapons against his own people. Some 400,000 Syrians, at last count, have lost their lives in the Syrian civil war, supported by Iran, supported by Russia, propping up this butcher who is head of the regime.  So last night's show of bipartisan support is more than just a message of unity against terrorism; it is a sign the Senate will fight to stop Iran from tightening its grip on power. The legislation we will pass this week introduces new sanctions and embargoes on  First, it imposes new restrictions on persons who transact with and support Iran's ballistic missile programs, giving our President authority to impose sanctions on their weapons providers.  The legislation also makes clear that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps bears responsibility for destabilizing activities and terrorism in the region by extending new sanctions to them as well.  This bill also addresses Iran's human rights abuses by directing the Secretary of State to submit a list of people who are guilty of human rights violations so we can take further action against them.  Lastly, it reaffirms the arms embargo by allowing the President to block the property of any person or entity involved in the supply, sale, or transfer of prohibited arms and related materiel to and from  I also submitted yesterday an amendment to this Iranian sanctions legislation that targets Mahan Air, which is Iran's largest commercial airline. As a transporter of terrorists and weapons, Mahan Air is nothing more than a commercial coverup for terrorist activities, and, with routes in and out of Europe, it is essential for us to stop their continued expansion and to understand how their activities bear on the safety of American lives.  I am thankful for Chairman Corker's leadership on the Iran and now Russia sanctions bill, and the expediency in which we are moving forward. While we can't, in this bill, undo all of the harm caused by the foreign policy of the Obama administration, we can work to correct course, and I am glad we are doing so in a bipartisan way. Last night's vote was a sign of unity, and I am looking forward to getting this legislation through the Senate and onto the President's desk.  Mr.President, I wish to take a moment and talk about the Saudi arms sale, which we will be voting on this afternoon at about 2:30 or in that timeframe. We know Saudi Arabia remains under threat from the violent ambitions of Iran, which I just got through speaking about, but that is not just a threat to us, it is a threat in the region, particularly to Sunni allies like Saudi  A stronger Saudi Arabia will provide a powerful deterrent to Iranian aggression. This particular sale of weapons, announced by the President when he was in Saudi Arabia a couple weeks ago, will help provide greater regional stability to pushing back the advancing tide of Iranian-backed terrorism. It will help against Iranian-backed Houthis' weak government control, which allows terrorism to flourish in the region.  Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has been described by U.officials as the most active and dangerous affiliate of al-Qaida today, with several thousands of adherents and fighters inside of Yemen supported by the Iranian regime. AQAP, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, has continued to take advantage of the political and security vacuum. This arms sale will also bolster the kingdom's ability to provide for its own security and continue contributing to counterterrorism operations across the region, thereby reducing the burden on the United States and our own military forces by equipping them to do their own security and not depend on us.  The sale will also help deter regional threats and enhance the kingdom's ability to protect its borders, contribute to coalition counterterrorism operations, and target bad actors more precisely.  Finally, it will improve the kingdom's defensive military capabilities. Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has intercepted more than 40 missiles fired at the kingdom by Iranian-backed Houthi militias. Nine of these missiles have struck Saudi territory itself.  I look forward to voting in the 2:30 timeframe this afternoon against the resolution of disapproval filed by our colleague. I think it is important for us to help our allies defend themselves, to fill a power vacuum left that would otherwise be filled by U.forces and military effort.  I think it sends a strong message to Iran and their affiliates in the Middle East that we will not stand quietly or stand silently in the face of the continued growth of their terrorist activities and support for terrorist activities around the world.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

14222,topic-id,929,"Madam Speaker, this morning, the American public woke up to news accounts that the Trump White House and Republican leadership in Congress is going to again this week make another attempt to try and repeal and replace the Affordable Care  Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy gave a speech in Texas a few days ago on Saturday where he promised that this is the week that the Republicans will repeal and replace the Affordable Care  For those of us who were in the Chamber here just a short time ago in March when the first attempt was made to butcher the healthcare system with the so-called American Health Care Act, what we saw was the culmination of a process that was hyperpartisan starting in January in which the committees rushed through a piece of legislation without even giving the Congressional Budget Office a chance to analyze the cost and the impact in terms of the uninsured rate in  And then finally, as the hour approached when a vote was scheduled to[[Page H2977]]take place, the facts caught up with the legislation. The Congressional Budget Office determined that 24 million Americans would lose their health coverage, that the Medicare trust fund would be weakened because of the raid on the trust fund by reducing a Medicare tax surcharge for millionaires; and it would reduce the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 4 years, a program that is revered and probably the most popular insurance program in America in which, again, collection of healthcare stakeholders from all across the country, the American Hospital Association, the nurses, the doctors, the March of Dimes all came out universally opposing this measure.  And finally, the Quinnipiac poll showed what the American public thought of this bill. They came out with a poll that showed only 17 percent support in the American public for the Republican healthcare bill. Again, the Quinnipiac poll comes from my State, the State of Connecticut, and was very supportive and friendly in terms of its polling data in terms of the Trump campaign last year, so it is certainly not a partisan poll.  So why are we revisiting a measure which was so universally denounced and despised? Well, there has been a new amendment that has been offered in an attempt, again, within the confines of the Republican majority, to try and win votes to pass this bill this week.  Again, they have a majority with roughly 240 seats. They need only 216, and that is really what has been the focus of the majority leader in terms of trying to line up a vote this week.  The amendment, the so-called MacArthur amendment, again, revisits some of the issues, which, again, some of the more conservative members of the Freedom Caucus were complaining about, and what it proposes to do is basically give States the ability to wipe out essential health benefits--in other words, the basic patient protections that were built into the health insurance law 8 years ago.                              {time}  1215  It does nothing in terms of trying to ameliorate the impact of the Medicaid cuts, which is the program for low-income and working Americans, which the ACA expanded and has done great work in terms of reducing the ranks of the uninsured. That is the measure which we now have before us this week.  Well, once again, the stakeholders who have to live with this have weighed in with their thoughts. This is what the American Hospital Association said:  ``The amendment proposed this week would dramatically worsen the bill.''  Again, it is a bill that was so unpopular, poorly drafted, and not ready for prime time that the Speaker pulled it from a vote on March 24.  The American Hospital Association, which is the largest trade association for hospitals in America--they represent thousands of hospitals--have said that, in fact, this makes it even worse.  By weakening the essential health benefits--and I come from We know a little bit about insurance in that What we know is, if insurance companies can redesign healthcare plans, the essential health benefits will be the first to go. The ones that will be the first to go will be maternity care, behavioral health, and emergency coverage because those are the most expensive items that are included within the health insurance plan. I would say, well, that is true. On the other hand, those are the essential benefits that families need.  Look at what has happened since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2007 to infant mortality, for example: because of the Medicaid coverage, 57 percent of the live births in America are now women--and particularly young women--who get the benefit of Medicaid coverage. So they get prenatal care. They get the help that they need to make sure that a healthy delivery occurs. That is why infant mortality rates have been coming down in this country since the Affordable Care Act passed.  To allow States to eliminate or give insurance companies the ability to eliminate maternity care, again, is just going exactly in the opposite direction. A goal all Americans support is to reduce infant mortality and to promote healthy live births.  The American Hospital Association was joined by the American Medical Association, which is the largest trade group which represents physicians all across the country, and came out against the bill.  America should listen. The people in Congress should listen. We should not take up this bill. It is time for a true bipartisan process to improve America's healthcare bill.  Let's not vote on this this week. Let's listen to the American people.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-01-pt1-PgH2976-2.txt,1836,"'S, EMAILS",2017.0,1.0,July

I want to thank Mr.Payne for introducing H.1372, which will ensure such consideration is made.  Recently, the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held a series of hearings focused on the progress and the future of achieving national preparedness in the face of events like Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Among the child safety efforts made in the last 10 years, FEMA created the National Emergency Child Locator Center within the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children to ensure the swift reunification of children should a major emergency displace communities.  Mr.Speaker, I know this personally, having been an elected official on Staten Island during the tragedy in lower Manhattan in September of 2001. All three bridges from Staten Island to New Jersey were closed, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was closed, and ferry service was stopped from Staten Island to We had many of our residents stuck at work in Their children were on Staten Island and could not be reached when being released from school.  I know Mr.Payne can comment on this as well, but I just want to publicly thank him, because I experienced that myself.  The subcommittee heard from weather-tested first responders who, among other important issues, stressed the importance of integrating the needs of children into emergency planning, reminding us that, after all, children are not just mini-adults.  While DHS and FEMA have taken steps to elevate the safety of our most important populations, DHS can still do more to ensure Department policies, programs, and activities to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against disasters, and also consider the needs of children throughout our impacted communities.  By authorizing a children's needs technical expert at FEMA, as H.1372 seeks to do, we can make certain that the needs of children are integrated into emergency preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation activities.  Further, H.1372 will require DHS's Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans to appropriately consider the needs of children throughout Departmental activities and report such efforts to  H.1372 provides peace of mind that the future of our most treasured assets, our children, are safe in the face of emergencies. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this legislation would not have a significant impact on the Federal budget.  I want to thank Chairman Shuster of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and Chairman Barletta of the Transportation and Infrastructure's Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management for working with the Committee on Homeland Security to see that this legislation receives timely consideration on the House floor.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I am committed to ensuring FEMA has resources at its disposal to meet its mission of safeguarding a more resilient nation.

14002,topic-id,3209,"Mr.President, let me say at the outset that I support the position from the Senator from I believe that what he has said about the situation between the United States and Saudi Arabia is timely and needs to be heard. People across the United States and around the world should be aware of the fact that we are witnessing four famines across this world. One of them is in Yemen, and three others are on the continent of This is a famine that is created not by drought, not by national defense, but by human disaster--by a war that has been created and is one that has been pushed largely by the Saudis at the expense of the people--the innocent people--who live in the country of  What the Senator from Kentucky is basically calling on all of us to do is to ask: What role is the United States playing in Saudi Arabia's aggressive activities? Should we be more vigilant in our knowing that what we are selling them is being used in ways that are inconsistent with the values of the United States of America? We know the record of the Saudi monarchy when it comes to human rights, and the Senator from Kentucky has spoken to that quite eloquently. We know what they have done to their own people, to the people who live in their country, and to those who seek to have the basic freedoms that we take for granted in  We also know that, when it comes to the Saudi activity of promoting their version--the most extreme version--of Islam, they have been guilty of promulgating Wahhabism, which has led to extreme forms of the Muslim faith in some places in the world. Those are realities.  We know the reality of 9/11. When we traced the origins of those who came and killed 3,000 innocent Americans, too many roads led back to Riyadh; too many roads led back to Saudi So why can't we be more open and honest in our relationship with this country?  The Senator from Kentucky has told us this morning that the amendment that will be offered shortly by him and by Senator Murphy is one that calls on the Senate to take an honest look at Saudi Arabia today and its relationship with the United States.[[Page S3419]]  May I add one other element on a personal basis?  It is so rare on the floor of the Senate to see what we have just seen this morning--a proposal for an amendment to be debated and an amendment to be voted on on the floor of the I can count on one hand how many times that has happened this year in the What used to be the most deliberative body in America--the great debating society and so forth--has turned into a place of rubberstamps and unanimous consents. I am glad--win or lose in our effort here on this amendment--that the Senator is bringing this important issue to the floor. I thank him for making it a bipartisan effort in the process.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, what I have come to the floor to speak to is another issue that really calls on the Senate and asks the basic question: Why are we here?  I think we know that we were elected to make America a better nation and to help families across this Nation realize the great opportunity and goodness of this  One of the issues that most people worry about the most in their daily lives is healthcare. They should. Many times, I have said on the floor that, if you have ever been in a position in your life as a father of a seriously sick child and have had no health insurance when that has happened, you will never forget that as long as you live. I know. I have been there. I went through a period of time with my wife, in raising our daughter, when she needed the best medical care in America, and we did not have any health insurance. It was frightening to think what would happen to our little girl because we did not have the protection of health insurance and the quality care that everybody wants for themselves and for the people they love.  At this moment in time, we are in a debate about the future of healthcare in America--the future of health insurance in I cannot think of a more serious topic. People say: Well, it is one-sixth of the American economy--our healthcare system. That is critically important. Even more so, this is such a personal matter for every individual.  The Affordable Care Act, which was passed 6 or 7 years ago, I was proud to vote for. We couldn't get any support from the other side of the aisle--not one single vote, not one Republican vote in support of it. Our goal, of course, with the Affordable Care Act was to reduce the number of Americans who were uninsured when it came to health insurance. We achieved a major part of our goal. The rate of uninsured in health insurance in America was cut in half by the Affordable Care We expanded opportunities for health insurance through the Medicaid Program, as well as through private insurance exchanges, which were moved in the right direction.  We also said something else in that we wanted to build into the health insurance system of America protections for families. We wanted to make sure that you could not be discriminated against in buying health insurance simply because someone in your family had been sick. Think of how many of us--one out of three, I might add--have preexisting conditions or of someone in our family who has a preexisting condition. It happens--a child surviving cancer, a child with diabetes, somebody in the family who has a heart condition. Those are the realities of life for families across  Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the health insurance companies could say not only no to you but, really, no when it came to coverage, or they could charge you premiums that were way beyond what people could afford to pay. We eliminated that in the Affordable Care Act--eliminated it. You cannot discriminate against an American on the basis of his having a preexisting medical condition.  The insurance companies went wild in defining what a preexisting condition was that might raise your premiums or to deny you coverage. Having had acne in your adolescence was a preexisting condition. The fact that you were a woman who might give birth to a child was a preexisting condition. The list went on and on. We eliminated that and said that you cannot discriminate against Americans because of those things.  We have people on the other side who have said that we have to get rid of that protection. If we do, what will happen to all of these people?  On Saturday, I went to a march in Chicago, in Lincoln It was the Children's Heart Foundation and the congenital heart defect alliance. Of course, it speaks for itself. The 1 birth defect among children in America is a heart defect, and 1 out of 100 babies born has a heart problem. These are kids with preexisting conditions. You should have seen the families show up in big, big numbers, supporting little kids--some of them just babies. They were proudly wearing T-shirts, standing up, and saying that we are going to fight for this little boy or little girl. They were trying to promote medical research to save their lives.  It is something that really touched me as I looked at 600 people on that hot Saturday afternoon, marching in Lincoln Park in I said to them: When it gets down to the basics in life, the most important thing in your life is your baby. The next most important thing is your family, whom you have standing behind that baby. Then there is the doctor--that doctor whom you are counting on to do everything in his power or her power to make sure your baby survives. But you need to bring into this conversation another group--politicians, Senators, and Congressmen--because we are making decisions right here in Washington that will decide whether the families who marched in Lincoln Park in Chicago on Saturday and families like them all across America will have access to affordable health insurance, real health insurance that will cover them. That is what the debate is about.  It was just a few weeks ago that the House of Representatives passed a measure to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to replace it. At the end of the day, not a single Democrat voted for the measure. It passed by two votes--two votes--in the House of  When they came back and analyzed what the Republicans had voted for in the House of Representatives when it came to healthcare, here is what they found: Their proposal to eliminate the Affordable Care Act--the one that passed the House of Representatives several weeks ago--according to the Congressional Budget Office--a nonpartisan, expert group--according to the CBO, 23 million Americans will lose their health insurance under the plan that passed the House of In my State of Illinois, with 12.5 million people in our population, 1 million people would lose their health insurance.  I will just tell my colleagues, I don't see how any Member of Congress can stand before us and say: I have a great solution for healthcare in We are going to take health insurance away from 23 million people. But that is what the vote did. And their vote, sadly, eliminated the protection against discrimination because of preexisting conditions.  So what has been the reaction to the House repeal bill that was passed? I can tell my colleagues that in my State there is not a single group, not one medical advocacy group, who supports what the House of Representatives did.  I am from downstate Illinois, outside the city of I have a congressional district down there in smalltown America, great people. If you went into that part of Illinois and said to them ``I am going to vote for a measure that is going to put in jeopardy the future of your local hospital,'' the people would literally rise up to resist it.  The Illinois Hospital Association tells us that the Affordable Care Act repeal passed by the House of Representatives endangers hospital services all across our State but especially in small towns and in rural They estimate that we are going to lose 60,000 jobs at these hospitals in our I can tell you what those hospital jobs are in smalltown America, in rural They are the best jobs in the community. These are medical experts, doctors and nurses and supervisors and administrators who keep these hospitals operating, and they are paid well to do it, and they should be. Those are the jobs at risk of being eliminated by the vote in the House of  One million people in our State could lose health insurance, and our hospitals are threatened with closure.[[Page S3420]]That is why the Illinois Hospital Association opposes what the Republicans did in the House of Representatives, and that is why the Illinois State Medical Society--our doctors--and the Chicago Medical Society have come out against what happened in the House of That is why the nurses have opposed what was passed in the House of Representatives as well. Not a single medical advocacy group supports what happened in the House of Not one in my Can't find one of them.  So now we remember from basic civics that after it passes the House, it is our turn in the What are we going to do with healthcare reform? Well, I wish I could tell you. We are told we are going to vote on it. Maybe as soon as 2 weeks from now, we will come to the floor and vote on changing the healthcare system of the United States of  What is the proposal of the Republicans in the Senate when it comes to the future of our healthcare system in America? I don't know, and the reason I don't know is it is being done in secret. There have been no committee hearings, no opportunity to offer amendments. In fact, we haven't even seen the measure we are going to be asked to vote on in 2 weeks.  The Congressional Budget Office, which is supposed to analyze it, hasn't published any analysis of the Republican plan. Yet they are moving forward at a breakneck pace to have us vote on it, up or down, before we leave for the Fourth of July recess. It is a frightening prospect.  They will do it under what is known as reconciliation. I won't bore people with Senate procedure, but what it basically means is they can move it through with a simple majority vote in the U.Amendments will be considered on what they call a vote-arama basis. And if it sounds like some kind of a game, it is almost a game. You offer an amendment and you get perhaps 1 minute to explain your amendment on changing healthcare in America, and the other side gets 1 minute to explain their opposition, and off you go to a vote and then another one and another one. Your head is spinning, trying to figure out what in the world each of these amendments and each of these votes is going to mean. Those are the measures to be taken by the Senate when it comes to healthcare.  This is exactly the opposite of what happened when the Affordable Care Act was passed. We adopted 160 Republican amendments to the Affordable Care None of them voted for final passage, but 160 amendments were offered by Republicans to change it, and they were adopted. It was a bipartisan process on the amendments.  How many amendments will we be able to offer to the Republican Senate proposal that is going to come before us in 2 weeks? The answer is that we don't know because we have never seen the Republican proposal. It has been done in secret. Thirteen Republican Senators were chosen by the majority leader to sit in private and come up with this bill. There was no open committee hearing, no open discussion. Some Republicans were invited in, and some were not. We don't know what the ultimate product will look like, but I can tell you this: Whatever the Republican Senators come up with, it is going to have a dramatic impact on each and every single American, every one of us in our communities back home.  I know this idea of repealing the Affordable Care Act in 2 weeks is a solemn political promise that many Republicans made, but they also made a promise to the people they represent to do what they can to help these families through their difficult times. That is why we need to make sure the product that is passed by the Republicans in the Senate is one that serves the needs of people across the United States of  If this product coming from the Republicans is like the House measure that takes away health insurance for 23 million Americans, then I can understand why the Republicans want to do this in secret. I can understand why they don't want us to see it until the very last minute and then vote on it and get out of town as fast as they can, because it is an embarrassment to think that the U.Senate and the House, for that matter, would vote to take away health insurance from 23 million That is a dereliction of duty, and from where I am sitting, it is just flat immoral to take away health insurance from that many people.  What if we end up with a product like the House of Representatives' that jeopardizes rural hospitals and hospitals in the inner cities, that closes down these community healthcare clinics, reduces access. Well, I will tell you what will happen. People without health insurance will still show up at the hospital sick, in the emergency room, and they will still be treated, but they won't be able to pay for it. Who will pay for their care? We will pay for their care. Everyone else with health insurance will pay more because people who are uninsured will receive free medical care. That is the reality. And, of course, if you don't have a regular doctor or a regular medical home, as they call it these days, what started off as a minor problem could turn into a major problem, even life-threatening. That is why the Affordable Care Act builds into it community healthcare clinics and opportunities to create a medical home.  When I met with the Chicago Medical Society at a convention they had in Chicago this last week, I was surprised by a few things. First, I was surprised to learn that out of the 5,000 physicians in the Chicago Medical Society, they received responses back from over 1,000 who said they thought the measure that passed the House of Representatives--the Republican repeal bill--was the worst news they had heard when it came to the future of healthcare. They preferred the Affordable Care But they went on to say something that may surprise people. These doctors--over 1,000 of them responding to the survey--said they thought it was time for us to talk about very significant changes to our healthcare system in They are tired of fighting the private insurance companies. What they suggested is that we look at a plan like Medicare for all.  Right now, Medicare serves 50 million or 60 million People can't wait to turn 65 and finally qualify for Medicare, with no exclusions for preexisting conditions, and they know that Medicare is going to give them quality care, and it is not going to bankrupt them as individuals.  These doctors in the Chicago area have said it is now time for America to seriously look at Medicare for all, and I agree with them. I think it is time to look at it because the private health insurance system, even as we have tried to save it, salvage it, remake it through the Affordable Care Act, has real shortcomings.  I hope those on the other side who are considering changes in our healthcare system will actually listen to doctors, listen to hospital administrators, and listen to the families they represent. Why they are doing this in secrecy, why they are refusing to give us a chance for committee hearings and amendments I can't tell you, other than the obvious: Clearly, what they have come up with is something they don't believe the American people will accept, so they need to push it through without disclosure at the last minute and get out of town in the hopes that people won't blame them.  Well, when it comes to healthcare, people don't forget. I won't forget, and the people of Illinois won't forget the votes that were cast in the House of Representatives which threaten to take away health insurance from 1 million people in my  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

14133,topic-id,719,"Mr.President, I want to take a few minutes to acknowledge Ann Earlier this year, after 6 years, Ann stepped down as Regional Administrator of the U.General Services Administration's--GSA--Great Lakes Ann Kalayil is a trailblazer. She is the first woman--and first Asian American--to serve as GSA Administrator of the six-State Great Lakes I am honored to congratulate her on a job well done.  Headquartered in Chicago, IL, the GSA is the Federal Government's real estate and procurement manager. As Regional Administrator, Ann Kalayil was responsible for 128 Federal buildings, 986 leased locations, 11 U.land ports, nearly 1,000 employees, and about $150 million in contracts to small and economically disadvantaged businesses. To say Ann Kalayil had a big job is an understatement, but it will come as no surprise to the people who know her that she met the challenge head-on and thrived in the role.  Her story is the story of the American dream. Born in Chicago, Ann was the daughter of Indian immigrants. When she was 5 years old, her parents moved back to Kerala, It was the first time Ann met her siblings, Tom, Sales, and They were ecstatic to meet their baby sister but spoke very little English and struggled to communicate with each other. So what did Ann do? She took it upon herself to learn Malayalam, a South Indian language native to Kerala, Malayalam is an extremely complicated language, but Ann picked it up immediately, and people never guessed it wasn't her first language. This is how Ann would handle situations throughout her career. She never feared going out of her way to learn the needs of the community or group, even if it meant she would do most of the work. All that matters to Ann Kalayil is getting results.  People who know Ann best describe her as fierce, outspoken, and compassionate--just like her late father, Philip Her dad taught her the importance of these shared values and public service. Philip Kalayil was a Chicagoland legend. He was leader in the Indian American community, starting organizations to help people stay in touch with their culture and religion. Later, he would start the Indo-American Democratic Organization, empowering people to register to vote and make their voices heard. Ann would later serve as its president. In 2008, Philip was recognized by the Association for Asian American Studies with its Heart of Asian America Community Award, a well-deserved honor.  You could say public service was in Ann's blood, and although Philip is no longer with us, I know he would feel the same way. What a proud moment it must have been for him, watching his youngest daughter being sworn in to a top Federal job--appointed by the President of the United States--while holding the family  Growing up as Philip Kalayil's daughter, Ann had a front row seat in how to be a leader in the community and has waged countless successful campaigns, issues ranging from education policy, campaign finance reform, immigration reform, and documenting Asian American history. During the 2008 Presidential campaign, Ann cochaired Obama's Asian American and Pacific Islander Leadership Council and was among a select few who was in a reserved area near the stage in Grant Park when Obama greeted a crowd of nearly 200,000 to celebrate the historic election. For all she takes on, her brother Tom only recalls seeing Ann nervous once, and it was when she was asked to throw the first pitch at a Chicago White Sox game following her appointment at the  Prior to her appointment at the GSA, Ann worked for more than 12 years at the University of Chicago in Information Technology Services in Emerging Technologies and Communications and as director of Client Services and Like her father, she was also a teacher. Ann taught interdisciplinary courses on Asian Americans at DePaul University, Loyola University Chicago, and the University of Illinois at Ann also holds a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Illinois at Chicago, a bachelor's degree in computer science from Northeastern Illinois University, a master's degree in Asian studies from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a doctorate from the University of Wisconsin- I want to congratulate Ann Kalayil on her wonderful career and her outstanding service to our community and the country. I wish her all the best.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-16-pt1-PgS2962.txt,326,INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,16.0,July

A bill to repeal the Jones Act restrictions on coastwise trade, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Mr.Mr.President, I come to the floor today to introduce the Open America's Waters Act of 2017. This bill would repeal the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, better known as the Jones Act, an archaic and burdensome law that hinders free trade, stifles the economy and ultimately hurts consumers, largely for the benefit of labor unions. If this legislation becomes law, U.shippers will no longer be required to patronize market inefficiency but rather, effectively leverage the global shipping market.  As many of my colleagues know, the Jones Act is one of many of laws passed over time that addresses port-to-port coastal shipping, drafted in order to protect the U.domestic shipping industry. While the Jones Act may have had some rationale back in the 1920s when it was enacted, today it serves only to raise shipping costs, making U.farmers and businesses less competitive in the global marketplace and increasing costs for American consumers. This protectionist mentality directly contradicts the lessons our nation has learned about the many benefits of a free and open market. Repeatedly, it has been proven that trade liberalization has created[[Page S4001]]jobs, expanded economic growth and provided consumers with access to lower cost goods and services.  The forced purchase of American vessels combined with the immense cost associated with U.shipbuilding has forced U.shippers to act against their best interests to the detriment of their businesses. While foreign-built coastal-sized ships typically cost between $25-30 million, a U.S.-made ship of the same size can cost anywhere between $190-250 million. A repeal of the Jones Act, over time, would have broad impact. According to a 2002 U.International Trade Commission study, repealing the Jones Act would lower shipping costs by about 22 percent. The Commission also found that repealing the Jones Act would have an annual positive effect of $656 million on the overall U.economy. Though this decade-and-a-half-old study provides some of the most recent statistics available, it is not hard to imagine the modern affect that maritime deregulation would contribute to this industry.  Congress must take action to repeal laws that have outlived their usefulness and are no longer relevant to modern commerce. It is unacceptable that millions of dollars in the U.economy are lost every year to an antiquated policy, and unacceptable that this body is unable to disengage from special interests in order to participate in a productive debate on this issue. I encourage my colleagues to reflect on our responsibility as lawmakers and see the Jones Act for what it really is: an outdated and protectionist policy that only serves to harm the American economy and consumer.  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgS3998-2.txt,326,INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,13.0,July
14254,topic-id,3787,"Mr.President, this week--perhaps as early as tomorrow--Majority Leader McConnell, who just left the floor, will ask the Senate to vote on a bill we have not seen. That is right. We will be voting this week on a bill we haven't seen. I think it is a first. I am going to do a little research to see if this has ever happened before in the Senate, where Members of the Senate were brought together to vote on a bill that has not been made public or printed for us to review.  This isn't an inconsequential bill. This is a bill about the healthcare system of the United States of There is not a single American living in our Nation today who will not be affected by our vote this week because we are in the process of deciding whether we will change healthcare in America, health insurance in America, and there is not a single one of us who doesn't have a health insurance plan, either private or public, or not affected by the health insurance industry in healthcare across the United In fact, healthcare itself represents one-sixth of the American economy.  So we are being asked to vote on a bill this week which has not been printed and given to us and which will change healthcare for every single American and affect one-sixth of the American economy.  We do know that some of the previous provisions that have been brought before us on the Republican side have an impact--a negative impact--and in my State of Illinois, a very personal negative impact.  We know that their effort to repeal ObamaCare, which has been a political slogan that has been used for 6 or 7 years, ran into a wall when the American people said: Well, if you repeal it, what is left? What will be there? What will replace it?  At that point, the Republican effort disassembled. They didn't have an alternative. They spent the last 6 years[[Page S4140]]under ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--saying ``No, repeal it'' without spending the time to think about what would follow, what is next.  The Congressional Budget Office--this is an interesting thing--the Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan agency that we turn to that evaluates our work. They take a look at the bills we write, and they take a look at the laws that will pass, and they say: Well, this is the impact it will have on the deficit, on future generations, on entitlement programs.  Sometimes the Congressional Budget Office is maddening. They take forever. I don't know what is going on over there, but what you think is a simple question can take weeks and sometimes longer to result in an analysis, and there are times when I just flat out disagree with their analysis.  Let me give an example. When we debated the Affordable Care Act, we said that one of the things we need to do is make sure there is plenty of preventive medicine. For example, we make sure under the Affordable Care Act that every senior gets a free annual physical. Our belief is, if you detect a problem a person has early enough, you might be able to lessen its impact or actually cure it. We said that to the Congressional Budget Office, and they replied to us: You cannot put a dollar value on preventive medicine.  Well, it is common sense; isn't it? If you find something early, it is more likely to be cured. It is cheaper. No, you can't put a dollar on it.  So the Congressional Budget Office sometimes can frustrate us, but we rely on them, and I would say, for the most part, they do give us good advice. I don't agree completely with them, but they give us good advice.  Do you know what they say about the Republican repeal plans that have been passed in the House of Representatives and the various versions that have been suggested? They believe those repeal efforts will take health insurance away from 22 million to 32 million  Think about that. We passed the Affordable Care Act because so many people in America had no health insurance, and we wanted to make sure they had it--for their own peace of mind, for their own good health, to make sure there was fairness in our system so sick people without health insurance who are cared for don't have their bills passed on to everybody else. Well, the Congressional Budget Office took a look at the Republican plan, which passed the U.House of Representatives by four votes--all Republican votes--four votes, and they looked at the plans proposed by Senator McConnell and the Republicans, and they said: At the end of the day, 22 to 32 million Americans will lose their health insurance. They said, in my State of Illinois, 1 million out of 12\1/2\ million will lose their health insurance.  I cannot understand how any Senator of either political party could, in good conscience, come here and say: Boy, we had a great week. We just passed a healthcare reform bill, and 1 million people in Illinois will lose their health insurance. Really? That is why you ran for the U.Senate, to take health insurance coverage away from people? I would have thought common decency, common sense would suggest we want to do just the opposite. We want more and more people to fall under the protection of health insurance.  We also know some of the reforms we built into the Affordable Care Act are going to be changed by at least the early versions of the Republican repeal bill. Like what? One out of three Americans has a preexisting medical condition. A few weeks ago, I went through a heart procedure that worked out just fine--thank you--but now I have a preexisting condition. I am in pretty big company: one out of three people across the United  Remember the day before we passed the Affordable Care Act? Before we passed the Affordable Care Act, if you had a preexisting condition, if you could get health insurance, it was darned expensive.  A good friend of mine had a trucking company. He had some problems with his ankle. He went to the doctor. The next year, when they wrote the health insurance plan for his trucking company, they excluded anything on the health insurance policy affecting his legs and his feet. Each year, he said, I was afraid to turn in any claim because the next year they wouldn't cover him. It is a preexisting condition.  We changed that. We changed the law. We said, in America, when you sell health insurance, you cannot discriminate because of preexisting conditions. You can't discriminate with higher premiums because you have a child with diabetes. You can't discriminate with higher premiums if your wife has survived breast cancer. Now, to me, that is common sense, and it is humane.  The Republican approach allows the States to waive that--back to the bad old days, when preexisting conditions could run your premiums through the roof, where you have haves and have-nots when it comes to health insurance, and Republicans said the other protections we put in the Affordable Care Act are also on the chopping block.  For example, my wife and I raised three kids, put them through college. They had their health insurance when they were students. They came out of college looking for jobs--thank you--and it took a little while to find the right job, and we worried: Now that they are not in school, whose health insurance is going to protect them while they are looking for a job with benefits?  We put in the Affordable Care Act that your kids--young adults--can stay under your family health insurance plan until they reach the age of 26. It is just common sense. Keep them under the family plan until they have a chance to get that job with benefits.  We put other provisions in there--lifetime limits. It used to be, you would buy health insurance in this country and to keep the costs down, they would say: We have you covered. Up to $150,000, you are covered. Now, $150,000 sounds like a huge amount of money to people of modest means and working families, but we all know you are one accident or one diagnosis away from having medical bills that go through the roof. So $150,000? Get real. That could be 2 days in a hospital with a doctor and a surgery or radiation. That is the reality.  So we took lifetime limits off the policies. They can't do that to you in America anymore. When you buy health insurance, you have health insurance, and if, God forbid, your condition takes your bills to sky heaven, they are going to be covered. Now the Republicans say: Well, that is another thing we will take out. We will make that optional.  Can I tell you one other one that really gets me because it was a big debate here for years. Back where my friend Senator Sheldon Whitehouse is standing used to be the desk of Paul Wellstone, a liberal Senator from the State of What a good guy--terrific guy--short, feisty. Boy, when he got into a fight, you wanted to be on his side.  Paul Wellstone teamed up with a man who sat right there named Pete Pete Domenici was exactly the opposite politically: from New Mexico, conservative, Republican, disagreed with Wellstone on virtually everything, except for one thing. Each of them had in their families someone suffering from mental illness. They decided they were going to do something about the fact that most health insurance plans did not cover mental illness. It was a battle that went on for years to require health insurance to include mental illness and they won the battle and we put it in the Affordable Care Now, the Republicans say: Let's make that optional. This is something you can buy if you want to buy it.  At the end of the day, I think we all know we need a health insurance plan which is there when we need it, that covers things we can't even imagine when we buy the health insurance, and it makes sure people don't end up broke and bankrupt because of healthcare bills.  That was the driving cause, the driving reason for people filing bankruptcy in America--medical bills. They couldn't pay them. Since we passed the Affordable Care Act, the number of bankruptcies filed because of medical bills has been cut in half. So good health insurance that covers you when you need it and covers a member of your family when you need it is essential. That is why this debate and this vote tomorrow are so essential.  One thing I forgot to mention. Wellstone and Domenici didn't just[[Page S4141]]cover mental illness. They put another provision in there, and most of us paid no attention to it: substance abuse treatment. That has to be covered in health insurance too. Is that important? Have you heard of the opioid epidemic, the heroin epidemic?  I recently asked one of the best providers in Chicago about this, and they said: Luckily, people who have a child who ends up being addicted and needs treatment, if they have private health insurance, there is some coverage. Now, there is a battle about how many bills will be paid and how much is paid, but it is covered under the health insurance plan. Republicans want to make that optional. They call it freedom of choice.  The junior Senator from Texas, Ted Cruz, talks about policies you could buy that are really cheap policies. We call it junk insurance. You are insured in name only. If you need it, it isn't going to be there. That has been in the Republican plans that have come before us. We don't know whether that will be in the plan we have to vote on tomorrow. We don't know. It is a mystery.  How many hearings have been held on the bill we will vote for tomorrow on proceeding to change healthcare in America? Not one. How many amendments have been offered? Of course, none. We haven't seen it. We don't know.  We also know something else. The Republican plan on healthcare will slash the Medicaid Most people--myself included--a few years ago, would have been stumped to describe the Medicaid Program and what it covered. Now, I will tell you what it covers, and think about cutting what I am about to describe by 25 to 35 percent.  1, half of the children born in the State of Illinois are paid for by Their mother's prenatal care, the birth of the child, and postnatal care of mom and the kid is covered by Medicaid--one-half.  In addition to that, every school district in my State--probably in Rhode Island, probably in Oklahoma--receives Medicaid payments--school districts. Why? For the kids with special education needs. Medicaid helps pay for counselors so these kids can be mainstreamed in education. Medicaid in my State even pays for feeding tubes for those severely disabled children who are in school--but a 25- to 35-percent cut in the Republicans' proposals for  The most expensive thing in Medicaid, the thing that costs the most money, I haven't mentioned. Is your mother in a nursing home? Is your father? Your grandfather? Sixty percent of the people in nursing homes rely on Medicaid to stay in that nursing home and get the basic care they need. So when you cut that by 25 to 35 percent, what happens to Mom? What happens to your grandfather? Does that mean the family now has a bill to pick up? Does that mean they have to leave the nursing home and go somewhere else? Where will that be? Yet that is one of the proposals.  The disabled community, they stepped up as well. Medicaid is health insurance for disabled people in A woman in Champagne came to me and said: I have a 23-year-old son with autism. He is pretty good. He is kind of on his own. He is doing some things. Senator, if he didn't have Medicaid health insurance, I would have to put him in an institution. I don't want to do that.  How important is Medicaid? How important is it that the Republicans will slash this Medicaid? It gets to the heart of healthcare for tens of millions of people in the United States of  Why do Republicans want to cut Medicaid? It is simple. It is linear. It is direct. They have to cut $700 billion out of Medicaid to provide a tax cut for the wealthiest people in  Oh, Durbin, you are making that up. This must be a press release from the Democratic National No, that is exactly what it is all about. In order to pay for the tax cuts to the highest income individuals, to pharmaceutical companies, and to health insurance companies, they cut Medicaid payments to the They think that is simple justice, a tax cut. They are always for tax cuts, but look who pays for that tax cut.  So who lines up for and against the Republican approach we are going to get to vote on tomorrow? That is easy. There is not a single medical advocacy group in America today supporting the Republican position. That is a pretty broad statement. You had better be ready to back it up, I am ready. Hospitals, doctors, nurses, pediatricians, every medical advocacy group, and community clinics all oppose what the Republicans are setting out to do--and they are not alone. Remember the preexisting conditions? I mentioned diabetes and cancer. The American Diabetes Association, the American Cancer Association, the American Heart, Lung, you name it, all of those groups oppose what the Republicans are setting out to do. They realize it is a dramatic step backward in terms of healthcare in  Every healthcare repeal bill Congressional Republicans have devised to date has represented a massive step backward for healthcare. None of the bills proposed by Senate or House Republicans would increase the number of Americans with health insurance coverage. It does just the opposite. None of them reduce costs or improve care.  You say: Well, if you tell me you don't know what the bill is going to be, how are you describing it? I am giving the composite of all the bills that have been offered by the Republicans in the House and So far, we think--one in the House for sure--four different bills in the Senate, which I have just described, you will find this in all the bills. They don't get better, they get worse. None of them will strengthen our healthcare system or improve people's lives.  One of my Republican colleagues really put it in a few words very directly and said recently: I didn't come to Washington to hurt people.  I trust that none of us--not a single Republican or Democrat--came for that purpose. We want to help people, don't we? Isn't that why we are here? That is why we need to reject this approach. It is why we need to sit down together and make our healthcare system better.  I voted for the Affordable Care I believe in it. It cut the number of uninsured people in my State in half, and I think that is a worthy goal. It made many other changes which I have described here this evening.  Is it perfect? By no means. I used this example before: The only perfect law that I know of was carried down the side of a mountain on clay tablets by Senator Everybody else does their best, and sometimes we need a little help. Our current healthcare system needs some help.  Let me tell you where I think we ought to change it. 1, we know that the one market where the premiums are going through the roof is the individual marketplace, where small business people and others are facing skyrocketing premiums. What percentage of America fits into that group? Six percent. They are not being treated fairly under the current system. We have to change it. We have to make healthcare premiums affordable. Every Republican plan brought before us raises those premium costs.  2, we don't address the costs of prescription drugs in the Affordable Care Health insurance companies tell us that is driving premium costs more than any single item. Blue Cross Blue Shield in Illinois pays more for pharmaceuticals--prescription drugs--each year than they pay for inpatient hospital care. There is nothing that is controlling these costs. We should; shouldn't we?  Shouldn't we agree that, if you happen to live in some part of the country where you don't have health insurance available in the marketplace, at a very minimum you will have a public option? What do I mean by that? A plan that looks like Medicare, a plan that isn't driven by profit, but a plan that provides the basic services. We can do that. We have Medicare Advantage programs. We have other options. We want to make sure that is available to every You choose it, if you wish.  Those three things right off the top I would include as part of what we can do on a bipartisan basis--Democrats and Take the tax cut off the table. Take slashing Medicaid off the table. Take rewards to health insurance companies off the table. Focus on helping the families, businesses, and individuals in America who need this basic protection.  We are going to go into this mystery vote tomorrow. We have been elected[[Page S4142]]to the U.There aren't many people in history who have had this honor. What we are doing tomorrow does not bring honor to the  Considering a bill that has not been written, published, and disclosed to the American people is just wrong. Considering a bill that has never had a committee hearing is unfair. Considering a bill that I am sure will have many flaws and weaknesses is reckless.  That is what we face this week. How important is it? It may be the most important vote we cast this year as far as I am concerned. There is nothing more important in life than the peace of mind in knowing you have health insurance at that critical moment when you or somebody in your family desperately needs help.  There is not going to be a minor amendment offered on the floor that will straighten out the situation.  I know my colleagues are here to speak. I will close by saying this. If you come to watch this bill, whatever it is, brought before the Senate in the next few days, it will not be a moment when you think better of this place. It is a process called vote-arama. Here is what it means. You put an amendment on the floor and file it with the clerk. They read the amendment. Then you have 2 minutes--1 minute for and 1 minute against--and you vote.  Really? We are going to take the healthcare system of America and put it through that kind of a process, where we don't even have time to sit and measure the impact of one amendment over the other? The Congressional Budget Office will not have its analysis. So it is really going to be a free skate. We will be up here trying our best to vote yes or no on these amendments if we proceed to the bill.  Here is the good news. If 3 Republicans--3 out of 52--will step up and say: Stop, we can do better as a Senate, that will be the end of this terrible endeavor. We will send the measure back to committee. We will have Democrats and Republicans sit down. They will go through the regular process. They will produce a bill. The public will get to read it. They will go through expert testimony. Then we will have an amendment process. Then they will bring it to the floor, and we will do the same. We will consider it carefully. We will use our best judgment and try to come up with something on a bipartisan basis that is a credit to  Instead, what we are going to face, if the majority leader has his way tomorrow, is a process that does not serve this country well and does not bring honor to the  I urge my Republican colleagues, three of them at least, to step up.

Mr.Speaker, I am honored to recognize National Police Week 2017 and to join with the millions of proud Americans throughout our country to thank our law enforcement members for their continued service and sacrifice.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-16-pt1-PgH4217.txt,1797,MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 1460,2017.0,16.0,July
14154,topic-id,881,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about a critical subject too often overlooked by It is the Federal debt and our deficit.  It is no secret that our national debt will soon surpass $20 trillion. To provide some context for that figure, $20 trillion represents the largest amount of debt ever owed by any nation in history. This fact, coupled with the fast-approaching end to our fiscal year, will leave Congress facing an unavoidable debt debate.  Our looming debt and deficit are two of our country's most urgent challenges, but the legislative branch does not treat them like the crises they really are. Since January alone, Congress has added $284 billion to the debt over the next 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office recently projected that if Congress continues on its current path, deficits will increase dramatically over the next decade. Specifically, by 2027, the deficit will grow from 3.6 percent of the Nation's GDP to 5.2 percent of the Nation's GDP, totaling $1.4 trillion. Yet, as the National Debt Clock continues to click upward toward $20 trillion, the Federal Government continues to spend money that it simply does not have.  If Congress continues to legislate in this current state of denial, one day soon, we may well wake up to discover that the financial markets have declared that the United States is no longer a good bet. We must also remember that Congress's failure to address this fiscal train wreck today will force our children and grandchildren to deal with its consequences tomorrow. Unless Congress can get this fundamental issue under control, nothing else will matter very much.  There ought to be an option that allows taxpayers to take matters into their own hands. That is why today I am reintroducing the Debt Buy-Down The Debt Buy-Down Act is a commonsense bill that allows taxpayers to rein in the national debt with the simple check of a box. If passed, this bill would require the IRS to include an option on individuals' tax forms that allow them to voluntarily designate up to 10 percent of their tax liabilities to go specifically toward reducing the national debt. The bill would then require Congress to reduce Federal spending by an amount equivalent to that designated by the taxpayers. If Congress fails to make these necessary spending reductions designated by taxpayers, then across-the-board spending cuts would be imposed.  This is not a good way to reduce the Federal debt. The better way would be to make priorities as we consider our spending bills, but it is better than just letting these spending bills go and doing nothing. We ought to use a scalpel and go in and treat these programs as we should and make sure they are doing what they were intended to. If we cannot do that, then we need to take dramatic measures to get our debt and deficit under control.  The Debt Buy-Down Act would protect Social Security benefits, benefits for those in the uniformed services, and payments for net interest on the national debt from being included in any of these across-the-board cuts.  Simply put, in the absence of responsible Federal budget solutions, this bill allows taxpayers to take matters into their own hands. In 2014, Americans paid over $1.37 trillion in individual income taxes. If every one of these individuals had contributed 10 percent of their tax liability, Congress would have been required to have cut $137 billion in spending. While $137 billion does not solve our $20 trillion debt problem, it is certainly a good place to start.  Congress has been so desensitized to the growing national debt that the word ``trillion'' does not even raise alarm bells anymore. In fact, after I introduced the Debt Buy-Down Act in 2010, I began sending a weekly, pun-laden press release to help put the then-$13 trillion national debt--just in 2010--into perspective. It was called ``So Just How Broke Are We?'' Maybe it is time to bring it back.  So 7 years and $7 trillion in added debt later, just how broke are we today? We are so broke that, with our $20 trillion national debt, we could book 570,000 trips to the Moon on It is a pretty expensive excursion, but we could do it 570,000 times. We are so broke that, with our $20 trillion national debt, we could buy every seat at Chase Field in Phoenix for the next 22 million Arizona Diamondbacks games. Of course, that is just a ballpark figure, but it is the last pun. I promise. We are so broke that with our $20 trillion national debt we could buy 20 billion tickets to see  My love of bad puns and jokes aside, instead of thinking about how $20 trillion could be spent, maybe we ought to start thinking about how $20 trillion could be saved.  That is why I am calling on my colleagues to support the Debt Buy-Down Act and empower taxpayers to reduce the national debt. Just think, a simple check of a box would help save billions of dollars and preserve the strength of our national economy. It would save future generations from the consequences of our crippling national debt.  At any rate, I hope this bill makes like the debt and grows a lot of interest.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgS3998-2.txt,1633,REMEMBERING SERGEANT FIRST CLASS MARVIN DALE HOLLINGSWORTH,2017.0,13.0,July
14275,topic-id,664,"Mr.President, immigration enforcement is one of the Federal Government's most essential responsibilities. It is also one of the most debated and rightly so. Those of us in this body need to ensure that Federal immigration laws secure our borders from criminal and terrorist threats and facilitate effective interior enforcement to keep citizens safe.  At the same time, our laws must promote a system of legal immigration that encourages economic growth and opportunity, especially in border communities like those in my home State of Arizona, but while we debate these policies on the Senate floor, local police officers and sheriffs around the country are serving on the frontlines of immigration enforcement. These men and women put their lives on the line every time they go out on patrol. For them, immigration policy is not a hypothetical exercise, it is part of the day in and day out reality of serving in law enforcement. Throughout the country, local officers increasingly find themselves coming in contact with individuals who, after being apprehended for the commission of a crime, are determined to be in the country illegally. This is especially common in border States like  Once it is determined an individual in their custody is in the country illegally, that information is relayed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE can then send a request to local officials with instructions to hold that individual for up to 48 hours so they can be transferred to Federal custody. This is called a detainer request. The partnership between law enforcement authorities at all levels of government leverages vital information and resources in order to keep dangerous criminals off the streets. The Federal Government has no better partners in this effort than State and local law enforcement agencies from  Despite the critical role these entities play in assisting their Federal partners with immigration enforcement, current Federal policy leaves them exposed with the threat of costly litigation. That is because third-party groups that oppose detention have threatened local agencies that choose to comply with valid detainer requests. They are threatened with lawsuits. Using punitive legal action to punish law enforcement for good-faith efforts to keep people safe is simply wrong.  We can have this policy debate without jeopardizing public safety and the ability of local law enforcement officers to do their job. That is why I am introducing the Support Local Law Enforcement Detainer Indemnity This bill will require the Department of Homeland Security to protect State and local law enforcement entities from lawsuits that uphold valid detainer requests from This is called indemnification. It would allow officers to fulfill their law enforcement responsibilities without second-guessing whether to keep potentially dangerous criminal aliens in custody.  Reforming our Nation's immigration policies is no easy task, let me tell you. It is slow, frustrating work in the Senate, but as we continue the debate, local law enforcement shouldn't be left to shoulder the burden as a result of Washington's failure to secure our borders and implement a workable enforcement policy.  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation that will give State and local law enforcement the certainty of knowing the Federal Government has their back.  I also thank local sheriffs across the State of Arizona who are really shouldering this burden and who came to me with this issue. They want to keep their community safe. They want to do what is right. It pains them to have to release someone they know is dangerous, but they can't expose themselves and their counties to the litigation that would come if something like this legislation is not put in place. So this is a response to a very real problem out there.  I thank those like Sheriff Dannels, Cochise County, and Sheriff Mascher, Yavapai County, Sheriff Clark of Navajo County, Sheriff Wilmot of Yuma County, and many others who have been working on this issue, work on the frontlines, and do a lot of work that we are very appreciative of in                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-04-pt1-PgS2775-2.txt,1633,MOTION TO DISCHARGE--S.J.

14260,topic-id,1633,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about the effort by Republicans in the majority to rip apart our healthcare system and jeopardize the protections for people with preexisting conditions and to throw millions of people off their health insurance.  Now, it is deeply troubling at this point that with less than 24 hours until the expected vote, we don't even know which version of repeal the Republicans hope to pass. Do Republicans support the Better Care Reconciliation Act--the bill that according to the Congressional Budget Office, would cause 22 million more Americans to become uninsured, which would drive up healthcare costs and dismantle the Medicaid Program? Do they support the Cruz amendment, which would bring back junk insurance plans that offer virtually no protection and drive up out-of-pocket costs for vital services or will they rally behind their backup option, a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with nothing--that is, nothing--an approach that would add 32 million more Americans to the ranks of the uninsured and cause average premiums in the nongroup market to double or will it be something else entirely? We don't know.  This is reckless. This is irresponsible. The American people deserve better.  Let's be clear. A vote for the motion to proceed is a vote to move forward with conceivably any one of these bills, and all of these bills are terrible. They jeopardize lifesaving care and treatment for millions of American families, especially those with preexisting conditions. They tear apart our safety net and give tax breaks to powerful corporations.  Let me remind my Republican colleagues that a vote in support of the motion to proceed will have real-world consequences for your constituents who may lose their health insurance. Perhaps these are people you have met; people, many of whom may be losing sleep out of justified fear that their children or their parents, their loved ones or they themselves are at risk of losing their healthcare.  I have talked to so many people in my State about these dangerous proposals. There is Kristi is a young farmer in Greater Minnesota whose husband and two kids relied on Medicaid to access care when their farm was struggling.  There is Sandy, whose mom is in a nursing home and who doesn't know how she will pay for the round-the-clock care her mother needs if Medicaid, which covers more than 6 in 10 nursing home residents nationwide, scales back coverage.  Then, this is Sheri, who said that if it weren't for Medicaid, her son Brandon, who has cerebral palsy and hydrocephalus, probably wouldn't be here. I met I think he is 18 or 19. He was born 15 weeks early, in Minneapolis, about a pound and a half. They took him to the Mayo Clinic in The Mayo Clinic said: We can't handle him, so they sent him back to Minneapolis to Gillette Children's Hospital, which could. They told Brandon's parents: He is going to require $1 million in care the first day to save his life.  Brandon has had, I think, 37, 38 surgeries. He spoke at a meeting we had on Medicaid a couple of weeks ago in Minnesota, and he stood--he had a walker. He had just gotten an A-minus in his first college course. He was actually, in a way, the last person in the room I was worried about because his resilience--this guy, this kid is going to be amazing. I don't think he would be here if we didn't have the kind of Medicaid we have and the kind of Medicaid my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are talking about limiting in a way that will affect so many people I have met across my  This is one of those votes that will go down in history. It is one of those votes that all of us will be answering for wherever we go for the rest of our lives.  The former Republican Senator from Minnesota, David Durenberger, outlined some of the reasons Senators should not vote for this consequential legislation in an excellent op-ed, a piece he wrote, and it was in USA TODAY today. Senator Durenberger--again, a Republican from Minnesota and someone whom I talk to a lot about healthcare--wrote this piece, saying resist the bullying, don't vote for a mystery healthcare bill.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Senator Durenberger's op-ed.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Former GOP Senator: Resist the Don't Vote For a Mystery                             Health Care Bill     There will be no do-overs on this. Take it from me: a no vote          this week is the only one that will be defensible in the          years to come.       What do you do when you are a U.senator and the      president wants you to vote for a health care bill that could      radically change health care?       You ask questions. You hold hearings. You understand what      it would mean to your constituents. You listen to those who      know the system. And when it doesn't add up, you vote against      it.       The year was 1979, and I was a freshman Republican senator      from Inflation was driving the already high costs      of health care through the roof. President Carter wanted to      use Medicare and Medicaid to limit increases in hospital      budgets in the face of rapidly inflating costs.       Ultimately, I decided to vote against it as it would end up      hurting the people of my state and was inconsistent with my      beliefs. And then, after the vote, we--Democrats and      Republicans--launched an effort to learn how best to change      the cost curve of the entire health system by focusing on how      we pay for       This week, the Senate once again is set to vote on a health      care bill that will radically change how people get coverage      and who can afford their care. But unlike normal times,      Senators, you are being asked to approve a Motion to Proceed      to a vote:       Without knowing what will be in the bill.       Without knowing what the non-partisan Congressional Budget      Office will say about the impact of major amendments and the      final bill on coverage and premiums.       With full knowledge that the Senate parliamentarian, who      rules on what can and can't be allowed in a budget bill, has      said that the Senate must remove provisions intended to      prevent an insurance market death spiral       Without knowing the details of the secret state Medicaid      waivers the Trump administration insists will make the bill      work.       Without knowing how your own state budget will be impacted.       Without knowing how you will defend the provisions you will      only learn about later, including the payoffs and other      things that will be sneaked into the bill at the last minute.       Without even knowing which bill you are being asked to vote      on, what the defining amendments will be and how much time      you will have when being pressed for a final vote you'll be      stuck with.       A vote in these circumstances will rightly provoke anger      and distrust unlikely to abate. Take it from me: A no vote on      the Motion to Proceed this week is the only one that will be      defensible in the years to come.       I have had my arm twisted by the best of them--presidents      and Senate leaders and party whips alike. I know how      uncomfortable it can be. Usually, they were able to attempt a      convincing argument about what is good about the bill for the      country or my state. But I never would have voted for      something so far reaching without knowing the answer to all      the questions above.       Never in all my years did I experience the level of      bullying we see today. It doesn't look good in Minnesota, and      I suspect it doesn't look any better in your state.       I know that some of you ran for office vowing to repeal the      Affordable Care Act, hoping to improve coverage and decrease      costs. As public opinion polls tell us, voters do not believe      this bill does the job. The good news is we haven't run out      of time to ask questions and to work together to fix what      needs fixing if we take the time to return to regular order      and hold hearings.       Seven years ago, Democrats supported a bill far from      Democratic orthodoxy. It did not provide for single payer,      nor Medicare for all. Not even a public option. They handed      Republicans a chance to build a health system that plays to      our unique strengths as a nation, not to our weaknesses.       As someone whose efforts earned the support of both      Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.Bush to reduce      health care costs without leaving anyone behind, I know our      party can do much better. But it should be obvious to all of      you listening to your constituents that voting on this      hodgepodge of mysterious bills is not the way.       Because there are no do-overs. The vote for the Motion To      Proceed is likely a vote for final passage, and the House      clearly stands ready to pass the Senate bill unchanged.       There is no making good on all of the issues later. Once      the funds for health coverage are gone, it will take new tax      increases to replace them. And what's the likelihood that      will happen?       There will be no hiding this vote. Let me assure you, as      the official scorekeeper, the[[Page S4150]]     CBO will eventually score the entire bill, and that's what      your vote will be evaluated on.       For those who worry about re-election politics, I can      assure you that going into a campaign confident that you've      done what's best for every one of your constituents, not just      for those who want to stick you with a stale slogan, is the      best medicine you'll ever have prescribed for you.

14261,topic-id,1345,"Mr.President, there aren't many votes like this in a Senator's career so let's just lay this out. If you support the vote tomorrow, the following are some of the specific consequences that could follow and in many cases would follow.  First, it is a vote that would open debate on bills that would undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions. This could happen in one of two ways. This vote could open debate on the potential Cruz amendment, which would allow insurance companies, as long as they offer ACA-compliant plans on the exchanges, to also sell bare-bones, skimpy plans outside of the exchanges, with almost no consumer protections. Under this amendment, insurers would be allowed to deny coverage and charge higher rates to women, older adults, and individuals with preexisting conditions. To my Republican colleagues, I ask: Do you know someone who is pregnant? Do you know someone who has diabetes? Asthma? Depression? Cancer? Multiple sclerosis? Substance use disorders? Arthritis? Dementia? Sleep apnea? Parkinson's? All of these people could be denied coverage under the Cruz amendment, just as they were prior to the  The Cruz amendment will also bring back annual and lifetime limits, coverage exclusions, and more.  When I was campaigning in 2008, and I would go around Minnesota--cafes, VFW halls, bars--there would be a flyer up for a family who had gone bankrupt for someone who had gotten sick. This would bring back those annual limits, those lifetime limits. Do we really want to go back to that?  The Cruz amendment is intended to deceive. The amendment is designed to make people think it would lower premiums since it would allow insurers to offer stripped-down plans that don't comply with the ACA's consumer protections, but what it actually does is skyrocket the price of insurance for people with preexisting conditions like epilepsy, Crohn's disease, and stroke, while eviscerating the quality of insurance for those who don't yet need, or know they need, such coverage.  In fact, America's Health Insurance Plans, which is the national political advocacy and trade association of companies that sell health insurance to Americans, and the BlueCross BlueShield Association have said this proposal is ``simply unworkable in any form and would undermine protections for those with preexisting medical conditions, increase premiums and lead to widespread terminations of coverage for people currently enrolled in the individual market.''  The fact is, these high-deductible, bare-bones plans are a dangerous rip-off, and many people will not even realize what garbage insurance they have until it is too late.  Here is the thing. Even if the Cruz amendment were removed from the bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act would still undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions. That is because the bill would allow, and even incentivize, States to waive ACA protections like the guarantee of coverage for basic essential health benefits.  If you are allowed to offer plans that don't cover basic services like mental health, prescription drugs, and maternity care, then you have a backdoor channel to charge people who need those services more than those who don't. Not only that, States that seek waivers and end the guarantee of essential health benefits bring us right back into the world of annual and lifetime limits--a world where your care would end not because your doctor said so but because the insurance company would stop paying for it. This could be true even for people who get their health insurance through their employer. In fact, even if you work in a State that hasn't taken this waiver, your employer could have gotten their health insurance from a State that had.  In short, with or without the Cruz amendment, the Better Care Reconciliation Act breaks President Trump's promise to protect people with preexisting conditions.  Second, yes, tomorrow is a vote to end Medicaid as we know it. Medicaid is a lifeline, providing health insurance and access to care for more than 70 million That is about one in every five It includes seniors, pregnant women, people with disabilities, families with children.  Senator Klobuchar was right about this being a lottery. Any of us can be in an accident. Any of us can be diagnosed at any time. Any of us can have a child who is diagnosed at any time with something unexpected.  Healthcare really should be a right. I don't understand people who say: I am healthy. My kids are healthy. Why should I suffer? I am the victim here. Nothing has happened to me. Why should we have a system where I am paying for people with preexisting conditions?  Really? Is that the attitude my Republican colleagues are taking? Because that seems to be the logic.  Medicaid had been a bedrock of our healthcare system since 1965. It was and is a Federal promise made to States and to all Americans over 50 years ago. And most of all, Medicaid works. But the Better Care Reconciliation Act would gut it. It would end the program's coverage guarantee, leaving States to either roll back coverage or slash other vital programs in order to meet their citizens' needs.  Finally, a vote to support the motion to proceed to this bill is a vote to drive up people's total healthcare costs. The Republicans' plans decrease or eliminate the ACA's tax credits, which help people afford their insurance--that was part of the construct--and it dramatically hikes premiums for older Americans, although ones younger than I--I am now 66, but from 50 to 64. It drives up deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs that many people have to pay in order to receive care.  Americans don't like these proposals. In fact, new polling shows that only 17 percent of Americans think they and their families will be better off under the Republican plans. That is 17 percent.  What Americans want is for Republicans and Democrats to work together to build on and improve the Affordable Care So why do my Republican colleagues continue to push forward on these terrible bills? It doesn't have to be this way. There is another option. This body can reject the wrongheaded and ill-thought-out proposals and allow for an open, bipartisan process under regular order where we can work together and do the things the American people actually sent us here to do--expand coverage, lower costs, and improve care. We should have bipartisan hearings where we hear from nonpartisan expert witnesses about the challenges facing the Affordable Care Act so we can work together to fix what isn't working in the  What we do know from the last few years is that coverage matters. This is important. Coverage matters. Just having coverage matters. Healthcare isn't really about these big, heroic emergencies. A person's health is about some of those events, but what it is really about is having coverage and getting continuous care throughout your life.  Rigorous studies have shown that for every 300 to 800 adults who get coverage, 1 life is saved per year. Research summarized by Atul Gawande and his colleagues in a recent New England Journal of Medicine piece finds that health coverage expansions have improved people's access to care, improved their financial security, meaning fewer bankruptcies and medical bills sent to collections, improved chronic disease care and outcomes, improved self-reported health, and more. Overall, health insurance has been shown to help Americans live longer, healthier lives. Now is not the time to roll back our progress.  I urge my Republican colleagues to think about what a vote for proceeding on this terrible legislation would mean for the American people.  Paul Wellstone said that politics isn't about winning; it isn't about money; it isn't about power; it is about improving people's lives. Our constituents sent us here to improve their lives. So I urge my Republican colleagues to vote no. Let's work together to fix what needs to be fixed in the Affordable Care Act and do all we can to[[Page S4151]]make sure people have access to affordable, high-quality healthcare when they need it.

14010,topic-id,1585,"Mr.President, I take the floor to strenuously argue against[[Page S3425]]the proposition being pushed by Senators Paul, Murphy, and others to deny arms sales of about $500 million to the Kingdom of Saudi The package they are trying to exclude from the $110 billion arms deal is precision-guided munitions that would be used by the F-15s, a package of Joint Direct Attack Munitions, Paveway laser-guided bombs for Saudi Tornado and Typhoon aircraft. The bottom line is, the package we are talking about are precision weapons the Saudi Air Force and military could use in operations against Iran's proxy in Yemen and other threats that continue to plague us.  The flaws of the Saudi Government are real. They are known to me. My friends on the other side, particularly Senator Paul, constantly put Saudi Arabia and Iran on the same footing. I think that is a very unwise analysis.  To suggest that Saudi Arabia is as bad as Iran is just missing the point, big time. The Iranian bureaucracy is the most destabilizing force in the They have aggressively pursued military action through proxies and have been directly involved in military actions in Iran's efforts to dominate Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and now Yemen have to be pushed back.  Here is what Secretary Mattis said about this proposal when I asked him the question: How would Iran view passage of this proposal limiting precision-guided weapons to the Saudis by Congress? He stated: ``I believe Iran would be appreciative of us not selling these weapons to Saudi Arabia.''  That is pretty direct. Iran would be really happy.  On September 21, 2016, 71 U.Senators supported a tank sale to Saudi The vote was 71 to 27. In other words, 71 U.Senators rejected Rand Paul's proposal to stop the sale of tanks. I would argue that a tank is not nearly as much of a precision weapon as the weapons we are talking about here to be given to the Saudi Air If we are worried about collateral damage in Yemen, I understand the concern. Precision weapons would help that cause, not hurt it.  We have to understand whom we are dealing with in We are dealing with Saudi Arabia has a border with The Iranians are backing a force called the Houthis to bring down a pro-Western government in From a Saudi perspective, everywhere you look you see Iran encroaching throughout the  The bureaucracy in Iran is the biggest threat to the world order, and that is saying a lot, given the way the world is. I say that with confidence because what Iran is doing is trying to destabilize the Mideast in an unprecedented fashion. Our Arab allies are tired of it, and now is the time to stand with them--with their imperfections--against Iran and their hostilities.  This $500 million chunk of the $110 billion weapons sale is absolutely essential to the Saudi Air Force to get these weapons, not only to minimize casualties but to win the fight against the aggressive nature of Iran in Yemen and other places.  I don't know where we are going with Iran, but the President has said the current nuclear deal is absolutely a terrible deal. He is right. This deal locks in a march toward a nuclear weapon by the Iranians if they don't cheat. They don't have to cheat. In 10 or 15 years, the agreement allows them to enrich and reprocess without limitation, so this deal has to be replaced.  I hope we don't go to war with anyone, but if we go to war, I want allies that are capable to help us in the fight. We complain about our Arab allies not doing enough. When they want to do more, we say no to them. Guess what. No wonder people believe America is an unreliable partner. We say one thing and do another.  To my Democratic colleagues: You were OK with voting to help President Obama increase the capability of the Saudi Army at a time when it was in our national security interest. What has changed between September 21 and today? What geopolitical situation has changed that all of a sudden Iran is no longer the threat they were in September of last year and Saudi Arabia is less reliable? Nothing, other than the election of Donald I have been a critic of Donald Trump--President Trump--when I thought it was necessary for the good of the country, but all I can say is, this wholesale defection by Democrats really is disturbing. It is undermining, I think, our national security interests when it comes to containing It is sending the worst possible signal we could be sending to our Arab allies at a time when we need them the most. I don't question people's motives; I question their judgment.  Here is my problem. I had no problem helping President Obama because I believe Saudi is the bulwark against Iranian expansion. Our allies in Saudi Arabia are imperfect, but they do share intelligence with us, they are in the fight, and we need to help them because it is in our interest to help them. You had absolutely no problem helping them when it was President Obama's idea. Everything Trump you seem to be against. That is absolutely disappointing, and quite frankly despicable.  To my Republican colleagues: Rand Paul has been consistent. I respect his consistency. I just completely disagree with him. If you think containing Iran and keeping them from toppling Yemen, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon is not in our national interest, you are making a huge mistake. The last thing we want is the Iranian Ayatollah to march through the Mideast and start spreading his form of radical Shi'ism in the backyards of all of our Arab allies.  So I cannot urge this body more to reject this ill-conceived idea. It is $500 million out of a $110 billion package. It is the kind of weapons that will matter on the battlefield. It will lessen civilian casualties, which is a noble goal, and will also give capabilities to the Saudis to more effectively contain Iran that is marching through Yemen, through their proxies, the  General Mattis--Secretary Mattis has it right. Iran would be appreciative of our not selling those weapons to Saudi  We are going to sanction Iran this week, I hope, for what they have done outside of the nuclear agreement. Since the nuclear agreement was passed, they have humiliated our sailors. They captured them on the high seas and humiliated them. I don't remember Saudi Arabia doing that. They are test-firing missiles in the violation of a U.resolution that could destroy Israel and one day reach us and our allies throughout the Mideast and They are spreading their form of radical Shi'ism all through the world, all through the The money they received from the Iranian nuclear deal is not going to build roads, bridges, and hospitals, it is increasing the lethality of the IRG and other Iranian combatant units.  What we are trying to do and what President Trump is trying to do is give our allies the ability to contain the threat which is in our interest. Sanctioning Iran and denying Saudi Arabia the weapons they need to defend themselves and others against Iran is pretty inconsistent.  There is a military necessity for these weapons. It will change the equation on the battlefield. It is in our interest that Iran lose this effort to take over Yemen and destabilize the Mideast at large. You have to remember that these are the same people--the Iranians--who built lethal IEDs and injected them into Iraq--IEDs that killed many, many American soldiers. This is the same regime that took over our Embassy years ago, humiliated our sailors, and chants ``death to America and Israel'' on a regular basis. Yet here we are, sitting as a legislative body, contemplating our not helping an ally who is willing to fight the threat that is posed by Iran in the All I can say is that on September 21, 2016, almost every Democrat saw this as a good move to help Saudi  Now almost all of you are voting against an arms package that is more necessary today than it was in 2016. The only change is that we have a new President whom you hate.  I was not a big fan of President Obama's, but when I thought it was right, I stood with him. President Trump is right to increase the capability of the Saudi military to deal with the Iranian aggression. There is no bigger threat to the Middle East and America, I believe, than this Iranian regime in the hands of an ayatollah who is really a religious  So I hope you will vote for what is best for America, which is to empower our allies to contain threats that we commonly enjoy. We enjoy the experience of being in the crosshairs of the[[Page S3426]]They want to destroy the royal family in Saudi They want to destroy Israel, and they want to destroy us. So the idea that we are not going to help an ally that is willing to fight is just inconceivable, and the idea that we are going to vote no for an arms package because Trump is President--and all of you over there voted yes before--is disappointing.

I rise today to join my colleagues and once again speak out against the Senate Republican healthcare bill and the dangerous impact it would have on the people of my home State of New Hampshire and Americans from all walks of life.  This week, Senate Republicans are pressing ahead with plans that would increase health insurance costs, give Americans worse health insurance, and strip away health coverage from millions of Yet, despite statements that a vote will come tomorrow or in a matter of days, Senate Republican leadership will not tell even their own Members what proposal we will vote on, let alone hold a hearing on the impact of the bill.  As version after version of this bill has emerged from behind closed doors, somehow each time it is even worse than the last, and every version would be devastating for people across New These bills would lead to higher costs for worse coverage. In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said we would see even higher deductibles than the ones we already see. This proposal would decimate the Medicaid Program and end Medicaid expansion. It would take coverage away from millions. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that between 22 and 32 million people would lose coverage, depending on which bill we vote on.  We know that rising healthcare costs are squeezing hard-working people across I have made clear to my colleagues across the aisle that I am willing to work with anyone who is serious about working together to build and improve on the Affordable Care Act, to lower costs, but unfortunately these Senate Republican bills would do just the opposite.  Over the past months, I have heard from people all across New They have shared their most personal stories, their frustrations, and their fears about what will happen if this bill becomes law.  Last month, Senator Shaheen and I held an emergency hearing in Concord to hear from our constituents about how proposals put forward by Senate Republicans would impact them. We held this emergency hearing at 2 p.m. on a Friday afternoon in the summer, with just a day's notice. Yet hundreds of people showed up, and more than 50 people got up and shared their most personal stories about the importance of healthcare, of how they have benefited from the important protections provided under current law, including maternity care, prescription drug coverage, and coverage for substance use disorder services.  One of those Granite Staters was a woman named Maura from Exeter, Maura told us that the Affordable Care Act has been a ``financial life-saver'' for her family. She explained to us how, when she signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, her premiums dropped by $750 a month because of subsidies. As Maura described it, she and her family were able to put the extra $750 each month toward childcare, food, and their mortgage.  On another recent visit to Granite State Independent Living in Concord, a nonprofit that provides a range of assisted-living services for Granite Staters, I also heard about the importance of Medicaid from a Granite Stater named Terry has physical disabilities and requires the assistance of personal care aides, who are paid through They help her with daily tasks, such as getting up in the morning and getting dressed and preparing meals. Terry said that without the support from Medicaid, she wouldn't be able to go to work, to her job, or do basic tasks, such as shopping on her own. Without Medicaid, she would need to burden her family in order to complete everyday, basic activities, and she wouldn't be able to go to work. Terry fears that this support could be taken away under this legislation, and she is right. It could be. She said that given the cuts to Medicaid and the provisions in TrumpCare, she ``wouldn't get anywhere near what I need to survive.''  Finally, I have heard from advocates and those in recovery from substance use disorders about how vital Medicaid expansion has been in helping them get the support they need in order to get well and back on their feet. In fact, those on the front lines of this epidemic have said that Medicaid expansion is the 1 tool we have in order to combat the heroin, fentanyl, and opioid crisis, which is the most pressing public health and safety challenge facing my  A few weeks ago, I visited Goodwin Community Health in Somersworth and heard from a woman named At one point in her life, as a result of substance misuse disorder, Elizabeth was homeless and she had lost custody of her son. Elizabeth is now in recovery, and she works at the SOS Recovery Community Organization in Rochester, helping others get the support they need.  She said that she owes her recovery to Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act and that holding on to Medicaid is essential because without it, many people who are in the throes of addiction would not be able to find help.  Elizabeth said:       I just really want to emphasize the ripple effect that      recovery has on the community. It's not just because I'm in      recovery that I can help somebody else. Everyone around me is      impacted. When we talk about the recovery revolution, it's      about how everyone in the community is affected when someone      gets into recovery.  Elizabeth is right. People who can get healthcare can get healthy, and that has a tremendous ripple effect. It lifts us all. It makes us productive and strong.  At the heart of all of these stories--Maura, Terry, and Elizabeth--and the stories that I hear all over my State is the basic fact that our communities, our families, and our entire country are better off when we give more people a chance to participate, to get the support they need, to live their lives with dignity, to contribute to our economy, and to thrive.  Unfortunately, if TrumpCare becomes law, the progress we have made will be lost, insurance costs will rise, and millions of people will lose the care that they need.

14155,topic-id,1048,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss an epidemic that is sweeping our From big cities to small towns, communities across our country have been ravaged by drug addiction and the multiple problems caused by it. Opioid overdoses have quadrupled since 1999 and were responsible for over 33,000 deaths in 2015 alone.  We have all seen the dangers posed by the overprescription of highly addictive prescription opioids. According to the CDC, addiction to prescription opioid painkillers is the primary gateway to heroin abuse. In fact, Michael Botticelli, President Obama's drug czar, testified in my committee last year that people who are addicted and abuse prescription opioids are 40 times more likely to abuse heroin.  Almost all of the heroin sold on the streets of the United States today enters the country illegally from It is trafficked by drug cartels into our communities through our porous southwest border.  It is a problem that continues to grow. Even as heroin has increased, it has remained available and affordable because increased production in Mexico has ensured a reliable supply of low-cost heroin. As long as there is a demand, the enormous profit potential of the drug trade will ensure that there is a sufficient supply. A kilogram of heroin can be produced in Mexico for around $5,000. It can be sold to dealers for as much as $80,000--a 1,500 percent profit.  At another committee hearing, we learned that heroin has significantly dropped in price. In 1981, the nationwide average price was $3,260 per gram of pure heroin. Today, it is between $100 and $150 per gram. That translates into as little as $10 for one hit, making heroin a very affordable and very destructive addiction. While prices have dropped, the potency has increased. Heroin sold in Wisconsin has increased from 5 percent purity in the 1980s to somewhere between 20 percent and 80 percent purity today.  As awful as that reality is, imported heroin is only one front in our fight against opioids. Another equally dangerous front is synthetic or man-made opioids--particularly fentanyl and its analogs--which are now commonly mixed into the heroin sold in our communities. Since fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, it only takes a minuscule amount of fentanyl--just 2 milligrams, less than one one-thousandth of the weight of a penny--to be potentially lethal.  Even more alarming, we are now beginning to see carfentanil, often used to sedate elephants, also being blended into heroin and fentanyl on the streets. Carfentanil is 100 times more potent than fentanyl and 10,000 times more potent than morphine. A dose of carfentanil the size of a grain of salt can lead to a deadly overdose.[[Page S4000]]  Just as we are seeing an increase in drugs coming across our southwest border, man-made opioids are on the rise as well. The profit potential of fentanyl is even more staggering than heroin's. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, 25 grams of fentanyl costs approximately $810 to produce and has a market value of $800,000.  In 2013, 3,097 people died from overdoses involving synthetic opioids. Just 1 year later, we lost 5,544 people to that same drug--a 79-percent increase in just 1 year. My home State of Wisconsin has been particularly hard hit by the introduction of fentanyl and its analogs.  In April, 2016, I met Lauri Lauri is from Oconomowoc, WI, a suburb in She lost her son Archie to a heroin overdose.  Here is a picture of He doesn't exactly look like a heroin addict, does he? Archie was just 19 years old when he died. He began using marijuana during his freshman year in high school and discovered opioids the summer after his high school graduation. After overdosing multiple times and trying to quit, Archie had stayed sober for 77 days before he relapsed again and finally overdosed on May 15, 2014.  In Archie's memory, Lauri started a foundation called Saving Others For Archie, or Her organization raises awareness throughout Wisconsin of the dangers of drug abuse. It offers support for families battling addiction. Lauri is constantly being contacted by and providing comfort to other parents coping with similar tragedies.  Lauri's story is moving, and I applaud her for being such a strong advocate for those struggling with addiction. Unfortunately, her tragedy is not unique. The scourge of addiction and overdose deaths has devastated thousands of families, including my own.  In January, 2016, I lost a nephew to a fentanyl overdose. The legislation I am introducing this afternoon is in memory of my nephew, of Archie, and of all of the families in Wisconsin and throughout America who have lost loved ones in this epidemic.  Today I am proud to introduce the Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act, or SOFA Sharing an acronym with Lauri Badura's organization, the SOFA Act will give law enforcement a set of enhanced tools to combat the opioid epidemic by closing a loophole that criminal drug manufacturers are exploiting.  Fentanyl is a synthetic, or man-made, opioid--the result of complex chemistry that brings together multiple building blocks. Criminal chemists need change only one small piece of the chemical bond to be one step ahead of the law. The fentanyl analogs on the street today serve no known medical purpose and are contributing to the alarming overdose rates throughout the country. My legislation would classify these analogs under schedule I and give the DEA tools to quickly schedule additional fentanyl analogs as they are identified in our communities.  This body took a step forward last Congress when we passed the CARA legislation to improve addiction treatment programs throughout the United We can now take another important step forward by providing law enforcement with the tools it needs to get these dangerous synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and carfentanil, off the streets.

Tim has testified at a committee field hearing in Pewaukee, and he participated in an opioid roundtable in Milwaukee I convened in His leadership in Wisconsin and on this issue has been invaluable.

14266,topic-id,2903,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin and also my colleague from Their words have been very powerful.  I also rise to talk about healthcare. We are told in the Senate that tomorrow we vote, but we don't know what we will be voting on. We will bring up a House bill that, by virtually every account, is not going to be the bill that we will be voting on, but we don't yet know which version of healthcare we will be voting on if we proceed to the debate.  It is like a three-card monte game. There are all sorts of different versions that are out there on the table. One version would take health insurance away from 22 million people, one from 25 million, and one from 32 million, and we are not being told which one we will vote on.  When I was a kid, there was a TV show we used to watch, ``Let's Make a Deal.'' One of the features of the show was this: What is behind door 1, and what is behind door 2? The contestants would have the opportunity to pick. One would be great, and one would be a disaster. That was the fun of the game show: What is behind door 1? What is behind door 2?  But this isn't about a game show. We are not participating in a game show. We are participating in a decision about the most important aspect of any person's life--their health--and about the most important expenditure they ever make with a dollar--a healthcare expenditure--and about the largest sector of the American economy--healthcare.  Instead of treating the issue with the gravity it deserves, there is a secret plan and a mystery vote without any hearings, shutting out the committees, including the HELP Committee, where I serve, shutting out the minority party, which represents 48 of the 100 Senators in this body, and, most importantly, shutting out the public. As the Senator from Vermont mentioned, in this body, the greatest deliberative body in the world, we have not had a single hearing. We have not heard from a single doctor, a single patient, a single hospital, a single nurse, a single insurance company, or a single medical innovator. We are about to take a vote on the most important expenditure in anyone's life and the largest sector in the American economy following a completely closed process where it has been the will of the majority to keep the door shut.  This isn't a game show.  Let me tell you how real this is. I did something on Friday that I often do. I started doing this in 2002. I live in Richmond, but I drive a number of hours to Wise County, VA, which is a county on the border between Virginia and It is a county where my wife's family is from. She grew up in Roanoke, but her dad is from Big Stone Gap, VA, in Wise County, right across the border from Pike and Hazard Counties in  There is a fairground in Wise--the Virginia-Kentucky fairgrounds. Back in the late 1990s, a Catholic nun, Sister Bernie, and two other wonderful nurses who have become friends--Teresa and Paula--decided to try to offer healthcare for people who didn't have health insurance at this county fairground. They just set up with a few volunteers, and they said: If you live in Appalachia, if you don't have health insurance, if you need medical care or dental care, just come and we will see what we can do. They do this every July, for one weekend a year.  Here is what this has grown into. I first went when I was Lieutenant Governor in 2002. People start to arrive. I have talked about this on the floor. I just did it Friday, and I want to share some stories. They start to arrive Tuesday or Wednesday in cars. They camp in the campground. Now, it is July, and this weekend was the hottest weekend in the summer. They start camping with their kids, often in cars. Some are sleeping in cars. Some are throwing blankets out on the lawn next to a chain-link fence. They wait in the tens, in the dozens, in the fifties, in the hundreds.  Then they open the door at 6 a.m. It is Friday morning, and the people who have waited for days come in and get a number to see if they can get healthcare on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday from volunteer doctors in the richest Nation and the most compassionate Nation in the world.  When they opened the door on Friday morning, I was down there. I do what I do. I go and I work the registration booth, and I talk to people and register them so they can get healthcare. I got there a little late. They had opened the door at 6 a.m., and I got there 8 a.m. They had already given out numbers to 1,200 people in the first 2 hours. Over the course of the weekend, they serve thousands of people.  They come in to get dental care. For most of them, their teeth are too far gone. So it is just a matter of pulling their teeth. Some come in to have most of their teeth pulled, and then they can get dentures. They get an eye exam and find out: Wow, I should have gotten glasses 5 or 10 years ago. No wonder I have been such a poor student all the way through school, or no wonder I have had such a hard time on my job. I needed glasses.  They get a cancer screening. Sometimes they get something caught early, and sometimes they get something caught very late.  It is an amazing spectacle. It is uplifting because of the volunteers who turn out--doctors, dental hygienists, nurses, and the Lion's Club, which comes to do vision screenings. That is uplifting.  It is depressing and it is heartbreaking to see people sleeping up against chain-linked fences and sleeping crunched over in their car for days so that they can get a little bit of free healthcare in the richest Nation on  When I work the registration booth, I have to ask people a series of questions so that they know who they can go see when they are there. I worked the booth for about an hour and a half. Here is a question you ask everybody: How long has it been since you have seen a doctor? How long has it been since you have seen a doctor?  I had a mother of four kids. The kids were 12 and under, and they were sort[[Page S4156]]of buzzing around. The mom was sitting in a chair. You know what happens if you are a mom with kids that young. Your kids pick up something in school. They bring it home, and you get sick. This is what happens to parents. I have a colleague here with young kids, and he knows what I am talking about.  I asked the mother: How long has it been since you have seen a doctor?  I am not really sure.  So I was kind of going through my checklist. Have you seen a doctor within the last year?  No, not within the last year.  Have you seen a doctor within the last 2 years?  Not within the last 2 years.  Have you seen a doctor within the last 3 years?  I might have seen a doctor in the last 3 years.  That was a mother of four young kids.  I had somebody sitting across from me, and I asked her another common question: Are you employed? You ask everybody this. Part-time? Full-time?  I am not employed, but I am about to get my nursing license back.  Well, that is interesting. So you are in healthcare.  Well, I used to be. I am about to get my nursing license back.  Well, what happened?  Now, this wasn't on the questionnaire, but I couldn't resist asking her: What happened?  Well, I was a nurse. I had a great career. I had a great life. But then a doctor prescribed me opioids for arthritis, and the bottom fell out of my life. I got addicted to opioids, and I lost my license, and I lost virtually everything in my life. Now I am unemployed, but I am working as a counselor at a church, trying to help people who are also opioid addicted. I am about to get my license back, but I am not working yet, and I don't have insurance yet, and that is why, even though I am a nurse and I am a healthcare professional, I have waited in line for a couple of days to come get healthcare.  There was a woman from Maryland who had been laid off as a supervisor at McDonald's a number of months ago. She was unemployed. She had horrible dental problems that were way past being solved. She just needed to get a bunch of her teeth pulled to ease her pain. So get what this woman did. This is about an 8 or 9 hour drive from her house. When her teeth got so bad and so painful after her firing and she needed to have her teeth pulled, she couldn't go anywhere. She didn't have anybody to do it.  She said: I think there is this free clinic in Now, it is a couple of months out. So I am going to have to suffer through the pain for a while, but I also have to save up some money.  She saved up her money like most people would try to save money for a summer vacation. She saved up her money so she could put enough gas in the car and pay for one night at a hotel and so she could drive for 9 hours to Wise County, VA, and wait in the line for days and come and get a bunch of her teeth pulled in the richest and most compassionate Nation on  By the way, I had another guy, and I asked him the question: What are you here for? Are you here for medical services, are you here for dental services or are you here for vision services?  He said: I am actually here for all three, but the problem is, it is the hottest day of the year. It is 95 and humid, and I am so sick, I can't sit out in the Sun all day. So I got to do two out of three. I can't do all three.  I said: Which are the two worst, is it the medical and dental or vision and dental or vision and medical? He said: Look, I will do dental and medical, but even though I have glasses and I need to get an upgrade, I can't wait around because I am so sick out in the hot Sun for so long. So you are just going to have to give me two out of the three. I can't wait all weekend. I can't wait all day in this dusty fairground on the 21st of July to get healthcare.  These people need us. They need us to be at our best. They need us to be thinking about them.  The first time I went to this clinic in Wise, I was struck by the magnanimity of the volunteers, I was struck by the need, but what really hit me was when I went into the parking lot. I expected to see cars from Virginia and Kentucky because Kentucky is 10 miles away from the fairgrounds. I might have expected to see cars from West Virginia, which is 100 miles away, or Tennessee, which is 40 miles away, but North Carolina is 150 miles away, South Carolina is 350 miles away, Georgia is 400 miles away, Alabama is farther, and Oklahoma is farther. People drive from all over the Southeast in the United States, in the richest nation on Earth, in the most compassionate Nation on Earth, to wait for days in a dusty campground in the heat of the hottest part of the summer so they can have their teeth pulled because they don't have healthcare.  The Affordable Care Act has cut the uninsurance rate to one of the lowest in recorded history, but we haven't gone far enough. We have to do better by these people who are sleeping in their cars or up against chain-link fences, who are traveling for 9 hours to get their teeth pulled, not worse. We want to have fewer people like this and fewer folks who need to do this, not more.  The vote we are going to have about whether it is 22 million or 25 million or 32 million people who lose health insurance, that is going the wrong way. We have to go a different way. We have to do better, not worse.  Most of the things we talk about in this Chamber are about issues. This isn't about issues, this is about who we are. This is about who we are as This is about who we are as This is about who we are as thinking, feeling, breathing, believing human beings. It is about who we are.  A great teacher, a great teacher once laid out the yardstick: ``I was sick and you took care of me.'' That is one version of the New There are other phraseologies from the 25th chapter of Matthew: I was sick and you visited me. I was sick and you cared for me. I was sick and you looked after me. The Teacher basically says, the way you treat someone who is sick is the way you treat the  It is important to be compassionate to somebody who is sick, and anybody who is hearing these words, you don't have to think for a second to think about somebody in your family who is suffering from cancer or dementia or mental illness or who has been the victim of an accident. There are faces appearing in your minds right now because we all have this in our families. The way we treat people who are sick is not just a measure of us, it is a measure of what we think about the When a great teacher said, ``I was sick and you took care of me,'' he was giving an instruction to us about the way we should behave.  In the last week, I am struck by the fact that this body has been jolted by the news about two of our colleagues, both of whom who have had cancer diagnoses. Last week, we were shocked and saddened to hear about our colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, who is my chairman on the Armed Services Committee who is suffering a very tough form of cancer, and cancer is going to find a match in Senator  This touches us in this body. A week or two before, we heard about another colleague on the Armed Services Committee who sits next to me at every committee hearing, Senator Hirono, who just announced she has kidney cancer and just underwent surgery. I was chatting on the floor with her earlier tonight. I don't think she would mind me saying, she is strong and she is a fighter, like Senator McCain is a fighter, but she is worried about it just like Senator McCain would be. This touches everyone.  It touches the powerful, it touches the powerless. It touches the wealthy, it touches the poor. It touches men, it touches women. It touches the young, it touches the old. It touches everyone, and the way we treat people who are sick, the way we treat people who are anxious about their health is the way we treat the That is what we are taught. So let's live up to that standard.  Why would we do otherwise? Why are we here? Why did we run? Why do we serve? What do people expect of us? I was sick, and you cared for me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was sick, and you looked after me. I was sick, and you took care of me.  Is it that hard? Is it so important to rush it through and not have hearings and not have committees and not engage the Democrats and not listen to[[Page S4157]]the people sleeping against chain-link fences or driving 9 hours to get their teeth pulled?  We can't afford to get this wrong, and the talent of the people in this body convinces me beyond a shadow of a doubt that if we take the time, we can get this right. If we can get this right, why will we not take the time to get this right?  So I would plead with my colleagues, let's stand together on behalf of the sick, let's stand together on behalf of those who are counting on us.  Another part of the New Testament is the Letter of Paul to the Hebrews: ``Because we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, we have got to do the right thing.'' We are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses who want us to do the right thing, and I know we can, and I pray we will.  With that Mr.President, I yield the floor.

The bill also holds Iran, North Korea, as well as Russia accountable. Specifically, Russia for interference in our Democratic Republic, but also for its ongoing human rights violations, its illegal invasion and occupation of Crimea, and continued military violence in eastern Ukraine with over 10,000 dead due to Russian aggression.  This bill will impose sanctions on people involved in human rights abuses, those who launch cyber attacks and those who supplied weapons to the Assad government in President Trump and his staff regularly question the intelligence that shows Russia interfered in our election.  Given the President's priorities lately, it is imperative that Congress send a clear message and make it more difficult to undercut sanctions without congressional approval.

There are serious questions about the President's carelessness, about his lack of judgment. In fact, last July, the Speaker said that individuals who are extremely careless with classified information should be denied further access to it.  Even the President's own Chief of Staff said those who mishandle classified information have had their security clearances revoked. They have lost their jobs. They have faced fines. Some have gone to prison.  I have to ask my colleagues, shouldn't the President of the United States be held to that same standard? They say he can do what he wants, but does that make it smart?

14259,topic-id,2271,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for her good words and her advocacy.  I rise to join her and my colleagues on the floor in sharing the concerns I continue to hear every single day in my State, whether it is just simply walking the parades, as I did in Stillwater, MN, where people would come up off the sides, or, on the Fourth of July, when a family with a child with Down syndrome just came off the side of the parade and grabbed me and said we need healthcare for our son, that we cannot cut him off, that we cannot make these drastic, draconian reductions to Medicaid--because he is the face for  Right now, as far as I know, we have many versions of this healthcare bill. I think I heard this version referred to as option I was thinking that is not really correct because we have had options A and Those were the two House healthcare bills. We had options C and D, which were the two Senate healthcare bills. Then we went to option E, which was back to the idea of repealing without having a replacement. Now, as far as I know, after doing A, B, C, D, and E, we are at plan My mom was a teacher her entire life, and I learned from her that you cannot get much lower than F, right? I think it is time to set a new course, and that is to work together for a better grade for the American people and for a better healthcare plan, which means working across the aisle to make changes to the Affordable Care  The Minnesotans whom I have heard from do not like A, B, C, D, E, or On Friday, in fact, I received a letter that was signed by 121 different Minnesota healthcare organizations, and it talked about these past proposals.  They wrote this:       Minor changes or amendments will not change the ultimate      impact of these bills and their deep and devastating impact      on Minnesota and its citizens.  What were these groups?  They were pretty mainstream groups, those being the AARP Minnesota, our children's hospitals, the Autism Society of Minnesota, our nursing homes, the Minnesota Hospital Association, the Minnesota Nurses Association, Mental Health Minnesota, our Catholic Health Association, our addiction treatment professionals, and many more.  As different as these groups may be in their missions and in the work they do and who belongs to them and where they live, what they have in common is that they are dedicated to taking care of the health and well-being of They are scared about what would happen if any of these proposals--A, B, C, D, E, or F--were to pass.  They have seen that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that with a number of these bills, it would mean that over 20 million people, if not all of them, would lose their health insurance, that Medicaid would get cut by more than $700 billion, and that out-of-pocket costs would skyrocket. Deductibles for a benchmark plan could reach $13,000 by 2026. They have seen that the Congressional Budget Office has found that a repeal bill without a replacement would be even worse, as 32 million people would lose their coverage, and premiums would double.  I understand why these Minnesota healthcare organizations are scared about these bills, but the people who are even more scared are the citizens of my State who depend on the Affordable Care Act for their healthcare.  As I said, we all knew, on the day it passed, that the Affordable Care Act was a beginning and not an end. You cannot pass a major piece of legislation like that without making changes over time. Unfortunately, with the exception of a few minor things, we have been, basically, blocked from making changes because we are always having thrown at us this idea of simply repealing everything and causing chaos. After the sentiment of the American people has been made quite clear--and you do not have to look at a poll to know that; all you have to do is walk down the Main Street during any parade in our State--now is the time for us to work across the aisle and make some positive changes.  What are those changes? For one, we know we must bring some certainty to the exchanges and stabilize the market.[[Page S4148]]  I see the Senator from New Hampshire here who is the former Governor of New She knows, along with her colleague Senator Shaheen, we need to have more certainty in the marketplace. That is why we support the bill that would do that. We should vote on that bill.  I also support Senators Kaine and Carper's legislation--the Individual Health Insurance Marketplace Improvement Act--to reestablish a Federal reinsurance program. This bill would lower premiums by providing support for high-cost patients.  Now, the Republican legislature in my State--both houses are Republican--joined with the Democratic Governor in our State and passed a similar State-based reinsurance program.  I know Alaska, which, by all accounts, is a red State, has passed a reinsurance program that recently got approval from this administration. Just last week, as Senator Hassan knows, New Hampshire announced its plans to pursue one as well.  So we can and we should come together to pursue this as one change we can make positively for the  Another is, it is long past time to do something about the rising cost of prescription drugs. I have a bill--and I see my colleague from Minnesota here as well, Senator We have worked on this issue together on both bills, which is similar to this issue of harnessing the negotiating power of 41 million seniors who are on Medicare in order to bring drug prices down. Right now, Medicare is literally banned from negotiating on behalf of 41 million seniors. The last time I checked, the senior citizens in my State had a lot of power, and 41 million people, especially seniors, is a lot of negotiating power. Let's harness that because it will not just help to bring drug prices down in the Medicare Program, but it will help down the line for all citizens.  There is the bringing in of more competition. One way you do that is by dangling the prospect of competition from other countries. You can do it with a trigger that is based on the number of competitors you have in a certain market. You can do it based on an increase in price or you can just do it.  I and Senator McCain, who is certainly in our thoughts and prayers this week, have long had a bill to allow Americans to bring in safe, less expensive drugs from That is very similar to that of the U.market. As I have often noted when I talk about this bill, we can see Canada from our porch in We can see those lower prices right across the border.  When we have developed so many lifesaving drugs, when we have done the research, when we have put government money--taxpayer money--into the research, why in this country do we have the most expensive drugs in the world?  I can tell you why. It is that we have not done anything about it here because, for too long, the pharmaceutical companies have been able to have their way when it comes to legislation. This is the end of that. Finally, the American people are starting to see this as not just campaign rhetoric but as a real problem when 4 out of the top 10 best selling drugs have gone up over 100 percent in just the last 10 years.  Here are some more ideas.  Senator Lee and I have a bill--bipartisan, across the aisle--that would again allow the temporary importation of safe drugs that have been on the market in another country for at least 10 years when there is not healthy competition for that drug in this country.  I and Senator Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, have a bill to stop something called pay for delay, which is when big pharmaceutical companies actually pay off generic companies to keep less expensive products off the market. That is an outrage. I would challenge any Senator to vote against that. I do not think one will. That is why we need a vote, and that is a perfect example of a bipartisan bill that could be included in a package of measures that could be improvements on the Affordable Care  How about this one? It is the CREATES Act, which is another bipartisan bill with me, Senator Grassley, Senator Leahy, Senator Feinstein, Senator Lee, and many others that would put a stop to tactics in which pharmaceutical companies refuse to provide samples that the generic companies need to develop new drugs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation would save taxpayers $3.5 billion, and the one I just mentioned on pay for delay would save taxpayers $2.9 billion.  Why would we say to the taxpayers of this country that we will not do that, that we will not even allow it to come up for a vote?  These are votes the Senate should and must take. Bringing up a bill that devastates the Medicaid Program or that repeals big parts of the Affordable Care Act, without having a replacement, does the opposite. It does nothing. These bills--A, B, C, D, E, or F--do nothing in terms of bringing down pharmaceutical prices.  What is this really about? It is about the identical twins whom I met yesterday from Cambridge, MN, which is a small town--a town similar, I am sure, to the towns the Presiding Officer would find in his State or to the towns in New Hampshire or to the towns Senator Whitehouse would see in Rhode  This is about identical twins. One of the twins is a pitcher, and one of the twins is a catcher on their softball team. One of the twins found out, just in the last year, that she has juvenile diabetes. It is a very dangerous, dangerous thing to have at that young age. The other twin is perfectly healthy. Of course, the family had to go immediately to the doctor. They bought insulin, and the insulin had gone up three times what it should have in just the last few years. It is very difficult for them to afford now. They got the strips. They had to do all of this, and the price kept escalating. To add to everything else, now this mom is worried that one of her daughters, not two, will have a preexisting condition and be kicked off of the insurance.  Think about that. They are identical twins. It could be either one. You do not know which one. Is it the catcher? Is it the pitcher? It is a lottery. If you do not have healthcare like the Affordable Care Act in place, it is like a lottery. You do not know which one of them is going to be kicked off the insurance, not have insurance, and get very sick and possibly die. That is what we are talking about here.  That is not what this country is about. It could happen to anyone--to anyone in this Chamber, to anyone up in the Gallery, to anyone at home. You do not know when it is going to happen to you or your sister or your brother or your neighbor or your dad or your mom or your grandma or your grandpa. That is why we have affordable healthcare insurance.  This debate is also about our seniors and our rural communities. As Senator Franken knows, we have heard time and time again from our rural hospitals--from Aurora to Gilbert, to I was up there recently, and that is what I heard about--the rural hospitals and how difficult it is going to be for them if any of these bills pass.  I know it is something our Republican colleagues, all of whom are from rural States--Senators Collins, Capito, and Murkowski--have expressed real concerns about with regard to the impact of some of the proposed Medicaid cuts and what they would do in their  Both the Senator from New Hampshire who is here with me today, Senator Hassan, and certainly Senator Whitehouse have been leaders in this area. That is why we passed the Cures That is why we put a bunch of funding from the Cures Act into opioid addiction treatment. That is why we passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act on a bipartisan basis--one of the few bills that made it through last year.  You cannot just run TV ads on it, and you cannot just put it on campaign brochures and then go out 6 months later and cut Medicaid, which provides the treatment for 32 percent of opioid medication-assisted treatments we have in our You cannot do that. You cannot give beautiful speeches and go to press conferences and then make those kinds of cuts. I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand this.  This is a time when we can chart a different path forward, when we can end up where we should have begun but still standing, and that is by working together to find some positive changes to the Affordable Care Act for the[[Page S4149]]American people. Again, I said it on the day it passed--it is a beginning and not an end. Let's seize this moment, open the door, and work together for the American people.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgS4139-4.txt,1826,NATIONAL MARITIME DAY,2017.0,24.0,July
14114,topic-id,564,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the backbone of the American economy: small business.  Whether I meet with an owner of a family restaurant that has been on the same street corner for 50 years or a programmer for a startup tech company trying to land its first big break, I am always inspired by the amount of dedication and ingenuity that goes into running a small business. These men and women work hard, and their passion can always be seen in the products and services that they produce.  The district I serve is home to so many thriving small businesses, and each one has a great story behind it. Such is the case with M.Neill, Incorporated, a family-owned heating company located in Bernardsville, New This is M.Neill's 100th anniversary.  Business has not always been easy for M.The company has been overcoming obstacles since David Neill started it in 1917. It has had to navigate through the Great Depression, the OPEC oil crisis, and the 2008 financial crisis. It has had to make the move from coal to more efficient fuels. But through four generations, M.Neill has always been able to adapt and expand its business.  M.Neill continues to be a household name in heating in the Bernardsville area. It caters to other local small businesses and families all around Somerset and Morris Counties, and it is known for its 24/7 service and family-oriented approach. Some of its customers even date back to when the company first began, testament to the value of the honest service that M.Neill provides.  Today I congratulate current owner David Neill on the centennial of the company. The entrepreneurial spirit and innovation the Neill family has exhibited over the past 100 years is truly exemplary and serves as an example to all of us.  The stories we hear about successful small businesses are not the only evidence we have that they are pivotal to our economy. The statistics also prove that point.  We have over 29 million small businesses in the United States, and nearly two-thirds of the jobs created in this country come from those businesses. It is undeniable that a thriving small business sector is critical to bolstering employment in this country.  The same is true in New Jersey, which is home to 843,000 small businesses, accounting for over 99 percent of the total businesses in the These same small businesses employ 1.8 million people in New Jersey, more than half of our total workforce.  With so many people relying on work from our small business community, it only makes sense that Congress does everything possible to support them. That is why we must use this week, National Small Business Week, to continue to talk about the ways we can help rid small businesses of harmful regulations and equip them with the tools they need to grow and to prosper.  Last year we made great strides in the House by passing legislation such as the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act and the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, but we need to do more. Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together to support pro-small business legislation. Families like the Neills work hard their entire lives to serve their communities. It is imperative that those of us in Congress work to serve them as well.[[Page H3073]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-05-03-pt1-PgH3072.txt,1936,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018--MOTION TO,2017.0,3.0,July

It has been more than 3 months since the press revealed that the Attorney General gave false testimony in response to questions from both myself and from Senator Franken about his contact with Russian officials; yet the Attorney General has made no effort to come back before the Judiciary Committee to explain these actions--actions that some could construe as perjury.[[Page S3421]]  There are now countless new and troubling questions swirling around the Attorney In fact, he was scheduled to appear before the Appropriations Committee this morning--a committee that would have to vote on his request for a budget--but, for the second time in as many months, he abruptly canceled. Neither I nor Senator Franken sit on the Intelligence Committee, so we are not going to have the opportunity to follow up with the Attorney General in person. I am not going to be able to ask him why he hid his contacts with the Russian Ambassador, including a reported third meeting at the Mayflower Hotel, nor will I be able to ask about the timing of his recusal or his involvement with the Russia investigation both before his recusal and after. I will not be able to ask whether the President ever suggested he intervene in the Russia investigation in any way. And especially I will not be able to ask how the Attorney General can justify violating his recusal from the Russia investigation by working to fire its lead investigator.  The American people deserve answers to each of these questions--not only answers, they deserve truthful answers. That is why I shared my questions for Attorney General Sessions on these topics. But I also shared them with members of the Intelligence  So, at least, on the plus side, Attorney General Sessions will finally face some serious questions, but I am still concerned he is not going to be the most forthcoming witness. We saw last week that Trump administration officials have invented a brand new claim of privilege to insulate themselves from congressional oversight--and to protect themselves from giving answers that would be embarrassing or damaging to the  I asked the Congressional Research Service to provide me with a list of valid reasons to refuse to answer a question from a There is executive privilege, of course, but it has to be invoked by the President, and it is not absolute. Of course, there are also constitutional privileges, such as the Fifth Amendment right to not incriminate oneself. Even in my days as prosecutor, I strongly protected the rights of people, no matter what crime they were charged with, to take the Fifth Amendment if they wanted to, but there is no ``I would rather not answer'' privilege. That is not in the Fifth That is not an executive privilege. Unless it necessarily involves disclosing classified information, the answer ``I would rather discuss this behind closed doors'' is not a valid response either. That is really not a valid response. That is just trying to get out of answering questions.  The Attorney General's spokesperson said yesterday that Attorney General Sessions ``believes it is important for the American people to hear the truth directly from him and [he] looks forward to answering the committee's questions.'' Yet it was also reported yesterday he plans to invoke executive privilege in response to some inquiries. If true, the Attorney General is speaking out of both sides of his mouth.  I hope the Attorney General is not going to allow President Trump to follow the precedent of Richard Nixon and go down the path of invoking executive privilege to stop an inquiry into illegal or unethical conduct. These questions need to be answered. The American people deserve the truth. They deserve an Attorney General who is held accountable for his leadership of the Justice Department, not one who is embroiled in controversy and hides from the congressional committee of oversight jurisdiction of his  We must not lose sight of the fact that our democracy was attacked. It was attacked by a country that has no respect for us. If we do not take this seriously, we will be attacked again. We must know exactly how that happened so we can protect our democratic institutions and protect our country. This goes way beyond the Republican or the Democratic parties. That includes knowing whether members of the Trump campaign enabled Russian interference.  Russia is not a friend. Just as they have tried to interfere with elections in some of the NATO countries in other parts of the world, we know they have tried to interfere with ours. The American people also deserve to know whether the President or his administration have attempted to interfere in the Russia investigation, knowing it was improper. Any such attempt would amount to obstruction of justice.  Attorney General Sessions needs to answer critical questions today. He needs to answer for his leadership of the Justice Department in both the Senate Appropriations and the Judiciary He can keep ducking the questions, but sooner or later, the Attorney General must answer for his actions.  We deserve to know whether he is acting in the public interest--which is what an Attorney General should do--or in Donald Trump's personal interest. If he cannot decide between those interests, if he cannot distinguish between the public's interests and Donald Trump's interests, well, he is not fit to serve as Attorney  I pointed out, when Deputy Rosenstein came before the Appropriations Committee this morning, all the things the administration were cutting out of the budget--money for victims of crime, money to go after the opioid epidemic in this country, large cuts in the I could go on and on.

They put in money for lawyers to work taking private property of people in Texas and Arizona and elsewhere to build this wall of the President's.

The other part, of course, was to have Mexico pay for it. The check is in the mail--very, very, very slow mail.

14268,topic-id,3253,"Mr.President, I rise to address the Republican plan to have a vote to proceed to a healthcare bill tomorrow. The only challenge is that we have no idea what bill we are being asked to proceed to. This is hardly the way a democratic republic operates in which the leader of the majority says: We want to come to the floor with no committee deliberation, no consultation with healthcare experts, no dialogue with the public, no amendments in committee of any kind, and vote on a mystery bill.  The biggest mystery to me is how it is possible that the majority of Republicans are taking seriously a plan to rip healthcare from 20 million-plus Americans in order to give fabulous giveaways to the richest among us. The bill they entertained previously would have given $33 billion to the richest 400 Americans--$33 billion. I have mentioned this number before. Some journalists have quoted it as $33 million, and some citizens have said that I meant $33,000. It is $33 billion to the richest 400 Americans--enough funds to pay for Medicaid for 700,000 people.  What individual would say it is moral to rip healthcare away from 20 million people in order to give tax breaks to the very richest among us? In some misguided, mysterious way, something has gotten ahold of the hearts and minds of my colleagues and made them think this was some kind of good idea to do so much damage to so many.  In fact, we have been having this conversation since It was earlier this year, when President Trump was sworn in, when the majority said: We are going to come to the floor of the Senate, and we are going to repeal healthcare for millions of Americans in short order.  Here we are 6 months later, and it has not happened yet--in part because when people look at the details, they start to raise questions.  It took a long time for the House to send a bill over to the Senate, and then the Senate proceeded to work on this bill with a group of 13 secret Senators--working in a secret room, in secret meetings--with the public not allowed, with fellow Senators not allowed. They came up with a bill that looked very much like the House bill, and we will talk more about that later.  The President said in his campaign and throughout much of this year: You are going to have such great healthcare at a tiny fraction of the cost, and it is going to be so easy.  Well, it has not been that easy. We have seen the President back a plan from the House and invite everyone over to celebrate at the White House and get the champagne bottles out and say how wonderful it was that the House had passed this healthcare bill--this bill that would strip healthcare from more than 20 million Then, a couple of weeks later, someone explained to him what was in that bill, and he said: Oh, well, that bill is mean and heartless. Then the secret 13 here in the Senate meet, and they come out with a very similar bill. And now Trump is all excited; now we have a really good bill, except that in a single year, it would do even more damage to healthcare in  Along the way, the President moderated his dialogue a bit and said: Who knew healthcare could be so complicated? Well, Mr.President, most of the people in America realize we have a complicated healthcare system. We have an overlapping system of six different systems of healthcare. It really is quite messy and difficult. It would be great if we could, in fact, adopt a much simpler system. And I certainly have[[Page S4159]]been advocating for us to have a much simpler system, so just by right of being an American, you are born into this world and you have healthcare. That is the way most developed nations do it, but not here in the United States of We have a great healthcare system for the very wealthy, and we have a very complicated, stressful system for everyone else.  What are we going to vote on tomorrow? I wish the majority leader would come to the floor and tell us. Will we vote on a motion to proceed to a bill that looks like--what? What can you tell us? Is it TrumpCare 3.0? How does it differ from TrumpCare 1.0 or 2.0? Will it have the Cruz amendment in it for fake insurance, the provision that would do enormous damage on both ends of the insurance market, providing fake insurance policies to the young and the healthy and destabilizing healthcare and putting it into a death spiral for everyone else? Or, Mr.Majority Leader, maybe you could come and tell us if you are planning a straight repeal of the ACA--a straight repeal that would raise costs and premiums even higher and not just rip healthcare from 20-plus million people, but from 30 million-plus people, a plan that would be even more devastating than the previous plan. Is that what you want us to vote to proceed to tomorrow?  I can tell you that we shouldn't be voting to proceed to any version on healthcare, something that so affects the peace of mind and the quality of life of We should be operating like a democracy, like a democratic republic--holding committee hearings, holding a conversation. This is what we did when we talked about the ACA those several years ago. We had more than 100 committee meetings, roundtables, and walk-throughs here in the U.We had the single longest markup of a healthcare bill in the HELP Committee ever in the history of the United We had the second longest session marking up the bill in the Finance We had the entertainment of hundreds and hundreds of amendments, and we adopted over 100 Republican amendments. There was a very public, extended process, with a ton of time to go home and consult with healthcare experts and stakeholders in our own States and with the most important stakeholders--the citizens of the United States of America--the men and women and sons and daughters and grandparents. How did they feel about these changes?  Well, as everyone knows, President Trump did call the House bill mean and heartless, but we just keep getting bills that are meaner and more heartless. The House bill would kick 23 million people off insurance over the next decade and 14 million just next year. The subsequent bills don't look that different.  The secret 13 here in the Senate went and did their deliberations, adopted pretty much the same thing as the Senate, only they made it worse. That June Senate bill would kick 15 million off in a single year, rather than 14 million. And then we had the brilliant idea of a repeal-only bill, which would do even worse, kicking 17 million people off in a single year and 32 million off within the 10-year period.  Then we have the bill that isn't even on here because we didn't get a Congressional Budget Office score on it; that is, the special Cruz fake insurance amendment bill--the one that would say: Hey, insurance companies, you can offer policies that are not worth the paper they are written on. Oh, they are very appealing. There is a health insurance policy. You only have to pay $40 a month. Isn't that great? And then the policyholder who has it, they get in a car accident, they get a broken bone, and they find out the emergency room is not covered, the x rays are not covered, the cast is not covered, the doctor is not covered. Nothing is covered. That is why it is fake insurance. That is why it costs only $40 a month. It might as well be 40 cents a month, for all we care, because it just doesn't cover anything.  Then, your spouse--your wife--has the great, joyful news that you are going to have a child together, and guess what. Maternity care is not covered. Can you imagine in this modern era not covering maternity care? Yet, before the Affordable Care Act, many, many policies in America didn't cover maternity care.  Well, in addition, these brilliant plans by my colleagues would cause premiums to skyrocket. Then, we have, of course, the fact that they do diabolical things to those who have preexisting conditions.  Now, let me spend a little more time on the special Cruz fake insurance version of this. Yes, it gave those very cheap policies that aren't worth the paper they are printed on to the young and the healthy. But then, those who are older--those who are sick or have injuries or have preexisting conditions or are concerned that they may develop difficult medical issues--they need to buy a policy that actually covers the things that one would expect, that has an essential benefits package, the same as every single policy in America today has. But, because the young and the healthy are buying the fake policies, that means that the costs skyrocket on the policies with the essential care benefits. As a result of that, more people bail out who feel like they are not directly in danger of getting sicker or injured, and then the cost of the policy goes up even more. It is a death spiral for insurance: fake insurance at one end, destruction of the insurance market at the other end.  So my colleagues decided to not even share the Congressional Budget Office analysis of that bill. It was that bad.  Let's see what some folks said about this. Larry Levitt, senior Vice President of the Kaiser Family Foundation said: ``If there were a Joy of Cooking for insurance, this would be the perfect recipe for destabilizing the market and turning the marketplaces into high-risk pools.''  That is his comment about the Cruz fake insurance plan.  Let's turn to a joint letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield and from America's Health Insurance Plans about the Cruz insurance plan, the Cruz fake insurance plan. Their letter says: ``It is simply unworkable in any form and would undermine protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions, increase premiums and lead to widespread terminations of coverage for people currently enrolled in the individual market.''  Or how about an article in the Atlantic by Vann Newkirk, published just a week ago, July 14 of this year: ``The Cruz amendment creates almost a textbook scenario of wide-scale adverse selection--whereby riskier and more expensive patients wind up concentrated in risk pools--and entirely undermines any tools for managing that adverse selection.''  That is a fancy way of talking about the death spiral in insurance for those who are not young and healthy.  Then we go to the conversation that CBO says is the worst option of all: 17 million would lose coverage in the first year and 32 million by 2026 under the repeal-only plan. Next year, in just 1 year, premiums would skyrocket above what they might have gone to anyway by an additional 25 percent.  Now, our majority leader likes to say that wouldn't actually happen because provisions in the bill don't go into effect for 2 years. Well, these estimates and these commentaries take that into account, because the destabilization in the marketplace begins immediately. Does anyone really think insurance companies are going to stick around the marketplace that they don't know is going to exist in 1 or 2 years?  This repeal-and-run strategy would throw our healthcare industry into chaos. If you think it is a good plan, well, I have some beachfront property in Arizona you might want to buy.  Every version of this Republican TrumpCare plan is worse and worse for the American people, yet these are the options that are being put forward. The majority leader wants us to vote to proceed to this set of undesirables tomorrow, these undesirable--in fact, ``undesirable'' is just too kind of a word for these policies. These are despicable. These are destructive. These are, as the President said, mean and hard-hearted.  Shouldn't we try to pursue options that will make our healthcare system work better? That is what we need to do. Let's start by nailing down the cost-sharing reduction payments, or These payments are a lifeline to more than 12 million low-income They lower the premiums, and they lower the deductibles. They are important sources of stability for[[Page S4160]]insurance companies. But our President has said: I am not sure I want to release these CSR payments. So what happens with that? Insurance companies have to assume they are not going to get them, so they are raising their rates or perhaps bailing out of the market completely.  If these CSR payments are terminated, insurers may leave these exchanges altogether. For those who do stay in, the average premiums for silver plans would need to increase by 19 percent just to compensate for the loss of the Because insurance companies are like any other business, they need to know how much they are going to be paid if they provide a product, and right now, they don't know.  Let's hear what some have had to say. When the insurance company Anthem pulled out of Ohio in June--last month--the company cited ``continual changes in Federal operations, rules and guidance'' as the main reason for exiting the marketplace.  The company also said that ``the individual market remains volatile and the lack of certainty of funding for cost sharing reduction subsidies . . . does not provide a sustainable path forward.''  Then there is Brad Wilson, the president of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, who said:       The biggest single reason for that rate increase is the      lack of the federal funding for Cost Sharing Reduction      Payments in 2018. We cannot assume nor should we that the      money is going to be there based on what we know today.  At another point Mr.Wilson was quoted as saying:       The failure of the administration and the House to bring      certainty and clarity by funding CSRs has caused our company      to file a 22.9 percent premium increase, rather than one that      is materially lower. . . . The rate increase would be 8.8      percent if the CSRs were guaranteed for 2018.  A single-digit increase versus more than a 20-percent increase, and they have to go with the higher increase because they don't know if the President is going to make the payments that he is obliged to make.  I think a piece from the Baltimore Sun from May 5 describes the situation we find ourselves in best, when it says:       It's not the problems in the Affordable Care Act exchanges      that are driving the Republican effort to repeal      It's the Republican effort to kill Obamacare that's causing      problems in the exchanges.  President Trump and the Congressional Republicans are trying to exacerbate them. He closes by saying: ``No wonder rates are going up.''  This really does make clear the situation. The President wants to say the exchanges have problems so we need to repeal and run or repeal and replace. Our answer to the exchanges having problems is to drive 20 million people-plus off healthcare, maybe 30 million people off healthcare. In fact, the exchanges are having problems because they are being sabotaged by President Trump and our Republican colleagues; first, by wiping out the reinsurance proposal, which enables companies to go into a new area and compete but only if they have insurance against getting a disproportionate share of the really sick people. That is a very logical part of an insurance plan which encourages companies to go into new markets to compete, and my colleagues sabotaged it.  The cost-sharing reduction payments we just talked about, a very key part of lowering premiums and making the policies affordable so struggling, hard-working Americans can buy those policies and have lower premiums and lower deductibles, but my colleagues and President Trump have sabotaged it.  That is not a service to the American people. Maybe they feel they are doing a service--to whom? To the rich who can buy insurance without any of this effort to provide insurance throughout our society. Do my colleagues really want a world in which we only have wealth care? That is healthcare that only the wealthy can buy. Do they really want to denigrate, tear down, and destroy the quality of life of millions of their constituents by pursuing this path?  It was not that long ago that Franklin Roosevelt said: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who have little.''  But in their bills, my colleagues have been saying: We want to give massive tax giveaways to those who have the most by ripping healthcare away from those who are struggling, hard-working  It is the opposite. It is the opposite of the belief that we are all in this together, and we want a foundation for every family to thrive. I want a foundation for every family to thrive. That means peace of mind that if your loved one gets sick, they will get the care they need. It is the peace of mind that if your loved one gets sick, they will not end up bankrupt.  We are not just talking about ripping healthcare insurance away from more than 20 million people. We are talking about ripping peace of mind away from 20 million people. We are not just talking about those individuals. We are talking about undermining the rural and urban healthcare infrastructure which helps everyone.  I have been out in very rural, Republican parts of my State holding townhalls. I am hearing from those who are in clinics, and they have improved considerably. Some of them have doubled their number of employees over the last 8 years because of the support for healthcare clinics in the ACA and also because their uncompensated care--the number of people they were serving who couldn't pay their bills--has dropped enormously.  So not only have they been able to employ a lot more people providing healthcare in the community, but they have been able to do additional things. They have been able to provide more preventive services, more mental health services, and so forth. So it has been a big win for rural America, and my colleagues want to tear that down. That just doesn't make any sense at all.  That is why everyone here should vote unanimously to oppose going onto a mystery healthcare bill tomorrow. There is so much we could do together if we want to improve healthcare: fix those CSRs; provide a fix to reinsurance; proceed to have a full enrollment period rather than cutting it short; retain and reinforce the individual mandates so those who have insurance are covered throughout the spectrum, from the young and healthy to those who are older; provide the sort of advertising that enables people to sign up and make the signup process a lot easier than it is right now. There is so much we can do together to make our healthcare system work better.  My colleagues have come to the floor tonight to say this really matters. Quit playing games with people's lives, quit trying to destroy the foundation for our families to thrive, and vote no on a motion to proceed to a mystery healthcare bill tomorrow.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgS4139-4.txt,1900,SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,24.0,June
14011,topic-id,1360,"Mr.President, while my friend's remarks on the motives of Democrats are fresh in people's minds, let me address this directly. There is a new President today, but there is a different policy, and that is what this resolution is about. Let me be very clear about what we are talking about today.  Senator Graham would have you believe that we are about to vote on the entirety of the $110 billion in arms sales that was proposed--that was unveiled--by President Trump during his visit to Saudi That is not the case. We are voting today on $500 million of that $110 billion sale. You can still be friends with Saudi Arabia and sell it $109.5 billion worth of arms rather than $110 billion worth of arms. The specific set of arms that we are talking about--precision-guided munitions that are going to be used to perpetuate the Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen--was the specific set of weapons that the Obama administration refused to transfer to the Saudis at the end of 2016. We did not take a vote on this in 2016. We took a vote on a different arms sale.  It is not simply that there is a new President and that Democrats are objecting to the arms sale that President Trump is moving forward with. It is that we have a new policy. This specific set of munitions that President Trump is asking us to consent to is one that President Obama would not sell. The policy is different, not just the personnel. Let's talk about why the policy is different.  What is happening today in Yemen is a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions. There are four famines that exist in the world today. One of them is in Yemen, and only one of those four is caused, in part, by the United The United States supports the Saudi-led bombing campaign that has had the effect of causing a humanitarian nightmare to play out in that country such that 8 million people right now in Yemen are in starvation or are on the brink of starvation. Last week, we received word that 100,000 people in Yemen now have cholera. Cholera? All of this is directly a result of the civil war.  The reason that the Obama administration decided not to transfer the precision-guided munitions to the Saudis is that the Saudis were using the weapons we were giving them in order to deliberately target humanitarian infrastructure and civilian infrastructure inside The Saudis have made it pretty clear that time is on their side, that they can wait out the Yemeni population and drive it to the negotiating table. They suggest that this humanitarian catastrophe, ultimately, accrues to their benefit because it eventually will push the Houthis into supporting a better deal than they would have otherwise for the  Let me give you some direct evidence of how this bombing campaign is leading to the humanitarian crisis.  This cholera outbreak, which has been covered in the news, began, in part, because the Saudi airstrikes were targeting water treatment facilities inside This is independent reporting from relief agencies that operate on the ground inside Yemen that tell us that the Saudi bombing campaign that has targeted civilian infrastructure--in this case, water treatment facilities--has led to the cholera outbreak.  It continues. The bombing campaign that is leading to this catastrophe continues. The reason the Obama administration would not sell them this specific set of arms is that it did not have confidence that the arms would be used to hit purely military targets.  What we are asking for is to hold off on selling these precision-guided munitions until we get some clear promise--some clear assurance--from the Saudis that they are going to use these munitions only for military purposes and that they are going to start taking steps--real steps, tangible steps--to address the humanitarian crisis.  Senator Young has been very articulate on the things that the Saudis are doing to stop--to halt--to slow the flow of relief supplies into Yemen today. There are some proactive things the Saudis could do, which they are not, that could save millions of lives inside Yemen today.  More broadly, I think this is an important moment for U.policy in the Middle The Saudis are our friends. They are an important, stabilizing presence in the Middle They have helped to broker a kind of detente between Sunni nations and Israel, our sacred ally. They cooperate with us on counterterrorism measures. They share intelligence with us. Clearly, we have an important economic relationship, but they are an imperfect partner.  This body should have a debate as to whether it is in the national security interests of the United States to get drawn more deeply into the set of proxy wars that is playing out in the region between the Sunnis and the That proxy battle plays out in Yemen; it plays out in Syria; and it plays out in other ways in places like Just because you have a friend does not mean that you have to back every single one of your friend's fights. If my friend asks me to hand him a rock to throw at the neighborhood kids, I am not going to do it, but if he wants me to help him stand up to the neighborhood bully, then maybe I will be there for him. Even with your friends you decide what fights you join them in and what fights you don't.  In Yemen, it is not just I who is making the argument that the civil war is accruing to the detriment of U.national security interests; it is a broad swath of foreign policy experts and Middle East experts in this city and across this country and across the globe. Why? It is that this civil war is radicalizing the Yemeni people against the United They do not perceive this bombing campaign that is killing thousands of civilians as a Saudi bombing campaign. They perceive it as a U.S.-Saudi bombing campaign.  Just get your intelligence briefing, and look at the difference in the amount of space that AQAP controls today versus what it controlled before the civil war began. AQAP, which is the arm of al-Qaida that has the most capability to hit the United States, has grown exponentially in terms of the territory it controls. ISIS has grown as well. These extremist groups take advantage of the civil war, and if our priority in the region is really about defeating these organizations, then this civil war is not helping in that effort. Civilians are dying; extremist groups are growing; and the Yemeni population is being radicalized against us.  To exacerbate matters, the Trump administration has walked away from the political process. Secretary Kerry was actively involved in trying to bring the Houthis and the Saudi-backed government together. He got close to an agreement, but it fell apart. This administration has not restarted that process. For those who want to throw more arms into this contest, I think it is hard to believe that, ultimately, it will lead to any cease-fire or any peaceful transition to a new government if the United States is totally absent from the negotiating table as we are today.  This is not about objecting to the entirety of the sale, and this is not about delivering a broader message to the This is about saying that this specific conflict in Yemen is not going well and is hurting the United Until we get some real assurances from the Saudis that they are going to pay attention to the ``no strike'' list, until we get some commitments from the Saudis that they are going to let relief supplies flow into Yemen to address the famine and address the cholera outbreak, then let's press pause on this small slice of this arms sale.  I am proud to join with Senator Paul and others, and I hope that my colleagues will see fit to support it when we vote in about an hour and a half.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

14267,topic-id,2216,"Mr.President, I was really glad to be on the floor to hear the remarks of my great friend Senator  It is gut-check time in the U.The legislation we are going to consider tomorrow would hurt a lot of people in ways I think that are very hard to fathom. One of our colleagues said: I didn't come here to hurt people.  Everybody came here with designs on how to make their community, their State, their Nation a better place, and we are on the verge of taking a vote on a bill that objectively will rain a level of devastation down on this country that is really hard to fathom.  I can't match Senator Kaine's eloquence talking about the personal stakes here. We take for granted the fact that as employees of the U.Senate, we get a health benefit that makes sure that if we do fall ill or if our children fall ill, we will not have to think about whether we have the money to be able to afford treatment, but that is not how it is for all of those families who lined up in Virginia to receive care. That is not how it is for those who come to a similar event in Connecticut that is targeted just for dental services but has a line that begins the night before and is oversubscribed before the event begins the next morning.  That is not how it was for the millions of American families who used to go bankrupt because, when faced between a choice of personal financial ruin and the death of a child or a loved one, they chose financial ruin. Until you have been faced with that choice, I don't think there is any way to understand it. It certainly is a choice no one in this Chamber will ever have to make.  In Connecticut, the Burger family made that choice. Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, in the 2-week period of time where Mr.Burger didn't have healthcare insurance, their son was diagnosed with cancer, and when he got on his new plan, it was a preexisting condition so it wasn't covered, and the Burger family lost everything. They went through their savings account. They lost their house. They went bankrupt. They were one of thousands and thousands of families who made that choice. That rarely happens any longer. The number of personal bankruptcies in this country has been cut in half because of the Affordable Care  The Affordable Care Act hasn't made healthcare magically affordable for everyone, but it has meant that people don't have to make that choice any longer. The scope of the pain we are talking about, if any of the three versions of this bill get the vote, is really hard to fathom. Under the original version of the bill, 23 million people would lose insurance.  I amended this chart when a series of changes were made at the last minute that CBO scored to reduce that number to 22 million, but this is the entire population of Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia, all losing healthcare at the same time, and the majority of that happens in the first year. So of the 22 million, 14 or 15 million of those people lose insurance next year. The scope of that devastation--12 months from now, 15 million less people having insurance, 15 million more people showing up in emergency rooms to get care--is something I don't think any of my colleagues really can get their head wrapped around.  For all the times President Trump said the Affordable Care Act is dead, that ObamaCare is in a death spiral, that is not true. It is a lie. It is a lie because the Congressional Budget Office says the death spiral only occurs if you pass any of the versions of the legislation we are considering; that if the Affordable Care Act stays in place, 28 million people will not have insurance--which is far too many--but if one of these bills go into effect, at the end of 10 years, we will have 50 million people without insurance.  A new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the ACA markets are not collapsing despite what the White House says--despite the lies they perpetuate. Early results from 2017 suggest the individual market is stabilizing and insurers in this market are regaining profitability. ``Insurer financial results show no sign of a market collapse.'' That is the Kaiser Family Foundation's finding which mirrors the finding of  The collapse in our insurance market only happens if one of these bills pass, and it is not just the number of people who lose healthcare. The folks we should care most about--the people who are making just enough money so they don't qualify for Federal programs but not enough money that they can save for retirement and pay for their kids' college bills and do all the things you need to do in order to lead a respectable life--those people are going to be hurt worst by this bill.  If you are a 64-year-old getting ready for Medicare coverage, you are making $56,000 a year, you are going to pay 170 percent more under this bill just in your premiums, never mind the extra money you are going to pay in copays and deductibles.  The CBO says that if these bills are passed, a single policyholder who purchases a plan at a 58-percent actuarial value in 2026 would have a deductible of roughly $13,000 for medical and drug expenses combined, which is absolutely unaffordable.  By every metric, whether it be the amount of money that you pay or the number of people who do not have healthcare coverage, the CBO answers this question: Who gets hurt under the GOP healthcare plan? Pretty clearly, everybody, unless you are an insurance company, a drug company, or rich. If you are affluent and you can afford your own healthcare, you will be fine. If you are an insurance company or a drug company, you are going to get a big tax cut out of this. But everyone else will get hurt and get hurt really badly.  I have watched my Republican friends process this information. I have watched them, largely, stay silent. The Democrats are the only people on the floor of the Senate these days who are talking about healthcare. Most of my Republican friends are not willing to come down and defend any of these products, but those who have been have shifted their rationale.  Republicans who have been willing to come down and defend their plan concede that millions and millions of people will lose insurance, and they concede that rates will go up for most So they cling to one last value that underpins the Republicans' healthcare plan. In their words, that value is freedom--the freedom not to be insured. The Republicans suggest that you should not really worry about 32 million people losing insurance because those people really did not want insurance and now they will be free not to have it. That is just not what the CBO says. The CBO says that millions and millions of these people who will lose insurance desperately want it; they are just not going to be able to afford it.  It is also not true that the bill grants that kind of freedom. Insurance is compulsory under the Republican healthcare plan just like it is under the Democratic plan. It is just compulsory in a different way. The Republican plan says that as a penalty for not having insurance, you will be banned from purchasing insurance for 6 months. The Affordable Care Act says that if you do not purchase insurance, you will get a penalty on your tax form. Either way, it is a penalty.  Yet a new wrinkle has been thrown into this debate because last week it was ruled that, in a reconciliation, the Republicans cannot include this penalty provision. Without it, the entire[[Page S4158]]bill falls apart. Markets would collapse.  For all of the Republicans' talk about the freedom not to purchase insurance, they included a requirement in their bill that people buy insurance. They know they had to because they know that without it, the entire insurance market would collapse. Why is that? If you require insurance companies to charge the same thing for sick people as for non-sick people, then you have to encourage people who are not sick to buy insurance. If you do not, folks will just wait until they are sick to buy insurance, and the only people who will have insurance will be the people who have acute conditions. That will make insurance itself unaffordable, and insurers will stop offering products, or they will jack up rates to the point that it will be totally unaffordable for everyone.  In the Affordable Care Act, that is what led to the individual mandate. In the Republican healthcare bill, that is what led to this provision that locks you out of insurance for 6 months. But that has been ruled veritable. That has been ruled essentially out of order under reconciliation.  The Republicans are going to be faced with a choice if they are able to get on this bill. They will either remove that provision and guarantee the collapse of the entire insurance market in this country or they will have to strengthen that penalty in order for it to be allowed under reconciliation, but that will essentially rob the last rhetorical argument that the Republicans had in favor of this bill. They cannot argue that it provides more people with insurance. They cannot argue that it helps with cost. They cannot claim that it increases quality. They know that. The only thing left that they could argue is that it allows some people to go without insurance if they do not want it. In truth, their bill does not do that, and the rules of the Senate are going to require that they increase that penalty even more if they want any plausible, workable version of this bill to survive.  It leaves us in a place in which there is no argument to do this. It does not advance values that Republicans hold dear, like personal freedom, it does not improve people's healthcare experiences, and it does not increase the number of people who have healthcare insurance.  It really does beg the question: Why are we doing this? Did anybody come to the Senate with the desire to hurt this many people?  If I had told my Republican colleagues 4 years ago that their ACA replacement plan was going to drive up the number of people without insurance by 32 million and increase rates by 20 percent in year 1, would you have believed it? For 6 years, I took my Republican colleagues at their word. I did not agree with them that we should repeal the Affordable Care Act, but at least I thought they had the same goals in mind as we did--more people having access to the healthcare system and costs being controlled for as many people as possible. It is now clear that we do not. The Republicans are about to vote on a bill that will inflict unthinkable amounts of pain on this country. Who gets hurt under the GOP health plan?  I said this on the floor last week, and I will just say it again to close--that it does not have to be this way. We have accepted for so long that healthcare is a political ping-pong ball that gets tossed from one side to the other every 5 or 10 years.  Why is it so inconceivable that Democrats and Republicans could not sit down together and try to work out keeping the parts of the Affordable Care Act that are working and improving the parts that are not? Why couldn't the Democrats understand that the Republicans want flexibility of benefit design and give Republicans something on that if you understood that we want some certainty of these marketplaces? We do not want President Trump to be able to sabotage and undermine these markets. Why can't there be a compromise and a deal there?  There is still time. If this vote fails tomorrow, there is still the ability for us to come together, because in the end, there is the story Senator Kaine told about rural Everybody here knows that story. Everybody here knows there is enormous work still to be done, and nobody out there is believing the lies about this bill, this wonderful healthcare plan President Trump is promising. Everybody in this country hates this bill. It has a 15-percent approval rate. These folks know there is virtually no one who is helped by this bill other than insurance companies, drug companies, and people who are very affluent and fortunate enough to be healthy.  We do not have a communicable disease on our side of the aisle. We are not going to physically hurt you if you get in a room with us. We actually do deeply desire to improve the healthcare system. You have just got to give us a chance.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgS4139-4.txt,1837,ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION,2017.0,24.0,July
14077,topic-id,684,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to express again, as I did earlier, the support we have for the Capitol Police and others for the good work they do every single day and extend our best wishes to Majority Whip  My friend, Mr.Tiberi, who is managing time on the Republican side, said he was, I think, 17 years old. If he were here and had supported the Clinton healthcare bill, that never would have happened. That would be another way that we might want to look at.  Mr.Speaker, as I said a bit ago, this is an unusual procedure. We are being asked to amend legislation that left the institution. Heaven knows where the Republican healthcare bill rests today. The President calls it mean; the Senate won't tell us where they are, as they write the bill, and when it might emerge; and we find ourselves offering amendments to something that is not going to happen.  H.2579, the Broader Options for Americans Act, would allow premium tax credits to be used for unsubsidized COBRA coverage under Unfortunately, this does nothing to fix the AHCA, the underlying measure this bill intends to amend.  Older Americans are likely to rely on COBRA, and the AHCA would allow insurers to charge older Americans up to five times more than they charge younger The tax credits in H.2579 would not make COBRA coverage any more affordable for the American people. In addition, it could potentially weaken the risk pool coverage because it would encourage older and sicker workers to remain on COBRA that could hurt small businesses. This is simply a backdoor way for States to discriminate against existing conditions.  Because of weakening essential healthcare in the underlying[[Page H4930]]TrumpCare bill, COBRA is going to be needed again to help people who leave employment for health reasons or have preexisting conditions.  Let me remind the American people how we got here in the first place. Last month, Republicans brought TrumpCare to the House floor and passed it without a single Democrat supporting it. The measure, as passed, would take away health insurance for millions of Americans, raise premiums for working families, and place an age tax on older  The bill is just one of the many promises the Republican leadership continues to make in an effort to twist arms for votes from their caucus to pass  I am also concerned that the House ignored important procedures when considering bills that are on the floor today.  First, since the Republican bill passed, the CBO numbers confirmed the measure would force Americans to pay more for lower quality healthcare coverage. That is not in dispute.  Second, this bill is not appropriate to consider now because it amends TrumpCare, and it hasn't even passed the  Even if this bill was incorporated into TrumpCare, it would not undo the terrible cuts included in the measure. It would leave 23 million Americans without health insurance, cut Medicaid by $800 billion, discriminate against individuals with preexisting conditions; and will drastically raise premiums for older  It would unravel important consumer protections or cut programs designed to address the opioid addiction crisis in my State of Massachusetts, and throughout the I am quite certain everyone here and watching this debate has someone close to them dealing with a drug or alcohol addiction.  In addition, many middle class Americans rely on Medicaid for long-term care. That is beginning to resonate with the American people.  This bill does nothing to fix the Republican repeal measure, as I have noted, and it is likely to create more and new problems.  I encourage my Republican friends and colleagues to go back to the drawing board, craft a bill with us, and fix the problems in the Affordable Care There is a chance to do that.  Twenty-three million more Americans have health insurance because of the passage of the Affordable Care Now is not the time to retreat. In times like this, we should be advancing these arguments in this institution for hardworking Americans and their families.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Because most of the intelligence budget involves highly classified programs, the bulk of the Committee's schedule of authorizations and direction are found in the classified annex to the bill. This classified annex has been made available to Members since markup in the House Intelligence Committee spaces.  At the unclassified level, I can report that the overall funding authorized by this bill is slightly below the President's budget request. Furthermore, the bill funds the Military Intelligence Program in line with the levels of the House-passed National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.  The bill implements the first stage of a committee initiative to streamline and optimize defense intelligence beginning with the Defense Intelligence Agency; provides guidelines to guarantee that intelligence community contractors can meet with Congress unhindered; and enhances oversight of intelligence activities by mandating intelligence community reports on threats to Federal elections, leaks of classified information, security clearance processing, and other vital activities.  Mr.Speaker, America faces an international threat matrix more complicated than anything we have endured in the past. The recent, impressive progress made by the U.military and its allies against ISIS in Iraq and Syria has not ended the ISIS terror threat. In fact, based on the group's ability to inspire terror attacks through social media and other means, ISIS could remain a significant threat to the West even after it loses all the territory it controls. Additionally, al-Qaida remains active in Afghanistan and has retained its close links to the resurgent Meanwhile, other threats from belligerent regimes like Iran and North Korea continue to intensify, while instability in failed states like Libya presents pressing security challenges to the U.and our European allies, including through the facilitation of waves of mass migration that provide cover for the movement of jihadists to the  This bill will ensure that the dedicated men and women of our intelligence community have the funding, authorities, and support they need to carry out their mission and to keep us safe, while providing Congress with the tools it needs to provide robust oversight over their actions.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

The bill includes provisions that fall within      the jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland       I recognize and appreciate the desire to bring this      legislation before the House of Representatives in an      expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on      Homeland Security will forego seeking a sequential referral      on this bill. However, this is conditional based on our      mutual understanding that foregoing action on H.3180 at      this time does not prejudice this Committee with respect to      any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matter      contained in this bill or similar legislation.       This waiver is also given with the understanding that the      Committee on Homeland Security expressly reserves its      authority to seek conferees on any provision within its      jurisdiction during any House-Senate conference that may be      convened on this or any similar legislation, and requests      your support for such a request.       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming      this understanding with respect to H.3180, and ask that a      copy of this letter and your response be included in the      Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the      House floor.

Michael McCaul,     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,     Washington,       Dear Chairman McCaul: I received your letter regarding H.     3180, the ``Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year      2018.'' You have asserted that Section 502 of the Act falls      within your jurisdiction because it requests that the      Director of National Intelligence coordinate with the      National Intelligence Program (NIP) funded Department of      Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis (DHS      I&A) to produce a publicly available advisory report on      foreign counterintelligence and cyber threats.       Consistent with our January 11, 2017 exchange of letters,      HPSCI has exclusive jurisdiction over NIP funded DHS I&A      intelligence activities. However, I acknowledge that your      letter in no way diminishes or alters the jurisdiction of the      Committee on Homeland Security with respect to any future      jurisdictional claim over the subject matter contained in the      bill or any similar legislation.       I will include a copy of your letter and this response in      the Congressional Record during consideration of the      legislation on the House Thank you for your assistance      with this matter.

14001,topic-id,3822,"Mr.President, today is an extraordinary day. Today is an auspicious day, for we will be discussing issues of war and peace.  Believe it or not, we rarely discuss such important issues. We have been at war for 15 years. There have been a handful of debates--most of them indirect, most of them forced only under duress, and most of them would have been avoided if the leadership of both parties could avoid them, but today they cannot avoid this debate because this is what is called a privileged motion.  Today we will discuss the involvement of the United States in the Middle East, and we will also discuss whether we should engage in a new war in Today we will discuss an arms sale to Saudi Arabia that threatens the lives of millions of Yemenis, but we will discuss something even more important than an arms sale, we will discuss whether we should be actively involved. Should the United States be actively involved with refueling the Saudi planes, with picking targets, with having advisers on the ground? Should we be at war in Yemen?  If you remember your Constitution, it says no President has that authority--only to repel imminent attack--but no President alone has the unilateral authority to take us to war. Yet here we are on the verge of war.  What will war mean for Yemen? Seventeen million folks in Yemen live on the brink of starvation. I think to myself, is there ever anything important that can happen in Washington? Is there anything I can do to save some of the millions of children who are dying in Yemen? This is it. This is this debate today.  It isn't about an arms sale, it is about children like Ali, who died. Why are they dying? Because the Soviets have blockaded the ports. Ninety percent of Yemen's food comes in from the ocean and they can get no food and they are starving and dying of cholera because of war. We think of famine being related to the weather. Sometimes it is, but more often than not famine is related to man, is manmade, and the most common cause is war.  How bad is it in Yemen? Seventeen million people live on the edge of starvation. Some, like Ali, have already died. What are people saying about it? They say that the humanitarian crisis in Yemen may be worse than  Let me repeat that because nobody in America is listening to this. Everybody is paying attention to some silly show trials and silly stuff going on in committees. Nobody is talking about this at all. They say it is worse than Millions of people have fled Hundreds of thousands have died, and people are now predicting Yemen may be worse.  One refugee group said this: The impending famine in Yemen may reach Biblical proportions. Think about that. It is astounding what is going on there, and it is being done without your permission but with your weapons.  Today I will force a vote with the help of Senator Murphy, who has been a prime mover in this, to tell you the truth, and has done a great job in bringing people together, but we will force this vote for these children in Yemen because we have a chance today to stop the carnage. We have a chance to tell Saudi Arabia we have had enough.  The question is, Should we give money or arms to Saudi Arabia at all? What has Saudi Arabia done over the last 30 years? They have been the 1 exporter of jihadist philosophy, the 1 exporter of let's hate America, let's hate the Judeo-Christian ethic, let's hate the Judeo-Christian tradition. It is coming from Saudi They teach it in the schools in our country. They teach it in the schools in They corrupt the religion of Islam throughout the world, and we are going to give them weapons? I think it is a huge, huge mistake.  If you say: Well, I doubt that. There is no way they are that bad. Don't they share intelligence with us? Don't they help us in the war on terror?  Yes, every time they help us, they hurt us twofold worse. I will give you an example directly from Hillary When she is writing honestly and not talking to the public, she sends an email to John This is one that was leaked through Writing to John Podesta, Hillary Clinton said: We must put pressure on Saudi Arabia and Qatar because they are supplying logistical and financial support to  ISIS is the group we are fighting in the Middle East again, and Saudi Arabia was supplying them. This is according to Hillary Clinton, not indirectly but directly.  Who in their right mind would give money, arms, or share our technology with a country that has been supporting ISIS? Who would do that? Who would think that is a good idea? Yet they will come here and say that it is about Iran, and we have to combat Iran everywhere.  Guess what. This may make the situation with Iran worse. What do you think Iran thinks when Saudi Arabia gets weapons? They think to themselves, well, if the Saudis are getting more, we need more.  What do you think Israel thinks? If the Saudis get more, we need more.  Have you ever heard of an arms race? That is what this is. We are fueling an arms race in the Middle Every side wants more. You say: Well, we have to do this. We have to combat  Do you know how much the Gulf sheikhdoms, Saudi Arabia, and all their allies--the ones who are bombing the hell out of Yemen--do you know how their military spending compares to that of Iran? It is 8 to 1. All of the money is in the Gulf h. All of the power, all of the weapons are in the Gulf sheikhdoms. They have more weapons and spend more on weapons--8 to 1--than  We are going to vote on Iran sanctions this week, and they say that they don't want ballistic missiles Well, I don't either. The best way to do that is to put pressure on Saudi  How would you put pressure on Saudi Arabia? Maybe we wouldn't sell them arms. Maybe we would withhold the sale of arms until they come to the table and we get a ballistic agreement with It is a naive and foolish notion to think that Iran is going to give up on their ballistic weapons. They are never giving up on their ballistic weapons unless Saudi Arabia did the same thing.  People don't talk about this, but Saudi Arabia has ballistic missiles. They have Chinese missiles. They are called the Dongfeng-21 N-3. They have dozens of these. Do you know where they are pointed? Tehran and Tel  Saudi Arabia is no friend of Do they cooperate with Israel some? Yes, but their missiles are pointed at Tel Aviv, Saudi Arabia's other missiles are pointed at Are these missiles nuclear capable? Yes.[[Page S3417]]They are not thought to be nuclear tipped, meaning they haven't been armed with nuclear missiles, but everyone who is in the arms community acknowledges that these missiles could carry a nuclear payload if they were altered. They have the ability to do it.  Should we send arms to Saudi Arabia? Here is another quote from Bob Graham, and this is a paraphrase. He says that there is an abundance of evidence that the Saudis were complicit in 9/11.  Have we forgotten that 15 out of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia? Have we forgotten the missing 28 pages that they kept from the American public for over a decade? When you read those missing 28 pages, which have now been released, they tend to implicate Saudi They tend to indicate that the attackers, particularly in San Diego, were befriended by a government agent for Saudi  There is an abundance of information that implicates Saudi Arabia in 9/11. In fact, less than a year ago, this very Congress voted unanimously or virtually unanimously to let American citizens--the victims of 9/11, their families--sue Saudi This is an extraordinary thing. We almost never let people sue governments, particularly foreign governments, but we voted nearly unanimously. Why? Because people still have sympathy for the 9/11 victims and their families and because people obviously believe there is some information that may implicate Saudi  You say: Oh, no, they have changed. Well, how much could they have changed? It was only a year or two ago Hillary Clinton was writing that email saying that the Saudis are giving financial and logistical support to Who in their right mind would sell arms to Saudi Arabia under those circumstances?  If it doesn't persuade you that the Saudis are supporting ISIL and terrorism and may have been part of 9/11, perhaps we should look not only at the humanitarian disaster in Yemen--what they are doing to the public and that their goal basically is famine, to bring them to submission--but perhaps we should also look at Saudi Arabia as a country. Perhaps we should look at the human rights record of Saudi  I will give you a couple of instances of what it is like to live in Saudi There was a young girl who was 19 years old. They haven't named her because her story is so traumatic. She was 19 years old. They call her the Girl of She was 19 years old, and she was raped by 7 men.  The men were punished, a couple of years in prison. You know what happened? They arrested the victim because, you see, in Saudi Arabia it is your fault if you are raped. In Saudi Arabia, rape victims are arrested, put in prison, and publicly whipped. She was given 6 months in prison and 200 lashes. That was her sentence.  Ultimately, it did not come to the fore. Do you know why? Partly because the United States stood up and said it was wrong and partly because, perhaps behind the scenes, we said: Maybe we are not going to sell you weapons if you behave like a bunch of barbarians.  I will tell you another story about Ali al Nimr, a The Middle East is somewhat divided between Sunni and He is a They are about 10 percent of the public in Saudi They are the minority. They are treated like dirt. His uncle was a sheikh. And by all accounts, he was one who called for peaceful elections, who wasn't an advocate of violence. He never was known or seen to have a weapon but was executed by the Saudis for leading protests. He was executed for standing up in front of people and saying: We should have elections. We should not have this authoritarian government that lords it over us and does not allow us even to practice our religion in public.  Ali's uncle was beheaded. Ali was 17 at the time. It was the beginning of the Arab Spring, and Ali got excited and motivated. If you see the pictures of him, it is heartbreaking. You see pictures of him in western clothing. He liked poetry. He liked music. He was, by all means, the kind of person that we wish would come to leadership in Saudi  At 17, he went to a rally and he chose to be part of the Arab Spring to say: We don't want authoritarianism. We don't want despots. We don't want Kings and all of their lording over us. We want elections.  For that, he was arrested and put on death row. Death row in Saudi Arabia, being Saudi Arabia, includes beheading and crucifixion. That will be his sentence--beheading and crucifixion.  This is the regime that you are being asked to send weapons to. People say: Oh, they are buying them.  The technology is ours. It is American technology that was developed for the defense of this country, and the companies would never have the technology had we not paid them to have it. The American taxpayer has a right to that technology, and while for almost every other good in the marketplace the government has no right to tell you how who to sell it to, arms are different because they are all developed by the U.taxpayer.  I do believe there should be rules about who gets our arms. I don't think we should sell them to Saudi Arabia if they might wind up in the hands of I don't think we should sell them to Saudi Arabia if they punish people for protests, if they punish people for speaking out by beheading them and crucifying them.  I am not for selling them a rifle, much less precision-guided missiles. Some will say: Oh if we give them more accurate missiles, they will kill civilians. That presumes they are not targeting civilians.  Do you think it was a mistake? Do you think they accidently bombed a funeral procession? Do you think their intelligence was so bad they didn't know it was a funeral procession? They killed 125 people at a funeral. They wounded 500. We wonder about why we have so much terrorism. Yes, maybe some hate us inherently, but some of it is blowback to policy.  Do you think the people who died or the people who survived or the relatives of those who died in that funeral procession will ever forget it? They will remember it 100 years from now.  The problem we face is that terrorism goes on and on as long as we keep supporting despots who treat their people like crap, who sentence them to beheading and crucifixion, who are starving their neighboring country, which is one of the poorest nations on the planet  We are not getting better. We are not getting any closer to peace by supporting the It is a huge mistake. The Girl of Qatif, a rape victim, was sentenced to prison and 70 lashes. Ali al Nimr, still on death row, was sentenced to beheading and crucifixion. Raif Badawi, who is he? I don't know much about him, but he is an outspoken blogger. He is somebody who writes his opinion and may have opinions that may not be orthodox. For that, the Saudis arrested him, and he is in jail for 10 years, and he is sentenced to a thousand lashes.  I don't think you can survive a thousand lashes, so the Saudis--in their great humanity--are dividing his treatment into 10 doses. He has already had 100 publicly applied. He has 900 more to go.  Shouldn't we think a little bit about supplying arms to this country? If the human rights aspect of this is not enough, I think we should probably think about the region. There is a problem in the Middle There is conflict. Some of it goes very deep.  Those who live in the Middle East member the Battle of Karbala in 680 A.D., when a grandson of Muhammad and Khalifa came together and had a battle. They still remember, and they are still unhappy about a battle from 680 A.D.; they have long memories.  I am reminded of what one Afghan told a reporter or a soldier recently. He said: You have all the watches, but we have all the time. They live there and have for centuries and will be there when we are gone. They have to fix their own problems. We can occasionally say that we are going to help some people destroy an evil empire or an evil group like ISIS, yes, but the people fighting--the people on the ground--need to be the people who live there. It cannot be foreigners, and it cannot be people whom they consider to be pagans or it is never going to work. Yet we are foolish if we do not look at the repercussions of what it means to sell arms to Saudi  How will Iran react?  I was in a committee hearing the other day, and one of the Senators said: We do not care how Iran reacts. We do not care what it thinks.[[Page S3418]]  By golly, we ought to if we are going to put sanctions on them. Doesn't that mean we care enough that we are trying to modulate and change their behavior? The whole idea of sanctions means that we do care about what Iran thinks. It does not mean we agree with it, it does not mean we condone it, and it does not mean we say Iran is right. But, certainly, we do care about what it thinks. What do you think Iran thinks about supplying arms to Saudi Arabia? It thinks: We need more.  Saudi arms alone are the third biggest in the world now. It is the United States, which is as big as the next 10 combined. Then, it is Then, it is Saudi Saudi Arabia has these other gulf sheikhdoms, despots. They are all allies of ours. There are about five or six of them, and, altogether, they have eight times more weapons than So we are complaining--I think, justifiably so--because we worry about the mischief of Iran in the Middle We are complaining about that, and we want them to change their behavior.  What do you think is the prime reason they create weapons and are creating the ballistic missiles?  Some of it is because they fear our invasion, like in Iraq, but I think a great deal of why Iran develops weapons is its fear of Saudi In fact, when you look back at Iraq and the whole weapons of mass destruction that never existed, one of the interesting stories is that--it may be a theory, but I think it has some evidence--Saddam Hussein pretended, valiantly, that he had weapons of mass destruction not to deter us but to deter Here is Saddam Hussein, sending all of these smoke signals up that he has weapons of mass destruction because he wants to keep Iran at bay.  We think everything is about us, and we never acknowledge that maybe some of it is about the regional politics. When we give weapons or sell weapons to Saudi Arabia, there will be, for every action, a reaction. There will be significantly more pressure for Iran to come forward and have more weapons.  What does it do to our ally Israel?  There have been at least a few reports that say Israel believes that, every time we give a dollar to Saudi Arabia, they need to respond with a dollar and a half. There was a quote from one of their government ministers on this, which reads that he worries about their qualitative edge.  I have a quote here from a colleague of mine--a friend of mine--who is a rabbi and a friend of the  Rabbi Nate Segal writes:       While I understand the President's intentions, we must      proceed with great caution due to the challenges and the      history of the region. At this time, I don't see the benefits      of the arms deal for the United States or  This is coming from someone who believes, with every fiber of his being, that Israel should be defended. He is worried that, by giving weapons to Saudi Arabia, it detracts from the qualitative edge that Israel currently has.  Imagine what would happen if the Government of Saudi Arabia were overthrown. They have billions and billions of dollars of weapons. Many of these weapons are the most sophisticated weapons we have. Is there a chance that they could be overthrown? I don't know. They behead their citizens and crucify them. Do you think anybody who lives in Saudi Arabia might have some pent-up anger for the regime?  William Wilberforce once said of slavery: ``In having heard all this, you can choose to look the other way, but you can never say that you didn't know.''  I love that statement because so many people at the time of slavery looked away. They just said: It is something we do. It is part of our time. It is part of our age.  So many people knew the horror of slavery. So many people knew the horror of what was happening to a people, and they looked away.  I think, in having heard of the impending famine in Yemen, in having seen Ali, and in having heard of the impending famine, you can choose to look away. Many in this body will, today, choose to look away.  They will say: Do you know what? Saudi Arabia gives us some benefit sometime, and we hate Iran more. So let's just give some more weapons to Saudi  They will be looking away from the human rights tragedy that is central to Saudi Arabia's whole being. They will be looking away from the fact that Saudi Arabia was supporting ISIS in the Syrian civil war. They will be looking away from the fact that the Saudi blockade is starving Yemeni children.  Do you know what? I choose not to look away. Today I stand up for the thousands of civilians who are being killed in Today I stand up for the millions of voiceless children in Yemen who will be killed by the Saudi blockade. Today I stand up for saying that we, the United States, should no longer be fueling the arms race in the Middle It has come to no good. The wars and the rage and the anger are thousands of years old. We will never get to the bottom of it. We should defend ourselves at all costs. We should be very careful as to whom is admitted into the country, and we should not get involved in every civil war in every misbegotten part of the planet.  It is my hope and my prayer that enough Americans will wake up and say that we are tired of war, that we are tired of funding every war on the globe, and that we are tired of sacrificing our young in every civil war.  Today this will be a bipartisan vote. There will be a large contingent from the other side of the aisle and a small contingent from this side. This is important. This is a rare day in Senate history, when we actually have the chance to stop an evil, but we will stop this evil by sending a loud message to the President and a loud message to Saudi Arabia that we are not going to blindly support the arms race.  We are not going to be blind to your human rights transgressions, and we are not going to blindly give you weapons in the face of beheading your citizens and crucifying them.  Today I take a stand for those who do not have a voice, and I hope the Senate will think long and hard and will vote against this arms sale to Saudi  The PRESIDING The assistant Democratic leader.

14170,topic-id,507,"Mr.Speaker, we continue to hear about the challenges for college students who borrow more and more to pay higher tuition rates and then are saddled with huge debt loads that they will have great difficulty paying back.  The average debt for a 4-year college student today is nearly $37,000. We need to explore new ways to ensure that every student has the opportunity to go to school, to develop their skills, and then pursue their dreams without feeling deterred by the price tag.  I think we need to look at a new approach, an approach that would help students pay for college. It is a concept known as an income-share agreement. It is a concept that would provide students the funding that they agree to pay back as small, affordable portions of their income over the years following graduation.  Income-share agreements are interest free, and students only will make those payments if they are employed and if they receive an income that meets a certain threshold. This method of financing puts less pressure on students to keep up with fixed high-interest payments while they are faced with job uncertainty.  Rather than accruing debt under the traditional student loan structure, this makes the investment in these students' future more equity-based. Their payments are guaranteed to be affordable, rather than fixed, and a certain price.  This is a much more manageable plan for students, Mr.Speaker, who are eager to get a career underway after graduation and want to make sure that they are putting their degrees into practice in a field that they have studied and have a passion for, rather than feel constrained by the impending weight of paying back loans right away.  That is why I am co-authoring the Investing in Student Success It is modeled after a program at Purdue At Purdue, an average student received a little over $13,000 in funding for tuition, paired with a student promise to pay back that money in 6 to 10 years after graduation in small percentages of their income.  The bill provides a legal framework for private organizations to invest in individual students through implementing similar income-share agreements. Doing so creates more options for payment and increases accessibility for higher education.  Today, the cost of tuition at a public 4-year university is nearly quadruple what it was back in 1974. Due to rising tuition costs and the increased need for a college degree in the workforce, it is more important now, more than ever before, to address the student loan debt crisis and provide students with the resources they need to graduate with minimal loans.  Income-share agreements also provide the flexibility that students need when faced with an uncertain job market and provide an alternative to the traditional student loan repayment structure.  Mr.Speaker, as we look for ways to make higher education more affordable and more accessible, we should be advancing new innovative solutions to help students go to college without that burden of high debt after graduation, and income-share agreements are another way of accomplishing this.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgH6219-2.txt,1930,"'S, EMAILS",2017.0,25.0,July
14191,topic-id,488,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.1372, the Homeland Security for Children  Mr.Speaker, children are not tiny adults, as was stated, but too often that is how the Federal policy treats them when there is not a deliberate effort to do otherwise.  The Department of Homeland Security, through its components, interacts with children regularly, and its policies have a direct impact on them. That is why I introduced H.1372, the Homeland Security for Children  H.1372 would make integrating the unique needs of children a priority at the Department of Homeland The bill directs the DHS Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans to solicit and incorporate feedback from children's organizations into Department-wide policies and activities.  Additionally, H.1372 would formally authorize the existing children's technical expert position at the Federal Emergency Management The position was established by former Administrator Fugate in response to a March 2015 recommendation by the FEMA National Advisory  At the time, the National Advisory Council had concluded that FEMA had made progress integrating the unique needs of children into disaster plans since Hurricane Katrina, despite the fact that it did not have a technical lead to emphasize and address children's issues. As a result, State and local governments and emergency managers were unaware of guidance related to children's needs at the State and local level, leaving children vulnerable.  According to Save the Children, 80 percent of the National Commission on Children and Disasters' recommendations from 2010 still remain open. Whatever progress has been made in integrating the needs of children in disasters, it is clear there is still work left to be done.  H.1372 will ensure FEMA and DHS has the expertise necessary to do its part to ensure the unique needs of children are integrated into relevant activities, plans, and policies.  The legislation has been endorsed by Save the Children, and former Administrator Fugate has said he supports efforts to authorize the children's needs technical expert at  Mr.Speaker, the Homeland Security for Children Act is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable among us are adequately integrated into homeland security and disaster policies planning.  I would like to just state, Mr.Speaker, that this bill has been a long time coming. I was just reminded of its importance by a program that I watched on television the other day about the tornadoes in Oklahoma, where we lost 7 children in a school building that fell. It showed the disarray in the rest of the parents being able to be reunited with their children. This is a timely bill.  Before I yield back, I would like to thank Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for agreeing to exchange letters to expedite consideration of H.1372 on the floor.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-04-25-pt1-PgH2828.txt,2097,"'S, EMAILS",2017.0,25.0,July

14270,topic-id,3100,"Mr.President, it is nice to see you here at 11 p.m. on Monday night. One of the privileges we have of being in the majority is that we get to preside over the U.Senate, so we can listen to all of our colleagues talk to this august body.  I have been in that chair for the last couple of hours. I can't go to bed tonight without putting the record straight in this body. I don't think there is a Member of the U.Senate who doesn't want America to have the best healthcare in the world. The problem is, we have a campaign of disinformation that is underway right now, and it is outrageous. I cannot let it stand.  My mission tonight, very briefly, will be to put some facts on the table, on the record, because we have a lot of innuendo right now, a lot disinformation: Oh, my God, people are going to die.  Let me remind everybody, we are sitting here with a healthcare system that is collapsing. There is no other way to describe it.  Why are we here tonight at 11 p.m.? Before I get to healthcare, I want to remind the American public of why the U.Senate is open tonight. We also did this earlier in the spring because something historic is underway right now in the United States of America and that is this: For the first time in our history, the minority party has not waived a Senate rule that would bypass the time requirements when confirming a nominee by the President of the United Because of that, we today have confirmed only around 29 percent of this President's nominees. The prior President, at this very point in time, had over 70 percent--over 70 percent--almost 300 people. I think the number today is under 50 for this It wasn't until a month or so ago that he could even have a full staff meeting.  By the way, who is running America today? Holdovers from the last administration because we haven't been able to confirm the new nominees. Over 200 people right now stand in line, waiting to be confirmed by this body. It is outrageous.  The American people ought to be upset. They ought to be more than upset. Let's define who is doing that. It is not the majority. The minority party is dragging their feet because it slows down everything else.  Guess what doesn't get done this year if we continue with this schedule. Unless we are here every night, as we are tonight, we will not have time to get to taxes this year. We will not have time to get to what the American people are assuming we are going to get to. Consumer confidence is at a 13-year high[[Page S4162]]because they are anticipating that we are going to clean up some of this mess.  Let me quickly move on to healthcare and put a few facts on the record tonight before we close. There are five healthcare systems in We forget this. We talk only about ObamaCare right now, but there are five healthcare systems in  First, we have group policies. This is where almost the majority--the vast majority are in this. Anyone who works in a company or in a large organization has a group policy.  Then there is the individual market. The individual market is what ObamaCare addresses. It is only 13 percent of the entire healthcare system.  Then there is the  Then there are Medicare and  There are five different systems of healthcare in the United What we are dealing with is the individual market and Medicaid--mostly the individual market.  Let me try to describe the situation as we see it today. In 2008, before the ACA, there were 48 million people in America who did not have insurance. That is a catastrophe by anyone's measure. In the richest country in the history of the world, we had 48 million people who did not have insurance. You could be precluded from having insurance because of a preexisting condition. You could lose your insurance. You couldn't transfer across State lines. If you changed companies, even in group policies, you could be denied coverage under the next employer's policy.  There were real problems. Both sides had responsibility for that, but today after the ACA, 28 million people, as we stand here tonight, still do not have insurance in America--28 million. Of the 20 million who got it, 16 got it only because of the expansion of Medicaid, not because of ObamaCare's work in the individual market; 16 million got it because of the expansion of  All that was, was bribery from the Federal Government to certain States that decided to take the money and run. They didn't do their citizens a full justice. What we see of the remaining 4 million of the 20 million who got insurance during ObamaCare--remember, 16 million got it because of the expansion of Medicaid; of the remaining 4 million, 2 million are like my wife and me.  Do you remember the day when President Obama said that if you like your insurance, you can keep your insurance and if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor? Like most Democrats in the Senate and the House who voted on ObamaCare without reading it, he obviously didn't know what was in the bill because neither of those things were true.  I was canceled. In an individual policy before I ran for the U.Senate, my individual policy as a retiree was canceled, and the only policy we could get under the exchange in ObamaCare included things like vision, hearing, drug rehabilitation. I have never had a problem with that. My wife hasn't either.  By the way, maternity--I met my wife in first grade. We are not having babies at this age. What is that? My rate is almost double because we had to take things in policies that we did not need.  Of the remaining 2 million, 1 million are the most destitute, low-income people who really do need our help, but we have disrupted the entire healthcare system because the Democrats thought that the bigger government approach would work.  How has that worked out in places like the VA? I hear talk now about single payer; I will get to that in a second. If you like the VA, you are going to love a single-payer system because that is exactly what it is.  Let me go on. I have heard a lot of talk in this Chamber tonight about, oh my God, the Republicans are going to hurt people in America--hurt people in  Let me talk about who is hurting people in America today. This is a travesty in itself. We cannot get the information from the We have just now gotten the information from the In 2014, the IRS, under the rules of ObamaCare, fined 8 million people $1.8 billion.  Mr.President, I don't know about you, but I am outraged. I know you are too.  The irony of that is that 85 percent of the people who were fined in 2014--$1.8 billion--85 percent made less than $50,000, and less than half of them made $25,000.  What our Democratic friends did was cram down the throats of Americans this thing called ObamaCare, and then they put fines on people who couldn't afford insurance, and they are the poorest people in our country.  Who is standing for those guys today--the Democrats? Don't you bet. They want a Big Government solution that gives them more power, and they could not care less about the very poor people they claim to champion. I have had enough of it. This is outrageous.  Twenty-two million people are going to lose insurance. That is what they tell us. Let's clean this up right now. The CBO's own estimate says that once you remove the mandate--forget about what else is available. If you just remove the mandate, because the policies are so expensive, 15 million are going to give it up. That is happening today.  By the way, do you know that CBO is using a March 2016 baseline to compare these numbers to? It is outrageous. In business, you would never accept this. Yet today they are determined to be the ``holy grail'' up here. I haven't seen a number come out of the CBO that I would depend on yet. In fact, in 2010, they overestimated the number of people who would sign up for ObamaCare by 12 million people. They missed the estimate by more than 50 percent. This isn't a rounding error. They don't know what they are doing.  Right now, today, we have the same problem. Fifteen million people say they will give up their insurance voluntarily because it is too expensive. That has nothing to do with the new plan. That is because ObamaCare is too expensive.  They also say that 4 million people will give up Medicaid is free. Why would somebody give up Medicaid?  They say ObamaCare is so good and so affordable that they are going to add 5 million people to it. There is no evidence today that would back that claim up. That is not a quantified model outcome. It is the estimate of a person who sits over there and makes this up. The other side is acting like, oh my goodness, this is the ``holy grail.''  Let's talk about this. The premiums under ObamaCare prior to this year, over the last 2 years, are up over 105 percent in They say that the reason premiums are going up is because of uncertainty coming out of the White This year's rates were determined last year, before we even knew this President was going to be a nominee. That is more disinformation.  What I am fed up with is that it sounds like a good story until you see the facts. The premiums in my State alone going into next year are going up 42 percent.  Here is the untold truth: In my State, 96 of 159 counties have only one carrier. That is a monopoly. They can do pretty much whatever they want. That is under ObamaCare, not anything else we are talking about. That is the reality today.  By the way, here is the real comeuppance. Today in my State--and you have the same problem in your State--300,000 people who make less than the poverty rate in my State cannot get insurance today under Forget about what we are talking about to fix this mess. Today under ObamaCare, they can't get insurance--300,000 people in my That is true in every State in our country. That is the untold ugliness of  ObamaCare is hurting people right now. I am tired of hearing the other side talk about how they care for people--they care for people--and then they fine the poorest people in America $1.8 billion. Then they deny 300,000 people in my State access to healthcare. Enough already.  What are we doing about it? Six months ago, this President said that there were four objectives that any healthcare system in America and the individual market had to meet. The first was access. We have already talked about how ObamaCare is failing people who need access to it. The lowest income people in America are being denied insurance under We fixed that. People who want insurance are going to get insurance.  By the way, premiums were the second thing we had to do to try to get costs down because it is becoming too[[Page S4163]]prohibitive. I have sons in the middle of their careers. They can't really afford the insurance they are being offered today. I feel it firsthand in my own life.  Premiums right now, though--if we put into place the suggestions we have on the table right now, the HHS Department has estimated just last week with a very credible model that rates could come down as much as 78 percent in the next 4 years. Has anybody heard the other side remind us of that data point? Why do those rates come down? Because the free-market system gets to act again, instead of being shackled in choices being removed. All of a sudden, now we move into it.  By the way, they talk about these made-up fantasy policies. Wait a minute. I had one of those made-up fantasy policies that you can't get today under It is called catastrophic coverage. For some people with a high deductible, catastrophic coverage--that works. They are denied that today because Big Government knows more about what you need in your personal life.  The third thing we had to do--and this was very important. The second part of this problem is that Medicaid was not on a sustainable path. I am sorry. They have overpromised, and they cannot deliver. There is no way over the next 30 years that we can sustain Just as Medicare and Social Security are going bankrupt, we cannot afford to do what they are promising people we are going to do. They know that. They already know that.  Just like the Great Society, these Big Government programs that they promise all the time are going to work have never worked. The Great Society, the War on Poverty was going to remove poverty from I remember that.  I sit at a desk where that bill was signed by the then-Democratic leader of the Senate, Richard Russell, before it went to the White I am reminded every day of how Big Government has failed the American people. That war on poverty has spent trillions of dollars trying to reduce poverty in Yet, today, the poverty rate is fundamentally the same as it was in 1965 when that was signed into law.  Big Government does not work in situations like this. I lived under a single payer. My son lived under a single payer. This is the alternative they are after. I have heard it mentioned three times on the floor of the Senate tonight. We cannot go there. It bifurcates delivery. It would add $3.2 trillion. That is more than we spend on all of our mandatory expenses today--$3.2 trillion every single year. That is impossible. If you think that would work, imagine this. Go home and look at your tax bill. Whatever you paid the Federal Government last year, double it. That is what that would mean. It is not workable.  The fourth thing we had to do was make sure preexisting conditions were protected. I worried about that through my entire career. If I changed jobs, if I had been sick or my family had been sick, I might have been denied insurance. We can't allow that. This bill doesn't allow that. We protected preexisting conditions. We put Medicaid on a sustainable path for the long term. We also bring premiums down. That was a major priority here. And we give everybody in America access to healthcare--period, end of the conversation.  That is not good enough. The other side is not going to be happy until this Federal Government steps in and takes over 18 percent of our economy called healthcare. They tried to do it in 1992 to 1994, under They tried to do it here. I remember the Speaker of the House saying: If you want to know what is in this bill, you have to vote for the bill. We are not doing that today. This cloud of innuendo that the other side has perpetrated on the American people is just not true.  In 2010, not one Republican voted for Not one amendment got to the floor of this Yet they want to talk about this great open policy. They had 7 years to fix this mess. People in my State have been hurt by it. It is unforgivable, and we can do something about it this week.  Senator John McCain is very sick. He is a fighter. He will take care of this. I hope he will be back this week to help us. If he can, I think he will. We are going to vote on it this week. We have to do this for the American people.  I want to remind everybody what is at stake here. If we don't pass this tomorrow, then we end up moving toward a single-payer system. Let me remind everybody of the other Big Government failures we talk about: the VA and the Postal Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are bankrupt. We talk about the ObamaCare failures. Then there is the Great Society of rural poverty. I want to remind everybody.  Let me close with this. I heard tonight that this is a reckless action, the new policy. I heard New Testament examples about how to take care of your brethren. It is shocking to me that somebody on the other side would say that when they know these statistics of what they have done--8 million of the poorest people in America have been fined $1.8 billion. Half of them make under $25,000 a year. That is taking care of your brethren all right. I am embarrassed. We can fix that.  I believe we heard the rain of devastation: No one is helped by this bill; it is a reckless act. Here is the one I love: We want to work with you. We want to work with you to help fix this thing. Just a year ago, I didn't hear any speeches in here--I don't think you did from that Chair--where anybody on that side acknowledged that there was anything wrong with You hear today: We want to work with you to help fix It is 7 years too late, in my opinion. It would have been nice to have been included in the conversation in 2009 and 2010 when it was crammed down the throats of  I believe this is a historic moment in America, not just for healthcare. Healthcare is very important, but it is bigger than that. This is about the direction of our country. Are we going to try to trust Big Government again and again until we can't afford it? We are already well down that rabbit hole. We cannot afford this chance again. We have already proven it doesn't work.  I hope that this week colleagues on our side will get together and we will vote this thing in. I welcome any Democratic support as well. I know we are not going to get it. This is a time to stand. I hope we will have that vote. I fully encourage my colleagues here to support that. Let's get on with business.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgS4139-4.txt,2286,"'S, EMAILS",2017.0,24.0,July

14022,topic-id,226,"Mr.Speaker, today is World Press Freedom Day, a day that deserves commemoration now more than ever.  Undermining the credibility of the free press and attempting to turn the American people against the media is reminiscent of authoritarian tactics, not the conduct of the leader of the free world. Yet the President has referred to the press as the ``enemy of the people'' for simply doing their job: reporting the facts and holding all of us accountable.  He has also dismissed distinguished publications as fake news, again, for simply doing their job and has threatened to change libel laws that will weaken the First Amendment, making it easier for him to attack and sue the press.  This antagonistic relationship between the President and the press is not only beneath the dignity of the office, it is also dangerous for our democracy. We have seen strongmen and autocratic countries suppress the media through intimidation and by discrediting the integrity of the very institution of journalism.  It is hard to believe that I have to say this in this country at this point in our history, but as Thomas Jefferson said: ``Our liberty cannot be guarded but by the freedom of the press, nor that be limited without danger of losing it.''

The first 100 days of an administration offer a chance to watch a new President turn proposed policy changes into reality. In southwestern Pennsylvania, we are seeing President Trump fulfill his pledge to end the war on coal, and we are seeing real change.  For example, the very day that President Trump signed legislation overturning one of former President Obama's anti-coal rules, a coal company in Somerset County announced it would open a brand-new coal mine that will create at least 70 new middle class jobs. It would be great if President Trump can make it out to the mine's grand opening ceremony scheduled for June 8.  I have met with miners as their mines were closed during the previous administration, and I listened to their stories as they worried about their kids and paying their mortgages.

14007,topic-id,1457,"Mr.President, I rise to speak in support of the Murphy-Paul-Franken resolution of disapproval and to outline my concerns about the unfettered sale of arms to Saudi The Saudi-led war in Yemen has created a humanitarian disaster in one of the region's poorest countries. Many thousands of civilians have been killed, many more made homeless, and millions are at risk of starvation, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The chaos in Yemen has also been strategically disastrous for the United States, providing fertile ground for extremist groups like al-Qaida and ISIS and creating new opportunities for Iranian intervention.  In addition to being morally indefensible and strategically shortsighted, the Trump administration's unconditional support for the Saudi coalition, including billions of dollars in arms sales, risks dragging the United States into yet another war in the Middle  These are the reasons I strongly support the resolution of disapproval offered by my colleagues and their effort to block some of these arms sales to Saudi  I also think it is long past time that we begin to take a very hard look at our relationship with Saudi This is a country that is run by a hereditary monarchy in which women are treated as third-class citizens.  I would like to mention for a moment the case of Loujain Alhathloul, a Saudi Arabian human rights activist who was arrested at King Fahd International Airport on June 4. She has been an advocate for women's rights in Saudi  In 2014, she was arrested for defying the country's ban--are you ready for this--on women drivers and imprisoned for 73 days.  In 2015, she ran as a candidate in a local council election--the third in the nation's modern history and the first in which women were allowed to both[[Page S3424]]vote and run--even though her name was never added to the ballot.  More recently, Alhathloul criticized a Saudi Government-sponsored women's empowerment summit, which was attended by Ivanka Trump, for its lack of inclusiveness.  While she has now been released from jail--and I am very glad to hear that--this is no way to treat a peaceful dissident. The human rights organization Amnesty International reported that during her detention, Alhathloul was not allowed access to an attorney, nor was allowed to speak to her family.  Finally and perhaps more significantly, it is important that here on the floor of the Senate, we begin to discuss the decades-long effort by Saudi Arabia to export an ultra-reactionary form of Islam throughout the world.  A recent piece in the Boston Globe by Stephen Kinzer, a journalist who has covered the Middle East for many years--Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have his article printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Boston Globe, June 11, 2017]                Saudi Arabia Is Destabilizing the World                          (By Stephen Kinzer)       Just a few months ago, the governor of Indonesia's largest      city, Jakarta, seemed headed for easy reelection despite the      fact that he is a Christian in a mostly Muslim country.      Suddenly everything went violently wrong. Using the pretext      of an offhand remark the governor made about the Koran,      masses of enraged Muslims took to the streets to denounce      him. In short order he lost the election, was arrested,      charged with blasphemy, and sentenced to two years in prison.       This episode is especially alarming because Indonesia, the      world's largest Muslim country, has long been one of its most      tolerant. Indonesian Islam, like most belief systems on that      vast archipelago, is syncretic, gentle, and open-minded. The      stunning fall of Jakarta's governor reflects the opposite:      intolerance, sectarian hatred, and contempt for democracy.      Fundamentalism is surging in This did not happen      naturally.       Saudi Arabia has been working for decades to pull Indonesia      away from moderate Islam and toward the austere Wahhabi form      that is state religion in Saudi The Saudis' campaign      has been patient, multi-faceted, and lavishly financed. It      mirrors others they have waged in Muslim countries across      Asia and       Successive American presidents have assured us that Saudi      Arabia is our friend and wishes us well. Yet we know that      Osama bin Laden and most of his 9/11 hijackers were Saudis,      and that, as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote in a      diplomatic cable eight years ago, ``Donors in Saudi Arabia      constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni      terrorist groups worldwide.''       Recent events in Indonesia shine a light on a Saudi project      that is even more pernicious than financing terrorists. Saudi      Arabia has used its wealth, much of which comes from the      United States, to turn entire nations into hotbeds of radical      By refusing to protest or even officially acknowledge      this far-reaching project, we finance our own assassins--and      global terror.       The center of Saudi Arabia's campaign to convert      Indonesians to Wahhabi Islam is a tuition-free university in      Jakarta known by the acronym All instruction is in      Arabic, given mainly by preachers from Saudi Arabia and      nearby countries. Genders are kept apart; strict dress codes      are enforced; and music, television, and ``loud laughter''      are forbidden. Students learn an ultraconservative form of      Islam that favors hand amputation for thieves, stoning for      adulterers, and death for gays and blasphemers.       Many of the students come from the more than 100 boarding      schools Saudi Arabia supports in Indonesia, or have attended      one of the 150 mosques that Saudis have built there. The most      promising are given scholarships to study in Saudi Arabia,      from which they return fully prepared to wreak social,      political, and religious havoc in their homeland. Some      promote terror groups like Hamas Indonesia and the Islamic      Defenders Front, which did not exist before the Saudis      arrived.       Eager to press his advantage, King Salman of Saudi Arabia      made a nine-day trip to Indonesia in March, accompanied by an      entourage of 1,500. The Saudis agreed to allow more than      200,000 Indonesians to make the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca each      year--more than come from any other country--and sought      permission to open new branches of their LIPIA university.      Some Indonesians are pushing back against the Saudi assault      on their traditional values, but it is difficult to deny      permission for new religious schools when the state is not      able to provide decent secular alternatives. In Indonesia, as      in other countries where the Saudis are actively promoting      Wahhabism--including Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bosnia--the      weakness and corruption of central governments create pools      of rootless unemployed who are easily seduced by the promises      of free food and a place in God's army.       The surging fundamentalism that is transforming Indonesia      teaches several lessons. First is one that we should already      have learned, about the nature of the Saudi government. It is      an absolute monarchy supported by one of the world's most      reactionary religious sects. It gives clerics large sums to      promote their anti-Western, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic      brand of religious militancy abroad. In exchange, the clerics      refrain from criticizing the Saudi monarchy or its thousands      of high-living princes. Saudis with close ties to the ruling      family give crucial support to groups like Al Qaeda, the      Taliban, and This fact should be at the front of our      minds whenever we consider our policy toward the Middle      East--including when we decide whether to side with the      Saudis in their new dispute with neighboring       Saudi Arabia's success in reshaping Indonesia shows the      importance of the global battle over ideas. Many in      Washington consider spending for cultural and other ``soft      power'' projects to be wasteful. The Saudis feel differently.      They pour money and resources into promoting their world      view. We should do the same.       The third lesson that today's Indonesia teaches is about      the vulnerability of democracy. In 1998 Indonesia's      repressive military dictatorship gave way to a new system,      based on free elections, that promised civil and political      rights for all. Radical preachers who would previously have      been imprisoned for whipping up religious hatred found      themselves free spread their poison. Democracy enables them      to forge giant mobs that demand death for apostates. Their      political parties campaign in democratic elections for the      right to come to power and crush democracy. This is a      sobering reality for those who believe that one political      system is best for all countries under all circumstances.       The Saudi campaign to radicalize global Islam also shows      that earth-shaking events often happen slowly and quietly.      The press, focused intently on reporting today's news, often      misses deeper and more important stories. Historians of      journalism sometimes point to the northward ``great      migration'' of African-Americans after World War II as an      epochal story that few journalists noticed because it was a      slow process rather than one-day news event.       The same is true of Saudi Arabia's long campaign to pull      the world's 1.8 billion Muslims back to the 7th century. We      barely notice it, but every day, from Mumbai to Manchester,      we feel its effects.

14008,topic-id,342,"Mr.President, this article by Mr.Kinzer used the example--this is just one example--of Indonesia to demonstrate the incredibly negative impact Saudi financing has had in many places around the world.

14263,topic-id,2791,"Mr.President, I do not know--and I don't know if anyone knows--whether the Republican so-called healthcare legislation will pass tomorrow, whether the beginning of the debate will take place or whether it will not. I don't know that, but this I do know. The legislation being proposed--and by the way, we still don't know what that legislation is. In general, what we do know is that the legislation being proposed is the cruelest, most destructive, and irresponsible piece of legislation ever brought to the U.Senate in the modern history of our country.  I know the media focuses on, do the Republicans have the votes, how is this Senator going to vote, how is that Senator going to vote? All of that is interesting to those of us inside the beltway. The far more important issue--which we don't discuss enough; the media doesn't cover enough--is what this legislation actually would do if it were implemented.  Right now, unique among major countries on Earth, we do not guarantee healthcare to all people as a right. The result of that is that we now have today--before this disastrous legislation--28 million Americans who have no health insurance and even more who have high deductibles and high copayments, preventing them from getting to a doctor when they should.  We have a bad situation now. It is better today than before the Affordable Care Act was passed, when we had over[[Page S4152]]50 million people without insurance, but no one suggested what we have today is where we should be. Yet we have 28 million people uninsured. The Republican solution to this problem is to throw another 22 million people off of the health insurance that they currently have.  I want the American people to, for one moment, put themselves in the place of someone tonight who may be watching what we are talking about here, who has cancer, who has heart disease, who has diabetes or some other life-threatening illness. Millions of people are in that position. They are struggling for their lives right now. They are under treatment. They are thinking, what happens if this Republican bill is passed? Will I live and continue to get the treatment that I need or will I die?  I think there are very few Members of the Senate who have met with their constituents on this issue, who have not seen people break into tears, asking: What is going to happen to me or my children or my parents?  We did a teleconference townhall a few weeks ago in We had some 16,000 people on the line, and a woman whose kid has a very, very serious illness called. The cost of the prescription drugs are off the chart. She asked: What is going to happen to my child if this bill goes through?  Do you know what? I didn't have the guts to tell her what might happen to her child. I don't want to be on the phone telling any person in Vermont or in America that their child might die because of the legislation that might proceed tomorrow.  This legislation would cut Medicaid by almost $800 billion over a 10-year period, taking healthcare away from lower income and working-class families, including many children with special needs, kids with Down syndrome, kids who have serious emotional problems, kids whose lives now depend on When you cut Medicaid by $800 billion, many of those children will lose coverage entirely or receive significantly fewer benefits.  This legislation, when we cut Medicaid by $800 billion, will have a severe and dramatic impact on nursing homes all over A lot of people don't know this, but if your mom has Alzheimer's and is in a nursing home or your dad has a terminal illness and is in a nursing home, guess what: Medicaid pays almost two-thirds of the costs associated with nursing home care in What happens to the people in nursing homes when you slash Medicaid? How many of them will get thrown out of the nursing homes? Where do they go? Are families in America, working-class families, going to be forced to make the choice of whether they take care of their parents or whether they send their kids to college? Those are the choices that working-class families may have to make if this horrific legislation gets passed.  This legislation would dramatically decrease funding for the opioid and heroin epidemic that is sweeping this country, including my State of Vermont, including Kentucky, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Ohio, and States all over the country that are struggling with the opioid addiction problem.  The program that provides the most funding to help deal with addiction treatment and addiction prevention happens to be What happens to our efforts to try to get a handle on this terrible, terrible epidemic sweeping our country when you make massive cuts to Medicaid?  I found it amusing that when Donald Trump ran for President--oh, he was a great friend of the working class. He was going to stand up for the working class. Let me mention to workers all over this country who are in their sixties that if this legislation passes, your premiums are going to go up dramatically. That is one of the reasons the AARP strongly opposes this legislation.  If you live in Baltimore, for example, where I was this morning, speaking to the NAACP--in Baltimore, if you are 60 years of age and you make $40,000 a year, your average health insurance premiums will go up from about $4,000 a year now to $8,800 per year, more than double. If you are a 62-year-old worker, making $40,000 a year--not a lot of money--how are you going to pay that?  Remember, all that Donald Trump said about what a great friend of the working class he was. This legislation would defund Planned  I get a kick out of hearing my Republican friends talk about choice, freedom. Oh, my goodness, they love choice and freedom. They want the American people to go to any place they want to go. It is all about what America is about. Two and a half million women have made a choice, and the choice they have made is that they want to get their healthcare from Planned That choice, that freedom would be taken away from them, starting tomorrow, if this legislation is passed.  When you think about insurance, you think that insurance is about covering you in your time of need. Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, many millions of the American people could not get the health insurance they needed to address their particular healthcare crisis. If you had a heart disease, if you had breast cancer, if you had diabetes, the insurance companies would say: We are in the business of making money. Why on God's Earth would we want to insure you if you had breast cancer 5 years ago and it is possible it might recur? That is a losing proposition for us.  That is what insurance companies want to do. They are not in the business of providing healthcare. They are in the business of making money. They denied, unbelievably--think about how crazy this is; they actually would deny coverage to people who had preexisting conditions.  I have problems with the Affordable Care It is far, far from perfect. It did end that obscenity of allowing insurance companies not to cover people who had preexisting conditions--something that is quite unbelievable.  Guess what. If this legislation is passed, in all likelihood, many people in this country with preexisting conditions will not be able to get healthcare that they need at a price they can afford. We don't quite know how many of them will die. Nobody can make that prediction.  I want to read for you a very interesting article that appeared from an institution called PolitiFact is an entity that tries to keep a check on what politicians say. They look at you and you make a statement, and they say: Is this true or is this guy not telling the truth? I was on a TV program called ``Meet the Press'' a number of weeks ago. I said: Well, you know, if this Republican legislation is passed, thousands of Americans will die.  And my Republican colleagues and the rightwing media said: Bernie Sanders is engaging in hyperbole. He is exaggerating. Who wants to see anybody die?  I know nobody here wants to see anybody die. Of course not. No Republican does. No Democrat does. No Independent does. But we have to look at the consequences of what we do.  So what PolitiFact did was take a look at the studies to see whether I was telling the truth.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the PolitiFact article be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From www.politifact.com, June 27, 2017]  Bernie Sanders' Projection of Thousands' of Deaths From Lost Health                        Coverage Is Well-Supported                          (By Louis Jacobson)       During an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Bernie      Sanders, I-VT., didn't hold back in his criticism of      Republican efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act: He      said such legislative efforts will literally be deadly.       ``What the Republican proposal (in the House) does is throw      23 million Americans off of health insurance,'' Sanders told      host Chuck ``What a part of Harvard University--the      scientists there--determine is when you throw 23 million      people off of health insurance, people with cancer, people      with heart disease, people with diabetes, thousands of people      will die.''       Sanders continued, ``I wish I didn't have to say it. This      is not me. This is study after study making this point. It is      common sense.''       Even if it seems like common sense that insurance would      save lives, would it be on the scale of ``thousands,'' as      Sanders said? And would legitimate studies show that?                          studying the studies       When we contacted Sanders' office, spokesman Josh Miller-     Lewis cited two sources.       One is the ``Harvard study'' Sanders mentioned--published      on June 22, 2017, by the liberal Center for American      It was[[Page S4153]]     coauthored by a Harvard professor of social epidemiology; two      medical students who graduated from Harvard's T.Chan      School of Public Health, and two policy specialists at the      Center for American       To come up with their estimates, the authors of the      Harvard-Center for American Progress report adapted the      results of a peer-reviewed 2014 study of the Massachusetts      state health care law--a law that was a model for the      Affordable Care The 2014 study was lead-authored by      Harvard professor Benjamin       The Harvard-Center for American Progress study projected      that there would be one excess death for every 830 people who      lose coverage as a result of the Using Congressional      Budget Office projections of the impact of the House version      of the bill, the authors estimated an additional 217,000      deaths over the next decade, or 21,700 per year.       The second piece of evidence Sanders' office cited was an      op-ed by yet more health policy specialists who are      affiliated with Harvard--David Himmelstein and Steffie      Woolhandler, who are professors of public health at Hunter      College-City University of New York as well as lecturers at      Harvard Medical       The op-ed--published on 23, 2017, well before either      chamber's Republican health care bill was introduced--used as      its basis a different study lead-authored by This      2012 study tracked what happened after states expanded            Adapting the findings of the 2012 study to a scenario in      which 20 million Americans lost coverage--which turned out to      be lower than what the CBO found for the House bill--     Himmelstein and Woolhandler estimated that there would be      43,956 deaths annually due to the GOP's health policy      changes.       It's worth noting, however, that both of these projections      come from the ideological left. As we noted, the Center for      American Progress is a liberal think tank. And Himmelstein      and Woolhandler are founders of Physicians for a National      Health Program, a group that advocates for single-payer      national health insurance--a proposal that is even further to      the left than the Affordable Care       So can Sanders' assertion be supported by the peer-reviewed      literature alone?                         What prior studies say       In our previous fact-checking of this issue, we found at      least seven academic papers that detected a link between      securing health insurance and a decline in mortality. Here's      a rundown.       In 2002, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists      convened by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine      estimated that 18,000 Americans had died in 2000 because they      were uninsured. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research      associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that      sought to update the IOM study with newer data. Replicating      the study's methodology, Dorn concluded that the figure      should be increased to 22,000.       A 2009 American Journal of Public Health study concluded      that a lack of health insurance ``is associated with as many      as 44,789 deaths in the United States, more than those caused      by kidney disease.''       Three studies looked at state-level expansions of Medicaid      and in each case found ``significant'' improvements in      mortality after such expansions of coverage. These include a      2012 New England Journal of Medicine study of New York,      Maine, and Arizona by Harvard researchers, and a 2014 study      of Massachusetts by researchers from Harvard and the Urban      (These were the two articles that formed the basis      of the analyses cited by Sanders' staff.)       A 2014 study published by the blog of the health policy      publication Health Affairs looked at states that, at the      time, had declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable      Care It estimated that the 25 states studied would have      collectively avoided between 7,000 and 17,000 deaths.       A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found      improved survival rates for young adults with cancer after      securing insurance under the Affordable Care       A 2017 study in the journal Medical Care looked at a      provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows young adults      to be covered under a parent's policy. The study found a      decline in mortality among this population from diseases      amenable to preventive treatment. (Mortality from trauma,      such as car accidents, saw no decrease, as would be      expected.)       We found two papers with results that were more equivocal.       A paper published in April 2009 in HSR: Health Services      In it, Richard Kronick of the Department of Family      and Preventive Medicine at the University of California (San      Diego) School of Medicine, raised questions about the      conclusions of the seminal Institute of Medicine study from      2002. Kronick's study adjusted the data--as the IOM had not--     for a number of demographic and health factors, including      status as a smoker and body mass index, and found that doing      so removed the excess number of deaths found in the original      study.       A 2013 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine      coauthored by Katherine Baicker of Harvard University      compared about 6,000 patients in Oregon who got coverage      through a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn't.      While the study found improvements in out-of-pocket medical      spending and lower rates of depression among those who got      coverage, key benchmarks for physical health--including blood      pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar--did not improve in      such patients.       But even the two lead authors of the more equivocal studies      have told us that the scholarly record demonstrates that      having health insurance saves lives, and that not having      insurance can lead to additional deaths.       We asked several of the authors of these papers whether      they believe Sanders' assertion of ``thousands'' of deaths is      generally supported by the scholarly evidence. We heard back      from three of them.       `` `Thousands' is completely fair,'' Dorn said.       Baicker agreed. ``It is of course difficult to pin down an      exact number of deaths that would be caused by a specific new      policy,'' she said. ``But a number like `thousands' does not      seem unreasonable, based on the available evidence.''       And Sommers--whose work formed the indirect basis of the      studies cited by Sanders--concurred.       ``I agree that it's challenging to pin down an exact number      on this,'' Sommers said. But overall, the academic evidence      ``certainly gets you into the range of thousands of deaths      per year.''                               Our ruling       Sanders said, ``When you throw 23 million people off of      health insurance--people with cancer, people with heart      disease, people with diabetes--thousands of people will die.      . . . This is study after study making this point.''       Sanders' statement on Meet the Press was phrased generally      enough to be defensible. We found ample evidence in the      academic literature to suggest that legislation on the scale      of the House bill would produce ``thousands'' of additional      deaths.       That said, we can't say with any specificity how many      deaths will occur. It's important to note that the studies      provide estimates only, and each study found a slightly      different result. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly       ",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgS4139-4.txt,1010,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018--MOTION TO,2017.0,24.0,June

Quoting again from PolitiFact:       So can Sanders' assertion be supported by the peer-reviewed      literature alone?  Then they cite some studies.       In 2002, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists      convened by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine      estimated that 18,000 Americans had died in the year 2000      because they were uninsured.

A 2009 American Journal of Public Health study concluded      that a lack of health insurance ``is associated with as many      as 44,789 deaths in the United States, more than those caused      by kidney disease.''  And on and on it goes. This is not Bernie Sanders talking; this is scientific and medical study after medical study saying what is obvious--that if you have a life-threatening disease and cannot get healthcare, you will die.  So I would hope that my Republican colleagues, as they vote tomorrow, understand the consequences of their vote. I know no Republican--nobody here--wants to see anybody die, but when you take 23 million people off of the health insurance they have, many thousands of those people will die.  I think most Americans would think that when you are dealing with an[[Page S4154]]issue like healthcare, which impacts, by definition, every single person in our country, and when you are dealing with an issue that impacts about one-sixth of the American economy--over $3 trillion a year--that you just might want to have some serious discussions on that issue. You might want to ask--here is a radical idea--doctors what they think about this legislation. What is it going to mean to their patients? Wow, that is a pretty radical idea when dealing with healthcare for all the American people. You might want to have one hearing, maybe, and say to doctors: Doctors, what do you think about this bill?  What about hospitals? How will this bill impact hospitals, especially rural hospitals in Vermont, Virginia, and all across this country? You might want to talk to a hospital administrator. You might want to talk to a patient advocate, maybe somebody from the American Cancer Society or somebody who is active in the diabetes effort. You just might want to talk to the experts on healthcare as to how this legislation might impact the work they do. But, amazingly, in an unprecedented way, this legislation was written behind closed doors. I think it was 12, 13 Republican Senators who wrote this bill. Most Republican Senators don't even know what is in this bill, let alone Democrats and let alone the American people.  How do you write legislation that impacts every American, one-sixth of the economy, and not have one public hearing to hear from those most knowledgeable about healthcare in America? But that is exactly what the Republican leadership has done. I know why they did that. It is not a secret. If you had a horrific piece of legislation, trust me, you would want as little public discussion as possible. You would try to hide what this bill does. I understand that. Yet, despite all of that, it turns out that virtually every major healthcare organization in America opposes this bill.  I don't know how you can go forward with legislation that has had zero public hearings, that is opposed overwhelmingly by the American people--last poll that I saw from USA TODAY had 12 percent support for this legislation--and go forward with legislation opposed by every major healthcare organization in This bill is opposed by the AARP, the largest senior group in It is opposed by the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, the Catholic Health Association, the American Lung Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National MS society; and the American Nurses In other words, virtually every major healthcare organization does not want to see this bill passed.  The American people overwhelmingly do not want to see this bill passed. So how come it might pass? People don't want it. Healthcare organizations don't want it. Who wants it? I will tell how wants it--people who are going to get tax breaks. They think it is a great idea. Billionaires who got $200 billion in tax breaks from the House bill think it is an extraordinary idea. So what if 23 million people lose their health insurance from the House bill. The top one percent will get $200 billion in tax breaks. Large healthcare corporations like it. The insurance companies and the drug companies are going to get a combined hundreds of billions of dollars.  I will tell you who else likes it: those people associated with the Koch brothers who are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on elections. They like it because their ideology, their philosophy is that government should play no role in the concerns of the American people. Mark my words--if this bill, which would cut Medicaid by $800 billion, passes, Medicare will be next. And in the House, they have already passed legislation that would voucherize Social Security will not be far behind. That is the ideology of the Koch brothers and the people who fund the Republican Their concern is with large campaign contributors, not the American people.  I hope very much that tomorrow when we assemble here--I gather in the afternoon--for a vote, the Republicans will think more about people in their own State, about their children, the elderly, the sick, and not just about their campaign contributors.

14269,topic-id,1354,"Mr.President, the Senate Republicans are about to take one of the most reckless actions in Senate history. They are going to vote to blow up the American healthcare system and do I don't know what next.  I want to be really clear about this. Never before has the Senate voted on major legislation that would reorder one-sixth of the American economy and impact tens of millions of American families without even knowing what the bill does. There has been no bipartisanship. There have been no hearings.  Let me just say something about hearings. This may seem like sort of a process or procedural complaint, but this very much matters. Hearings matter because it is how you get experts to tell you whether your bill is any good, whether it is smart or stupid, harmful or helpful. Hearings matter because they subject your bill and the process to public scrutiny. The media is able to report on what you are up to, and your constituents know what you are up to. So it is not a small thing to complain about no hearings. In fact, you can't be a good legislator without having hearings, and you can't be an effective legislative body without conducting public hearings. We never have major legislation without hearings, but that is exactly what they are doing, and there is one very simple reason for this. They are embarrassed by what is in this bill.  It is true we don't know exactly what is in this bill. There are lots and lots of versions and lots of notions being kicked around, but we can be sure of a few things.[[Page S4161]]  First, we know this; that whatever problems there are with the Affordable Care Act, this bill doesn't even bother to try to fix them. To the extent that people are worried about high deductibles, it actually increases the deductibles. To the extent that people are worried about the lack of choices on the healthcare exchanges, it doesn't even try to fix that.  Second, we don't know exactly how much they are going to cut Medicaid, but they are going to cut Whether it is rolling back the Medicaid expansion or making these radical structural reforms, essentially block-granting Medicaid to the States, they are going to deeply cut This hurts people. It hurts people in nursing homes. It hurts people with drug addiction. Medicaid is a program that works and delivers care for millions of Americans, and it will be slashed massively tomorrow.  We also don't know whether they are going to keep the capital gains tax cut or get rid of it. In any case, they are going to get rid of most of the revenue in the Affordable Care They are cutting taxes for the very wealthy, and the way they pay for that is to cut So under the guise of fixing the ACA, they do the thing they wanted to do all along--cut taxes, cut It has nothing to do with ACA: cut taxes, cut That is what the bill tomorrow will do. I don't care if it is the 2015 version. I don't care if it is I don't care if it is a new Senate version. I don't care if it is Cruz's. All this cuts taxes for the wealthy and cuts That is what this legislation does.  Americans are going to be hurt by this legislation; people with preexisting conditions, families with a loved one struggling with opioid abuse, people in nursing homes, people who rely on Medicaid, people who rely on Planned The tens of millions of people who will lose their insurance almost instantly. That is why every single patient advocacy group, from the American Cancer Society to the March of Dimes, to the National Physicians Alliance, to disability groups, to the AARP--everybody hates this bill. Make no mistake, they hate every version of it.  It is not like there is a less harmful version. Either 22 million or 23 million or 32 million lose their healthcare. We don't have to do this to ourselves. We don't have to do this to the American people.  So there are lots of different versions of this legislation. What the leader is doing, very cleverly, is allowing people to believe that the thing they are moving to is the thing they may prefer. In other words, it is a blank canvas. It is just a motion to proceed. It is just a motion to begin debate.  Make no mistake, the vote tomorrow is to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no plan to replace it. That is what they are doing tomorrow, and they have been totally secretive because they know the moment they start talking specifics, the whole thing comes crashing down.  There are core elements of this vote tomorrow that are true no matter what. It cuts Medicaid; it cuts taxes for the rich; it reduces patient protections; it reduces the number of people who have insurance; and it will all be done with no hearings, no Democrats, no experts in healthcare. This thing will be dropped on us without enough time to review it, without enough time to interact with our home State to figure out what the impact would be.  We are being asked to do one of the most reckless things any group of legislators has ever been asked to do, which is to jump off a policy cliff--a healthcare cliff, a political cliff--and eventually they are going to tell you it is going to work out. Make no mistake, the reason they can't tell you what is in the bill is the moment they do, this thing will come crashing down.  What we have to do is make sure this thing comes crashing down anyway, and we have to do it for the tens of millions of Americans who depend on Medicaid and the We have to do it for our rural hospitals, we have to do it for people with preexisting conditions, and we have to do it for people without power, without money, without the ability to walk 200 yards from this Chamber to the U.Senate doctor, the best healthcare in the world.  Not only are we on the exchange--I have a Kaiser plan so we are on the exchange, we are in ACA--but also, anytime I want, if I have a headache, if I have a stomach ache, if I have something more serious, I can literally walk about 200 yards from here, go to the Senate doctor, and get whatever kind of healthcare I need.  I want you to understand how lucky the people who are voting on your future are and how privileged we all are in this literally gilded place, when people's lives and livelihoods and life savings are on the line tomorrow, and if I get so much as a hangnail, I get to call my staff and have them help me out. We are lucky people, and we need to think about whom we are representing. I will be fine. Every Member of this Chamber will be fine, but our job is not to take care of ourselves. Our job is to represent our constituents.  This bill has earned a really historic title: Most unpopular major bill in American history. Most unpopular major bill in American history. How that can get 20 votes, let alone 51, is beyond me.  I want to make one last point. We need to kill this bill, not just because of all the harm it is going to do to the country, we need to do it for the legislative branch of the U.We just can't make laws like this.  Right now, the majority party is shortsighted because at some point Democrats are going to have the gavel. The temptation to follow this precedent being set this week, to enact major legislation without hearings and without the other party, might destroy the Senate itself. There is still time. There is still good will. We can walk back from the brink and do the right thing.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan).

14120,topic-id,917,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to taking up the Intelligence Authorization Act on suspension at a time when issues concerning the intelligence community have taken on an even greater significance and urgency, and taking up the bill this way will deprive Members of the opportunity to offer important amendments.  The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 is a good and bipartisan bill, but even a good bill can be made better. And although we have taken up the IAA on suspension on occasion in the past, it has only been on the basis of mutual agreement, which is not the case this year.  On its merits, I believe the IAA should and will become law, and I look[[Page H6194]]forward to its ultimate approval by both the House and Senate, and enactment.  Nevertheless, I share Leader Pelosi and Whip Hoyer's view that tonight's suspension vote should be opposed. This IAA should go through regular order so that Members may offer amendments. I will vote ``no'' today because I disagree with the expedited procedure used to bring this to the floor.  The Intelligence Committee has a unique role in this House and a special obligation to the American people.  It is our job to oversee the activities of the 17 agencies that comprise the intelligence community, ensuring that we strike an appropriate balance between protecting our country's national security and the civil liberties of everyone who calls America home.  On behalf of the House--by and through our oversight tools, including the IAA--our committee helps ensure that the activities of the U.intelligence community do the following: that they adhere to the Constitution and to the law; that they advance the national security interests of the United States; that they wisely expend taxpayer dollars; and that they steadfastly protect Americans' civil liberties and privacy rights.  The legislation before us today, like its predecessors, continues to fund, equip, and give policy direction to the intelligence community and military intelligence elements of the Department of It provides funding levels slightly below the President's 2018 budget request and sustains intelligence priorities provided for in previous authorizations.  In addition to the unclassified legislative text and accompanying House report, the IAA includes a classified annex, which directs the resources and spending for the IC's activities and programs. This includes a correlating schedule of authorizations that lays out funding for the IC and the  This year's IAA, once again, incorporates a number of Democratic Member oversight priorities: it improves our efforts to stamp out waste, fraud, and abuse by requiring an Inspector General-level review of existing whistleblower procedures and by permitting IC contractors to come directly to Congress without requiring permission from the IC elements that employ them.  A provision accompanying the report mandates that the ODNI notify and provide justification to Congress if the executive branch alters the existing Presidential Policy Guidance, or PPG, relating to U.counterterrorism actions located outside of designated areas of active hostilities. The PPG, first promulgated under the previous administration, is an important element of U.policymaking that seeks to ensure direct action against lawful terrorist targets is undertaken only when necessary and consistent with U.national security and foreign policy interests. This is the result of rigorous legal and policy deliberation and coordination within the U.Reporting to Congress on any changes to it ensures proper oversight.  The bill also furthers our committee's belief that the future of the IC workforce depends on diversity; as such, this year's IAA enhances the ODNI's Centers of Academic Excellence program.  Finally, this bill reflects a clear-eyed assessment of the threat we face from a resurgent Russia determined to undermine our democratic institutions and our faith in the American political process.  As the intelligence community has determined, Moscow initiated as early as mid-2015 an active measures campaign to assault our 2016 election. The Kremlin's influence campaign consisted of cyber espionage, hacking and weaponizing stolen documents, and a propaganda machine that was used to great effect to amplify every element of their appalling campaign, and perhaps more.  This year's IAA acts on that unanimous IC judgment by directing assessments on Moscow's influence campaigns against foreign elections and the threat posed by Russian finance activities globally. It also requires ODNI to publish a report on the foreign cybersecurity and counterintelligence threats to future U.Federal election campaigns.  As with any product of a good-faith attempt at compromise, I do not pretend this bill is perfect. There are provisions I wish were modified, and some provisions that I would have liked to have seen included. Many of my colleagues feel the same way, and they should have been permitted to offer amendments, something I hope they will be permitted to do by voting ``no'' on this bill under suspension.  For example, we wish this bill had done more to codify in law some of the previous administration's counterterrorism reforms, including giving the status of law to an executive order requiring the Director of National Intelligence to continue the practice of releasing publicly available data on the total number of combatants and noncombatants killed or injured due to counterterrorism action.  I look forward to the fiscal year '18 Intelligence Authorization Act being enacted into law--not through the vehicle of the suspension calendar, but through consideration under regular order. For that reason, I urge a ``no'' vote here so that all Members will have a chance to be heard.

First, the human rights and humanitarian concerns have been well documented with respect to Yemen's story in the Middle East is a tragic one. Yemen's previous President ruled the country for decades with an iron fist and fleeced the country of its resources for his personal gain. He also allowed terrorist groups to enjoy safe haven in Yemen in the days after 9/11.  Today, Yemen remains a country in dire straits. It is on the verge of a famine, and there have been over 100,000 cases of cholera.  To make matters worse, the current conflict in Yemen, which includes the Saudi military, has worsened the humanitarian situation. Selling the kingdom precision weapons in this deal could further exacerbate the crisis.  Second, and of equal concern to me, is an area that hasn't been talked about much in this debate; that is, that the Saudi Government continues to aid and abet terrorism via its support and funding of schools that spread extremist Wahhabi propaganda. Saudi Arabia's support for these Wahhabi madrassas goes back decades. It is responsible for much of the radicalization of Muslim youth in the Middle East and North  In the past several months, we have witnessed lone-wolf attacks in London and in Tehran and elsewhere around the globe. Though the nature of terrorism has changed, many of the sources are the same. The propagation of Wahhabism, an extreme ideology, continues to fuel radicalism and terrorism around the globe. So if we want to get serious about cracking down on terrorism, the United States should focus--one of the focuses should be--on countering the spread of  The White House has not clearly articulated how the United States will put pressure on Saudi Arabia to end their support of Wahhabi schools, even as it claims that President Trump's recent visit to Riyadh was focused on curtailing terrorism. Furthermore, the administration has not sufficiently assured Congress that these weapons will not fall into the wrong hands.  Look at It has become a radical place--it wasn't 15 years ago--in good part because of Saudi funding--Saudi individuals who are a good part of the government, some who are friends with the government--of these madrassas, which taught radicalism to the Pakistani people.  Look at Indonesia, one of the largest countries in the world. It had usually practiced a form of Islam that was mild and tolerant. The Wahhabi schools are now flourishing in Indonesia, and it is becoming a radical place of danger to us.  We have to send a message to Saudi  They do some good things. I support their putting pressure, for instance, on the Palestinian Authority to finally make peace with But they do a lot of bad things. It seems there has almost been a rotten deal between the Saudi monarchy and the Wahhabi clerics to work together. It has to end.  My vote for this resolution of disapproval hopefully can send a message to the Saudis that their behavior in regard to Wahhabism must change. It is hurting the world and eventually will hurt them.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-13-pt1-PgS3416-3.txt,1036,HOMELAND SECURITY FOR CHILDREN ACT,2017.0,13.0,April
14109,topic-id,376,"Mr.President, first, on the topic of healthcare: I was very happy to hear the statement from Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray yesterday in which they pledged the HELP Committee to the task of restabilizing and strengthening the markets, particularly by guaranteeing the cost-sharing reduction program. As Chairman Alexander said: ``Without the payment of these cost-sharing reductions, Americans will be hurt.'' That is clear. Everyone has said it, even the insurance industry, and yet President Trump continues to treat this critical program as if it is some kind of political hostage. The President treats the critical program as if it is some kind of hostage.  Insurers in three States--North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Iowa--have each released separate rates for 2018: one if the payments are made, and one that is 20 percent higher if they are not. In these three States, premiums will be 20 percent higher if President Trump refuses to carry out the law. Every American will see that increase in their monthly bill and know it is a Trump premium tax.  Insurers from coast to coast have said that uncertainty surrounding the cost-sharing reductions are the 1 threat to the stability of our markets. State insurance commissioners--many of them Republican--are announcing higher rates for next year and directly blaming the President's failure to guarantee these payments, as the insurance commissioner of Idaho did yesterday.  We have enough problems in the world right now without President Trump creating entirely new ones out of political spite and a petty vindictiveness. When you lose politically, you don't take it out on the American people. That is not Presidential; that is just small.  So we would say to the President: Stop holding this critical program as if it is some kind of political hostage, stop the sabotage, make the payments this month so Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray can get to work in a bipartisan way on a longer stabilization package.  Let me salute a large number of my Republican colleagues who agree we have to do cost sharing. They have realized that just sticking with President Trump--particularly when his motivations are not Presidential but are sort of nasty, vindictive--is a bad idea. I salute you because, for the good of America, we have to work together.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4698-3.txt,1036,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018--MOTION TO,2017.0,2.0,April

Mr.Speaker, I, too, want to add my thoughts and prayers for our colleague and friend, Congressman Steve Scalise, and the victims of yesterday's shooting. May God be with them during this time.  Mr.Speaker, my bill, Broader Options for Americans Act, is before us today.  We have all heard about COBRA continuation coverage, which allows someone with group health insurance who experiences a qualifying life event to keep their job-based coverage when they no longer have a job and, most importantly, their plan's networks of providers--doctors, hospitals, et cetera--for a certain amount of time.  Currently, consumers with COBRA coverage, who could face a cost of up to 102 percent of plan costs, are not eligible for ObamaCare's Federal subsidies. My bill allows individuals who pay for the full cost of such continuation of coverage to qualify for the tax credit established under the American Health Care  This allows those consumers, including clergy, church lay workers, and their dependents who are experiencing similar circumstances and who get their coverage through church plans, who have been affected by sudden life changes to receive assistance to pay for their unsubsidized health premiums.  This bill represents another step forward in our continuing work to help Americans access more options for true patient-centered healthcare.  Mr.Speaker, this hits close to home for me. As a high school student, my dad lost his job of 25 years. I think the gentleman from Massachusetts has heard that story before. We, as a family, lost our healthcare and went into COBRA coverage.

One of the frustrations about the CBO report that never gets reported is the fact that millions of people will choose not to have healthcare. That is what the CBO says.  It is not often repeated in the national media or on the floor here, but I would just kind of remind everybody that, often, the other side of the aisle speaks a lot about choice and the freedom to choose. And with respect to healthcare, that is what millions of people will do, according to  I would also like to remind my friend--and I do mean that--that there are millions of Americans in my State alone who have insurance but don't have the choice of provider they once had or the choice of a hospital they once had.

There are people who have insurance, but premiums have doubled and tripled in the last several years and out-of-pocket expenses for those who are not subsidized have gone to levels that are unprecedented.

14101,topic-id,985,"Mr.President, the United States is a world leader in innovation, science, and technology; promoting democratic and humanitarian values; and maintaining international security and economic stability. The United States should play no less of a global leadership role combating climate change.  Climate change is the defining issue of our time. It is our greatest environmental, political, and moral challenge. History will judge our generation by what we do--or don't do.  I call on this body to pass 155, affirming in no uncertain terms the U.responsibility to work cooperatively with the international community to aggressively and effectively fight climate change.  There is no need to debate whether manmade climate change is occurring. The scientific evidence is clear. Greenhouse gases emitted through human activity are having a profound effect on Earth's climate, and 2016 was the warmest year on record, beating the record of 2015, which beat 2014's. The international community is no longer debating the science of climate change, and there should be no further debate in the halls of  Instead we must agree how the United States--as part of the international community--will take all steps necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to preserve our environment and way of life for future generations.  We are seeing species extinction and reduction in record numbers. We are seeing our landscapes changing, especially in the American West and in our colder climates like the We are seeing extreme weather events devastate communities.  As a dry, arid State in the Southwest, my home State of New Mexico is right in the bull's eye of climate disruption. New Mexico is the country's sixth-fastest warming State: the annual temperature has increased about 2.7 degree Fahrenheit since 1970. Droughts are becoming more intense. We have decreased snowfall in the winter and decreased runoff in the spring. All this has negative consequences for our land and communities.  Climate change not only threatens our environment, it threatens our economic stability and international security.  More than 1,100 U.businesses, corporations, and organizations, many of which operate internationally, are on record supporting the Paris The businesses include Arch Coal, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Dow Chemical, and Business leaders agree that the Paris Agreement is good for business.  Support for the accord is broad based within private industry, from electricity generators such as PG&E and National Grid, to oil companies such as Exxon Mobil and Shell, to mining companies such as Rio Tinto, and to manufacturers such as General Even some of the largest coal producers, such as Cloud Peak Energy and Peabody Energy, support remaining in the agreement. This broad support is due to a simple reality: leaders of successful businesses make decisions based on the available science, not ideology.  Business leaders are telling Congress and the President to stay in. Last November, over 360 businesses and investors called on U.S.-elected leaders to support the Paris Agreement and other domestic low-carbon policies. The letter was signed by more than a dozen Fortune 500 companies, as well as small family-owned businesses across more than 35 states. All these businesses want the U.economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy. They are concerned that a failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.  Despite this overwhelming support from the business community, the President has not decided whether the U.should continue as a member of the Paris accord. He is undecided despite the fact that his Secretary of State, former CEO of the world's largest oil company, says we should stay in, so we have a ``seat at the table.''  While sufficient resources and attention must be given to carbon-intensive industries and their workforces to ensure that transitions are not disruptive, we must look forward to supporting a new energy economy, that addresses climate change and produces good jobs.  We should not underestimate the threat climate change poses to national security. Secretary of Defense Mattis does not. He has testified before Congress that climate change poses as a national security threat. Indeed, the Pentagon has considered climate change a national security threat for over a decade.  Secretary Mattis wrote to the Senate Armed Services Committee that, ``[c]limate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today.'' He observed that, ``[c]limate change can be a driver of instability, and the Department of Defense must pay attention to potential adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon.'' To prepare for this threat, Secretary Mattis stated that ``. . . climate change is a challenge that requires a broader, whole-of government response. If confirmed, I will ensure that the Department of Defense plays its appropriate role within such a response by addressing national security aspects.''  According to the American Security Project, climate change serves as an ``accelerant of instability''or a ``threat multiplier'' that makes already existing threats worse. ``The threat of global warming for security will manifest through a range of effects: resource scarcity, extreme weather, food scarcity, water insecurity, and sea level rise will all threaten societies around the world. Too many governments are not prepared for these threats, either because they do not have the resources or because they have not planned ahead. How societies and governments respond to the increase in instability will determine whether climate change will lead to war.''  The President should not disregard the advice of his Secretary of Defense and the established position of the The challenge of climate change[[Page S2798]]requires a broad response from the entirety of the Federal The President should meet this challenge head on.  Across the globe, people are suffering from the effects of climate change. U.businesses and the military feel those threatening impacts as well. U.elected officials must listen to these businesses and our Armed The United States should not only have a seat at the international table, we should be leading the global community.

14258,topic-id,888,"Mr.President, a few weeks ago the Senate Republicans had to cancel a vote on the healthcare bill because the number crunchers over at the Congressional Budget Office, or the CBO, pointed out that the Republican bill was going to take away health insurance from 22 million people and drive up the costs for millions more. So Senate Republicans started throwing new plans together, one after another, rolling the dice and hoping the CBO would come back with a better number.  Here is a quick guide to what the Republicans have tried since the last time they canceled their vote on this bill. First, there was a bill that was, basically, the same as the first version but that included a little bit more money. CBO said it still knocked 22 million people off their healthcare coverage.  Second, there was a bill to simply repeal the Affordable Care Act, with no replacement whatsoever. CBO said that one would knock 32 million people off their healthcare.  Third, there was a proposal by Senator Cruz that would let insurance companies offer insurance at one price to people with no preexisting conditions and another price for anybody who had anything wrong. We don't[[Page S4147]]even have a CBO score for that one because CBO had trouble figuring out how many people with preexisting conditions who really needed insurance would never be able to pay for it under that bill.  Why is it that the Republicans have so much trouble coming up with something--with anything--that would improve healthcare in America? The problem is that the Republicans' real motivation behind all these healthcare bills is not to improve healthcare. It is to give giant tax cuts to the richest families and corporations in this country. When the goal is a big tax cut, it is hard to come up with something that actually also improves people's healthcare.  The Republican healthcare bills have gone from bad to worse to embarrassing. What makes this so painful, however, is that the health--even the survival--of real people hangs in the balance.  A couple of weeks ago, I met with families who said they hoped--they said they prayed--the Senate would not pass this terrible health bill. Each of these families had a small child who had been born with complex medical needs.  I met Baxter, who is only 3 years old and has cerebral palsy. I met Tom, who was born 4 months prematurely and needed multiple surgeries to help correct his medical conditions. I met Brody, who was born with his organs growing outside his body in a protective sac. He spent more than 7 months at Boston Children's Hospital, undergoing complicated surgeries to fit his organs back inside his body.  I met these children, and I have to state that all of these kids are fighters. Every one of them has endured great pain and shown courage and determination. Every one of them has needed help from Medicaid for hospital bills, breathing equipment, special feeding tubes, physical therapists, speech therapists, and nurses to help train the family on how to clean a blocked IV line or how to deal with seizures. Medicaid means these children get the medical care they need, and it means they can live at home instead of in an institution. It means their families don't have to go bankrupt. It is that simple.  Without this help, these families would be destroyed. These children and their families are the face of Medicaid, and we fight every day to protect them.  Just to be clear, Baxter's mother said to me that, without the help that Medicaid provided, Baxter would have died. They are good, hardworking parents with jobs and insurance, but they didn't have the millions of dollars it took to keep Baxter alive or the money to buy the equipment and support they needed to keep Baxter at home. Yes, this is about life and death, and if anyone doubts it, call Baxter's mom and ask her to explain it to you.  The Republican plan isn't just cruel. It is immoral, and it is not who we are as a people. We are better than that.  We shouldn't even be holding this vote tomorrow. The American people have begged Republicans to stop. Governors from red States and blue States alike have told them that this bill will be deeply harmful. Patient groups, the American Medical Association, pediatricians, nurses, hospital groups, nursing homes, and the AARP have all sounded the alarm, saying these bills would do irreparable damage to our health system and to families that are trying to take care of their loved ones.  I urge Republicans to stop the politics. People across this country--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--don't want you to repeal healthcare for millions of people. Listen to those people. Listen to Baxter and Tom and Listen to all the people who love them.  I know there is a lot we could do to make healthcare more affordable in this country. I know there is a lot we could do to make our delivery system work better. We could work together and build something better for all of But we can't even start down that path if we rip away healthcare from millions of We just cannot do this. It is wrong.

14257,topic-id,2903,"Mr.President, let me open my remarks by saying that from the very beginning of this ill-starred healthcare misadventure the Republicans have been on, Democrats have over and over again offered to help and to participate. Over and over again, we have spoken to, for instance, Chairman Alexander on the HELP Committee, saying: Give us a shot. Try something. We can do this. You have talked all these years about regular order.  How many times have we heard the majority leader say that regular order is the way to go and talk about how important the Senate is because it follows regular order? It looks as though all of that was nothing but a lot of bunkum because when he had the chance to come here and actually trust the Senate to work through regular order, what did he do? The very first day, he jammed through reconciliation to open a purely partisan pathway to undoing  Well, people have discovered that a lot of what they thought was their[[Page S4145]]good healthcare is So people on Medicaid, people whose private policies now don't have preexisting condition limits, caps on how much can be spent in a year or in a lifetime, folks who will get their money through the exchange, suddenly they have all discovered ``Oh my gosh, that was Don't take that away from me.'' That is one of the reasons we see all of the groups who come here concerned about healthcare lined up against this bill.  This bill, other than the creepy cabal of billionaires who are behind it, doesn't have a friend. And it just shows how narrow the Republican Party has now become that they will follow the creepy billionaires off the cliff against the advice of so many respected American organizations.  How about the American Cancer Society? The American Cancer Society says that the Republican bill would leave patients and those with preexisting conditions paying more for less coverage. They have come out against the bill.  I have a constituent home in Rhode Island, and her name is She and her daughters live in a beautiful place in Rhode Island, Wakefield, Like a lot of people I have heard from, Patricia is afraid. She is afraid that what this Congress is going to do is to repeal the Affordable Care Act and let health insurers go back to discriminating against people with preexisting conditions.  What is hers? Well, Patricia and her daughters have a genetic mutation, and that genetic mutation increases their risk of cancer. They would ordinarily be counting on the American Cancer Society to argue for them, and sure enough, the American Cancer Society has come out against the Republican health legislation.  Well, it got real for Patricia last year when her 34-year-old daughter was battling breast cancer. Fortunately, her health insurance covered her treatment, and it worked. She is now cancer-free. But because of their genetic mutation, Patricia and her daughters will need to be screened frequently for the rest of their lives. Under the Affordable Care Act, these potentially lifesaving screenings are covered, and Patricia and her daughters are not penalized for having a preexisting condition. Why on Earth would you want to go back to a world in which those two things weren't true?  Patricia wrote:       A genetic mutation is not caused by an unhealthy or      careless lifestyle, as some members of Congress seem to      think. You can do everything ``right'' and still end up with      cancer or another debilitating disease.  So she urged me to consider all the people who would be affected by the new healthcare bill, not just looking out for the rich and the healthy.  Another group who came out against this was the American Association of Retired Persons, the This bill may have changed, but the results are the same. The results are higher costs and less coverage for older Why would you want to do that? And this isn't just language from the AARP; it comes home again.  Lisa from Pascoag, up in northern Rhode Island--a bucolic, rural part of Rhode Island--wrote to share her experience with the Affordable Care This is her and her husband's third year on their ACA plan. Like many Rhode Islanders, they qualify for financial assistance to help them afford their health insurance. You would think that would be a good thing. Lisa thinks it is a good thing. She wrote to me that she thanks God every day that they have quality health insurance they can afford.  Her husband is a welder fabricator--a job that takes a toll. He has had several blood tests this year and recently began seeing a hematologist. Lisa knows that this type of specialty care would have been out of reach for their family without their current coverage, and so she is worried. She is frightened by the Republican health plan.  She and her husband are 56 and 62 years old. They are within AARP's interests. And she understands that because of their age, under the Republican plan, their premiums could go up five to eight times what they are paying today--five to eight times what they are paying today--and the tax credits that have been proposed, in Lisa's words, ``won't cut it.''  Doctors know a little bit about healthcare, and the American College of Physicians has come out in opposition. ``The BCRA . . . will not preserve and improve essential coverage, benefits and consumer protections, and access to care'' is their concern. Of course, why would you want to listen to the doctors about healthcare when you have a little pack of creepy billionaires who are telling you what to do? Never bother to listen to the doctors.  Well, Judith from Riverside, RI, is a doctor. She is a physician who works at a community mental health center in Judy told me that she sees the benefits of the Affordable Care Act every single day. She treats patients with serious mental illnesses, and they have what she called ``tremendous'' healthcare and social service needs. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, almost all of her patients were uninsured, and she spent her days scrambling to try to find different avenues to get them free care, to get them whatever they could scrounge. Since the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, she said, almost all of her patients have health insurance and they are able to get the medical care they need. As Judy put it, with all of their life challenges, at least they don't have to worry that they can't afford care.  Planned Parenthood is a favorite target of our Republican friends, and Planned Parenthood is strongly opposed to these measures. Women get a lot of their healthcare from Planned Planned Parenthood said: ``With this latest version of TrumpCare, women will pay the biggest price of all.''  Olive is a young woman living in Providence who shared her experience with me about how Planned Parenthood has been a reliable source of healthcare for her throughout her life. As a college student, Olive went to Planned Parenthood for birth control and well-woman care. She had a routine exam, and a doctor at Planned Parenthood found a lump in her breast. Twenty years old and far from her family, Olive said she was worried but never felt alone. Planned Parenthood connected her with the followup care and testing that she needed. She was treated by their doctors. Fortunately, the mass turned out to be benign, but Olive says she is forever grateful to Planned Parenthood for their help to her during a scary situation for a young woman.  Olive is still a patient at Planned Parenthood, and she even volunteers at their health clinic in She knows firsthand how important Planned Parenthood is for healthcare for millions of men and women across the country--particularly women--and, like the other people who have written to me, she is afraid of what will happen if Republicans succeed in defunding Planned  Small business folks have spoken to me about this. There is a lot of talk about how you need more freedom not to have insurance and freedom to be told you can't have insurance if you are sick. That is not the kind of freedom I think we really want to support around here. The freedom we want to support is for somebody to be able to follow their dreams, and over and over again, I hear from people who are able to get free of being linked to their employer healthcare plan and go out on their own because of the Affordable Care  Laura is a small business owner in our capital city, She and her husband own an architectural design and construction firm that builds homes around Rhode Construction is not a line of work you want to be in without health insurance. Well, because of the Affordable Care Act, Laura and her husband have affordable health insurance and dental coverage, and they have it for the first time. They can see the doctors they want to see, and their out-of-pocket costs are reasonable.  The Affordable Care Act has allowed small business owners like Laura and her husband to pursue their professional dreams, boosting our local economy and creating jobs for others without having to risk their livelihoods and life savings if an illness or an injury befalls them.  Just last night, I was in Narragansett, RI, and a woman came up to me to say: When you get back down there, please fight for us on the Affordable Care Act.[[Page S4146]]  She said: The Affordable Care Act has given me two things. One, it has given me my freedom. Because of the Affordable Care Act, I was able to leave my employer-supported program and have the confidence to go out on my own and become an illustrator.  Her business is so successful that she has actually started hiring people to support her business.  She said: That freedom to be an entrepreneur, to succeed, would never ever have happened if I had been chain-locked to my employer program and did not have an affordable option like the Affordable Care Act provides.  Second, she said: Once I did this, once I started my business, I then went for checkups. I was able to get tests that I could not have gotten before, and what they found was a tumor behind my eye. Luckily, it was not cancerous, but had they not caught it, she said, I would have lost my sight.  If you are an illustrator, being blind is a very tough proposition. She said: I have my freedom, and I have my sight because of this law. Sheldon, fight for me.  Janice from Cranston is the last person I will mention tonight. She wrote in to share how important the Affordable Care Act has been to her and her husband and how important our Rhode Island marketplace has been for her.  She said: There may be marketplaces that aren't working in different places around the country. Fine, go fix those. Don't mess with mine.  It is working in Rhode Island, and Janice is one of the beneficiaries of it. She is now retired. She lives with her husband Bob in Before the Affordable Care Act, she tried to buy health insurance in the individual market, and it was quoted to her at $800 per month--not affordable to her, not with limited income like that. So Janice and Bob have quality affordable insurance through Rhode Island's health insurance exchange, and they are happy about it. Don't disrupt their lives.  Janice actually told me that her health insurance premium actually went down this year, and so she splurged with the savings and bought dental insurance as well. That was a success. She wrote to me: ``I wouldn't have been able to afford healthcare if it wasn't for ObamaCare.''  Like so many of these other people who have written in, Janice says that she and Bob are scared to death that they will lose their insurance if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. She doesn't understand how some Members of Congress can claim to care about their constituents and still try to repeal their healthcare coverage. Janice said: ``They have money and they have good insurance, and they must not know what it is like for people like us.''  Well, we need to remember those real people out there who are getting the Medicaid benefit, who are getting affordable insurance through the exchanges and getting help with the premiums and the people who are on private insurance but no longer have to face lifetime caps or annual caps or preexisting conditions. Even people who are still on Blue Cross have gotten a benefit from this. Why would we want to take that all away?  The last thing I want to mention is this. Those are all personal stories, and it is really important to remember that behind this creepy billionaire effort to perform some kind of ideological experiment on people by taking away their healthcare, there are actually real people who are really going to suffer in their real lives, and it will have been deliberately done to them by people here who simply couldn't say no to the creepy billionaires.  There is another piece of this. It is a little more complicated, but I will close on this.  I love to use this graph. I use it all the time. This axis of the graph shows how long people live in different countries. The range is from 72 to 86. This part of the graph shows how much people pay in different countries for healthcare per year. Virtually everybody that we compete with is right in here--Japan, Greece, United Kingdom, Germany, and They are right in here. They do pretty well on life expectancy, and here they are in this cross of the $2,000 to $6,000 per year range. The most expensive other country in the world is Switzerland, at $6,000 per year. Look at where the United States is. We spend $8,500 per year--way more, double more than what the average is of the other countries we compete against. For that we get super killer life expectancy. I guess killer life expectancy isn't the right phrase to use. But do you get great life expectancy on that vast expenditure of healthcare? We compete with the Czech We compete with Part of what the Affordable Care Act did was to try to focus on this.  Here is the punch line. One of the things we do in the Budget Committee is that we look at things in 10-year chunks. If you look at the 10-year chunk from 2018, which is this year right here, to 2027, here is a 10-year period. What this graph shows is that, back here in 2010, the Congressional Budget Office did a prediction of what the healthcare costs for the country was going to be in this 10-year period. They said this is how much we are going to have to spend on Federal healthcare.  What happened is that we passed the Affordable Care Act and costs started to go down. They came in below expectations. Around here, they rebooted the test, and they did a new projection based on the new information for this same 10-year period. As you will notice, the costs that we have projected for that 10-year period from 2018 to 2027, inclusive, have fallen. They have fallen by $3.3 trillion.  If you want to talk about savings on our debt and deficit, if you want to talk about savings in healthcare, this red line was projected before the Affordable Care Act, and the green line--the difference--was the projection after the Affordable Care Act was law and after the results began to come in.  I can't promise you that every single one of those $3.3 trillion in savings was a direct result of a provision in the Affordable Care Act, but when we have delivered $3.3 trillion in savings, why would we never want to talk about that? Why would we want to put any of that at risk? Why would we want to go back to the preexisting condition of this prediction and pile $3.3 trillion back into that out-year period? It makes no sense.  So whether you are a person who has constituents who are real and who are going to suffer, who are going to suffer in real life as a result of the decision and the vote that you cast tomorrow, or whether you are a propeller-headed budget hawk who just wants to figure out how you can reduce America's costs, why would you vote for a bill and put any of this at risk? Why the fear of your constituents? Why the $3.3 trillion in savings? It makes no sense.  I will end where I began. If people will come to their senses and want to do this in a bipartisan fashion, during regular order--boy, did we hear a lot about regular order until regular order wasn't wanted any longer--we are here. We want to work with you. There are tons of ideas out there. We can work to improve the healthcare system for the real people in the real world, and not just do what we are told by a cabal of creepy billionaires who are yanking the chain of the Republican  With that, I yield the floor.

I would like to state very clearly for the record why I have come to this decision. I have decided to support S.42 and oppose the transfer of specific defense articles to Saudi Arabia primarily because of the Saudi Government's refusal to take specific steps that I repeatedly requested to alleviate the horrible humanitarian suffering in  Before I further explain that decision, I would like to explain what is not informing my decision. I am not reflexively opposed to arms sales in general or to Saudi Arabia specifically. On the contrary, after a series of questions are satisfactorily addressed, I believe arm sales to key partners and allies can enable them to more effectively defend our common interests and oppose common threats. After all, the United States cannot and should not employ U.military forces in every instance. When the United States and our partners confront common threats, we should encourage and empower regional allies and regional partners to play prominent roles wherever possible. When our partners are defending our common interests, we want them to be as well-equipped and well-trained and effective as possible.[[Page S3423]]  I recognize that despite our differences, the Saudi Government is an important regional security partner for the United States of However, when we work through our allies and partners, we shouldn't set aside our national security interests, and we certainly shouldn't set aside our support for universal humanitarian principles. That principle certainly applies to the Saudis and to the situation in  My decision today is based neither on an opposition to arms sales in general nor an opposition to arms sales to the Saudis in particular. Instead, my decision today is based primarily on the persistent and misguided refusal of the Saudi Government to take specific steps that I have requested to alleviate some of the humanitarian suffering in  My decision should come as a surprise to no one. As I have said on the Senate floor before, the United Nations calls the situation in Yemen the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. According to the U.N.--which, incidentally, our intelligence resources rely on for much of their information--Yemen has almost 19 million people. Two-thirds of the population is in need of humanitarian or protection assistance, including approximately 10 million who require immediate assistance to save or sustain their lives--two-thirds of their population. If that is not a recipe for instability in a dangerous region of the world, I don't know what is. So 17 million people are food-insecure, while 7 million people don't know where their next meal is coming from, and they are at risk of famine.  In addition, according to the U.as of yesterday, the World Health Organization reports a cumulative total of over 124,000 suspected cases of cholera and over 900 associated deaths. Cholera is impacting the most vulnerable. In fact, children under the age of 15 account for 28 percent of all deaths.  The situation is growing far worse. An NGO with personnel on the ground in Yemen tells my office that the large majority of these cholera cases have taken place since late Perhaps the most heartbreaking statistic is that a child under the age of 5 dies of preventable causes every 10 minutes in  Throughout this process, rather than just mourning this terrible situation, I have tried to identify tangible steps that can save lives, that can lead to a political settlement in Yemen, and that can enhance both regional and national security interests of the United In the case of Yemen, it became clear quickly that there were specific steps the Saudis could take to help alleviate the horrible humanitarian situation in  Based on that realization back in April--April 27, I led a nine-member, bipartisan letter to the incoming Saudi Ambassador, noting the important security partnership between the United States and the Government of Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia's role as a regional leader. I asked Riyadh to take some specific steps related to Yemen that would prevent thousands or even millions of additional people from dying there. Among several requests, I asked the Saudis to permit the delivery of U.S.-funded cranes to the Port of Hodeidah that would dramatically improve the ability to offload humanitarian supplies there. That is important because the Port of Hodeidah processes roughly 70 to 80 percent of all of the food and other critical imports that come into the country of This is the port that supplies people who are in the most desperate need of food and medical attention.  I also asked Riyadh to address unnecessary additional delays that the Saudi-led coalition was causing for humanitarian and commercial supplies going into that port. Not receiving a satisfactory response, I subsequently raised these issues directly with the Saudi Foreign Minister when he met with me and other Senators here on Capitol Still not receiving a satisfactory answer, we have continued to raise these requests repeatedly with the Saudi As recently as yesterday, the Saudis have refused to be responsive on the cranes. Further, in the face of clear evidence from the United Nations to the contrary, the Saudis have even denied a role in causing delays of humanitarian and commercial shipments into So for almost 2 months, the Saudis have failed to take my requests seriously.  For those who are new to this issue, perhaps this discussion of cranes and delays at ports seems a bit wonkish--maybe in the weeds. Yet in a humanitarian situation as dire as Yemen--with a child under 5 dying of preventable diseases every 10 minutes--every shipment of food or fuel, every day of delay can have life-and-death implications. The Saudis know this, yet they have been unresponsive to my requests.  There is no doubt that the Iranians and the Houthis are up to no good in There is no doubt that Saudi Arabia has the right to defend its borders, and there is also no doubt that this situation in Yemen is complex. But it is a false choice to suggest that we have to choose between opposing Iran and helping the millions of suffering people in I believe we have a moral responsibility and a national security imperative to do all we can to help the people in Yemen who are starving, who need medicine, who are dying.  The longer this war in Yemen continues, the more we will drive the Houthis into the arms of the The more leverage the Iranians and the Russians will gain in Yemen, the more terrorist groups like al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula will thrive.  Perhaps the Saudi Government isn't concerned about my vote. Perhaps they think this issue will just blow over, that attention will wane, that Senators will lose interest. I recognize I am just one Senator with just one vote, but I would caution the Saudi Government against such a view. I am not going to be losing interest in this issue anytime soon.  To the Saudis I say this: When I make a request and your government is unresponsive--at least as far as I am concerned--there will be consequences for that decision. My vote demonstrates that fact.  To my colleagues, I respectfully say that America's support should never be unconditional. It is in our interests and it is consistent with the humanitarian values that we profess to demand that the Saudis take some of these steps to alleviate humanitarian suffering in For this reason, I am going to vote in support of S.42 today, and I urge my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to do the same.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-06-13-pt1-PgS3416-3.txt,1256,MOTION TO DISCHARGE--S.J. RES. 42,2017.0,13.0,July
