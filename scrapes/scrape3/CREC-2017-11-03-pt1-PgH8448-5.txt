                        SUPPORTING HEALTHY KIDS

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the CHAMPIONING 
HEALTHY KIDS Act.
  This important legislation continues much-needed funding for programs 
like the Children's Health Insurance Program, community health centers, 
and our rural hospitals.
  Community health centers are a critical access point to care, and I 
have seen firsthand how they bless each person they serve.
  In addition to community health centers, my district includes many 
rural hospitals, which are truly a lifeline for my constituents.
  That is why I join my colleagues in letters urging to delay the cuts 
for the proposed disproportionate share of hospital and community 
health centers for at least 2 years. And I am happy to see this 
legislation doing just that.
  I won't let Washington forget about the rural communities at the 
heart of my district. They deserve better.
  And guess what? This bill is fully paid for.
  While delaying these cuts is a step in the right direction, I will 
continue to fight for a permanent solution.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Energy and Commerce Committee for their 
work,

and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.
