                                TAX CUTS

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, this is a historic week, one that has been 31 
years in the making. In a once-in-a-generation vote, we will vote to 
cut taxes for the middle class and unleash the power of the American 
economy.
  Our Tax Code is more than 70,000 pages of opaque rules and 
regulations

that cost Americans money and jobs. In critical ways, our Tax Code 
gives explicit economic advantage to our foreign competitors. That 
changes with this bill.
  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act puts the American taxpayer and the American 
economy first. The bill cuts taxes for individuals and families in 
every tax bracket.
  By lowering rates, doubling the standard deduction, and increasing 
the child tax credit, hardworking American families can keep more money 
in their paychecks. The average family of four earning $55,000 will see 
a tax cut of over $1,000.
  This bill will supercharge our economy by making everyone play by the 
same rules. It substantially reduces taxes on small businesses and 
manufacturers. This means more jobs, more money, and more opportunity 
for American workers.
  Tax reform is the single best thing we can do for our economy. I urge 
all my colleagues to support this bill.
