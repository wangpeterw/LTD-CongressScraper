                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say that, yes, I support 
keeping the government open. However, I cannot support the continuing 
resolution that came before this House today.
  Let me just say to America: I want you to understand it is not about 
not supporting our military. It has placed us in a position that we 
have to understand that we need to do both, just as Democrats and 
Republicans should work together.
  On this continuing resolution, it makes us, yes, give 6 years to 
CHIP. But what about the community health centers? What good is it to 
give us CHIP and not support community health centers? What good is it 
not to support our teaching hospitals?
  So I say to you, with Republicans in charge of the House, the Senate, 
and the White House, we could do better.
  Today, I proudly say to all of those women who marched across this 
Nation: I stand with you today because you marched for better 
healthcare. You marched so that we could have equality and equal 
treatment. That is why I proudly cast my vote as a ``no.''
