 UNVEILING OF THE BISHOPVILLE JAMES DAVISON HERIOT STATUE ON THE 100TH 
                      ANNIVERSARY OF ARMISTICE DAY

 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the 
American Legion Post 29 in Bishopville, SC as they celebrate the 
unveiling of the James Davison Heriot statue in downtown Bishopville on 
Sunday, November 11, 2018. James Davison Heriot was a South Carolina 
National Guard soldier who received the Medal of Honor for his actions 
during World War I.
  Post 29 is honoring the Americans who fought in World War I by 
unveiling this statue on the 100th anniversary of the end of the 
American involvement in the conflict, previously known as Armistice 
Day. I look forward to the unveiling of the Bishopville Heriot statue, 
as well as all other commemorations that will take place on this 
special 100th anniversary.
