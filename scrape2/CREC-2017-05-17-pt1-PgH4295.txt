              AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT HEROES ACT OF 2017

  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the 
Speaker's table the bill (S. 583) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control 
and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize COPS grantees to use grant 
funds to hire veterans as career law enforcement officers, and for 
other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Arrington). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from Virginia?
  There was no objection.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                                 S. 583

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``American Law Enforcement 
     Heroes Act of 2017''.

     SEC. 2. PRIORITIZING HIRING AND TRAINING OF VETERANS.

       Section 1701(b)(2) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control 
     and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796dd(b)(2)) is 
     amended by inserting ``, including by prioritizing the hiring 
     and training of veterans (as defined in section 101 of title 
     38, United States Code)'' after ``Nation''.

  The bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third
