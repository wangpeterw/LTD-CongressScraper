                          REPUBLICAN TAX SCAM

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the American public has caught on to our 
Republican colleagues' tax scam. They know this bill takes from the 
struggling middle class and bountifully rewards the billionaire class 
and transnational corporations that ship our jobs overseas. In fact, 
the only permanent tax giveaways in their bill are

for rich corporations and those lovely Wall Street banks that care so 
much for the American people.
  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates a $1 trillion addition to 
our national debt as a result of this bill. The Congressional Budget 
Office estimates that 80 percent of Americans, those making less than 
$100,000 a year, will see a tax increase under their plan. But you know 
what? They will wait until after next year's election to lock it in.
  There is very little in this bill good for average Americans. Our 
Republican colleagues are actually pushing America into deeper 
financial servitude to foreign investors from places like China and 
Saudi Arabia who are going to buy the Treasury debt securities, and our 
taxpayers will end up having to pay them principal plus billions and 
billions and billions in interest.
  How does that servitude sound like making America great again, 
putting us in hock in greater and greater amounts to foreign interests?
