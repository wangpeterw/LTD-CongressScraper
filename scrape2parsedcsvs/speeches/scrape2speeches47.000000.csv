3370,topic-id,327,"Mr.Speaker, today I would like to honor Captain Joshua Byers, a fallen soldier, son, husband, brother, and friend.  In Sparks, Nevada, Captain Byers lives on as a legacy. His kind heart, patriotic soul, and strong ideals of servant leadership have left a strong and lasting impact on everyone who knew him.  Captain Byers attended Edward Reed High School in Sparks, the home of the Although not originally from Sparks, Captain Byers moved with his mother, father, and two younger brothers to chase a dream and God's calling in  While at Reed High School, he joined the Naval Junior ROTC program and various other clubs, all while maintaining excellent grades.  When he reached his senior year, he was student body president, the battalion commander of the Junior ROTC[[Page H2905]]unit, and in line to be valedictorian on graduation.  One of his biggest dreams was to attend one of the Nation's service academies. After he completed his 4 years at Reed High School, he accepted an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, Hudson  Upon graduating from West Point, he earned an Army Ranger tab and was deployed to Iraq in 2003, where he was killed in action due to an IED explosion.  His legacy lives on at Reed High School, especially in the NJROTC program. Through an award given there by one of the past instructors as well, there is now being more done in order to memorialize a hero who left such a profound impact on those who knew him and were around him.  The NJROTC hallway at Reed High is going to be completely dedicated to Captain Byers, being named the Captain Joshua Byers Leadership Memorial  In this hall you can find Captain Byers' uniform, awards, military decorations, and various pictures and stories to help capture the essence of this hero in our hearts and minds.  Mr.Speaker, I ask today that we keep the Byers family and Joshua in our prayers and thoughts.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-27-pt1-PgH2904-3.txt,2090,MAINTAINING GREAT LAKES' ECOSYSTEM,2017.0,27.0,June

3292,topic-id,2427,"Mr.President, reflecting on his accomplishments to date in his administration, President Trump recently said: ``I think we've done more than, perhaps, any President in the first 100 days.'' Throughout the campaign and since coming to office, President Trump has repeatedly attacked politicians who are ``all talk, no action.'' It seems to be appropriate that, now that the first 100 days have passed, we should apply the President's standard.  Over the course of the campaign, Candidate Trump promised to replace the ``very stupid people'' in our government who ``don't know how to win'' with the ``greatest minds'' and the ``best people.''  He said that the Presidency was ``going to be easy'' and that the ``jobs are coming back, folks; that's going to be easy.''  He promised a ``beautiful,'' ``terrific'' plan to provide ``such great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost, and it's going to be so easy.''  He promised to build a wall so fast that ``your head will spin'' and that Mexico would pay for it. ``Just rely on me,'' he said.  He promised to be the ``greatest jobs President that God ever created,'' to ``bring us all together,'' and to create a ``unified Nation--a Nation of love,'' he said.  He predicted: ``We're gonna win so much that you may even get tired of winning, and you'll say, please, please, it's too much winning, we can't take it anymore. Mr.President, it's too much.''  He outlined that winning plan in no other place than Gettysburg last There, on that hallowed ground, where Lincoln reflected on his own ``poor power'' and wondered whether the world would little note nor long remember what he said there, President Trump--the man who said: ``I alone can fix it''--outlined his 100-day action plan to make America great again and restore honesty, accountability, and change to On that day, he promised that, on his first day, 18 different accomplishments would be achieved. He delivered just two of those.  Over his first 100 days, he promised to introduce and fight to pass 10 major pieces of legislation. That included a bill to ``grow the economy 4 percent per year and create at least 25 million new jobs.'' It included a bill to ``spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years.'' It included a bill to ``make 2- and 4-year college more affordable'' as well as bills to ``clean up corruption in Washington'' and ``discourage companies from laying off their workers.''  Today, more than 100 days into the Trump Presidency, where are we?  So far, the President's ``great'' team has not yet been assembled. There are 465 vacancies for which there are not even nominees yet. You cannot blame that on anything going on around here. There are 465 slots that still do not have nominees. Of the 10 pieces of legislation that he proposed on that day in Gettysburg, he has passed zero--none.  In his first 100 days, amidst the Great Depression, FDR stabilized the banks and put 250,000 Americans to work through a new Civilian Conservation Ronald Reagan rallied the country behind his agenda for taxes and spending. Facing an economic collapse--the likes of which we had not seen since the Great Depression--Barack Obama cut taxes and made historic investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and education in 100 days.  Notwithstanding this history--these facts--President Trump has repeatedly claimed in interviews and broadcasts how well the administration has done during the first 100 days. In fact, on day 90--he did not even need to get to 100--he said: ``No administration has accomplished more.'' As evidence for this claim, the President referred to the 28 bills that he has signed into law--laws to rename a VA clinic in American Samoa, laws to make it easier to hunt bears out of helicopters, to improve weather forecasts, to appoint members of the Smithsonian Board of Those were in the 28 laws. Missing from that list, however, is any legislation that fulfills a single campaign promise that he made, including his promise to repeal  In the absence of fulfilling the promises that he made at Gettysburg and on the campaign trail, he has also taken credit for a series of Executive orders even though, during the campaign, he railed against President Obama for using them. Candidate Trump said: ``We have a President that can't get anything done, so he just keeps signing executive orders all over the place.'' In fact, history shows that President Obama turned to Executive orders only after years of unprecedented obstruction and after he passed legislation through this Chamber and through the  President Trump turned to executive orders in the first 100 days despite controlling both Houses of With a Republican President, a Republican majority in the Senate, and a Republican majority in the House, he has to revert to the very same instrument that he was so appalled by in the hands of President Obama, and he still has no major legislative accomplishments to show for it. That is not fake news. That is the truth.  While we are on the subject, it bears noting, I think, that President Obama used his Executive orders to advance rights and opportunity for the American people. President Trump has used them to discriminate against refugees and immigrants in an unconstitutional travel ban, to weaken American competitiveness by reversing fuel efficiency standards for our cars, to weaken protections for our national monuments and endanger our economy and our environment by undoing the Clean Power  Not only has President Trump failed to keep his promises--it is actually worse than that--but he has actually proposed or supported legislation that would do just the opposite of what he has promised.  Look at healthcare. I hope I am not in need of any right now. Over the course of the campaign--I do not need to tell anybody in America this; we all saw it--Candidate Trump attacked ObamaCare over and over. He described it as a ``disaster'' that is ``imploding.'' So he promised: ``On day one, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of ObamaCare'' and replace it with ``something terrific.'' He pledged to ``take care of everybody,'' to champion what he called the ``forgotten man,'' and he assured America that ``everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.''[[Page S2707]]  More than 100 days after taking office, President Trump has not only failed to fulfill that promise, failed to repeal ObamaCare--the House has not yet even had a vote on it, as far as I know--but the White House has actually helped to write--and he endorsed--a proposal that would throw 24 million people, many of them poor and middle class folks, off of their health insurance, while slashing $300 billion in taxes for the top 2 percent.  That is what is in the bill that they are considering in the House right now. That is not a healthcare bill. That is a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans that is masquerading as a healthcare bill. That is not the promise that he made to the people who voted for him. That is not the promise that he made to the forgotten man. It seems that in the first 100 days the forgotten man remains forgotten, unless by ``forgotten'' President Trump meant millionaires who can avoid dealing with America's health insurance system by paying cash for their medical expenses with their having the benefit of the tax cut that President Trump has proposed to give them.  My point--and I want to be clear about it--is not to ask the President to fulfill these promises, most of which I opposed when he was running. I am simply pointing out that what he has said is not what he has done, including his promise to build a ``great, great wall on our southern border'' and force Mexico to pay for that wall. Instead, he asked Congress for $1.4 billion in taxpayer money to start construction.  I was part of the Gang of Eight in the Senate that negotiated the immigration bill--four Democrats and four Republicans--over 8 months. We had $11 billion of border security. By the time we passed the bill in the Senate, there was $40 billion of border security in that bill. It was paid for, unlike a lot of stuff we do, and it was not the taxpayers who were paying for it. It was the immigrants who were paying for it in their fees to this country.  Why is that not a better way of doing it?  Mexico is not going to pay for it. It has said it is not going to pay for it. He continues to say that it is going to happen, but it is just another broken promise. Instead, he went to the taxpayers and hoped nobody would notice that he was asking for $1.4 billion for the wall. Fortunately, both Republicans and Democrats alike in the House of Representatives and in the Senate rejected it--in particular, Members of the House of Representatives who represent border States or represent the border, who actually know what is going on down there.  I am sad to say that this inconsistent and erratic approach has spilled over to our foreign relations. On North Korea, President Trump bragged that the United States would easily ``solve the problem''--his language--without China, which he called a currency manipulator and on which, he said, everybody in Washington was soft, and he was going to fix it. Then he sat down with Chinese President Xi for 10 minutes and ``realized it's not so easy.''  When he was running, the President said: ``Maybe NATO will dissolve, and that's OK.'' He called it ``obsolete.'' Then he sat down with the NATO Secretary General and realized that it was, in fact, ``not obsolete''--his words.  At a time when NATO faces new pressure from Russian aggression and American troops are deployed to Eastern Europe to support our partners and our allies in the region, including the soldiers whom I met 2 weeks ago from Colorado's Fourth Infantry Division, they need a steady voice and a clear vision from  We need an administration that can face reality instead of one that spins its own. This is not a campaign anymore. This is governing.  During the campaign, Donald Trump promised: ``There will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth and nothing else.'' Over its first 100 days, the administration has honored the American people--it has been recorded--with 488 false or misleading claims, nearly 5 a day. Some people have actually lost count. It has honored them with 100 days of dog-and-pony shows of CEOs, campaign rallies, and photo-ops in semi-trucks on the South It has honored the American people with empty theatrics where Donald Trump, the President, donates a portion of his salary to the National Park Service, hoping no one would notice his proposal to slash $1.4 billion in funding for the Department of the  This administration needs a reset for the next 100 days and the next 100 after that. The President needs to focus on what the American people need and what he said he would provide them instead of attacking the independent judiciary and the free press and blaming ``fake news''--his so-called fake news--in an effort to obscure a reality that he doesn't want to deal with. He needs to focus on the next generation instead of his daily approval ratings. He needs to focus on the future instead of complaining about how unexpectedly hard the job is or how great his previous life was.  And one more thing--a small thing. Candidate Trump loved to criticize President Obama for playing golf. He tweeted about it at least 26 times with lines like ``Can you believe that, with all the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.'' Well, President Trump has spent 19 days playing golf so far--even with all of these vacancies in this administration--more than Presidents Obama, Bush, or But that is not the only record he has broken for the first 100 days, which includes an average of more than five tweets a day, over a month he spent in this 100 days at Trump properties, and over $20 million in taxpayer dollars to finance his personal travel, which is on pace to exceed in his first year what the previous administration cost the American taxpayer in eight.  A better idea than repeating this next 100 days for the 100 days that are coming would be to actually drain the swamp, as he said during the campaign. He could start by releasing his tax returns, which during the campaign he falsely claimed he could not release because of a ``routine audit.'' There was no prohibition on his doing the same thing that every candidate in the history of America for the Presidency has done.  Now that he has put out a healthcare bill that slashes taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars for the wealthiest Americans and proposed tax reforms that would further deepen income inequality in this country, the least he could do is show the ``laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals'' what the President stands to gain and what they stand to lose from his proposals.  While he is doing that, he should focus on dealing with Americans' rising healthcare costs instead of trying to take health insurance away from millions of Americans, making it harder for them to see a doctor and take care of their families. He should focus on expanding opportunities in our communities with investments in infrastructure and on helping people compete in the global economy and reducing the national debt crushing the next generation of That is why he was elected To some degree, that is why all of us are here.  At the start of his first 100 days, President Trump promised in his inaugural address that ``America will start winning again, winning like never before.'' More than 100 days later, it is really not clear what we have won, but it is clear what we have lost--civility in our politics, facts in our policy, confidence in ourselves, and 100 days that should have been used to bring this country together to confront our great challenges.  The next 100 days must be better than the last because, as our President once said, the American people are ``tired of being ripped off by politicians that don't know what they're doing.'' On this, at least, I completely agree.  I yield the floor.

3410,topic-id,2024,"Mr.President, there has been a rare outburst of bipartisanship in the Senate this week. It is somewhat amazing, and I think it should be celebrated because Democrats and Republicans agree that the administration's new budget is a complete disaster. It has fallen with a bipartisan thud here in our  I think there is a reason for that. Throughout the campaign and now as President, President Trump has made a lot of promises. He has promised a balanced budget. He has promised no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or He has promised the best healthcare for everyone at the lowest cost. He has promised massive new tax cuts. He has promised a great wall paid for by  Skeptics, including myself, have awaited this budget to see the hard choices, the details, and the math that could make sense of those promises. After all of those words--and there were a lot of them--and all of those promises, we now have a budget, and it makes no sense.  Let's walk through a few of the numbers. Every year, our country collects on average about 18 percent of our gross domestic product in taxes--the equivalent of about 18 percent of our gross domestic product in taxes, and every year we spend just over 21 percent of the That gap is why our national debt continues to grow. Instead of closing the gap, where you have spending here and revenue here--instead of closing that gap, the President's budget proposes further tax cuts, bringing down the share of the GDP we are collecting and increasing defense spending while promising to balance the budget.  Just this morning, President Trump sent his Secretary of the Treasury to Congress to explain how all this adds up. He couldn't do it. He couldn't do it. The only way the math in this budget works, the only way that the gap closes, is by assuming that magically our economy will grow faster than any serious economist in the country predicts and that, as a result of that outside growth, the government would take in an extra $2 trillion in taxes. That is the plan. That is the $2 trillion assumption about the finances of our country and the potential burden of the next generation of Americans, some of whom are sitting here with us today.  Even if you accept that math--which I don't--but even if you accept that math, we have another problem. The administration's budget also proposes massive tax cuts that it claims will not add to our debt because of the same $2 trillion in new tax revenues. As has been pointed out, that is double-counting, plain and simple, the kind that would cause any college freshman in America to fail his or her accounting exam. This would be like depositing the same paycheck at two different banks and claiming that your salary had doubled, then increasing your spending on groceries, travel, housing, and everything else as if it were actually true that your income would be double. You would go broke, and that is what is going to happen here.  It is no wonder that a Republican Congressman said that this budget was like building a house on what he called ``a sandy foundation.'' The administration's only hope of getting this through is if Americans, including some of the President's strongest supporters, ignore the math and ignore the fact that his proposal actually grows our national debt, cuts Social Security, cuts Medicaid, and savages countless programs that protect vulnerable Americans and invest in our future.  On Medicaid in particular, a lot of us are scratching our heads at the math, let alone the real world pain that would result, should this proposal become law.  The healthcare bill, which passed on the floor of the House--and I said about that bill that even if I think about the townhall meetings I have had in Colorado, where people object most strenuously and most strongly to what is called ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act, if you set out to design a bill less responsive to the people in my townhall who opposed ObamaCare--if you set out to draft a bill less responsive, you couldn't do a better job than they did in the House of  I thank the Presiding Officer for his work on healthcare because I can actually recognize the concerns of my constituents in his fine work as opposed to what we have seen in the  One of the things that are so disturbing about that bill is that they are slashing Medicaid by around $830 billion. That is 20 percent of the Medicaid Program that has been cut in that House budget. This new budget would gut the program by another $600 billion. Combined, that would cut Medicaid nearly in half by 2026--in half. That means millions more This is why the CBO--the Congressional Budget Office--told us that 23[[Page S3201]]million Americans would lose their health insurance as a result of the bill--because it would mean that the minute all of this happened, people would struggle to get quality healthcare services.  In addition to the 23 million who are going to lose it because of the plan the Republican majority passed in the House, in my home State of Colorado--and I do not think it is very different from a lot of places in this regard--half of the people who are on Medicaid are kids. Are they supposed to go to work, or do we want them in school and having the benefit of a healthcare program?  Do we expect seniors in long-term care to go back to work? There are millions of Americans who are living in nursing homes, having spent their entire life savings for the privilege of being in long-term care or in nursing homes that are paid for by What are they supposed to do? Are we going to empty out the nursing homes in the United States?  I think, to some extent or another--I always get into trouble with my staff every time I say this, but I am going to say this again here--every one of us in this Senate is a conservative if ``conservative'' means to protect the institutions of our government and to think carefully before we leap. There is nothing conservative about this proposal on It is a radical proposal--a 20-percent Medicaid cut. We have not seen anything like that in our history.  What is amazing about this budget is not just that the math does not add up but that its targets are shockingly clear: rural communities, vulnerable Americans, vital investments in our future. This budget slams communities that are already hurting in our economy. Farmers would face a 21-percent cut to the Department of Agriculture, meaning less help to fight erosion, protect water quality, and improve irrigation. The budget eliminates the TIGER Grant Program entirely, which builds roads, bridges, and train stations all across the country. It cuts the maintenance budget for the U.Forest Service by over 70 percent, making it harder to maintain the trails and facilities that support rural outdoor economies.  I invite anybody here and I would welcome anybody to come visit That is not a hardship; it is a beautiful place. See the condition that our national forests are in and the work that needs to be done and the conditions under which employees of the Forest Service are being asked to do their jobs. It is not right. It is not fair.  This budget eliminates essential air service which helps connect our most remote areas. Besides water, it is probably the most important lifeblood of our rural communities. It cuts assistance to State and volunteer fire departments, exposing our mountain towns to even greater risk. This is a horrible budget for rural America--horrible.  This budget also turns its back on families who are struggling the most. It eliminates support to heat low-income homes through the winter. That is the reason Democrats and Republicans do not support this budget. It cuts safety inspections for coal miners, while devastating support to fight pollution and clean up toxic sites that disproportionately harm poor communities. It cuts assistance to the homeless and community development block grants--ends it--which promote affordable housing and economic development in low-income areas. It slashes food stamps by 25 percent. It is like the Grinch himself wrote this budget. Nearly half of those who benefit from that program are children--poor children.  This budget not only ignores our duty to ensure that kids in poverty do not go hungry, it also fails to invest in their future. This budget cuts education funding by $9 billion. It slashes afterschool and summer programs for low-income children. It cuts funds to help teachers become better teachers. It cuts programs to help students work their way through college.  There is not anybody in America who thinks it is right that we are bankrupting families and students because of the high cost of college, which is something that their parents and grandparents did not have to endure because of choices we made then that we are not making today.  Who in his right mind thinks an answer to that is to cut work-study programs? Yet that is in the budget. It takes aim at our next generation. The budget targets next-generation research and technology that we need in order to compete in the 21st century. It slashes funds to the National Science  Do you want a reason as to why Republicans and Democrats do not support this budget--why we have bipartisan opposition for it? It is that it cuts the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, by $8 billion even though its research supported over 330,000 jobs and $60 billion in economic activity just last year. It cuts research for low-cost, clean energy even though experts predict nearly $8 trillion of global investment in renewable energy over the next 25 years. It devastates the Department of Energy's loan program that spurs private investment and pays for itself.  Believe me, I have worked in every level of government. I have been in the private sector, too, and I know there is waste in every level of government. There is waste in the Federal There are programs that make no sense, and there are decisions we make that make no sense. We need to strive every day to become better stewards of taxpayer dollars. I do not think we do a good enough job in this place of oversight, of how taxpayer dollars are being used. Yet this budget does not target waste, and this budget does not target fraud and abuse; it targets who we are as a nation and what we hope for, for the next generation.  In these times, the American dream is not something we can take for granted. It is the product of choices our forbearers have made and choices we have made--choices to invest in the future, to look out for one another and ensure that all Americans have opportunities to make the most of their God-given potential.  Budgets are more than just dollars and cents; they answer important questions about our vision for the future and our values as In that sense, it is worth considering how this budget would affect the everyday lives of Americans--of the people who come to our townhalls or the people who are too busy working, trying to provide for their families, to be able to go to our townhalls.  If this budget were to pass, a working mom might lose healthcare for herself and have to worry that her aging mother might not be far behind. She might have to cut back hours at work to pick up her kid whose afterschool program was just canceled. Driving home, she will wonder whether her child's weeklong cough has anything to do with the air he is breathing or the water he is drinking or whether that dinner was the last of the groceries for the month even though it is only the 25th.  These are the choices our constituents are going to face, and that is not the future we want. It is not an America we would choose for our kids.

3307,topic-id,779,"Mr.President, I am here to talk about 55 million Americans who presently lack the authority to save for retirement directly from their paychecks. I am here to talk about preserving, protecting, strengthening retirement savings for all Americans, and I am here to talk about providing State and local governments with the tools they need to expand access to retirement savings accounts in order to reach that goal.  I am here to oppose H.66. This misguided proposal would tear down ongoing efforts at the State and local levels to help families achieve financial stability in retirement after years of hard work and sacrifice. These ongoing efforts at the State level should be encouraged, not deterred.  The numbers here tell a dramatic story. Many private sector employees have the option to set up and contribute to their own individual retirement accounts, often called We know them well. But fewer than 10 percent of workers without access to a workplace plan contribute to a retirement savings account. This lack of retirement savings often leads to ruins--life-transforming disasters at ages when nobody deserves them, jeopardizing access to adequate meals, housing, healthcare, and other necessities for older Americans across the country.  In response to this catastrophic possibility for so many Americans, in August of 2016, the Department of Labor promulgated what has become known as the State-sponsored auto-IRA rule. This rule provides basic, critical guidance for States on how to administer programs designed to improve access to retirement accounts among private sector employees. These State-facilitated programs allow State governments to provide automatic enrollment in State-sponsored IRAs, with the opportunity, importantly, to opt out at any time.  The rule that has been promulgated by the Department of Labor, which was also expanded to include a limited number of larger cities and counties, made it clear that any auto-IRA program established by a State or municipal authority must limit the employer's role in the program. In addition, the rule clarifies any ambiguity regarding the application of the Employment Retirement Income Security It makes clear the conditions under which ERISA does not apply.[[Page S2713]]  The misguided proposal before us today seeks to overturn all of this critical rulemaking, carefully devised and developed. If it is passed, the resolution will cripple efforts at the State level to ensure that retirement savings opportunities are more readily available for all workers.  I have always assumed that my colleagues across the aisle were in favor of State initiatives and State authority and State experiments and States addressing the issues of their citizens directly. These are basic States' rights--but not so much in this case.  H.66, in fact, will be particularly harmful in States like Connecticut, which has already begun to bridge the retirement savings gap for nearly 600,000 people who lack access to employer-based savings for retirement in our The Connecticut Retirement Security Authority has pioneered this effort. I am very proud to say, Connecticut is among several States that have made real progress toward expanding secure pathways to retirement savings for their private sector employees.  By leveraging State facilitation with private providers, these plans allow workers access to secure, low-cost retirement savings which, in turn, allow more workers to adequately prepare for retirement, improving life for those workers and also reducing the burden on taxpayer-funded services. In fact, encouraging increased retirement savings yields important savings for Federal and State budgets in the future, not just now.  Studies have shown that expanded retirement savings programs could potentially reduce Medicaid expenditures in Connecticut by over $65 million in the first 10 years after implementation. That $65 million in savings on Medicaid is for Connecticut alone. Think of the whole country. Think of the savings in Medicaid and other critical service programs that go to aid our seniors. They would much rather save for themselves.  I ask my Senate colleagues who believe we ought to be spending our time expanding, not limiting, access to secure retirement solutions to join me in opposing this legislation. There are many of our Republican colleagues who have long called for reduced government spending and in increased autonomy for State governments. They should be joining in opposing H.66.  There are many of our Republican colleagues who have long advocated giving people the freedom and the opportunity to plan for their own future. They ought to be joining in opposing H.66.  I ask all of us now to join me in voting no on H.66 because States ought to have the flexibility and the opportunity to implement proven strategies to support hard-working Americans who wish to prepare themselves for retirement. Give them that opportunity. Do not destroy it in H.66.  I yield the floor.

3327,topic-id,1539,"Mr.President, President Trump is expected to issue an Executive order directing the Department of the Interior to review all of the national monuments issued over the past 20 years, to see whether those monuments should be reduced in size or repealed. It is clear to me that many of us know the value of our public lands. But I am questioning whether our President understands that trying to illegally roll back those national monuments--some of the most treasured lands in our country--is something we should not do.  This shortsighted move is a pretext to attacking the designation of the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, which is sacred to the five tribes that form the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, and is a breathtaking site for all Americans who come to experience what is the unbelievable, unique beauty of the  Whether they are there hiking or climbing or vacationing, it is a special place. But President Trump's Executive order is expected to go even further than just Bears Ears, reviewing any designation in the last 20 years, threatening the question of the San Juan Islands or Hanford Reach National Monuments and the creation of other sites around the United States and threatening our economy.[[Page S2503]]  Time and again, the Trump administration is pushing for policies that are harmful to our recreation economy and a disaster for our pristine places, and it sets a terrible precedent for future conservation efforts.  The Antiquities Act is one of our Nation's most successful conservation laws. It was signed into law in 1906 by President Theodore Roosevelt to designate Devils Tower in Wyoming as our Nation's first national monument.  In the 110 years since its enactment, the Antiquities Act has been a very useful tool by 16 different Presidents--eight Republicans, eight Democrats--to designate more than 140 national monuments, including, as I mentioned, the San Juan Islands and Hanford Reach in the State of  Nearly half of all of our national parks, including national icons such as the Grand Canyon or Olympic National Park, were first designated as national monuments under the Antiquities So it is a very helpful tool to making sure we preserve those special places. I will note, too, that only 4 percent of all land in the United States is set aside this way, designated as part of the national park system or as a national monument.  So, of all the lands in the United States, we are asking to protect 4 percent of the lands, that are these unique special places, to be persevered for the American public and not turned over to special interests for oil and gas mining.  I also think it is important to note that the Antiquities Act gives the President the authority to make sure that these monuments are designated because from time to time there are those who do not believe in these special places.  I note that when the Grand Canyon was being considered, an editorial in that time period editorialized: ``The idea of protecting the Grand Canyon represents a fiendish and diabolical scheme.'' Now, I don't think that is what Americans think today about the Grand Canyon, nor do they think that it is something that hasn't enriched the lives of millions of Americans over the years or added to our economy and tourism. So I find it ironic that the same people think that the designation of Bears Ears is somehow a ``fiendish and diabolical scheme.''  Well, what I know is that the President is wrong to think he can use the Antiquities Act in reverse. In 1938, an Attorney General's opinion was issued stating that the President did not have the authority to use it in reverse.  So I think any attempt by the Trump administration to modify or revoke earlier national monument proposals is without the legal authority to do so. But I also want to make sure that we are talking about how important and how special Bears Ears is. It is a monument of true significance. It encompasses 1.3 million acres of beautiful desert hills, mesas, and sandstone canyons in southeastern Utah and is home to some of the most spiritually significant lands of the local Tribes and some of the best rock climbing in the world.  Bears Ears encompasses Native American archaeological sites dating back at least 13,000 years. The area is covered in rock art, petroglyphs and pictographs, cliff dwellings, and artifacts. So if nothing else, those special places should be preserved.  It is also special to many of the early inhabitants of that area: the Ute Tribe, the Navajo Tribe, the Uintah Ouray Tribe, the Hopi Tribe, and the Zuni Bears Ears is important to these Tribal members for sacred ceremonies, and hunting, and fishing.  Bears Ears also continues to be one of the richest paleontological resources in our Nation, with fossil records dating back millions of years. So it is easy to see why it is so important that this special place was designated.  In addition to its historical and cultural significance, Bears Ears is also a world-class recreation resource visited by rock climbers from all over the world. It is also visited by hunters, hikers, canyoneers, white water rafters, mountain bikers, and the entire conservation community. That is why the Outdoor Retailer show, which had previously located its biannual event in Utah, decided after two decades that they were pulling out. That is right. They are pulling out their $40 million contribution to the Utah economy because they are against the efforts by many in Utah to oppose the Bears Ears monument and try to get the President to reverse the Antiquities Act and then use that Federal land for oil and gas exploration. I was so proud to see the outdoor industry take such a bold step. Companies like REI, Patagonia, Black Diamond, and Outdoor Research really made a big and bold statement. They decided that if a State was going to attack the very economy that was so important to their jobs in recreation, they were going to do something about it.  I agree with the Salt Lake Tribune editorial on the Outdoor Retailer's decision, which said that the debate over public lands is about ``who we are and where we are headed. To get there, we need leaders with a better appreciation of the magnificent gifts God has given everyone, not just Utahans.''  So what is ironic and, frankly, a bit sad is that at the same time the Trump administration is waging war on our public lands and fighting imaginary ones, like the War on Coal, we have new data on just what an economic engine the recreation industry has become. Just today, the Outdoor Industry Association released a new report on the economic contributions of the recreation economy. Today, the recreation industry generates $887 billion in consumer spending every year. That is up more than $200 billion--from $646 billion--since the last time the study was done a few years ago. What does this tell us? Not only do more Americans enjoy recreation on our public lands, but an economy has been built around it, and it continues to grow and thrive, with new products, new services, and more comfortable and innovative ways to enjoy the outdoors. The outdoor recreation economy is responsible for 7.6 million jobs in this country. That is a growth of 1.5 million jobs since the last time the report was done.  Meanwhile, the Trump administration seems perfectly content to do the bidding of these natural resources industries instead of focusing on these jobs and these recreational opportunities that are booming. In fact, the clean energy economy is now supporting more jobs than fossil fuels in 26 States and the District of So it is an economy that exists in many parts of our country.  On top of this effort to try and weaken these national monument designations and use the Antiquities Act in reverse, the President is also expected to gut some of our key investments in science and innovation that are also helping us grow in new ways.  I will tell you that pollution is not an economic strategy. We cannot turn the economy of the past into hope for the future. What we need to do is make sure we are paying attention to the unique resources that these special places represent and the great heritage of both Democratic and Republican administrations, which have done great work by protecting places like the Grand Canyon and Bears  I hope all of my colleagues will realize that this is a futile effort and that these special places do not belong only to us. They do not belong to the people who are here on the Senate floor. They belong to generations and generations of  To those great Presidents--Republican and Democratic--who made those decisions and created those special places for all of us, thank you. I hope that some future generation will be standing here thanking us for protecting Bears Ears and all of the national monument designations that have taken place over the last two decades.

3280,topic-id,587,"I thank my colleague.  Mr.President, I rise to speak about what the Senior Senator from Virginia just spoke about, and that is the miners' healthcare. We have complete action at long last. This should have been done in December, when we were pleading with the majority leader at the time to get it done then.  But we are happy we are at this point now, where one of two--one promise has been fulfilled, and that is the promise of permanent, guaranteed healthcare for thousands, tens of thousands of miners across the country. In my home State, the last count was 1,955. Let's round it off to 2,000--a lot of families. We are grateful we are at this point.  I do want to reiterate what Senator Warner said about our colleague from West Virginia, Senator He is right. Joe Manchin brought this up at every meeting over the course of many, many months and several years. We are grateful for the leadership he demonstrated and grateful that he kept us all focused. I thank all of our colleagues who worked on this.  I think, initially, going back years ago, before Senator Manchin was in the Senate, Senator Rockefeller was raising this issue. This really has been around a long time--for at least 5 years. We heard this morning from Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America, who talked about this 5-year fight.  I commend and salute Senator I also thank the committee dynamic here, the Finance Committee--several members on the committee--with Senator Wyden helping us get this bill, the Miners Protection Act, through the Senate Finance Committee and the leadership of Senator Schumer, as well, in focusing our caucus on getting this done.  I just want to make two additional points. One is a negative note, but I think it is important to point this out. There was a story yesterday in the publication, Here is what the headline was: ``Trump administration admits it used miners' healthcare as a bargaining chip.'' That was the headline. Then the subheadline was: ``Coal miners were just pawns in a larger game.'' That is what the headline and subheadline said.  I am not sure I have read a more disturbing headline in a long time, where the healthcare of coal miners--retired coal miners, who were promised this decades ago, would be used as pawns in a debate about a spending bill. Unfortunately, that is at least what has been reported. I hope we don't ever see a headline like that again.  Going forward, the problem for us now is, as much as we are happy about this current result on healthcare, we still have a lot of work to do for miners, especially when it comes to their pensions. That is the second half of the promise.  So I remind everyone again, these miners kept their promise. They kept their promise to their company to work in the darkness and danger of a coal mine, sometimes for decades, not just years. They kept their promise to their families to support them in the most difficult job imaginable. And many of them have served in combat or served in the military, in one war or another. They kept their promise to their country. It is time we fulfill the entire promise, and that means getting pensions done as well.  We are grateful to be part of this, and let's keep the momentum going for pensions for all of the retired miners.  I yield the floor.

3305,topic-id,2423,"Mr.President, this week the Senate continues to consider the government funding bill, which I hope we will decide to vote on tomorrow afternoon. I want to highlight a few ways that this legislation is good for It addresses important priorities, and it is particularly good for those 28 million people I have the privilege of representing in  I know people say we don't want to do an omnibus appropriations bill, and frankly this is not the best way to do business, but when our Democratic colleagues objected to us processing individual appropriations bills, this is the only alternative, other than perhaps a continuing resolution.  A continuing resolution would continue Obama-era policies and frankly wouldn't end up saving any money because both of them are subject to the same spending caps under the Budget Control  Here we are. The House will undoubtedly pass this agreed-upon bill, the first negotiated bill with the Trump White House, with a Republican majority in the House and the Senate, and with Democratic participation and input as well.  First, as I mentioned yesterday, this bill provides significant funding to shore up security at our international border with This is a particularly important Texas issue because obviously we share a 1,200-mile common border with Mexico, but it is also a national issue. It is an important issue President Trump ran on and one of the reasons I believe he was elected.  Attention to securing the border is long overdue. I have always contended that border security is first and foremost a matter of political will because we know how to do it. The question is, Do we have the political will to accomplish it? Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol chief Manny Padilla likes to say--he served in numerous capacities all across the border, from Arizona, California, and now in the Rio Grande Valley in He likes to say that there are really three legs to the stool of border security. There is technology, there is personnel, and then there is infrastructure, what some people like to call fencing or walls. Each area along the border depends--the mixture will depend on what makes sense, what is actually effective. It is obviously important to get the advice and input of professionals of Border Patrol who work day in and day out to secure the border. With this omnibus bill, we will see the strongest increase in border security funding in nearly a decade. That means more resources to help Customs and Border Patrol, among other agencies, to enforce our laws, keep trade flowing, and stem the tide of contraband and illegal immigration.  When we talk about border security, it is also important to recognize the important economic and trading relationship we have with Roughly 5 million American jobs depend on binational trade with Mexico, which is another reason I have been paying such close attention to the administration's discussion about updating NAFTA and other important trading agreements. More than half of the entire border between the United States and Mexico is in Texas so this is critical to Texas and to Texans and necessary to keep our people safe.  Fortunately, this funding deal will also strengthen our Nation's defense at a time when, under the Obama administration, we saw a 20-percent cut in defense spending. As former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper liked to say--well, maybe he didn't like to say it, but he did say it: In 50 years in the intelligence community, he had never seen a more diverse array of threats in his entire career. So our country does face multiple threats all over the world.  This legislation includes more than $20 billion for defense--a real important plus-up in defense spending for the first time in a long time. This bill also includes new funding to support our military men and women deployed abroad in the fight against ISIS, for example, and it includes a pay raise for our troops as well. We have an All-Volunteer military that has been stressed--really, unlike any other time in our Nation's history--with the longest continuous time at war, particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq and now in other places around the world. So in an All-Volunteer military, it is really important for us to make sure that we treat our troops right when it comes to pay and living conditions in an All-Volunteer military.  Fortunately, this bill will also begin to tackle a major problem that I spoke about just last week; that is, our readiness--readiness of our military to face the new and evolving threats around the globe.  I would just pause here to note that some people have said we can solve the disparity in our needs or the threats and the amount we have been able to fund for national security by just tweaking the Budget Control Act of 2011. Well, the fact is, Congress only appropriates about 30 percent of the money that the Federal Government spends. Well, 70 percent is on autopilot because of the Budget Control We have been able to keep discretionary spending, which includes defense spending, relatively flat since 2011, when the Budget Control Act was passed, but the fact is, mandatory spending is growing at a rate of about 5.5 percent. In my own view, we are never going to be able to fund our priorities--including national security--adequately, unless we revisit all of that 100 percent of Federal spending, which is going to take an act of political courage on the part of the President and those of us in the Congress but something we really cannot continue to put off day after day, week after week, year after year.  This Omnibus appropriation bill funds the procurement of new warships and aircraft and increases funding to help modernize our ancient nuclear deterrent programs and includes resources to counter radicalism and instability in the developing world.  I am also glad this legislation includes funds to help our veterans and their families transition into the civilian workforce, and it will better equip Texans working in military installations across the State, keep our military ready, and funds resources for the battlefield.  So while there is a finger-pointing and blame game or credit-seeking game going on here in Washington--and I guess if the blame game were an Olympic sport, Washington would win that--but this is too important to be talking about in terms of political winners and losers. The truth is, the American people will be the winner if we keep the government running, if we do our job, and particularly if those of us who are fortunate enough to be in the majority after this last election will simply govern. That is what they elected us to do, along with the President of the United  On a different note--I want to close on this. Yesterday, I spoke about the terrible storms and tornadoes that whipped through East Texas over the weekend. Fortunately, we were able to secure additional disaster relief funding in this omnibus package that will play a big part in helping communities rebuild, not only from floods and bad weather we have had in the past but also this current tragedy with loss of life and loss of property. It will help our communities rebuild, recover, and prepare for the next storm.  This legislation will also bring us closer to a solution to mitigate damage from hurricanes and storm surges along the gulf coast in the Gulf of This is particularly an important issue in Houston and along that gulf coast region, which is a huge, vital economic center for our country. By funding an Army Corps of Engineer study, we can best find a way forward that keeps more Texans safe from the next big hurricane, which we know is coming, and the question is just a matter of when.  This bill also dedicates resources to improve and strengthen waterways that will help maintain Texas ship channels so they can handle more commerce and provide better flood control for susceptible areas.  I will close by pointing out that this legislation also appropriates funds for bipartisan bills we passed last year. I know frequently--if you read the newspaper or if you watch cable news--you may think that nothing ever happens here, but actually even under the Obama administration, Republicans[[Page S2712]]worked in a bipartisan way to accomplish important things like the Every Student Succeeds Act, the follow-on from No Child Left Behind, and one that actually does things that conservatives think is important and pushes more authority back down to the States and out of Washington when it comes to our schools. It makes sure that the States, local school districts, parents, and teachers have a say when it comes to the best quality and the best way to teach our children in K-12 schools. So we will fund much of that effort in this legislation.  I know many of our colleagues represent areas of the country that have been devastated by the opioid crisis, as well as heroin crisis, which unfortunately seem to go hand in hand. We worked closely together, in a bipartisan way, to fund the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act signed into law last year under President Obama to help tackle the opioid epidemic running rampant throughout many parts of the country. It also includes resources that help eliminate the rape kit backlog, one that I have been working on for some time, to make sure--the Debbie Smith Act, which is in excess of $100 million that is available in funding to forensic labs all across the country to eliminate the rape kit backlog. The power of DNA testing through these rape kits to identify the perpetrator of sexual assault, as well as to exonerate the innocent, is really something to behold. So in this funding, the rape kit backlog will be reduced and we will bring to justice victims of crimes and vindicate those who were accused but who are in fact innocent.  This legislation will also help provide funds for victims of human trafficking to recover, and it will help train law enforcement to handle an active shooter situation via something we passed last year, on a bipartisan basis, called the POLICE As the Presiding Officer knows, police changed their tactics when it comes to active shooters. I believe it was Columbine where the tactic was still used to surround an area near a school and to make sure nobody comes in or goes out, but our police and first responders learned to be very resourceful and innovative and indeed are training now. According to the POLICE Act, Federal funds go to State and local law enforcement and first responders to help the police train to engage an active shooter to stop the killing but also to train the first responders, typically the EMS officials, to stop the dying. So you can stop the killer, but unless you have EMS or emergency medical service personnel trained along with the police department, you may stop the killing, but you will not stop the dying, and that is the goal of this important bill. This legislation helps fund that.  So here is the bottom line. Legislation is always a compromise, so it never ever meets anybody's individual expectations in terms of what they would want as the perfect bill, but I know people are frustrated by that because they say: Why couldn't we do more? Why couldn't we get more of what we wanted, and why did we have to give up something that other people wanted in order to agree to pass this legislation? Well, that is the way our system was designed. That is the way our Founding Fathers created the legislative branch and made it a requirement that in a country as big and diverse as ours, that we needed to build consensus in order to pass legislation, and that means Democrats and Republicans, Congress and the White House, working together to come up with an acceptable consensus product. That is what this is. It is a product of bipartisan give-and-take. It includes many conservative priorities that I like--that we have been talking about for a year--that benefit communities across my It provides for our national defense, and it will make our country healthier and safer, and it does that at the same time as we consolidate or eliminate more than 150 outdated and unnecessary programs and initiatives.  That is why it is important we pass this omnibus, as opposed to another continuing resolution, which, by the way, makes it nearly impossible for our national security agencies and our intelligence community to actually plan. When we fund government for a 6-month period of time, they don't know what is going to happen after that. So it is really important that we put our shoulders to the wheel and we work together, on a bipartisan basis, to give them some more certainty, to give them a longer flow of revenue, so they can do planning and spend the tax dollars that are appropriated efficiently.  An important point that has been lost as we discussed and debated this bill is, it finally sets the country in a new direction--one that leads away from the Obama administration's priorities, which existed under the continuing resolution and was reflected by endless cycles of continuing resolutions. That is the past. We entered a new era of a stronger defense, less regulations for job creators, and a more streamlined and efficient government.  This is the first major piece of bipartisan legislation negotiated with the new White House, and it proves that we can come together when we must, that we can govern, and that we can deliver results. It will also serve as a good blueprint moving forward with a carefully thought-out strategic budget as we look ahead to the fall.  This legislation isn't perfect, but it does represent progress. It does represent an important watershed with this new administration, where we have all come together and reached agreement on a piece of legislation that we feel is beneficial to the entire country. If we are not going to engage in that sort of activity, but we are just going to vote no on everything because it is not perfect, we are not going to be able to make that kind of progress that we are all, I believe, committed to making on behalf of the people we represent.

3331,topic-id,1169,"Mr.President, as we come back into session after a 2-week State work period, I think we need to take stock of what we have been able to accomplish in working together during the last few months.  Through the efforts of the administration and in working with Congress, we have been able to greatly lessen the regulatory burden on many American job creators, which is something sorely needed while our economy has been bumping along at, roughly, 2 percent growth of our gross domestic product since the Great Recession of 2008. We have confirmed a ninth Supreme Court Justice, and we have seen strong, credible action taken against people like the terrible Assad regime in  It is important to remember, as folks continue to judge the current administration and its foreign policy in particular, how we got here and what this White House inherited after 8 years of the Obama administration.  As President Obama left office, he left in his wake fires burning around the world. There is no better example than the Middle President Obama celebrated the Arab Spring as a testament to the power of a democratic voice, but he did little to help our partners across the Middle East and North Africa find stability and prosperity. Along the way, he made the world a lot more dangerous for all of us by his inaction or, in some cases, by his actions. Libya is one of the most tragic examples.  Without his coming to Congress but instead going to the United Nations for a resolution, under President Obama's watch, the country fractured after he helped to launch a poorly conceived military campaign that helped depose Muammar Qadhafi, with no plan at all as to what to do afterward to stabilize the country. Apparently, despite all of President Obama's criticisms of President Bush's 2003 invasion of Iraq, he learned very little from it, and terrorists, including ISIS, jumped at the opportunity to fill the vacuum in  Later, the American Consulate in Benghazi would be attacked, resulting in the deaths of four Americans, including that of Ambassador Christopher That was the result of President Obama's failed strategy in  To the east, as 2016 came to a close, Syria was embroiled in even more disarray, more bloodshed, and more violence than when the civil war initially broke out. President Obama promised the world--now infamously--that should the Syrian Government use chemical weapons that at that point a red line would have been crossed. We know how that turned out and so do the citizens of Syria and so do, importantly, other thugs, autocrats, and dictators around the world--red lines crossed but not enforced.  President Obama's threats went unanswered. Russia became bolder in its support of Assad as it became clearer that the United States would not intervene. Now, in light of years of inaction by the previous administration, we have a refugee crisis in the Middle East and throughout Millions of people have been displaced both internally and externally across We have a war criminal leading the Syrian Government who has repeatedly used chemical weapons and indiscriminately killed civilians, including children, in a region even further from any measure of stability than when President Obama took office.  Yet, instead of developing a strategy, instead of listening to his own military and national security leadership, President Obama and his team perversely opted to strengthen our adversary The ill-conceived JCPOA deal cemented the status of this state sponsor of terrorism as a future nuclear power as it released billions of dollars in sanctions relief to the regime and empowered our enemy to engage in even more terrorist activities abroad and around the world. After 8 years of the Obama administration, the bottom line is, our foremost enemy in the Middle East became stronger, not weaker.  On top of all of that, President Obama pushed aside our strongest ally in the region--Israel--time and time again to appease nations that were working against us. That is simply not how the United States should operate in its leadership role around the world.  I could go on and on about the foreign policy failures of the last administrations with respect to the Middle East, but it is not the only region in worse shape. Under President Obama's watch, Russia invaded Crimea and eastern It repeatedly threatened NATO member states and ramped up its cyber espionage to influence and undermine public confidence in free and fair elections both in the United States and in Along the way, our allies in Europe were cast aside rather than assured of our support--all with Russia's mounting aggression close by.[[Page S2505]]  In the Pacific, China continued to advance its regional dominance by making claims to islands disputed by our allies, going so far as to convert sand bars and reefs into island military bases--some with 10,000-foot military-capable runways right there in the South China  Finally, North Korea continues to develop and test its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities with the threat of soon being able to use both to reach the continental United North Korea carried out four nuclear tests during the Obama administration. That is simply unacceptable.  The truth is, after two terms of inaction, no coherent strategy, and leading from behind, our allies and partners around the world questioned the commitment and power of the United States and our ability to defend our national interests around the globe.  I, personally, am thankful for what we have seen President Trump accomplish so far, even in a short period of time. His tough but honest discussions about America's role in the world are appreciated not only by those of us here at home but by our allies and friends around the world who have been hungry for American leadership.  When Assad crossed a line the entire international community deemed abhorrent, President Trump, unlike President Obama, took action. Unfortunately, President Trump has inherited foreign policy predicaments that were created by both the action and inaction of his predecessor around the world. My hope is, President Trump will continue to work with the great team he has assembled to make sure U.interests are put first and that America continues to exert its leadership role around the world.  The truth is, a strong America and an America that leads is a stabilizing and peacekeeping influence around the world. Just the opposite is also true. As America retreats, there is no other country that can fill that leadership vacuum. It is inherently destabilizing, and it is an invitation for bad actors around the world to take advantage of that power vacuum.  I look forward to working with the administration, as well as all of our colleagues in the Congress, to help keep Americans safe by making clear that we will back up and support our allies and partners abroad and send a powerful message to those who threaten our interests.

3348,topic-id,325,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and that is Alzheimer's disease.  Since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer's disease have increased by 89 percent. Right now, there are more than 5 million Americans with Alzheimer's, and that number is expected to grow to 14 million--to almost triple--by the year 2050.  Alzheimer's and other dementias can be especially devastating both physically and emotionally for those who have these diseases and for their loved ones, your family and my family--for me, too many aunts and uncles, including my mother.  When Lena Costa was diagnosed with the disease, she took it on with the same strength and courage she had used to beat cancer and survive heart disease. She was in her late eighties. Upon hearing the diagnosis, she turned to my sister and to me and said calmly and bravely: ``Jim, Bette, I will just do the best I can.''  Today, there is no cure for Alzheimer's and there is no effective treatment for it. There is no proven way to prevent the disease or no method for slowing its progression.  Unlike my mother, we are not currently doing the best we can. We must come together to support additional Alzheimer's research--more funding. That is what we did in April when we in the House called for additional support for Alzheimer's research at the National Institutes of But we must do more.  Alzheimer's is a devastating disease. We must stand together, calmly and bravely, like my mom and so many of our loved ones who have been affected by Alzheimer's throughout our country.  Just as importantly, we must fix America's healthcare system. Certainly, in the last week, we have proved that there is no Republican way or Democratic way, but there is an American way, and that is if we work together as Members of Congress to improve America's healthcare system for all.

From 1942 until 1945, the U.Government detained over 120,000 American citizens of Japanese ancestry and of resident immigrants forcing them to live in internment camps, taking them away from their homes, their farms, and their businesses, many in California, in the San Joaquin  As American citizens, the internment denied them their constitutional right of due process.

3402,topic-id,549,"Mr.President, in recent years the American people have lost trust in the Federal government to keep our personally identifiable information, or PII, secure. In June of 2015 the Office of Personnel Management was infiltrated with a major cyber breach, affecting more than 22 million current and former federal employees,[[Page S2652]]including myself. In January of 2016, another nearly half a million Americans had their social security numbers stolen when the Internal Revenue Service was hacked.  I spent 28 years in the private sector, 12 years with a global cloud computing company. We faced cyber threats daily, and our customers expected security of their data. We delivered and not once was our data compromised. And we certainly did not give it out voluntarily. When there is an opportunity to protect our PII, we need to act on it and begin to rebuild trust with the American people.  In 1984, the public disclosure of certain manifest information was required of Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The original intent was to increase competition, to facilitate better public analysis of import trends, and to allow port authorities and transportation companies to more easily identify potential customers and changes in their industries. However, in recent years, PII of relocating individuals, bringing their home goods back to the United States, has been released, enabling identity theft, credit card fraud, and unwanted solicitations.  CBP does offer a process for consumers of shipping services to make their information confidential. However, these forms typical take two months to process and are often processed after the individual has moved.  That is why I am introducing the Moving Americans Privacy Protection This legislation will simply require CBP to remove personally identifiable information from vessel manifest sheets before making them available for public disclosure. I believe the default should be to protect peoples' privacy and automatically remove this personal information, rather than requiring citizens to make a request and hope the paperwork is processed in time.

3278,topic-id,1058,"Mr.President, our Nation faces a retirement savings crisis. Too many seniors live in poverty after a lifetime of hard work, and too many people are facing retirement who have not been able to put away the adequate savings they will need. That is a problem not only on a human level and on a moral level but on an economic level.  When seniors are forced to live in poverty, that hurts all of us and is a strike against our Nation's values. As more people have to spend money to take care of their retired parents and relatives, that hurts our economy. Millions of seniors do not have family[[Page S2700]]members who can spend those resources, so it is taxpayers who will have to make sure seniors have a place to live, food to eat, and medicine to keep them healthy. That is why we must do everything we can to help people save for retirement themselves and not have to rely on the taxpayer, to help them put a little bit of money away while they still can.  At the very least, the Senate should stay out of the way of our States that are taking action to address this looming crisis, but that is not what the Senate is doing here today. Instead, we are debating a resolution that would make it harder for people to save for retirement. We are debating whether to limit the ability of State governments to help people save for their retirement.  While some Americans are fortunate enough to work at companies that offer their employees retirement plans, many more do not. That is significant because research shows that the best way for people to save for retirement is through a retirement plan at work. Without one, workers are less likely to invest in an IRA or a 401(k) savings plan. That is why it is so worrisome that there are 55 million Americans right now in this country who do not have access to a retirement plan through their jobs. As the baby boomer generation approaches retirement, that is a serious problem.  President Obama proposed establishing a national individual retirement account program to help these 55 million Americans, but Republicans said no. In the absence of congressional action, both red States and blue States took the lead. They did so by coming up with a way for Americans to better save for retirement. One solution that has gained momentum over the last few years is to establish retirement programs at the State level to give people the chance to have retirement contributions deducted out of their paychecks into that plan if their company doesn't already offer a retirement program. It would give every worker across this Nation the same access to the tax breaks those lucky enough to have access to an employer-sponsored plan receive.  In my home State of Illinois, we were one of the first to do this. A few years ago, our State created the Secure Choice It is an innovative program that is poised to give 1.3 million Illinoisans the opportunity to save for retirement when it launches next year. It is important to note that not only is Secure Choice innovative, it does not impose any burdensome mandates. It is optional. People can deduct up to 3 percent of their wages, and it applies only to businesses with at least 25 employees that have been in existence for 2 years. Secure Choice is also portable, so people can take their savings with them if they switch jobs. It is estimated that it will save taxpayers almost $243.8 million in the first 10 years because retirees will not need to rely as much on Medicaid spending.  It is a pragmatic solution to address a real-world problem. Other States have since followed our lead in establishing other similar programs. That is why I find it so ironic that my Republican colleagues, who frequently speak about the need to protect States' rights, are using this resolution we are voting on today to try to block States as culturally and politically different as Illinois and Arizona from offering or even having the freedom to offer these plans. Instead of allowing States to be the laboratories of democracy they so often talk about, Republicans are trying to limit States' flexibility and, in the process, increase regulatory burdens on employers. That is quite a role reversal.  Why is there this push to block the States from trying to help their residents better save for retirement? One reason could be that it would pad the financial industry's bottom line. That is because many investment brokers don't want increased competition, and they are worried that programs like Secure Choice that are run by States will offer people who are saving for retirement a better deal.  News reports have indicated that mutual fund companies are worried that they will lose customers to State-based plans, even though the entire purpose of efforts like Secure Choice is to help the millions of Americans who are not currently saving for retirement. Other news outlets have reported that financial analysts on Wall Street are worried that State plans will be transparent about hidden fees, which means that financial analysts may be forced to reveal that they are charging fees that are perhaps a little too high and will have to lower how much they charge.  Instead of encouraging greater competition that will help 55 million Americans save money for retirement, some of my colleagues are listening to Wall Street lobbyists who want less competition and who want to take away a retirement savings option from hard-working And here I was thinking that the conservatives believe competition produces better outcomes for the American people.  At the end of the day, we as Senators must do everything we can to make it easier for people to save for retirement, not harder. We must look out for the constituents who sent us here to represent them, not for Wall Street or for special interests. That is why I urge my colleagues to stand by the States that have led the Nation in creating retirement plans, States as different as Illinois, Arizona, California, Maryland, Oregon, Connecticut, Washington, and New Please do not take the opportunity to save for retirement away from 55 million hard-working  The PRESIDING The Senator from                    Coal Miners Healthcare Benefits  ",CREC-2017-05-03-pt1-PgS2692-2.txt,2123,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,3.0,April

Unfortunately, many of the actions of the new Attorney General, since he was confirmed, have not erased these concerns. The Attorney General has already begun making dramatic changes at the Justice Department, including on critical issues like criminal justice, civil rights, immigration, and funding for crime prevention.  Just last week, Attorney General Sessions disparaged a Federal judge from Hawaii who issued an order blocking the Trump administration's Muslim travel ban.  Attorney General Sessions said: ``I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power.''  Senator Mazie Hirono, my colleague on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the junior Senator from Hawaii, pointed out that Hawaii was granted statehood in 1959 and called the Attorney General's comments ``insulting and prejudiced.''

3288,topic-id,721,"Mr.President, today I rise to express my strong opposition to H.66. This resolution would overturn a rule issued by the Department of Labor that is essential to providing increased access to retirement savings programs.  Among all working families in America ages 32 to 61, the median family in America had only $5,000 saved in 2013. This indicates to me that we are clearly facing a retirement savings crisis.  In California, 7.5 million workers don't have access to a retirement savings plan through their jobs, including 3.4 million women. Of those without a workplace retirement savings plan, almost 5 million are individuals of Color and over 3.5 million are  The good news is that, when a person has access to a retirement savings program through their workplace, they are 15 times more likely to save for retirement.  In California, legislators have been working for more than 4 years to create the Secure Choice program as a way of addressing the retirement crisis we face. This program allows workers to easily save for retirement through a deduction made directly from their paycheck.  Those who need access to a workplace retirement program the most, individuals with lower incomes, are far less likely to have that access. These are the people who stand to gain the most from the Secure Choice program and lose the most by Congress halting its progress.  Let me share some examples of the people who would be impacted. Most eligible employees work for small businesses that might not be able to offer retirement savings plans on their own. Nearly half of eligible workers work in the retail, hospitality, healthcare, and manufacturing industries.  This program supports lower and middle-class workers by providing access to the tools they need to control their financial future. The average wage of workers eligible for this program is $35,000, and 80 percent of eligible workers earn less than $50,000.  We are in a time of deep income inequality and must stand up for programs that support the middle class, like Secure Nationwide, the bottom 90 percent of households have seen their income drop compared to what it was in 1970. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent has seen their household income triple.  As workers struggle to make ends meet, it is appalling to me that Congress would actively take away a key resource for financial planning.  Californians want to ensure that all employees have access to a retirement savings program. The Department of Labor's rule clears the way for California to set up programs like Secure Choice by clarifying employers' obligations to the accounts.  This rule would also help small businesses compete for qualified workers who expect and deserve access to a workplace retirement savings program. Small Business California supports the Department of Labor's rule paving the way for these programs, and opposes this resolution.  Finally, in California, our State chapter of the Chamber of Commerce specifically asked for an opinion from the Department of Labor on employer obligations. Once the Department of Labor's rule was issued, CalChamber no longer opposed the California bill.  In fact, the legislation that passed in California requires the State board to report a finalized rule from the Department of Overturning the Department of Labor's rule ignores the effort and care taken in California to craft a program that works for both employees and employers.  Nationally, almost half of working-age households do not have retirement savings accounts, and 55 million people don't have access to a workplace retirement plan. This is shocking.  According to the Economic Policy Institute, the median retirement account savings for families ages 56 to 61 was only $17,000 in 2013. This is only slightly higher than the 2016 poverty threshold for a household of two people aged 65 and older. It is inconceivable that a family could afford to finance their retirement with only $17,000 in savings.  Supporting retirement savings is not a partisan issue. In fact a bipartisan group of State treasurers oppose this resolution, as does the National Conference of State  We are facing a retirement savings crisis in our country, and the Department of Labor's rule is a commonsense guideline that makes it easier for individuals to save for retirement.  I strongly urge my colleagues to stand up for American workers and support their access to retirement savings programs by opposing this resolution.  Thank you.

During his nominations hearing to be Deputy Attorney General, Mr.Rosenstein promised us that he would ``work to defend the integrity and independence of our justice department, to protect public safety, to preserve civil rights, to pursue justice, to advance the rule of law and to promote public confidence.''  However, many Members have mentioned they are concerned about the FBI Director's announcement of an investigation of And during his nominations hearing, Mr.Rosenstein was repeatedly asked if he would commit to appointing a special counsel to handle any investigation in this matter. I was impressed with his unfailing commitment to independence when he answered these questions.  Rather than prejudge investigations before he knows the facts, he unwaveringly promised to make decisions only after thoroughly reviewing all the relevant information in a particular case. He committed to not prejudge the situation before he knew the facts. And he committed to conducting every investigation with independence.  I personally believe Mr.Rosenstein possesses the necessary independence to conduct any investigation of this type. He told us he had never met with Russian officials nor has he spoken to the President or Attorney General about this matter. And he spoke in great length about his career-long commitment to independence and to conduct his work free from political concerns.  In fact, we already know that he has a well-known reputation for independence. In 2012, Attorney General Holder specifically asked Mr.Rosenstein to handle a special investigation into leaks of classified information because of his reputation for independence and impartiality.  When Republicans suggested a special prosecutor might be appropriate, members of the Judiciary Committee assured us that none was necessary precisely because Mr.Rosenstein was at the helm of the investigation. One member of the Committee described him as a ``scrupulous man'' and ``independent.'' There was ``no reason to believe why [he] cannot work with the FBI and assemble a very strong prosecution team where warranted.''  Mr.Rosenstein is still scrupulous and independent. If Mr.Rosenstein could conduct an investigation with independence under Holder then, he can certainly do it now. Furthermore, Mr.Rosenstein comes with high recommendations from a bipartisan list of former Attorneys General and Deputy Attorneys And he comes with high recommendations from his home state Senators, current and former.  Former Senator Mikulski wrote the committee and told us that he will be a ``strong, experienced leader at the Department of Justice who is fair and committed to the equal application of our laws'' and ``In these polarized times, now, more than ever we need a strong, experienced leader at the Department of Justice who is fair and committed to the equal application of our laws. I hope the Senate will confirm Rod Rosenstein for this important position.''  After Senator Cardin described all Mr.Rosenstein's professional accomplishments when he was introducing him at the hearing, he said, ``What impresses me the most, he has done this in a totally non-partisan manner.'' And concluded by saying, ``I think Mr.Rosenstein is the right person at the right time for Deputy Attorney General.''  Finally, James Cole, President Obama's Deputy Attorney General, wrote to inform the committee that Mr.Rosenstein will respect the need for the Department ``to not only enforce the laws, but to also maintain a level of independence that enables it to have credibility in the eyes of our citizens.''  From all I see and know about him, I believe Mr.Rosenstein will keep his promise for integrity and independence. He promised us if he is confirmed as Deputy Attorney General, ``all investigations under my supervision [will] be initiated and conducted in a fair, professional, and impartial manner, without regard to political considerations.''

3287,topic-id,747,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the Congressional Review Act measure to overturn the Department of Labor's rule that gives States the flexibility to help small business workers save for retirement.  Every American who has worked hard throughout their life deserves the ability to retire, knowing that they will be financially secure. But it is clear that we are on the verge of a retirement crisis. More and more Americans are retiring every day without the economic security they need, and we are beginning to see the harmful impacts of what happens to a generation that was not afforded the opportunity to participate in a traditional pension plan.  The AARP has estimated that 55 million Americans, including roughly 230,000 Granite Staters, do not have access to a retirement plan at their workplace, and participation in retirement plans has dropped over the past[[Page S2705]]several years. Few low- and middle-income families have retirement accounts. For families who fall into the lowest 25 percent of household incomes, fewer than 10 percent have retirement savings accounts. Even among families where the primary wage earners are between the ages of 56 and 61, those who are nearing retirement, the median retirement account balance for all families, regardless of income, was only $17,000--far less than what those families will need to live on in retirement. Therefore, we should be doing everything possible to support these future retirees and to look for opportunities to help them save now.  The Department of Labor rule that we are debating today supports States' efforts to enter into innovative public-private partnerships that would increase personal savings rates for employees of small businesses. The rule makes clear that small businesses will experience no operational burden for these plans, and workers have the opportunity to opt out of these plans if they choose. Already we have seen five States adopt their own plans based on this guidance, and additional States are considering similar programs that best match the retirement needs of their citizens. We are starting to see results. Research has suggested that employees with access to retirement plans from their employers are 15 times more likely to save for retirement.  Unfortunately, too many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are pushing this Congressional Review Act measure to roll back the progress States are making and to limit a State's ability to decide to facilitate a critical service to their citizens. If this measure passes today, the 12 million Americans who have already benefited from their States entering these partnerships will see their retirement plans impacted, and the other States considering these measures will have to stop.  As a former Governor, I understand how decisions made here in Congress have the ability to impact a State's ability to innovate and grow, and it is unacceptable that Republicans would vote to limit a State's authority to help their citizens save.  In States across this country, there is broad bipartisan support for State-facilitated retirement plans. Recent surveys have found that 80 percent of private sector workers support State-facilitated plans to help them save for retirement, and 80 percent of small business owners say they support the basic concept behind these plans. The bipartisan National Council of State Legislatures said passage of the CRA will ``result in an unwarranted preemption of state innovation'' and will ``restrict the ability of millions of hardworking Americans to save for retirement.'' The AARP has written that ``a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn this rulemaking represents significant overreach by the federal government.''  I find great irony in the fact that many of my Republican colleagues are voting to limit the ability of States and localities to innovate and craft policies--something they often say they support in other areas.  Additionally, retirement plans sponsored by States help save taxpayer dollars. Greater retirement security would result in fewer older Americans falling into poverty, reducing the number of citizens who would be forced to access social safety net programs.  This Department of Labor rule is exactly the type of commonsense, bipartisan proposal we should all support, and I am willing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in order to address the retirement needs of Granite Staters and all Undoing the States' progress on this front by voting in favor of this measure would limit the ability of more Americans to save for their retirement.  I will vote against this measure, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

3269,topic-id,1345,"Madam President, I rise today in honor of Law Day earlier this week, May 1. Law Day is an annual tradition that is celebrated around the United States, usually at local bar association luncheons. It has been a tradition for over 40 years as a day to recognize the rule of law. The 2017 theme for Law Day was the 14th Amendment--a post-Civil War amendment, which for the first time in the Constitution defined what an American citizen was, the definition of citizenship, but it also provided a protection for all citizens as an entitlement to the privileges and immunities of all the laws in all the States, and all persons were entitled to equal protection of the laws, as well as no deprivation of life, liberty, and property without due process. It is a powerful and important amendment to the  I want to talk about Law Day because there is a matter that is soon to be pending before the body: a proposal in President Trump's fiscal year 2018 budget to eliminate funding for the Legal Services Corporation, the effort that was begun more than four decades ago to try to provide free legal services for indigent people on matters in the civil courts that could affect their lives, liberty or property.  I will say, I am standing here as an attorney who practiced for 17 years and practiced with Central Virginia Legal Aid and saw the value of their work. I am familiar with their work across the Commonwealth and country, and I also have a bit of a personal bias that I have to disclose. My wife Anne was a Legal Aid lawyer from 1984 until 1998--14 years' worth of Central Virginia Legal Aid Society, trying cases, big and small, but also doing something I will use as a theme in my comments. She helped start an award-winning program at Central Virginia Legal Aid to get private lawyers to do voluntary work for indigent clients.  Legal Aid operates like small law firms in all these communities, but much of what they do is not just represent people in court. They bring private attorneys in who are willing to volunteer and provide them the training in cases like housing cases and others that might not normally be part of their practice. The Legal Services Corporation is very critical to the vindication of rights. There is an engraving over the Supreme Court Building across the street: ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' That is supposed to mean equal justice regardless of who you are, your gender, your race, your national origin but also whether or not you can pay. The article III branch, just like the article I or article II branches, is supposed to be open to all. So Legal Services Corporation is critical to providing legal services to people who otherwise wouldn't be able to pay it: elderly, veterans, low-income families, disabled Americans, victims of domestic violence. It does so on a fairly miniscule Federal budget.  The entire funding for legal services is less than one ten-thousandths of the Federal budget. Yet President Trump is proposing to eliminate it. Legal Services Corporation maintains 133 independent nonprofit programs in every My colleague from Maine was an attorney with one of those programs and is on the floor today. It funds the operation for 903 separate offices in the country. They served 1.8 million people in 2015. Of the nearly 756,000 cases that they successfully worked on and closed that year, 129,000 of the clients were people over age 60. More than 500,000 of the clients were females. Women comprised 70 percent of the Legal Services Corporation client base and 116,000 of the cases were cases about domestic violence. The offices around the country did as my wife's office did--they relied on these private attorneys, bringing in and training more than 91,000 private sector attorneys who volunteered during 2015 to help a Legal Aid client working with a local office, and they continue to do more.  They partnered recently with Microsoft to develop Pro Bono Net, a statewide legal portal for individuals to obtain direct legal assistance specific to their needs. They established the Leaders Council, comprised of leaders, not necessarily leaders in the legal community but others to promote the value of what they do. LSC in 2016 launched the Rural Summer Legal Corps--30 law students working in rural areas to address challenges these communities encounter.  It goes about its mission in an apolitical manner. Legal Services Corporation is not allowed to lobby. It works in blue and red States, works in urban and rural communities. It works everywhere and for everybody. The legal community is strongly in support of the continuance of the Legal Services Corporation--the American Bar Association and most State bars. In Virginia, just in Virginia, seven statewide bar associations have pledged their support for the continuation of Legal Many of them visited me in my office last week: Virginia State Bar, Virginia Bar Association, Virginia Trial Lawyers Association, Virginia Association of Defense Attorneys, Old Dominion Bar Association, Virginia Women's Attorneys Association, and the Virginia Hispanic Bar And 160 of the Nation's top law firms have urged this body and urged the White House not to defund Legal Aid, and 185 general counsel's offices from preeminent American companies--Disney, HP, American Express, and GE--have weighed in and said we need Legal  Many of Legal Aid's clients in Virginia are veterans because we are home to such a huge number of Active-Duty servicemembers, their families, and veterans. LSC helps veterans, Active-Duty military and their families access housing, deal with consumer financial challenges, or deceptive trade practices. Central Virginia Legal Aid recently dealt with a client, an elderly disabled veteran, who received a notice of involuntary transfer or discharge because an insurance company determined that his health had stabilized, despite the fact he was not even ambulatory and incontinent as well. Central Virginia Legal Aid worked with his insurance company to demonstrate this veteran had continuing physical needs, and he needed to have in-home care without further burdening his family, and were able to find a resolution. This is the kind of case that Legal Aid works on every day.  In conclusion, I want to say this. The budget proposal that we will grapple with--my colleague from Maine, who is here, is on the Budget Committee, as well--proposes to eliminate funding for Legal That would be a very bad idea. It would not help the economy. It would hurt vulnerable people who have nowhere else to turn. I was in the Shenandoah Valley at a senior center about 10 days ago. This was the story that a local Legal Aid lawyer put on the table, as I conclude. A 90-year-old woman in Waynesboro, VA, was ripped off by a traveling salesmen who sold her $10,000 of frozen meat she could not afford--virtually all of her savings. She realized very quickly she had been bamboozled by a fast-talking salesman: Why did I do this? I can't afford it, but I have given him my money. What do I do? This is the kind of case no private lawyer will take. You are not going to be able to get a legal fee for this. This is the kind of case that involves knowledge of particular consumer protection statutes that Legal Aid is well trained to do. And the Legal Aid lawyer who was representing this 90-year-old woman who had been ripped off by somebody said: Look, if I wasn't here for this person, nobody would be here. And that is what you get when you get Legal That is what you would lose if the Legal Aid was defunded.  I just put it on the table to my colleagues. Many in this Chamber are attorneys. Many have worked directly with Legal Aid offices in their States around this country and know the value of the program. We need to make[[Page S2695]]sure this program continues. In honor of Law Day this week, I just want to say, I hope my colleagues will join me in my effort.  ",CREC-2017-05-03-pt1-PgS2692-2.txt,2176,HONORING CAPTAIN JOSHUA TODD BYERS,2017.0,3.0,May

What has happened in this case, on the application of the University of Maine at Presque Isle--affectionately called UMPI--the University of Maine at Presque filed its application, which was 65 pages. They met all the requirements, but they made a terrible mistake. The rules of the Department of Education say that the application must be double-spaced. Indeed, the application is double-spaced, except for[[Page S2693]]an exhibit on page 21, which is single-spaced. It is double-spaced in the body of the application, and there was one other infographic in the application which was a space and a half--1.5 instead of 2--and the application was rejected for that reason alone.  This is preposterous. This isn't a game. This isn't ``gotcha.'' This is about real people. At the University of Maine at Presque Isle, it is 129 real people, and it is about their access to higher education, their access to a better life, their ability to achieve success. The application of their university was rejected because this little piece on one page and a similar piece on another page was 1\1/2\ spaces instead of 2. This is nonsense. This is the kind of thing that makes people hate government. This is the kind of thing that makes people say: What are they thinking down there? What is wrong with Washington? Why can't they get something so simple as looking at the substance of the application instead of applying what can only be characterized as a bureaucratic rule?  I am not one of these people who attack bureaucrats and Federal workers. In my experience, they are good people who are trying to do the right thing, and they make enormous contributions to our country. In this case, somebody somewhere in the Department of Education made a dumb decision, and it is one that is going to impact my people in I can't just keep quiet about it.  Last week, after letters from the Maine congressional delegation, which I will place into the Record, the Department of Education announced: Well, it probably wasn't the right thing to do. This wasn't a very good policy. I guess we made a mistake.  The problem is, it doesn't help UMPI; it only helps people in the future. I have worked with my colleague Senator Collins on this. She has done research. Her office has discovered precedents where indeed this kind of thing has happened before and they fixed it. They fixed it so that the application could be considered.  By the way, the decision on these applications around the country has not been made yet. We are not prejudicing anybody. We are not making a change after the fact. All they have to do is go to page 1 of the UMPI application and read it and forget about the fact that it is 1\1/2\ spaces in this little exhibit in the middle of the double-spaced application. In fact, we can fix it. We will make this double-spaced. I feel silly even coming to the floor of the U.Senate talking about this double-space, 1\1/2\ spaces. What are we doing here?  Again, the reason I am so passionate about this is that these are real people's lives. These are 129 young people who will not be able to take part in this program, and very likely their entire lives can be compromised by this. This is a big deal for them. It may be a little deal for the Department of Education, but it is a big deal for the University of Maine at Presque Isle and their students.  All I am asking is for the Department of Education and the Secretary of Education to look at this obvious, ridiculous bureaucratic mistake, correct it, and correct it for those who have been prejudiced by it. It is not just the University of Maine at Presque Isle; I understand there are a number of others across the country whose applications were kicked out for similar reasons.  I understand there has to be some uniformity. It has to be written in It has to be on reasonable paper that you can read, and it is not to be handwritten. To reject an application involving 129 young lives in my State because a little piece out of a 65-page application has 1\1/2\ spaces instead of 2--give me a break.  This is something that can and should be fixed, and I assume and believe the Secretary of Education and the people in charge at the Department of Education will find a way to fix it and prove to the people of Maine that the government in Washington is not crazy, that we can make reasonable decisions, and that when we make a mistake--and they acknowledged last week that it was a mistake, that it was not good policy, and they have rectified it going forward. But let's admit the mistake and relieve those who have been impacted by that mistake of its weight, of the obstacle that it places in the way of young people's opportunities.  I understand that this issue has arisen in Montana, Wisconsin, Arkansas, West Virginia, New Jersey, Ohio, Washington, Delaware, Alabama, Illinois, California, New York, Massachusetts, Florida, and It is time for it to be addressed. It ought to be very simple, and it ought to be taken care of in a matter of days--not weeks or months, but in a matter of days--so that those young people and our university can plan and implement and move forward in their mission to enrich and enable the lives of our citizens.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter submitted to the Department of Education by the Maine congressional delegation on this subject.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 2017.     Re University of Maine at Presque Isle's Upward Bound Grant          Applications #P047A170346 and #    Betsy DeVos,     Secretary, U.Department of Education,     Washington,       Dear Secretary DeVos: We are writing to support the      applications submitted by the University of Maine at Presque      Isle (UMPI) for two grants under the fiscal year 2017 Upward      Bound Program competition and to express our strong concern      that the Department of Education has determined that these      applications are ineligible for consideration. As strong      supporters of the TRIO programs, we were particularly      troubled to learn that UMPI's applications were ruled      ineligible due to an unintentional, minor formatting      oversight, which UMPI has not been given an opportunity to      correct. According to UMPI, the Department's decision risks,      over the next five years, denying 960 disadvantaged high      school students the chance to fulfill their academic      potentials.       The Notice Inviting Applications for New Awards (Notice)      for the Upward Bound Program competition, published in the      Federal Register on October 17, 2016, includes formatting      criteria not mandated by They are arbitrarily      drawn, entirely unrelated to the substance of the      application, and do not provide any recourse for applicants      to correct minor, unintentional, non-substantive mistakes.       UMPI has applied for two Upward Bound Program grants, and      both have been deemed ineligible for the same reason. We      understand that the Department has relayed to UMPI that a      line-spacing error, appearing within two info-graphics on two      of the application's 65 pages, is the cause of the      ineligibility determination, as these two pages do not comply      with the Notice's double-spacing requirement. These info-     graphics are intended to help the reader review the      application efficiently and more easily and contain text that      is 1.5 line spaced instead of double spaced. It is obvious      that the figures merely supplement a well-prepared narrative.      Were they removed, or were UMPI permitted to adjust the line      spacing on these two pages, the application would easily      warrant the Department's review. Yet unbelievably, the      Department refuses to review UMPI's application and has      provided no opportunity for UMPI to correct this trivial      mistake. We strongly urge the Department to reconsider its      decision and to allow UMPI's application to be read and      scored.       We appreciate that the formatting standards issued by the      Department are intended to prevent applicants from attempting      to gain an unfair advantage by using clever formatting      strategies. When the application is reviewed as a whole, it      is clear that UMPI is not seeking to mislead the Department      or to gain any unfair advantage. In fact, the error was so      insignificant that UMPI could not immediately identify it and      had to seek additional guidance. Now, the Department's      inflexible and bureaucratic decision could result in the      elimination of a longstanding, successful, and greatly needed      program on the basis of a non-substantive error before the      application is even read.       The Department has not identified for UMPI any other errors      in its application. To deny UMPI's application a reading      because two figures do not meet an arbitrary typographical      format ignores the spirit of the Upward Bound Program, is      antithetical to congressional intent, and would seriously      jeopardize the future success of hundreds of students in            The Upward Bound Program at UMPI serves 129 high school      students across Aroostook County, Maine, and has a strong and      long record of success in sending local low-income, first-     generation students to college. Since 1980, it has helped      students with great needs access the promise of higher      education.       We strongly urge the Department to apply some common sense      to the Upward Bound Program competition and read and score      UMPI's applications.           Sincerely,     Susan Collins,       U.    Bruce Poliquin,       Member of     Angus King, Jr.[[Page S2694]]       U.

3271,topic-id,463,"I say to the Senator from Virginia, 48 years ago this summer I joined the national legal services program and went to the State of Maine, where I served people in a very rural area with a whole range of problems. What I came to realize during that time was that the promises of our democracy, the promises inherent in the American idea, are not self-executed.  Every morning we pledge allegiance to this flag, and the last phrase is critical: ``with liberty and justice for all.'' That is a promise made to the people of this country. But the U.Supreme Court has found repeatedly, as the Senator knows, that you can't achieve justice if you don't have representation, particularly in an age of an overlapping and complex legal system.  So I believe this is not just another government program. This is part of the essence of the American idea. I remember being up in Maine in this small town of Skowhegan, I met a woman who was visiting from She said: What do you do?  I said: Well, I work for this group that provides legal services to low-income people in this region.  She said: How is it funded?  I said: By the government.  She said: Do you ever have to sue the government?  I said: Yes, of course. That is one of the things that you occasionally have to do in order to protect the rights of your client.  She was amazed that in this country we would fund the legal support of people who might actually occasionally bring cases against the government itself. She thought that was wonderful and really epitomized the idealism of this country. So I commend the Senator for raising this issue during Law Day to talk about the importance of this in terms of its relationship to the overall idea of  We talk a lot about justice. As you point out, across the street it says: ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' But that often means you have to have competent and professional advocacy and representation. The Legal Services Corporation is not a big part of the budget. It has not grown exponentially over the years. In fact, I suspect in real dollars, it is smaller today than when I entered the service 48 years ago.  But I know it is important. It is important in Maine, with the Pine Tree Legal Assistance, the Volunteer Lawyers Project, and the volunteers from law firms around our State who volunteer to give their time for pro bono legal assistance. But the hub of it is the National Legal Services To me, it epitomizes our commitment to effectuate the promises of American life, not just to talk about them but to make them real. So I commend the Senator for his comments.  ",CREC-2017-05-03-pt1-PgS2692-2.txt,1724,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,3.0,June
3281,topic-id,470,"Thank you, Mr. I join my colleague, Senator McCaskill from Missouri, in her comments about the Central States Pension We have over 14,000 workers and retirees in our State affected by this as well.  But I really stand here today to thank Senator Manchin for his work and to thank our leaders, Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer, as well as Chairman Cochran and Vice Chairman Leahy for their ability to put partisanship aside and get this deal done. It meant everything from funding for the COPS Program to helping to combat the opioid epidemic, Capital Investment Grants, and medical research.  But for one guy here, it was all personal, and that is Joe He fought long and hard to protect healthcare benefits for his coal miners. Think about this: In October, 12,500 retired coal miners and widows received notices telling them that their healthcare benefits would be cut off at the end of the year. Then, in November, another 3,600 notices went out. That is over 16,000 people.  I don't have coal miners in my State, but do you know why I knew about those notices? Because Joe Manchin[[Page S2702]]made sure that I knew about those notices and because the other Senators who spoke here, who have coal miners in their States--they stood up and made sure we knew about those notices, and they worked tirelessly to get this done.  For me, mining is not about that black coal dust. It is about red dust. It is about iron ore. As Senator Manchin knows, my grandpa worked 1,500 feet underground in the mines in He got his first job as a teamster when he was only fifteen. He had to quit school and go to work and help raise his eight, nine brothers and sisters. One of them died. His parents died. He worked underground his whole life. He went down that shaft and that cage every single day, just to support his brothers and sisters. Then he married my grandma and supported my dad and his brother.  Do you know what? I wouldn't even be here in the Senate today if he didn't have the pension benefits that came out of the job he had--and healthcare. Joe Manchin understood that about the people he represents. Those miners earned those pensions, and they earned their retiree healthcare benefits. That is why what he did, and what all those Senators who represent the coal miners did, is more than just about those States and about those miners. It is about a promise we made to our workers.  As one former Congresswoman, Barbara Jordan from Texas, once said:       What Americans want is something simple. They want a      country that is as good as its promise.  I thank Senator Manchin for fulfilling that promise.  I yield the floor.

3283,topic-id,1663,"Mr.President, first of all, I cannot express how humbled I am and how proud I am of all of us, and my colleagues here, my dear friend Senator We were Governors together. We split the Virginias--Virginia and West We worked together. He has the same constituency base I have in West Virginia, in Southwest Virginia, and all of West He knows the mining industry. He knows the hard-working people.  To Senator Donnelly from Indiana, we have been there together with the coal miners and the people who moved the coal and do the hard lifting. To Senator McCaskill from Missouri, Senator Casey from Pennsylvania--Pennsylvania has a rich tradition in coal mining--Senator Klobuchar and everyone who has spoken, and I want to thank the Presiding Officer too. He was an original cosponsor from So this is truly bipartisan. From Arkansas, the Presiding Officer understands hard-working people. He signed on to the bill without hesitation. I want to thank him. So it was really a team effort.  People have been talking about all of the things and the passion we have for different things. My passion comes from the people I was born and raised and grew up with in the coal mining towns. So all I ever saw in my life was people around me who nurtured me and guided me and taught me who were truly coal miners or coal miner families. That is all I knew. My Little League coach was a coal miner. My Boy Scout leader was a coal miner. A lot of my teachers were coal miners, basically, off and on, trying to supplement their incomes. My teammates whom I played ball with through high school became coal miners. My grandfather was a coal miner. My uncle was a coal miner who lost his life in a 1968 mine explosion. My next-door neighbor in 1954--I remember I was 7 years old, and I wanted to throw a ball all the time.  I would come home from school, and Pinchy would be there. He would throw a ball with me. I can still remember this so vividly. One day I was ready to play ball and Pinchy did not come home. I asked Mercia, his wife: Mercia, where is Pinchy?  She said: Joe, honey, he is going to be a little late today.  Well, we just had a mine explosion. I did not know anything about the mine explosion, but I knew there was no Pinchy to throw a ball with. So the second day, I asked: Mercia, where is Pinchy?  Well, they still didn't know the outcome. The rescue was going on. They did not know if they lost their lives or not or what had happened. So they were still in limbo.  She said: Joe, Pinchy has to work over again tonight.  That was her explanation to me, the little boy. The third day, she--by that time they knew. She had to tell me. So she is probably--I know Mercia had to labor with this. How is she going to tell this 7-year-old neighborhood kid who played ball with Pinchy?  She said--this is a tough one. She said: He is not going to come home.  When you think about the hard-working people who suffered--she never had anything. If it was not for healthcare and if it wasn't for a pension, Mercia would have had nothing. So I know the families and I know the sacrifices. What you all saw was my passion for the people I grew up with. So when I say thank you, I thank the President for supporting miners--President Trump--I thank my Republican colleagues, and I thank all 48 Democratic Senators who never wavered.  A lot of them don't even know a coal miner. What they know today, after 5 years that we have been talking about this and working toward this, is that you would not have the country you have today if it hadn't been for those people who sacrificed, who worked hard, never asked for a thing, gave everything they could back, took care of their families but took care of their country.  Basically, the energy they produced gave us the country. People, whether in California today, wherever they may be, understand that coal miners produced the energy that allowed us to win World War I, World War II, and every war we have been in, that supported the industrial might that we have that built the middle class.[[Page S2703]]  I am so thankful for all of that. I get choked up when I think about it because that is what we were fighting for. They never asked for a thing. My grandfather was run out of the mines in 1927 because he was trying to organize and say: We can't make it.  If you have ever heard the song lyric, ``I owe my soul to the company store,'' my grandfather owed his soul. He never had any money. He had script. He said: We have to do something different. We can't live like this.  They blackballed him. On Christmas Eve, 1927, my grandmother was pregnant with my uncle. She already had four children. My dad was the oldest. They came to the house and threw them out of a company house in the middle of a snowstorm. That happened in 1927.  So we know it. We lived it. In 1946, they talked about the history. In 1946, the Krug-Lewis amendment--Krug was Secretary of the Interior and John Lewis was at the United Mine Workers, and they said: You have to give those people something so they have something to live for. They have no health care. They have no pension. They have given you everything they have.  Harry Truman said: We are going to take care of them. You can't go on strike because if you do, our economy collapses. This is in 1946. So that is how this came about. Now, people said: Well, I have heard this. They are going to bail them out. We are not asking for a bailout. You understand, these people basically made an agreement that every ton of coal that was mined from 1946, the United Mine Workers basically, there would be an amount of money set aside that came from every sale of a ton of coal that went into this fund.  Every union contract negotiation, they contracted and they left money in their contract to pay for their benefits of healthcare and pensions and did not take money home to their families that they could have used. They made all of these sacrifices for all of these years. It wasn't their fault that the bankruptcy laws that were passed in Congress allowed companies to walk away and leave them high and dry.  It was not their fault. They did everything. So finally we have all come together to do the right thing that should have been done. It shouldn't be played politics with today. Everyone says we have winners and losers. We are all winners. If you can get something like this accomplished and be part of it, then you have to feel good about it. It gives you a reason to even be here.  That is what I am so appreciative of. I am so proud of everyone who has stood together on both sides, my colleague Shelley Moore Capito, a dear friend of mine, a I am a You know what, we are Americans and we are West That is what we were fighting for. That is the winner today. The winner is this great country that basically stood up and protected the people who gave them everything they needed to be the superpower of the world. That is what we fought for.  So there is enough praise and enough accolades for everyone to take home and say: We all did it, and we all did a job well done. We do have pensions now. These are not big pensions. These are $300, $400, $500 pensions. It supplements the way of life that is not extravagant by any means. So we are going to start working as soon as this is finished this week, and next week we will start on that.  To the 22,600 miners and their families who say thank you--I have heard from most of them--to all of the people who came up here, they were coming up here, a lot of them every week driving just to be here, to be part of it and put a face, put a family, put basically the challenges they would have being able to even exist or live without this healthcare--they made it possible. I want to thank all of them.  To Cecil Roberts, president of United Mine Workers, who was so diligent on this, Phil Smith, all of the people who worked so hard, I thank them, but really thank all of our Senators and the My congressional delegation, I am appreciative of them, our Republicans and Democrats on the House side who voted. They are voting now as we speak. The Senate is poised tomorrow for us to vote and support this.  I know President Trump will sign it. People are saying they used it, played bargaining games with it. I am not going to get into that because I don't know how you could ever sincerely mean that you were using people's livelihoods and the healthcare for them and their families as a bargaining chip. I don't think anybody meant to do that. Maybe it came out in something that should have not been said, but with that, we have to forget all of that.  Let me just say thank you. To the Presiding Officer, to all of my colleagues, thank you. Thank you for a job not only well done but basically very appreciated that it was done, and people's lives will be different because of what we did. God bless each and every one of you. Thank you.

This is called automatic opt in. They could say: I don't want that 3 percent put into a retirement plan. Make it 2 percent, make it 1 percent, make it 5 percent, or make it 0 percent. They would have the control, but when they first start the job, it automatically puts away a little bit for retirement.  I think about my son and daughter--my son who is 21 and my daughter who is 19--and they have worked a whole series of modest little jobs, from pouring coffee to coaching sports teams to working as a lifesaver and so on and so forth.  What if for every single job in those companies that were not providing those retirement plans, workers automatically had 3 percent of their funds put away toward retirement in a low-cost option--the same kinds of low-cost options that U.Senators have when they come here to the Senate, the same types of low-cost options that every Federal employee has? Why not give that same opportunity to ordinary working Americans? That is what we are here talking about.  We already made it harder to set up such stand-in plans--plans that stand in when there is no retirement plan provided by the employer. In March, we passed another CRA making it difficult to impossible for municipalities to create such a plan for their citizens, but the plans probably made more sense at the State level.  Now come my friends across the aisle to say: It is not enough. It is not enough that we hit them once by stopping the municipalities from providing a plan. We are going to hit them again--kick them while they are down. That is the attitude of this provision that is before the  What we are really talking about is denying the American dream to millions of citizens across the land who work for employers that don't have retirement plans or who run small businesses and don't have the administrative overhead to be able to set up a plan. This rips away the certainty that comes with knowing that if you work hard and play by the rules, you automatically save through one of these plans and you get a certain level of security and a certain level of dignity in your golden years.  Isn't it our job here in the Senate, as representatives of our citizens and our States, to do everything we can to provide a ladder of opportunity, to lift up the men and women of this country?  It isn't our job to say: Well, the States provided a ladder of opportunity; so let's go tear it down. Let's take a buzz saw and saw up that ladder of opportunity, because, wow, why would we want the States to help out our citizens? Isn't that not our job--to try to destroy opportunity?  But here we are with my colleagues saying: Well, as to these folks who don't have a retirement plan set up by their employer, we are going to make it as hard as possible for them to save money for retirement.  I hear the same folks come down here and say: Well, you know what; wouldn't it be wonderful if everyone saved more for retirement?  Well, yes, it would be. So why don't we make it easier for them to do so, not harder. A plan that puts no imposition on the small business--doesn't that make a lot of sense? Isn't that a win-win? Isn't that a blow in favor of helping out working people, rather than a blow that knocks them down?  Today, apparently, we have a slim majority that says: No, knock them down.  Furthermore, there is apparently a slim majority that likes to preach on States' rights. But when it comes to States trying to address a problem, you have a powerful special interest come to Capitol Hill and say: Don't let it happen because, after all, maybe one of them someday will be a customer of ours, and we wouldn't want them to be able to get help from their State while they are waiting for us to help them.  A powerful special interest comes here, and suddenly States' right are out the door, States' rights are out the window.  The conversation during the Presidential campaign was that we heard about electing a President who will[[Page S2714]]fight for workers. Well, that was yesterday, because today we are passing a bill that Members of the Senate expect the President himself to sign to take a buzz saw to the ladder of opportunity for working people--the President of the United States, I am talking about, to take an ax to the program that makes it easier for Americans to save money for their retirement.  Now, don't we know that public pensions are disappearing and private pensions are disappearing? What we are left with is Social If workers don't have pensions through their jobs, and all they have is Social Security, it is going to be pretty rough in retirement.  There is another option: to make it easier for workers to save. According to one study from 2013, 40 percent of small business owners had no retirement savings, 75 percent had no plans for funding their retirement, and 55 million Americans--nearly half of the private sector workers in America--are employed in jobs that do not offer any form of retirement savings or pension plan.  Well, that is a lot of Americans who are only going to have Social Security unless they save.  We know that it is much easier for them to save if they have a workplace plan and funds go into that plan automatically, and the individual worker can change the amount, the set-asides. They can increase it. They can decrease it. They can stop it. They can reactivate it. But because it is set up automatically, most workers choose to stay in it once they are there.  Workers don't want to have a different retirement plan for when they worked at this company and then another one at this company and another one at that company, or companies that didn't have a plan so they had to set up something on their own.  The idea is that this plan is portable, that you can take it from employer to employer. These are the things that are appealing to our State governments, which are saying: That is what will work well for the citizens of our  Shouldn't we enable the States to be a laboratory of invention, a laboratory of innovation? Shouldn't we enable them to test run whether this works or doesn't work, instead of our taking and destroying that pilot project, destroying that laboratory of innovation, destroying that experiment at the State level to see if this would help make American citizens better off?  This would all be done at the State level at no cost to businesses. In fact, that is what businesses have liked about it. That is why they have lobbied their State legislatures to say: Hey, maybe you would like to do this. We are too small. It is too difficult for us to set up a retirement plan. Maybe you all would like to design one that would be available.  At this moment, 25 States are considering legislation to create retirement savings accounts for small business employees that currently aren't able to participate in a workplace retirement plan because the workplace doesn't have one. Twenty-five States are looking at this. Even if only one State were looking at it, shouldn't we give that State the opportunity? Five States are looking at it--and power to them because maybe one of the five will figure out a way to make it work and the other States will learn from that.  Twenty-five States are looking at this because there is such an urgent need for their citizens. Seven of those 25 States are already at work implementing plans.  I am very proud that Oregon, my State, is one of those seven. It plans to launch a voluntary pilot group later this summer. If that goes well, it was planning to expand that plan over the next 2 years, and if that goes well, it was planning to make it available to individuals working in any job in Oregon where there wasn't a retirement plan.  That is very thoughtful. Start with a little group, expand it to a few more, and see if it is still working. If it is a good model and the feedback is good and you need to make some changes, you can make it on a small scale. When it is ready to roll, if it is doing a good thing for America's workers, for Oregon's workers, give every Oregon worker that opportunity to easily save for retirement.  There is so much interest from the States, so much interest from the businesses in those States for the possibility of experimenting with these plans. Last year, the Department of Labor set up the safe harbor rule that helps to clarify a piece of ERISA, our Federal retirement law, to make it possible for States to pursue this. That is what is before us today. Are we going to undo the protection to let States experiment?  The AARP likes to point out that these State-sponsored plans would likely increase the number of workers saving for retirement. That is because, as they enter the workforce, they would be automatically enrolled. They would be able to continue using that plan even if they change jobs within the That would be helping them from their very first day of employment in the workforce.  Imagine your son or daughter, age 15 or 16, getting that first summer job or evening job or early morning job, and already they are starting to save for retirement. It makes a big difference over their working years, which might cover four decades or more. It makes a big difference, whether they have anything to back them up other than Social  It is good for small businesses because not only does it free them from feeling badly that they hadn't set up a plan, but it makes their workers happier, more productive employees, and the businesses get to have all that by bearing no additional costs.  It is good for taxpayers. It is good for It is good for business. It is good for the workers. The only thing it is not good for is for some powerful special interest that has failed to offer plans to these workers but says someday it might and it doesn't want the competition--a powerful special interest coming here to Capitol Hill to rip down a ladder of opportunity for workers.  Is the President going to sign that after he campaigned on helping workers? Well, yes, apparently he is because that was yesterday in a campaign, and today is the reality of governing. Apparently, a powerful special interest is talking to the President of the United States, and he is helping that interest, rather than the workers of  He is fighting for a Federal blockade rather than for States to be the laboratory of innovation and experimentation.

3302,topic-id,865,"Mr.President, like so many, I spent the weekend reflecting on what the past 100 days have meant. And from President Trump--aided by congressional Republicans--it has been 100 days of broken promises, 100 days of far too much division, and 100 days of attacks on women and workers and seniors. It has been 100 painful days for many, no doubt about it.  It is not surprising then that to kick off their next 100 days, President Trump and Republicans have prioritized today, sending a clear message to Wall Street that the Trump administration remains open for business and is committed to standing with them and not with working families. That can be the only possible message, since today, Senate Republicans have advanced another one of their favorite tools this Congress--yet another CRA--to thwart efforts by States to simply provide their workers access to retirement savings program.  In March, Senate Republicans voted to overturn a rule that would allow major cities the flexibility to start their own retirement savings programs. No doubt, the negative impact of this reversal has already been felt across the country. Today's effort by Republicans to target State programs would have even more far-reaching consequences now and in the long term.  If Senate Republicans jam through this CRA that is on the floor today, they will be pulling the rug out from numerous States nationwide, leaving over 15 million workers, which includes nearly 2 million workers in my home State of Washington, without any easy option to save for their retirement.  This is going to have a significant, chilling effect across our retirement system for our workers, for our Governors, for State legislators, and State treasurers.  As AARP said this week, it would send the political message that Congress is opposed to State flexibility to increase retirement savings. We would likely see a number of States delay action or legislation to offer workers more savings options because of the perceived congressional prohibition. This cannot and it should not happen.  Fifty-five million workers today in our country lack access to a workplace retirement plan through their employer. That is about one-third of all of our workers in this country. Our retirement savings gap has continued to worsen, and it is true for most States across this country. It is true for my home State of Washington, despite progress and steps in the right direction over the past few years.  Today, fewer than half of all Washington State workers participate in a retirement plan at work, and nearly 90,000 Washington small businesses offer no retirement arrangement. This is too common all across our country. Because Congress has been unable to come together to address this retirement savings crisis, States have now begun to step up to help workers save for retirement through savings programs.  As I previously talked about on the floor, these savings programs simply allow employers to automatically enroll workers while giving workers the opportunity to opt out. These programs only apply to businesses that do not currently offer retirement plans. They in no way limit an employers' ability to seek out and offer their own employer-sponsored plan.  These plans are worker and business friendly. There is little paperwork required for workers to participate in the program, and there are no added burdens to small businesses. In fact, in these programs, employers are strictly required only to serve in administrative capacity.  Last year, Democrats working with the Obama administration pushed for guidance to provide certainty to States that have launched their own retirement programs. This guidance simply clarifies an existing safe harbor allowing employers to establish payroll deduction IRAs, which gives States clarity they need that these programs will not be preempted by Federal retirement law.  This guidance merely provides flexibility to cities and States to move forward with these programs, and in fact it was requested by the States and local officials. This is pretty common sense. In fact, it is the kind of proposal that Democrats and Republicans have agreed on for several years.  As much as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may not like to recall now, many of them have been on the record previously supporting just these kinds of efforts. Really, it is not hard to understand why. As I have said, it is very clear who President Trump and Republicans are standing with on this. Working families across our country are seeing clearly that on any chance to move the ball forward for them and their retirements, Republicans are now standing in the way and choosing instead to put the interests of Wall Street first.  This is a critical vote. Families are watching. If you say you stand with working families, you vote against this resolution. If you want to meaningfully address our retirement crisis, vote against this resolution.  I urge our colleagues to reject this harmful repeal. I urge them to stand with our States and our working families who just want to provide economic retirement security for the families in their  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

3285,topic-id,773,"Mr.President, Congress has spent the first 4 months of this year using an arcane, expedited procedure to roll back policies from the previous administration, while disregarding the impact these changes will have on American workers and families.  When you hold a belief that anything done by a Federal agency is bad, cutting programs seems like progress, but, unfortunately, it is not that simple.  I am all for streamlining government and making the process of doing business easier, but some rules--rules that keep workers safe, for example, or to protect consumers or to keep our air and water clean--are protections that make sense.  In their ideological zeal, the majority has time and again made the decision to roll back important policies regardless of the impact on American people.  So far this year, just to name a few, the majority has rolled back environmental protections for clean water and allowed internet service providers to sell your personal browsing history to the highest bidder. The majority has also reversed rules that make workplaces safer and has even made it easier for corporations to bribe the governments of developing countries.  Now today, as the window closes on the majority's ability to rush through legislation under the Congressional Review Act, we are again facing a vote that could harm American families and make it harder for people to save for retirement.  As I have said on this topic before, for the people of Michigan, the American dream can take on many forms. But no matter who you are, there are a few fundamentals that I truly believe cut across the entire American society. One small piece of the American dream is the ability to retire with dignity and save enough to be able to pass along something to the next generation.  The measure under consideration today, which would repeal the Department of Labor's safe harbor for States developing retirement plans, would be a step backward, and it would make it harder for people to save for a secure retirement.  It is no secret that the American economy has changed in the last generation. One of the most profound changes for working families has been the dramatic shift from defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution plans. Our current system of IRAs and 401(k)s work well for many people, but it is unfortunately leaving millions of Americans behind.  If you work for a large, stable employer--like those of us privileged to work for the U.Senate--you will more than likely have access to a retirement plan. Americans, when they have access to these types of plans, make smart, prudent financial decisions.  Over 90 percent of Americans with access to a workplace plan report saving for their retirement. But not everyone works for a large employer, and for those who do not, the system has very large, gaping holes.  Nearly 60 million working Americans do not have access to a workplace retirement plan. These are workers who are trying to put something away for a comfortable retirement and build a stable financial future for their families. They simply demand some solutions, and they certainly deserve them. Families don't care if it is a Democratic solution or a Republican solution, nor do they care if it is a Federal Government idea or their local State's idea. They simply want and need access to a plan that allows them to build a better future.  So this leads to a very important question. If the States are working to do their part to find solutions to this problem, why would we in the U.Senate work to block them?  These safe harbors provided by the Department of Labor are the perfect example of allowing the States to do what they do best, which is taking an active role as laboratories of democracy.  As I have said, we need big ideas, we need small ideas, and, frankly, we need all of the ideas that we can get. But I am saying here today that I am willing to work with any of my colleagues on a plan--big or small--to help Americans move toward a secure retirement.  A secure retirement cannot become a relic of the past, but this piece of the American dream will only be true for this generation of workers if we start working on these solutions now.

3329,topic-id,642,"Mr.President, I rise today to acknowledge and honor Michigan farmers. Agriculture is a vital part of Michigan's economy. In fact, Michigan is home to more than 51,000 farms that contribute over $100 billion to our Nation's economy. Michigan is also the second most diverse agricultural producer in the Nation, growing more than 300 commodities, including a significant portion of our Nation's milk, corn, cherries, cucumbers, and much more.[[Page S2504]]  Last week I had the pleasure of visiting the Iciek Dairy Farm in Gladwin, It was incredible to see firsthand how this family-run dairy has grown from a small farm of a few dozen cows to a large, modern dairy operation with 700 cows and seven full-time employees.  Today, the Iciek Dairy works with the Michigan State University Extension program to help mentor new businesses and farmers who are just starting off with their own small dairy operation. Michigan's farmers and farmers all across our country feed our country and people around the globe, and we must do what we can to support them. Our agricultural businesses rely on the ability to access the resources they need to keep growing, creating jobs, and contributing to our economy.  Access to these resources can be especially challenging for new small farm operations that are just getting started, including those small farms that make up 82 percent of Michigan's agricultural producers. Small farms that are just starting up or are facing tough economic conditions sometimes struggle to find and secure affordable credit. That is why I am working across the aisle with Senator Tillis to urge congressional appropriators to fully fund the Farm Service Agency loan programs as Congress considers government funding bills for 2018.  The Farm Service Agency works with lenders to guarantee and deliver small dollar loans to the small farms that need them the most. When a farm has no other options, Farm Service Agency loans and guarantees can help farmers cover urgent operating costs for feed, seed, and fertilizer to get them through the season. Without these loans, farmers could lose their ability to purchase equipment and other necessities for the planting season and could be forced to curtail their operations.  Currently, more than 2,300 farms in Michigan have Farm Service Agency loans totaling over $630 million. Across the country last year, the Farm Service Agency made and guaranteed a total of 39,650 loans totaling $6.3 billion. It is critical that Farm Service Agency funding reflect expected demand for loans so that small farms can continue to have this crucial lifeline.  This program is in such high demand that just last year the Farm Service Agency ran out of money to finance its operating loans, including more than 1,000 loans that had already been approved for small farmers. This led to a backlog of loans, and farmers were forced to wait for months until Congress passed emergency funding to get the loans they needed for their day-to-day operations.  Access to capital is critical across a range of businesses, but it is incredibly important to our farmers. They can lose out on an entire growing season if they cannot buy the equipment and the supplies they need while they wait for Congress to fund the Farm Service  Today, ensuring that the Farm Service Agency has sufficient funding is even more critical, especially following President Trump's proposed $4.7 billion cut to the U.Department of  Like our small businesses, students, and families, America's farmers deserve to have affordable loan options, and they deserve our attention and our support. I urge my colleagues to join me in asking for robust Farm Service Agency funding so we can continue to support our farming communities as they support and sustain us each and every day.

3277,topic-id,3542,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about an issue that affects every single Senator in this body and all of us as Americans, and that is this epidemic of drug use--opioids--which would be heroin, prescription drugs, the new synthetic heroins, like fentanyl, carfentanil, and U-4. It is devastating our communities. This is the worst drug crisis we have ever had in this country. That is my view, but it is also the view of a lot of experts. I have been involved in this issue for over 20 years, and I have never seen anything like it. That is why I have come to the floor to talk again today. This is the 34th time that I have spoken on this issue on the Senate floor in the last year or so.  I come with sadness in my heart because it is not getting better. Based on the statistics I have seen from my home State of Ohio and around the country for the first quarter of this year, it looks like the number of deaths and overdoses from drug abuse are increasing, not decreasing. Part of it is because of these new drugs coming in, particularly synthetic drugs, including fentanyl, carfentanil, and U-4--things that are produced in a laboratory by some evil scientist somewhere and shipped into our country.  So the need to act has grown only more urgent. Every day we are now losing 144 Americans to drug overdoses. Think about that. Every single day, 144 Americans are dying of drug overdoses. It has now far exceeded the number of people who are dying in car accidents in my home State of Ohio and it is exceeding that number around the country.  Millions more are not dying of overdoses but are seeing their lives and their futures ruined, and millions of us--those of us who are not drug addicted but who have friends, family, and neighbors who are--are watching loved ones as they fight this addiction. Maybe they have lost a job. Maybe they have broken relationships with families and friends. Maybe they have committed a crime like theft, shoplifting, or fraud to pay for their habit. Maybe they have just given up hope.  Just last week, I met with some community leaders from Dayton, As it happens, no matter where I am in Ohio, this issue comes up and this is what they want to talk to me about. They wanted to talk about the story of Nathan  Nathan Wylie was a happy 13-year-old boy. He was a Cincinnati Bengals fan. His goal in life was to be a professional football player. He wanted to play for the Bengals one day. He had his whole life ahead of him.  Nathan's dad, according to police reports, is a heroin user. One day a few weeks ago, Nathan got into his dad's heroin, and he overdosed. His dad took him to the fire station and first responders did what they could. They took him to Dayton Children's Hospital, but it was too late. Nathan died of an overdose at age 13.  Two weeks ago, a 14-year-old girl in Dayton was mowing the lawn at the apartment complex owned by her grandparents, and she came upon a body on the ground. It turns out that it was a 25-year-old young man who had died of an overdose.  This is what is happening in our communities.  Just a few hours after this young man who died of an overdose was discovered by this girl, Dayton Police responded to a car accident on Route 35 where a man had driven through a barrier and knocked over a street light. Police arrived and found the driver passed out with a used needle on the floor of the car. In this case they saved his life. They used this miracle drug called naloxone, or Narcan, which reduces the loss of life because it reverses the effects of overdoses. It doesn't always work, but it works the vast majority of the time if you get there in time. He was revived, and he said that he not only just used heroin, but that he was on his way to get more when he overdosed and almost died.  So I could go on. We see these headlines every day, not just in Dayton, OH, where I talked about these three cases, but all throughout our State and our country. That is why people are starting to take action to turn the tide, and I commend them for it.  Last week, more than 500 religious leaders across northeast Ohio banded together and said: We are going to do something about this. They took to their pulpits all at once to speak about this issue. A lot of them talked about National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, which was this past Saturday that it occurred. Father Bob Stec of Ambrose Parish in Brunswick, OH, gave his parishioners a three-part action plan. 1, get educated. Learn about these opioids. Learn about the connection between prescription drugs and heroin. With many heroin addicts, their use started with prescription drugs.  2, throw out unnecessary medications from your medicine cabinets. It is unbelievable the number of people I have run into who have said they started because they took prescription drugs, and they got their prescription drugs--in one case, a young man told me--from his grandmother's medicine cabinet.[[Page S2697]]  3, he said, was to pray for our first responders. God bless them, because they do save lives every day--in Ohio, 16,000 lives last year. Without them, the death toll would be far higher and the damage to our community would be far greater. They are as frustrated as anybody, by the way, by this epidemic. They want to get to the bottom of it, to be able to focus more on prevention and treatment and recovery. They don't want to keep applying Narcan to the same person again and again.  So I want to thank Father Stec and all of the other religious leaders for being willing to roll up their sleeves and to get involved. If they prevented even one addiction from starting, then they have made a permanent impact on the community. I am convinced that those 500 pastors, ministers, and rabbis have saved lives.  People in Ohio are taking action in other ways too. People are forming groups, particularly parent groups. Those who have lost a child are banding together and talking about how they cannot just console one another and support one another but put in place plans to help others.  I was at a treatment center recently when there were a couple of families there, and they spoke up. They are involved in the center. They come every day. They are there because they lost a son or a daughter to overdose. God bless them for stepping forward.  The Federal Government needs to do more too. We need to take action because we can be a better partner with States, local communities, and families. It is not going to be solved in Washington is not the solution, but it is part of the solution by being a better partner. We can take best practices from around the country as an example, as we did in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which passed this Chamber last year, and spread those around the country so that every community has the opportunity to make a bigger difference.  Last week I met with Governor Chris Christie of New He has a passion for this issue. He is leading the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid I thought it was a very good meeting. Governor Christie is serious about this. I think he is going to be a constructive partner with the Congress and with our President to help turn this tide. I am glad he was selected, and I am glad he has the Commission going.  I will tell you, though, that my message to him was twofold. One, I am glad you are doing this, but, second, let's take action. We don't need another commission to study this problem to know that this is an area where Congress and the administration can work together to take action.  In fact, this agreement that we will vote on in the Senate this afternoon and again tomorrow to fund the government between now and the year's end actually includes a lot of good legislation to help with this crisis. It fully funds the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act I talked about earlier, or This legislation is the first comprehensive reform to Federal addiction policy in 20 years. It treats addiction like a disease, which it is. It focuses on prevention, education, treatment, and recovery and helping our first responders with It is very comprehensive because that is the only way to get at this issue--to do it in a comprehensive way.  The legislation we will vote on today and tomorrow also fully funds the 21st Century Cures Act, which includes more funding that goes directly to the States to deal with opioid addiction.  In the funding bill, we have funded the CARA programs now at over $200 million for this fiscal year. That is more than the bill authorizes, and that is good news because we need it.  It includes $103 million in grants from the Department of Justice for drug courts, veterans courts, and prescription drug monitoring programs. It also includes $114 million for Health and Human Services grants for Medicaid assistance treatment, treatment for pregnant and postpartum women, and for supplying naloxone--again, this miracle drug can actually reverse an overdose--also known as Narcan, and this will help our first responders. It also provides training for them to be able to use it effectively.  It also includes $50 million authorized by CARA for the Department of Veterans Affairs to treat and prevent opioid addiction at the VA, as well as funding CARA's recovery services--the first time any Federal law has ever focused on recovery, not just for treatment but for longer term recovery.  By the way, when there is a good recovery program, the rate of success is dramatically increased--much improved. So it is important that Congress is being a better partner with regard to recovery.  Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services also announced that $26 million will also go out as part of the Cures Act I spoke about to the State of Every State in the Union applied for that money, and States are getting money, and it will be very helpful. I know our Governor and our legislature will put it to good use.  These are important steps. But I will tell my colleagues--and I said this to Governor Christie--that by my count, there are at least six provisions of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act that have not been implemented yet by either the previous administration or this administration. By the way, this is 9 months after CARA was signed into law. Let's get these programs all up and going.  We haven't set up the Pain Management Best Practices Interagency Task Force yet. What does that mean? We need a strategy for figuring out what the best practices are for pain management, for opioid prescribing and alternatives to potentially addictive opioids.  This is really important. Think about it. Four to five heroin addicts started with prescription drugs. Still, when you go to the doctor and you have an injury or an accident, it is not unlikely they will give you some pills--prescription drugs--and they will be addictive.  We have to be sure we do everything we can to come up with nonaddictive forms of medication, right? If we don't do that, we will continue to have the problem. We need to stop overprescribing. We have made some progress, but not enough. When a young man or a young woman goes to get their wisdom teeth taken out, they should not be given opioids. This has happened too many times. I have met two families from Ohio, one whose loved one died from an overdose because as a teenager he went in to get his wisdom teeth taken out and was given a bunch of these pills--60 Percocets in 1 case--and then, because he got physically addicted, he ended up going to heroin as a cheaper and more accessible alternative and ended up overdosing. That shouldn't happen.  So this is an important part. It can be done right now. Let's get this up and going and let's push back on overprescribing. Let's find ways for the pharmaceutical companies to produce medication that actually is not addictive that can help with regard to pain management.  Second, we haven't started the public awareness campaign about the dangers of opioid abuse and the link between these prescription drugs and heroin and other synthetic drugs like fentanyl. Let's do it.  In the legislation we have authorized an amount of money for the Federal Government to do a national awareness campaign that lets people know about this, because most of my constituents don't know about it. When the doctor prescribes those pills, they think that because the doctor prescribed them, it must be the right thing to do. Instead of taking maybe one or two, they are fine with having their kid or their brother or sister or mother or father take the whole dose when they aren't needed, perhaps, because they don't know about the link. They don't know these pills are addictive. Just getting that information out there is going to save lives, and it is an important part of turning the tide. Let's do it. This public awareness campaign can be implemented now.  The Department of Health and Human Services has not yet released information on alternative treatment options for youth sports injuries and about how parents and kids can seek treatment if they become addicted as a result of a prescription. Why wouldn't that make sense? Let's do that. Let's do it now.  I have had, unfortunately, many instances of talking to parents about a[[Page S2698]]kid who was injured in high school through a sports injury and who was prescribed opioids and, again, the parents and the kids didn't have the information to know how dangerous this can be.  There is a guy I worked with a lot on prevention who goes to colleges and high schools and talks about this. He talks about his son He was a football player. He must have been a great kid; I wish I had met him. He had an injury, and, of course, the coach said to play through it, and the doctor said: If you take these pills, you can play through it. He became physically addicted. Again, he later turned to heroin as a less expensive alternative because the pills were too expensive. He overdosed and died. His dad, by the way, is channeling his grief into something really constructive. God bless him.  The FDA has not yet announced its action plan on approving new opioids. The legislation we wrote, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, says the FDA has to seek recommendations from an advisory committee before approving any new opioid, and they have to label any opioid that is going to be used by kids--label it. The FDA is also supposed to issue guidance to educate prescribers on this issue. They have not yet done that. Let's do it. That action plan of approving new opioids is something we can do. We don't need another study or a commission to do it. Let's do it.  The National Institutes of Health hasn't begun CARA's clinical research into alternatives to opioids for treating chronic pain. NIH should do that. Now, they may say after hearing this speech that they are starting to do it. That is great. Let's do it. Let's get that information out there. Let's use the NIH and all the great researchers we have there and the great tools we have there to come up with alternatives that are not addictive.  The Department of Justice has not yet expanded the prescription drug take-back program. As I mentioned, National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day was last This is where you can dispose of your prescription drugs in a safe way. You know it is going to go into a safe receptacle where some trafficker is not going to take the drugs and spread them around our community, which, by the way, has happened. This is a really important program to get these painkillers off of the bathroom shelf. I mentioned the young man who got his grandmother's pain pills, and that is how he started his addiction.  So get them off your shelves. If you are listening today and you haven't taken this action, I urge you to do it. Somebody is going to be at your home, maybe fixing your plumbing, or somebody is helping to clean your home or something else; or kids might be in your home, or maybe some friends of your kids, and those pills are just too darn tempting. The cost of one pill is about $80 on the street. So think about that. Get rid of those pills. Take them to a drugstore where they have a receptacle now or take them to the police department where they have a receptacle. Be involved in these drug take-back programs.  Almost every community in America participated on There were tons of drugs--and I mean tons--that were disposed of. That is a good thing and that is going to save lives, but, again, the Department of Justice can expand that program. Under our legislation, they are authorized to do it. Let's do it. This is something that can be done right now. These are steps that HHS, DOJ, and others can take right now under the authorities already given them. It will make a difference. Again, this crisis is getting worse, not better. To turn the tide, we have to do all these things and more.  I also wish to mention that in addition to these important parts of CARA and other actions the administration can take is that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Ben Carson, can increase access to sober housing for people coming out of treatment. I know Carson well enough to know he has a passion for this issue and he wants to address it. This is one way to address it.  Under the previous Obama administration, sober living facilities lost priority if they had a zero tolerance drug policy. To me, that makes no sense. Carson has the authority to change that and to make it easier for folks who are in recovery to stay clean over the long term. Again, I hope the administration will take that step and these other important steps. Whether it is FDA, whether it is NIH, whether it is DOJ, whether it is HHS, whether it is Housing and Urban Development, we have opportunities without new legislation. This is either already authorized or actions they can take. Let's go ahead and do it. Let's do everything we can.  None of these individually is a silver bullet. There is no silver bullet. This issue is ultimately going to be decided in our communities, in our families, and in our hearts. We all have to get involved. All these will help. All these will help to ensure that we are responding to a true crisis in our community. If we do all these things, I believe next year can be better. This year is going to be worse. All the data shows that the number of overdoses and deaths--in my State of Ohio, in your State--are increasing this year compared to the last year.  It doesn't have to be this way. All these actions taken together on prevention and education, better treatment, longer term recovery, sober housing, ensuring that we are moving away from overprescribing and providing alternatives to addictive pain medication, ensuring that we do provide our first responders with the training they need on Narcan and naloxone, to get people who are overdosing and save their lives and then get them into treatment--not just save their lives but get them into treatment. All of that together will make a difference.  I believe we can turn the tide. I believe we can save lives. I believe we cannot just save lives of those who otherwise may overdose and die as a result of their overdose, but we can help all those who are addicted--the hundreds of thousands of people in Ohio, the millions of people across our country--to be able to achieve their dreams by getting them into treatment programs.  There is good news here because there are so many examples of people who have gone into treatment and longer term recovery and turned their lives around, many of whom are now helping others to do the same, many of whom are back at work, back with their families, back being the kind of citizens who contribute to our society in so many ways. That is the hope, and that is what can happen if we work together to implement this legislation, to do everything possible to have this broad, comprehensive approach to turn the tide.

We work together closely. Both of us having been Governors, we understand how important small businesses are to our States--in fact, to all the  With that, I would like to take a few minutes, with the concurrence of the ranking member, to honor America's small businesses and their owners and the impact they have on our economy and our communities and the vital role small businesses play in America today.  America's small businesses are truly the engine that keeps our economy running. They create two out of every three jobs in Let me say that again. Small businesses create two out of every three new jobs that are created in America today. Our Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship knows that Congress has a responsibility to help this engine roar by getting the government out of the way of our Nation's small businesses and thus providing small businesses with the opportunity to do what they have done to make this the greatest country in the world for the last 240 years.  We know that small businesses are vital to our economy, employing nearly half the American workforce and making up 99.7 percent of all employers in this country. It is because small businesses are so important to our economy that Washington needs to do all we can for businesses to start and, more importantly, to survive and grow.  We have seen a steady and well-documented decline in startups and a persistently low GDP over the past decade. Despite this, small businesses' optimism has hit record-high levels in recent months. Small business owners are more confident than ever. National Small Business Week--this week--is a fitting time to not only celebrate our Nation's small businesses but also to assure them that greater relief is coming.  Congress and the new administration are working hand in hand to undo the regulatory burden that has been hampering small business growth. It is no secret that the excessive regulatory burdens our Nation's entrepreneurs face places them at a disadvantage. We hear this every day from our position on the Small Business When asked what the biggest challenge they face is, it is almost always the regulatory burdens they are operating under.  America's small business owners want to comply with a reasonable and appropriate regulatory structure; however, the time and money they spend complying with layers of regulations from a myriad of agencies hampers their ability to focus on what truly matters, and that, of course, is running their business.  My Senate colleagues and I will continue to work with the administration on rolling back regulations that don't make sense. We will take a closer look at other issues facing the diverse small business community. Just last week, Senator Shaheen and I held a hearing on the many challenges that exist for rural entrepreneurs. As it turns out, these challenges are not much different from those that exist for entrepreneurs in more populous areas, except the challenges are amplified for business owners who operate without broadband internet or a traditional storefront on Main  The shared challenges amongst most entrepreneurs, such as access to capital, trade opportunities, and cyber security threats, among others, are at the forefront of the minds of those of us in Congress who are committed to delivering the relief small business owners have been waiting for.  Despite these challenges, America's 28 million small business owners and their employees set out every day to pursue their dreams and contribute to their communities. Their entrepreneurial spirit is nothing short of inspiring.  I want to give an example from Idaho--in fact, more than one example from Idaho--but I yield to Senator Shaheen at this moment for her comments and perhaps to tell us a little bit about what she took away from the meeting we recently had on rural small businesses.

3297,topic-id,492,"Mr.President, I thank Senator  We do, and I want to tell a story of an example of the inspiring spirit small businesses bring to us. This is the story of a small family business in Idaho Falls, ID, called Fin It began when its founder, Karen Browning, was asked to make a mermaid costume for her granddaughter. That doesn't sound like a very ostentatious beginning, but it was the beginning. This simple request was the catalyst of a much larger operation that experienced over a 3,000-percent growth over a 3-year period, now employing 75 full- and part-time employees in Eastern The Browning family contributes greatly to the community and makes all of us in Idaho proud with their continued success, having been named by the SBA as Idaho's Small Business of the Year.[[Page S2709]]  Stories like Fin Fun underscore the optimism that can be found in all corners of our country as small business owners everywhere take the large leap into the American dream.  I ask all Senators to join me this week in supporting and thanking the small businesses in our home States all across Senator Shaheen and I, of course, as part of the jurisdiction of our committee, have oversight responsibilities with the I have been very impressed over the years as to the focus of the SBA on small businesses.  One of the things I think Senator Shaheen shares with me is supporting an increase in the Office of We all know the Federal Government passes regulations at a stunning rate, which most people really don't completely understand. But the job of the Office of Advocacy is to act as an independent voice for small businesses when the Federal Government actually proposes a regulation. The Office of Advocacy is supposed to stand up and say: Wait a minute. Let me tell you how this is going to affect small businesses.  We all know that if the Federal Government, in any one of the agencies, enacts a regulation, it does affect businesses of different sizes differently. Indeed, if it is a large business, they generally have an army of lawyers, compliance officers, and accountants who can deal with the regulations relatively easily and absorb the cost. On the other hand, if it is a one-, two-, or three-person business, just filling out the forms the agencies require is sometimes a real burden. It is important that this Office of Advocacy in the SBA be encouraged, be expanded where possible, and be a real, true independent voice for small business in And I know Senator Shaheen shares my enthusiasm for continuing to support that enterprise within the I am always happy to work with any of my colleagues to make it easier for Americans to start and grow a business.

3325,topic-id,1710,"Mr.President, first let me thank my friend from Illinois for his always thoughtful and good words. I agree with his sentiments on Mr.Rosenstein, whom I will support as well.                        GOVERNMENT SPENDING BILL  Mr.President, first I want to say that it is very good news that the President seems to be taking the wall off the table in the negotiations we are having on an appropriations bill this week. It would remove the prospect of a needless fight over a poison pill proposal that Members of both parties don't support. On a bill as important as one to keep the government open, it is a dangerous prospect for the administration to push so hard for such a flawed, incomplete, and unthought-out proposal on a must-pass spending bill. It could tank what would have been productive, bipartisan, bicameral negotiations between the leaders in both If the threat of the wall is removed, as I hope is the case, our negotiations can continue and we can hopefully continue to resolve all of the outstanding issues by  Make no mistake about it, there are other important issues to resolve--no poison pill riders, above all, and the ratio of defense and nondefense spending in terms of increases above the baseline. On the nondefense side, miners are very important on our side, getting permanent healthcare for these miners who have struggled their whole lives; the issue of cost-sharing, where 6 million people could lose their healthcare because it would become unaffordable; and the issue of Puerto Rico, which is struggling so, are among those that we feel are important as well. There are other issues to resolve as well, but I am hopeful we can address them as the week moves forward. Poison pill riders are something that could really hurt the bill, and we don't want that to happen.                 The President's First One Hundred Days  Mr.President, on another matter, as we quickly approach the 100-day mark of the Trump Presidency, it is a good time to look back on what this administration has accomplished and has not accomplished. One thing is clear: This President has either broken or failed to fulfill many of the promises he made to working families during the campaign. This morning, I wish to focus on one area in particular--this President's promises to working people on jobs and the economy.  One of the President's key rationales as to why he would be an effective President was that he was a good businessman who could create jobs and get the economy moving much faster than anyone predicted. But on the major issues of jobs, including outsourcing, ``Buy American,'' trade--key economic issues that help job growth in America, that help working families--President Trump has made scant progress during his first 100 days and has broken several core campaign promises he made to kick-start the economy for working families.  On jobs, President Trump said he was going to be ``the greatest job President that God ever created,'' but have we seen one significant piece of legislation that would create jobs from this President? What about infrastructure, for instance? That is something that would create tons of good-paying jobs, and Candidate Trump talked about it a lot when he campaigned. He promised to fix America's crumbling infrastructure, pledging a $1 trillion plan to do[[Page S2502]]it. But we haven't seen any details of any plan yet, and no comprehensive plan to rebuild our infrastructure has been introduced by any Republicans in  So we Democrats came out with our own $1 trillion infrastructure plan, taking what the President said in his campaign. The bill would create 15 million good-paying jobs, going to the working families of We haven't seen any proposal or gotten any response to our proposal from the The only thing we have seen from President Trump on infrastructure is that he has proposed multibillion-dollar cuts to vital transportation programs in his 2018 budget, saying one thing in the campaign--infrastructure jobs--yet doing exactly the opposite--cutting infrastructure jobs--in his proposed budget for next year.  On outsourcing, Candidate Trump lamented the fact that so many companies were shipping U.jobs overseas, promising: ``We're going to stop it day one. It's so easy to stop.''  While President Obama used regulatory measures to stop inversions in their tracks--a company in New York, Pfizer, which I thought was so wrong to try and invert--President Trump has just signed an Executive order to review those rules and potentially undo them--the exact opposite of what he campaigned on. This is astounding. He said he was going to prevent jobs from going overseas. President Obama put in regulations that have virtually stopped inversions--companies moving their headquarters overseas for tax breaks. President Trump, directly in contradiction of what he talked about over and over and over again in his campaign, says: Now let's review those rules and possibly undo them. It is just hard to comprehend.  President Trump said his policy would be ``Buy American and Hire American,'' and he has had a bunch of little rallies where he talks about this, but he has refused to insist that pipelines and water infrastructure be made with American steel.  If he were serious about stopping outsourcing, he would demand that Senate Republicans put Senator Baldwin's bill requiring infrastructure to be made with American steel on the Senate floor. If we increase water and sewer as one of our biggest infrastructure proposals, American steel would get a huge boost, if companies had to buy American steel. Senator Baldwin has a bill that does it. President Trump has not gotten any action. He ought to tell Leader McConnell, tell Speaker Ryan he is for that bill, and they should bring it to the floor, and, with a lot of Democratic votes--probably every one, just about--we can pass it.  On trade, which is another crucial issue for the American worker--maybe the issue that President Trump garnered the most support for from working families--well, he has made some big promises, but he has either broken them or failed to deliver in his first 100 days. He pledged to hold China accountable for its rapacious trade practices, which have robbed America of millions of jobs and cost trillions of dollars of wealth. He said China was ``world champion'' of currency manipulation and pledged to name it a currency manipulator on day one. President Trump has done neither of those things. He has broken his promise to name them a currency manipulator, and he has backed off on his promise to get tough with trade on China in general.  This is an issue I am passionate about. I didn't agree with President Trump on a whole lot of issues, but when he talked about China during the campaign, I said: I am closer to President Trump on how we treat China than I was with President Obama or President Bush, and I thought it would be one of the areas where we could make real progress. Instead, we have seen a U-turn--China, not a currency manipulator, when he said over and over again they were, and they are manipulating their currency.  I know all the free-trade pundits get up and say: Yes, but now they are not reducing the value of their currency; they are doing the opposite of what they did when they made it easier for them to export. But they are still manipulating it. It still doesn't flow. As sure as we are sitting here, if China's advantage is to once again devalue the currency so they can have more exports and unfair advantages over American workers, they will do it in a minute.  Furthermore, had he called China a currency manipulator, it would have sent a shot across China's bow. For years, frankly, under Democratic and Republican administrations, China has gotten away with economic murder. They steal our intellectual property. They don't let good American companies into They buy American companies to get their technology and then produce it in China and try to export it here. They have over the years manipulated the currency to their advantage, among many other things. They are hurting us. Probably nothing has done more to hurt American jobs than China's rapacious trade policies. And President Trump is nowhere to be found. In fact, he is doing the opposite of what he promised on trade.  Instead of sticking up for hard-working, middle-class Americans by trying to create jobs and get tough on both trade and outsourcing, President Trump has spent the last few months looking out for powerful corporations and the special interests he repeatedly campaigned against, breaking promise after promise to working families. It is a shame he has taken this route.  On issues like infrastructure, outsourcing, and trade, we Democrats agree with many of the things Candidate Trump was saying, but he is nowhere to be found to work with on these issues. President Trump could have chosen to spend his first 100 days working with us Democrats on these issues, finding compromises and consensus to fulfill his promises to working Instead, he spent the first 100 days governing from the very hard right, refusing to seek Democratic input on any major legislation. That is not how you get things done here, and that is why the President has so little to show for his first 100 days.  We Democrats are prepared to work with him to give the middle class and those struggling to get there a much needed boost, but the President and Republicans in Congress need to start reaching out and meeting us halfway.  As I have told the President many times, if he governs from the middle, if he is willing to work with both parties to get things done, we might be able to compromise on some of the important economic issues where we have had these values for a long time--the ones I just mentioned. If the President, Republicans, and Congress continue their ``my way or the highway approach,'' the next 100 days will be just like the first--a lot of broken and unfulfilled promises and very few accomplishments from this new administration.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

3284,topic-id,997,"Mr.President, I came to the floor this afternoon to speak to the CRA legislation before us that would overturn the Department of Labor rule designed to help Americans save for retirement, but before I speak to that, I just want to join all of my colleagues on the floor in applauding what has happened to support the miners and to get them health benefits and to thank my colleague Joe Manchin for his leadership.  I know how personally he has fought for this, as so many people who spoke on the floor have. You know, we don't have any coal miners in New Hampshire, Joe, but we have hard workers. We have people who understand that when you make a promise to them, you need to keep that promise. Thank you for leading this fight and to everyone who made this happen because we need to reassure Americans that when we say we are going to do something, we actually follow through and we do that. So thank you for making that happen.  Now, Mr.President, it is disappointing that actually on the issue that is before the Senate right now, this effort to change the labor rule on retirement, that we are actually going to take something away from States across America have been developing and implementing innovative, low-cost retirement savings options to improve their citizens' retirement security.  That is really important at a time when we have so many people who have not been able to save for retirement, who are worried about what might happen if something happens to them and they can't work into the retirement age. Sadly, the misguided legislation that is before us would shut down these efforts and effectively take away from States the right to establish retirement options for workers.  Now, across the country we have had Republican and Democratic State treasurers join with groups, including the AARP and the Small Business Majority, to oppose this effort. I want to join them in asking two what I think are obvious questions.  First, why do the sponsors of this resolution want to deny Americans new, attractive retirement savings options?  Second, why in the world are they doing this at a time when the United States faces a growing retirement savings crisis--a crisis that threatens to strand millions of seniors without any personal savings and at risk of falling into poverty? And why do this when it doesn't include any mandates and there is no cost to taxpayers either at the Federal level or, in most States, at the State level? This is something that is paid for by people who are looking to get a pension.  Facts matter, and we shouldn't ignore them. Some 55 million Americans lack access to a workplace retirement plan, and 45 percent of households don't have any retirement account assets--zero savings. Polls show that more than three-quarters of private sector workers fear not having enough money to live comfortably in retirement.  To address this nationwide crisis, many States have stepped up to the plate, experimenting with public-private partnerships to help small businesses provide low-cost, turn-key payroll deduction options. The legislation being debated today would abruptly compromise the future of these State initiatives.  In my State of New Hampshire, nearly 99 percent of our employers are considered small businesses. That number is hard to believe. They employ over 50 percent of New Hampshire's workers.[[Page S2704]]Nearly 43 percent of Granite Staters work for an employer that does not offer a retirement plan.  As the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, I talk to small business owners regularly, and as a former small business owner myself, I understand the challenges they face. For many, it is a challenge just to meet payroll and to keep the doors of their businesses open. I know that many of them would like to offer a company retirement plan because they want to do right by their employees, but they just can't afford it.  A Pew Foundation survey found that three-quarters of owners of small and medium-sized businesses across the country support the idea of these State-run options because they offer a way for employees to save for retirement at little or no cost to the employer.  So these programs are sort of like starter plans for small businesses. A company that is still trying to gain its financial footing can offer this option to its employees. Then, once the company gets on more solid ground and it needs to attract and retain talent, it can transition to a more ambitious retirement plan that allows it to contribute to its employees' retirement savings.  It is especially troubling to me that the Senate is even considering whether to deny Americans this retirement option at the same time that we are seeing leaders on the House side trying to pass a healthcare bill that would make it more expensive for many preretirement seniors and for people with preexisting conditions to purchase health coverage.  Again, I would ask: Why would we want to deny this new, innovative retirement option to millions of employees who work for small businesses without retirement plans? Why would we want to deny small businesses the choice of offering these options? Why should the Federal Government stand in the way of States and small businesses that want to take positive steps to address the retirement crisis and help their citizens?  I think this legislation is misguided. It is legislation in search of a problem, and, worse than that, it would put a massive roadblock in the way of States and small businesses that are striving to solve the real and growing problem of inadequate retirement savings.  So I urge my colleagues to really take a look at what would happen in their home I urge them to stand up for America's small businesses, to vote no on this legislation. Let's ensure that Americans have more, not fewer, options to save for retirement.  I yield the floor.

3296,topic-id,416,"Mr.President, I thank Senator  As you point out, we were both Governors, so we had a chance to see small businesses from the perspective of the States and how States can be involved in supporting small businesses. But we also have been small business owners and operators ourselves. My husband and I had a family-owned seasonal retail business, and you operated a family-run ranch in So I am sure you share with me the challenges of small business owners, the things that kept me awake at night and that I know keep other small business owners awake: meeting payroll, balancing budgets, attracting workers, finding customers, and complying with local, State, and Federal regulations.  As you pointed out, and I certainly agree, our committee works in a bipartisan way not only on supporting public policy to help small businesses but also supporting the Small Business Administration, which has programs that help nurture our small businesses and address their unique concerns.  On Monday, I visited one of those small businesses. I was kicking off Small Business Week in New Hampshire, and I visited a company in Dover, which is a neighboring community to where I live. The company is called Popzup, spelled just like it sounds. It is a family-owned business that created an innovative microwave popcorn box without harsh chemicals, plastic, or silicon. The company's popcorn that goes in that box is environmentally friendly. It comes from American farms that don't use GMO products. It is great. They also have all of these seasonings that go on the popcorn, everything from a seasoning called Everything Bagel to one that is maple syrup. So it is a unique company.  Its founders, Julie and Marty Lapham, launched the company in 2015. They have received a lot of support from the Small Business Development Center in New In fact, Julie told me about preparing for a ``Shark Tank''-style competition she was participating in and how she got tremendous help from the SBDC in her presentation. She said: Without that help, I wouldn't have been able to do it. She actually won first prize in the competition--$10,000--because the SBDC had helped her sort through financing options, and she and her husband continue to work with them as they grow the company.

Our New Hampshire Small Business Person of the Year is Jake Reder, who is the cofounder and CEO of Celdara Medical in Lebanon,  I think it is important to point out that small businesses create 16 times per employee the number of patents that large businesses do, and Celdara Medical is a great example of that. They were founded in 2008. They are a biotech startup that identifies early-stage medical technologies and provides financing and business guidance to move lifesaving products from university laboratories to high-potential medical companies. They really show that entrepreneurship can be a positive force to cure disease and save lives.  During their startup, Celdara secured funding through the SBA's SBIR Program, the Small Business Innovation Research Program, which was extended last year--thanks in large part to the work of the committee--for 5 years because of its great track record, enabling entrepreneurs across the country to participate in R&D to keep us at the vanguard of innovation.

3416,topic-id,1176,"Mr.President, I just want to take a moment because we have all been so focused, and there has been so much concern about what is going to happen in terms of healthcare in this country. So many people have called me concerned about whether they are going to be able to continue their cancer treatments or whether their child is going to be able to get the operation they need or whether their mom with Alzheimer's is going to be able to continue to get nursing home care and so on, and I thank everyone who has told their story.  We have spent 6 months. This debate, this fight, isn't over yet, but it started the day after we were all sworn in, in this Chamber, in January, on January 4. A process was set up intentionally to be a partisan process that took just 51 votes, and instead of the regular committee process and working together, a path was initiated. Great concern went out across the country about what would be happening in terms of healthcare.  People have spoken up. They have written letters, emails, and made phone calls, and marched and told their stories. Today, at least for a moment, this Senate will not proceed this week because there are not the votes to proceed to what I believe is a complete unraveling of our healthcare system. That may come. Certainly, I don't underestimate people's abilities to make deals and to create a way to have this happen when we get back from the Fourth of July, but at least, in the short run, I want to thank everybody who has been involved and spoken out about this critically important issue.  There are lots of things that have been said on this floor and have been said publicly about the healthcare system. We do have a situation of people buying insurance on the private exchanges where there is a combination of things that have been done to create the situation where people are paying more, but there are also situations where there are problems and not enough competition and areas where people are paying too much, and we need to address that.  One of the biggest cost drivers is the cost of prescription drugs, and we desperately need to address that. I hope, when we come back after this next week, the Fourth of July, that we will have a conversation about the real problems we need to address, to build on healthcare, not take away medical care from tens of millions of people but to build on successes and tackle the things that aren't working.  I am very concerned about small businesses. I have introduced a bill[[Page S3784]]that would give a 50-percent tax credit for small businesses with 50 or fewer employees to help them cover the cost of their employees. We know most people who don't have insurance work for a small business or work for themselves as a single employer. Let's help them.  There are things I know we could work on together across the aisle that would lower costs and tackle the real problems.  This is what I also know; that is, when people talk to me about lowering cost and addressing healthcare, they are not talking about another tax cut for multimillionaires or billionaires. That is actually not on their list of healthcare reforms. It is in the bill that is in front of us, but it is not on the list when someone says to me: You know, I want to bring down out-of-pocket costs so I can afford insurance for my kids and, by the way, would you give another tax cut to multibillionaires. That is not on the list.  If we could come together and take the two things off the table, tax cuts funded by the second thing, which is cutting medical care for seniors, families, and children on Medicaid--if we could take that off the table and focus on the real cost drivers, the real problems that need to be addressed so that healthcare is more affordable, then we would see enthusiasm on our side of the aisle and probably both sides of the aisle. I know we can come together; the Presiding Officer and I have worked together many, many times on issues. We can do this again, but we have a situation where somehow tax cuts get involved in every debate. Secondly, addressing Medicaid, which is actually saving money for taxpayers, States, and families, is part of this in a way that makes no sense.  I have said it before, but just to illustrate it one more time, our Governor and State legislature expanded Medicaid to working families, people making minimum wage, and what has happened as a result of that? Well, 97 percent of the children in Michigan can go to a doctor. What does that mean? That means they cut in half the number of people walking into the emergency room who don't have insurance and can't pay. Uncompensated care is down by 50 percent, and guess what happens. Magically, the State of Michigan is saving money. There is $432 million more in the budget--taxpayers' money--and that savings can be used for something else important in the State, other than paying for people who don't have insurance, can't see a doctor, and have to use the emergency room.  For me, this debate gets all smooshed together with all kinds of things that aren't connected to each other. The truth is that Medicaid is saving money. More people can go to the doctor and get preventive care. Fewer people are walking into the emergency room, which is the most expensive way to get healthcare. This is working. For seniors, three out of five seniors in Michigan in nursing homes are there because of Medicaid healthcare.  I am not interested in cutting healthcare for seniors, children, and working families. I am not interested in a tax cut that is going to give the top 400 people in the United States a combined $33 billion in tax cuts. But if we want to focus on small businesses, folks who are individually buying insurance and either can't find insurance or it is too high, count me in. Count me in. That needs to get fixed, and that involves making sure that the administration does not continue with actions that are raising people's costs on purpose. We need to fix the things in the system that aren't working.  I hope that for the rest of this week, next week, and beyond, we can have some real conversations about working together to solve the real problems that deal with costs, prescription drug costs, out-of-pocket costs for people, and we can do that in a bipartisan way if we are focusing on the real problems in healthcare and how we make healthcare stronger, better, and more affordable for American families.

The last few months have been filled with an awful lot of uncertainty about whether the promise of healthcare for miners, retirees, widows, and others would be kept. As a matter of fact, earlier this year, 22,000 coal miners or their dependents received notices that their healthcare benefits would be terminated at the end of  After months of uncertainty and fighting, we stand ready later this week to pass a bill that would make sure America kept its promise.

This didn't come easily. If nothing else, this shows again the power of persistence. Joe first raised this issue in July of 2015, when he introduced the Miners Protection Since then, he has brought it up--I ask my colleagues to contradict me if it is not the case--in every public meeting or private meeting. Whenever there were more than two or three Senators engaged in any topic, Joe would come bursting in and say: We have to take care of the miners.

3300,topic-id,1011,"Mr.President, we have a retirement crisis in this country. Today, among working families on the verge of retirement, about a third have no retirement savings of any kind and another third have total savings that are less than one year's annual income.  Let's be blunt. Social Security alone is not enough for a secure retirement. Hitting retirement with little or no savings means spending those last years hovering around the poverty line, with little or no money for important purchases, like dental care or hearing aids, or extras, like buying a birthday gift for a grandchild.  There are a lot of different reasons people hit retirement with no savings, but one big reason is that 55 million Americans don't have the ability to save for retirement through a workplace retirement account. For years, the Republican-controlled Congress has done nothing to help the 55 million Americans who don't have an employer-provided retirement plan to save for their retirement--nothing--so seven States have actually stepped up. They passed legislation to provide retirement accounts to their constituents, and 23 more States are currently considering proposals like this. Massachusetts has stepped up, too, passing legislation to allow workers in small, nonprofit organizations to save for retirement in a State-administered plan.  These State efforts are a big deal. The actions of just those first seven States could expand coverage to 15 million Americans who don't currently have an employer-sponsored retirement account. These efforts would go a long way toward starting to chip away at the retirement crisis in our country, and both Republicans and Democrats should be applauding the efforts of the Governors, State treasurers, and State legislatures who are doing this important work. But instead of passing legislation to incentivize States to continue their innovative work or instead of bringing up a bill on their own encouraging companies to offer retirement accounts to their workers, Republicans are voting on a bill that would pull the rug out from underneath these State plans, jeopardizing all of the States' recent progress.  Republicans are constantly saying they are the party of federalism, deregulation, and State flexibility. Over and over again for the past several months, my colleagues across the aisle have come down to the floor to overturn regulation after regulation because they claim those regulations ``limit the role of State and local governments.'' So why on Earth are they now passing a bill to run roughshod over the States?  The States certainly aren't asking them to take it up. The National Conference of State Legislatures--the bipartisan organization representing the legislatures of all 50 States--sent a letter urging Congress not to pass this bill because ``it will result in an unwarranted preemption of state innovation, will restrict the ability of millions of hardworking Americans to save for retirement, and will prove costly to federal and state budgets.'' And 23 State treasurers and top budget officials, both Democrats and Republicans, from Idaho to Mississippi, wrote urging Republican leadership to ``protect the rights of states and large municipalities to implement their own, unique approaches . . . to address this growing retirement savings crisis.''  No, the State legislatures didn't ask the Republican Congress for this bill, and the American people are certainly not calling their Senators asking that they overturn the rules to help them save for their retirement either. Seventy-two percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats support the work the States are doing.[[Page S2710]]  If it is not the State legislatures and it is not the State regulators and it is not the American people who want this bill passed, why are Republicans pushing it forward? Why are we voting for this legislation?  Four words--national chamber of commerce. The national chamber of commerce has been fighting tooth and nail to kill these retirement initiatives. Their armies of lobbyists are swarming over Capitol They are peddling misinformation about what these plans do, all because the giant financial firms that pump money into the national chamber of commerce are worried that the State plans will offer better investment products with lower fees for customers.  Yes, the giant financial firms are right to be worried. States probably will not award investment contracts to the companies with the highest fees or to the companies offering kickbacks and prizes to make the sale. They are going to award contracts to companies that can provide the best product at the lowest cost. That is how a competitive bidding process works.  The financial firms hiding behind the chamber of commerce don't want competitive bidding, they don't want transparency, they don't want to fight on a level playing field, and they are willing to spend a whole lot of money to make sure they don't have to. In fact, the Chamber is so serious about keeping the system rigged that they have sent letter after letter to every Member of Congress and their staff, letting them know they are watching this vote.  Just in case you can't read between the lines, for extra emphasis, in bold and underlined typeface, their letters warned that they will be ``consider[ing] . . . votes on, or in relation to, [this] resolution[] in our annual How They Voted scorecard.'' The chamber of commerce is going to score who votes to help the big financial corporations and who doesn't, and they are going to make sure that all those potential campaign contributors know about the vote.  This is what gives Washington such a terrible reputation. The American people didn't send us here to work for giant financial institutions and their armies of lobbyists and lawyers. I don't care what kind of threats the chamber of commerce puts out; it is wrong to pass a law to kick people in the teeth when they are trying to save for their retirements. The lobbyists may be watching this vote, but the American people are watching, too, and they are ready to fight back.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

3275,topic-id,1126,"Madam President, for the second time in an administration that has just crossed the 100-day threshold, Republicans in the Congress have teed up legislation that is going to make it harder for working Americans to save. This time, there is a proposal in front of us that goes after a brandnew program that my home State of Oregon is just now getting ready to launch.  Let me make my views on this proposal clear, quickly. This legislation puts the special interests before working people, and it is just that simple.  We all understand there is a savings crisis in the country. The typical American who works hard and brings home a paycheck every week or two is struggling to get money set aside for their retirement.  Just think of the economic challenges these families are up against every day. Millions of young people are buried under student debt, so the prospect of saving for retirement feels like a dream and will remain so for years and years.  Parents raising kids are faced with steep home loans and everyday bills. At the same time, it can seem as if the sticker price of a 4-year college education can match the GDP of a small island nation.  The numbers on the savings crisis are just alarming. More than half of workers approaching retirement have nothing. That means zero set aside in retirement accounts like IRAs or 401(k) plans. Tens of millions of Americans do not have access to retirement plans at work. In my view, addressing these kinds of challenges ought to be a bipartisan priority, a priority where both sides of the aisle get together and respond.  In response to this crisis, my home State, along with a few others, has looked to find a fresh approach to deal with retirement savings. We want working people and middle-income families--particularly those who don't have access to a savings plan today--to have more opportunities in the future to set money aside.  My home State found a way to do it. Oregon found a way to do it in a kind of Oregon tradition that eliminates a lot of hassle. We are one of a handful of States that has passed what is called an auto-IRA law. At home, we call it OregonSaves, and we are going to be launching it in just a few months. What it means for Oregon workers is that when you get a job, you are going to get a retirement account, so that is not really complicated. When you get a job in Oregon, you are going to get a retirement account. You can start setting aside a little bit with every paycheck.  By the way--and I want to emphasize this--it is not mandatory. People have the right to opt out. So when people say: Oh, government is going to force people to do this and that and something else, the Oregon plan is just the opposite. It is voluntary in all particulars.  What it means for business owners--particularly small business owners--is that they can offer a savings plan without crippling fees or the hassle of dealing with redtape.  OregonSaves, what we are about to bring out of the starting gate, is simple. It is easy to understand. In my view, it is exactly the kind of innovative program we need to combat the savings crisis that has hit all parts of the country.  Over the years, I have often heard Members come to the floor and glowingly describe the States as the place[[Page S2696]]where the action is. They call them the laboratories of democracy. The theory, of course, is that States ought to be empowered to come up with new ways to tackle challenges.  I have to tell you, it is a head-scratcher why the majority here in the Senate would want to make it harder for innovative States like Oregon to put in place a savings program that is voluntary in nature.  So after all these speeches I hear about the States and States' rights and that the States are the laboratories of democracy, when it comes to a program that is voluntary in nature, the majority here still seems to think what we ought to do is say no.  I know the Presiding Officer cares deeply about how policies relate to rural areas. This is going to be especially hard on rural parts of the country.  I talked first about this issue during a debate a few weeks ago. Several employers had written my office to say how important OregonSaves would be for them. I shared a handful of those stories on the floor, and it was striking how many of those employers said that this would be a sea change for rural businesses in terms of recruiting workers. Thanks to OregonSaves, they would be able to compete when it comes to job benefits. The bill we are considering now would put in doubt that program that employers said could make a big difference, particularly in rural areas.  OregonSaves and programs like this involve years of discussion, years of effort to work with the Department of There has been a lot of consultation between the Federal Government and the States to get the legal roadblocks out of the way. Now that work is in danger with this vote.  So, colleagues, what I would like to do in wrapping up is to just step back for a minute and talk about what this body has been working on.  Even though the majority party has unified control of the government, we are not exactly at this point churning out bill after bill--certainly not landmark legislation that responds to the challenges facing American families. Mostly to this point, there have been votes on nominations and bills tossing out a bunch of Federal rules that protect the people who have no power or clout in  An awfully large share of the business of this Congress comes down to taking steps like the one we are looking at today, making it harder for the American people to save. I don't think this is just a step in the wrong direction; this is a sprint in the wrong direction. That is what we are dealing with today in the  Programs like OregonSaves are a commonsense response to a national savings crisis. The Congress should not be passing legislation threatening those programs, making the savings crisis even worse in communities across the land.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided between both sides.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.  The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
