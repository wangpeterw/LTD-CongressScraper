                       DEFEAT THE TAX REFORM PLAN

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, the tax plan that has been proposed 
by the House Republican leadership fails to support working families 
while making them foot a $1.5 trillion bill.
  Nonpartisan research projects that this legislation would raise taxes 
on 38 million hardworking Americans. The impact would be far and wide 
as the tax plan would end deductions for seniors facing growing medical 
expenses, young adults working to shrink their student debt, and 
families paying State income and sales taxes.
  This legislation would also have enormously damaging economic 
consequences as it would leave our children to pay off its $1.5 
trillion price tag. We need tax reform that puts working families 
first, but this clearly isn't it.
  For the sake of our economy, seniors, students, and working families, 
as well as the middle class, we must defeat this bill.
