                      TRIBUTE TO CHARLES VANPATTEN

 Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Charles for his hard work as 
an intern in my Cheyenne office. I recognize his efforts and 
contributions to my office, as well as to the State of Wyoming.
  Charles is a native of Gillette, WY. He is a graduate of the 
University of Wyoming, where he studied history. He has demonstrated a 
strong work ethic, which has made him an invaluable asset to our 
office. The quality of his work is reflected in his great efforts over 
the last several months.
  I want to thank Charles for the dedication he has shown while working 
for me and my staff. It is a pleasure to have him as part of our team. 
I know he will have continued success with all of his future endeavors. 
I wish him all my best on his journey.
