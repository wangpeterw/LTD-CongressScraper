                                 PRAYER

  Pastor Chris Bell, 3 Circle Church, Fairhope, Alabama, offered the 
following prayer:
  Our Lord and Father, I come to You today in this place of government 
of the Nation that I love to ask for Your hand of blessing and guiding 
wisdom upon the leadership of these United States of America.
  We know that all good gifts come from Your hand, and this beautiful 
and free Nation in which we live is one of those gifts.
  We thank You today for the many ways that You have blessed us, from 
our bountiful natural resources to our freedom to work and to speak and 
to worship.
  And it is because of these blessings that You have also given us a 
great responsibility to our world to live and to lead by example.
  So, by Your grace today, I humbly ask that You would help these 
leaders of our Nation and our citizens to be a continued light in the 
darkness.
  We confess now our need for Your help and Your guidance. Please place 
Your mighty hand on us today, for You have told us in Your Word to 
trust not in our own understanding, but to trust You and acknowledge 
You in all of our ways and You would make our path straight. May we do 
this today and in the future.
  It is in the name of our Lord, Jesus, I pray.
  Amen.
