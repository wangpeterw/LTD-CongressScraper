     shall--
       (1) not, in the case of a covered investment fund with a 
     class of securities in substantially continuous distribution, 
     condition the safe harbor on whether the broker's or dealer's

     research report constitutes such broker's or dealer's 
     initiation or reinitiation of research coverage on such 
     covered investment fund or its securities;

     Regulations;
       (3) provide that a self-regulatory organization may not 
     maintain or enforce any rule that would--
       (A) prohibit the ability of a member to publish or

     because the member is also participating in a registered 
     offering or other distribution of any securities of such 
     covered investment fund; or
       (B) prohibit the ability of a member to participate in a 
     registered offering or other distribution of securities of a
