               BASIC AMERICAN VALUES IN WESTERN NEW YORK

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of so many 
western New Yorkers and Americans who are outraged by the President's 
executive order on immigration.
  The story of America is defined by the struggle of immigrants 
overcoming

incredible odds to claim their piece of the American Dream. The 
executive order on immigration is callous, unlawful, and 
unconstitutional. An immigration ban on anyone that is based on 
religion or country of origin is in conflict with basic American values 
and who we are as a people.
  Inspired by the work of the International Institute, Catholic 
Charities, Jericho Road, Jewish Family Services, and so many more, my 
western New York community continues to be welcoming to refugees and 
immigrants from all over the world, including from those countries that 
are directly affected by this order. I know my community will continue 
to lead by example and proudly project American values.
