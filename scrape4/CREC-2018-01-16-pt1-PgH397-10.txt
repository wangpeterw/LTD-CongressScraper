                         RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DAY

  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate 25 years of observing 
Religious Freedom Day.
  On this day, more than 200 years ago, our forefathers in the Virginia 
General Assembly sought to practice their respective religions freely, 
so they passed a State law which secured our ability to exercise our 
faith freely today. The context of this initial law formed the 
inspiration for the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
  Our country holds among its most fundamental freedoms the right to 
practice freely one's religion and associate with others who share 
those same beliefs.
  As we know from experience, freedom is not without cost and it is not 
free. It must be protected and nourished, and our communities of faith, 
in particular, need to be safeguarded from government encroachment and 
intrusion.
  It is with this in mind, Mr. Speaker, that I will continue to work 
with my colleagues to defend our First Amendment and our communities of 
faith on Religious Freedom Day and every day.
