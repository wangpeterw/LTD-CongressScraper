                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT

  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report for April 2017. The report compares current-law 
levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to 
in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, S.Con.Res. 3. This 
information is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine 
whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. The 
Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional 
Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of 
the Congressional Budget Act, CBA.
  My last filing can be found in the Record on March 1, 2017. The 
information contained in this report captures legislative activity 
since that filing through April 25, 2017.
  Republican Budget Committee staff prepared Tables 1-3 of this report.
  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee 
exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays 
under the most recently adopted budget resolution. This information is 
used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the 
CBA. For this reporting period, 14 of the 16 authorizing committees are 
in compliance with their allocations. The two committees out of 
compliance are: the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
for spending $1 million more in budget authority and outlays than 
allowed over each enforcement window due to passage of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 
2017, P.L. 115-10; and the Committee on Veterans Affairs, which 
violates its outlay allocation by $200 million over both the fiscal 
year 2017-2021 and fiscal year 2017-2026 periods. The latter 
violation--the largest of this reporting period--stems from passage of 
a bill to amend the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 
2014 to modify the termination date for the Veterans Choice Program, 
and for other purposes, P.L. 115-26. This measure removed the August 7, 
2017, sunset from the program to allow funds previously appropriated to 
be fully exhausted.
  Tables 2-3 remain unchanged from the last report as no new 
appropriations activity has occurred for the fiscal year 2017 cycle.
  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican 
staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget 
totals approved by the Congress.
  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2017, 
which helps enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions 
under CBA section 311. In its report, CBO annualizes the temporary 
effects of the latest continuing resolution, which provides funding 
through April 28, 2017. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, 
the Budget Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the 
committee views current-law levels as being $953 billion and $583.2 
billion below budget resolution levels for budget authority and 
outlays, respectively.
  Revenues are consistent with the levels assumed in the budget 
resolution for fiscal year 2017. Over the fiscal year 2017-2021 and 
fiscal year 2017-2026 period, however, revenues are $1 million below 
assumed levels due to the enactment of H.J. Res. 83, P.L. 115-21, a 
resolution considered under the Congressional Review Act for 
disapproving of the rule by the Department of Labor relating to 
``Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make and 
Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness.''
  Social Security outlays and revenues are at the levels assumed in 
S.Con.Res. 3.
  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate 
pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The Senate's PAYGO scorecard currently 
shows increased deficits of $202 million over the fiscal year 2016-2021 
and fiscal year 2016-2026 periods. For both of these periods, outlays 
have been increased by $201 million, and revenues have been reduced by 
$1 million. The Senate's PAYGO rule is enforced by section 201 of S. 
Con.Res.21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.
  Finally, included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate's 
budget enforcement activity on the floor. No budget points of order 
have been raised since my last filing.
  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.
  I ask unanimous consent that the tables be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                                  Congressional Budget Office,

                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2017.
     Hon. Mike Enzi,
     Chairman, Committee on the Budget
     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of 
     Congressional action on the fiscal year 2017 budget and is 
     current through April 25, 2017. This report is submitted 
     under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the 
     Congressional Budget Act, as amended.
       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues 
     are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of 
     S. Con. Res. 3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 
     Fiscal Year 2017.
       Since our last letter dated March 1, 2017, the Congress has 
     cleared and the President has signed the National Aeronautics 
     and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2017 (Public 
     Law 115-10). That act has significant effects on budget 
     authority and outlays in fiscal year 2017.
           Sincerely,
                                                       Keith Hall,
                                                         Director.
       Enclosure.

  the adoption of S. Con. Res. 3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2017.
Emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the
  Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 does not count for certain budgetary enforcement
  purposes. These amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:


 
                                      Budget
                                    Authority     Outlays      Revenues
 
Further Continuing and Security             -2           -1            0
 Assistance Appropriations Act,
 2017 (P.L. 114-254).............
 
\c\ Division A of P.L. 114-254 contains the Further Continuing
  Appropriations Act, 2017, which provides funding for those agencies
  within the jurisdiction of 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills
  through April 28, 2017; those amounts are shown under the ``Continuing
  Resolution'' section of this table. Certain provisions in Division A
  provide funding until or beyond the end of fiscal year 2017; those
  amounts are shown in the ``Previously Enacted'' section of this table.
  In addition, Division B of P.L. 114-254 contains the Security
  Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, which provides funding until or
  beyond the end of fiscal year 2017 for overseas contingency
  operations; those amounts are shown under the ``Previously Enacted''
  section of this table.
\d\ Sections 193-195 of Division A of P.L. 114-254 provided funding,
  available until expended, for innovation projects and state responses
  to opioid abuse. CBO estimates that, for fiscal year 2017:
The $20 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section
  193 would result in an additional $5 million in outlays for FDA
  innovation projects;
The $352 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section
  194 would result in an additional $91 million in outlays for NIH
  innovation projects;
The $500 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section
  195 would result in an additional $160 million in outlays for state
  response to opioid abuse.
Consistent with sections 1001-1004 of P.L. 114-255, for the purposes of
  estimating the discretionary budget authority and outlays for these
  provisions under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974
  and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Act of 1985, these
  amounts are estimated to provide no budget authority or outlays.
\e\ For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget
  Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not
  include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts.
  As a result, current level does not include these items.
\f\ Excludes $81,872 million in budget authority and $40,032 million in
  outlays assumed in S. Con. Res. 3 for non regular discretionary
  spending, including spending that qualifies for adjustments to
  discretionary spending limits pursuant to section 251(b) of the
  Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, that is not
  yet allocated to the Senate Committee on Appropriations.
