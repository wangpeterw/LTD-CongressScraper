                      PRESIDENT'S BUDGET IS AWFUL

  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against 
the President's newly released budget request.
  When I began reading this budget request, only one word came to mind, 
at least that I can say here--awful:
  It is an awful budget for American families struggling to make ends 
meet who haven't had a raise in years.
  It is an awful budget for older Americans who paid into Social 
Security with the promise that it would be there for them.
  It is an awful budget for local businesses who can't get their 
products to consumers because of our crumbling roads and bridges.
  It is an awful budget for common sense, with unnecessary spending on 
a border wall that the American people will pay for.
  It is an awful budget because it sets the stage for even more waste, 
fraud, and abuse in government.
  In fact, Mr. Speaker, the only group that this budget isn't awful for 
is the President and his friends.
  The President calls this an America First budget, so why is it 
leaving so many American families behind?
  I urge my colleagues to completely reject this awful budget that 
doesn't create jobs, doesn't uplift families, and doesn't make any 
sense.
