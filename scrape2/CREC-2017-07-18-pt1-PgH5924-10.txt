                      HONORING FULBRIGHT SCHOLARS

  (Mr. MAST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the four 
Fulbright scholarship recipients from Florida's 18th Congressional 
District.
  The Fulbright scholarship is a competitive, merit-based grant program 
for international educational exchange. Each year, the program grants 
students the opportunity to study, research, or teach abroad.
  Dr. Nancy Ackles of Juno Beach, Amanda Fleming of West Palm Peach, 
Dr. Jan Fritz of Palm City, and Laura O'Connor of Jupiter are all 
recipients of this prestigious honor.
  Dr. Ackles will be traveling to Uzbekistan to teach English; Ms. 
Fleming will be living in Asia, working to enhance communication with 
the Vietnamese people; Dr. Fritz will be spending her time in Hungary 
as a sociology scholar; and Ms. O'Connor will be working in Spain as 
she teaches English to the local community.
  On behalf of the 18th Congressional District of Florida, I want to 
again congratulate these outstanding students and scholars for 
receiving the
