          IN SUPPORT OF THE GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of one of our 
most magnificent natural wonders: the Great Lakes. They contain a fifth 
of the world's freshwater and are vitally important to the economy and 
the quality of life in my district.
  The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which has received strong 
support from both sides of the aisle, works to clean up the Great 
Lakes, control invasive species, restore habitats, and reduce runoff. 
Yet we have heard that President Trump may virtually eliminate this 
critical program with an eye-popping irresponsible 97 percent cut to 
the budget; $300 million in funding would be reduced to just $10 
million.
  At the same time, his administration may gut EPA funds for climate 
science, clean air, and safe water.
  Let me be clear. I am adamantly opposed to these cuts and will do 
everything in my power to stop them.
  Tomorrow, on Great Lakes Day, the President is expected to release a 
budget proposal. I urge him to include robust funding for the Great 
Lakes Restoration Initiative and the EPA programs and ensure we pass on 
a sustainable, healthy planet to our children.
