                        MERIT-BASED VISA PROGRAM

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, Uzbekistan uber terrorist Saipov's 
attack in New York City is another example why the United States should 
end the diversity visa lottery. And I emphasize the word ``lottery.''
  The program should have ended years ago. Under this 1990 program, the 
State Department gives 50,000 visas each year to immigrants from 
different parts of the world using a lottery system. Getting into the 
United States is like playing bingo. It is a game of chance.
  Our immigration system should be changed to accept the best and 
brightest throughout the world. It is time to go to a merit-based visa 
system. Grant visas to people who will benefit America. Stop the random 
system that allowed Saipov to come in; a system that rolls the dice 
where foreigners win and Americans lose.
  And that is just the way it is.
