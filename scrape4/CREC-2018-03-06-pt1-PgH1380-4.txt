                RECOGNIZING OUR NORTH COUNTRY OLYMPIANS

  (Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the hard 
work and dedication of our north country Olympians, who made history at 
the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang.
  The United States women's bobsled team, trained in Lake Placid in my 
district, finished strong with an incredible silver medal win.
  We are also incredibly excited for Saranac Lake's very own Chris 
Mazdzer, who made Olympic history this year, taking home Team USA's 
first ever medal in men's singles luge.
  Chris trained tirelessly at the Olympic Training Center in Lake 
Placid, and I know he has inspired the next generation of New York-21 
athletes from across our region.
  Mr. Speaker, the north country has been buzzing with excitement since 
the Winter Games began, and seeing Chris on the podium was an 
incredible moment for us all.
  Congratulations to Chris and to all our Olympians, who showed the 
world just what the north country has to offer.
