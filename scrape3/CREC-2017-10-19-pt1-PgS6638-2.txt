                    REMEMBERING EVELYNE J. VILLINES

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the passing of 
disability rights pioneer and my longtime friend, Ms. Evelyne Villines. 
Ever since I first met Evelyne during my early years in the Iowa House 
of Representatives, I knew her to be a fierce advocate on behalf of 
those with disabilities. She had an outstanding work ethic and never 
stopped campaigning for those with disabilities to be recognized for 
their abilities and not by what others saw as their limitations.
  Thanks to people like Evelyne, our society has made a lot of progress 
in this area. Evelyne's tireless work earned her recognition on both 
the State and national levels as an inductee into the Iowa Women's Hall 
of Fame and the national Hall of Fame for Persons with Disabilities. 
Evelyne's efforts were recognized as paving the way for passage for the 
American with Disabilities Act of 1990.
  She served on numerous commissions and joined the board of 
SourceAmerica in its infancy, leading the company to become one of the 
largest employers of people with disabilities in the Nation. Evelyne's 
advocacy and resulting accomplishments have opened the doors of 
opportunity for people with disabilities.
       I am honored to stand before you in recognizing Evelyne for 
     her lifelong commitment to service. Evelyne's legacy will 
     live on for years to come through the countless individuals 
     who will continue to benefit from her life's work.
