          GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AND RELEASE OF FISA DOCUMENTS

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, we are starting hour 39 of the Schumer 
shutdown weekend.
  I would like everybody to understand that this is a 4-week spending 
bill--4 weeks. It has nothing to do with the March 5 deadline for DACA, 
has nothing to do with DACA at all. Indeed, it is just to keep the 
government running. So, if we get 9 or 10 Senators on the Democratic 
side to realize it has nothing to do with DACA, maybe we can go on and 
do the people's business.
  That said, many of my constituents are calling up, asking about the 
FISA documents, the FISA memo. I do want to see them put out in front 
of the public, and the supporting documents that go with them, after 
having had a chance to look at those confidential documents earlier 
downstairs.
  But I also want us to be confident in the process that Chairman Bob 
Goodlatte, Chairman Trey Gowdy, and Intelligence Committee Chairman 
Devin Nunes have in place to do this methodically and carefully, 
because we want to be sure these documents are brought forward and used 
in a way that is most advantageous to get to the truth. So part of that 
will entail that we need a special counsel to investigate and not have 
the DOJ and FBI investigate themselves.
