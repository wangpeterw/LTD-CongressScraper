                     TAX PLAN GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, we heard last week about $1,000 being 
crumbs and how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doesn't really mean anything 
for normal people.
  Where I come from, this means a lot to people. $100 bills and $50 
bills adding up to $1,000 is real money to real people, maybe not in 
San Francisco, but in my district and a lot of places in this country.
  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is working. These dollars are coming home. 
I just read today that Apple is going to repatriate billions of dollars 
and pay $38 billion of new taxes because they see a fair tax rate, and 
they want to come back and reinvest in America once again. That is $38 
billion for the good of the economy that may not have come back home, 
but now will, because now we have a tax rate that is friendly to the 
people who provide jobs and make the economy happen in this country.
  Mr. Speaker, I don't know anybody who would step over a dollar 
instead of stopping to pick it up. These aren't crumbs on the ground. 
These are the things that make America strong again and our economy 
good again. They are not just merely crumbs that elitists in San 
Francisco or coastal counties in California think don't mean anything. 
We are on the right track with this. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will 
mean more for Americans and their pocketbooks, lower taxes, and a 
better economy.
