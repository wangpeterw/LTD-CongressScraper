         Seminole Announces Three Teacher-of-the-Year Finalists

                           (By Leslie Postal)

       A math coach, a civics teacher and a high school instructor 
     who works with students with disabilities were tapped 
     Wednesday as finalists for Seminole County's teacher-of-the-
     year honors.
       The winner will be announced March 15 and will then be in 
     the running for Florida's top teacher award.
       Seminole's three finalists are:
       Samantha Neff, a math coach at Idyllwilde Elementary 
     School, who has been an elementary school teacher in the 
     district for 17 years and also teaches at the University of 
     Central Florida.
       Leesa Lavender, a seventh-grade civics teacher at Markham 
     Woods Middle School, who has taught middle school social 
     studies since 2007.
       Julie DelRusso, who works with 9th-to-12th-grade students 
     through the district's Exceptional Student Support Services 
     Department. She's been a teacher with the district for 25 
     years.
       The district will announce the winner at the teacher-of-
     the-year ceremony at the Hilton Orlando/Altamonte 
     Springs.
