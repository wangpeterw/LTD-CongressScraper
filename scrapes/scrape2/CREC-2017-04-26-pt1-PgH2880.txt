                         REMEMBERING JAY DICKEY

  (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, we just had the Arkansas 
delegation. My colleagues may have noticed that I was with them. Alaska 
and Arkansas have a great deal of similarity, both starting with an A.
  I served with Jay Dickey. I can tell you that he was my friend.
  To his family, even the other day when I heard that he had passed 
away, I tried to call his cell phone hoping that they would answer it, 
and it was Jay's voice. Here is a gentleman in this body that was a 
great basketball player, a good coach, tennis player, and a fine 
athlete. But more than that, he was a friend to many Congressmen in 
these Halls.
  As was mentioned, he tried to save us all. Some he succeeded with and 
some he did not. He worked with me for many years and finally 
accomplished his goal, and I thank him from the bottom of my heart.
  I know the Lord is taking care of him because he was a true American. 
He was a person that cherished his job, served his district well, and 
was an ally and a friend for those that believed.
  I want to thank Jay Dickey for his efforts to make this country 
better.
