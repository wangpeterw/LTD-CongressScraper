                TAX RELIEF FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IN TEXAS

  (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, last Saturday, across America, was Small 
Business Saturday, a yearly event that highlights American Main Street 
businesses by encouraging consumers to shop in their local shops.
  Forty-five percent of all companies in Texas are small businesses. 
They provide jobs to 4 million Texans. They are our neighbors, our 
family members, and our friends. They provide jobs to more than 4 
million families as well as the 4 million Texans.
  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides small businesses in my north Texas 
district with the lowest tax rate since World War II, allowing them to 
invest in their community, hire more people, and, as the National 
Federation of Independent Business says: This tax bill will lead small 
businesses into a better position.
  We highlighted small businesses last weekend, and the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act follows through with a Tax Code built for increased wages and 
long-term growth.
