                      BENEFITS OF ONSITE CHILDCARE

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, study after study has shown that 
employers and employees find that onsite childcare provides the 
greatest value of any employer-provided childcare option. Despite this, 
only 11 percent of all private sector workers in the U.S. receive 
childcare assistance through their employers. Of that 11 percent, only 
7 percent have access to childcare at or near their place of work.
  As childcare costs dramatically increase each year relative to family 
income, the time has come for new approaches that provide affordability 
and flexibility for working families and increased productivity for 
businesses. Onsite childcare accomplishes this and has been repeatedly 
shown to reduce absenteeism and increase staff retention.
  That is why I am introducing the Child Care At Responsible Employers 
Act this week: to incentivize employer investment in onsite childcare 
by providing a small preference in government contracting to those who 
do so.
  With childcare costs rising, we can't afford not to act, and onsite 
childcare helps both businesses and families.
