                          THANKFUL FOR CHANGE

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as we approach 
Thanksgiving 2017, I am thankful for the change since election 2016 and 
the positive success of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike 
Pence to cut taxes to create jobs.
  In the House, led by Speaker Paul Ryan, there have been records set 
on productivity. As of this week, there have been 458 bills passed out 
of committee, more than the last five administrations; 407 bills passed 
out of the House, more than the last five administrations; and 82 bills 
signed by the President. There is progress for limited government and 
expanded freedom.
  President Trump has also restored trust in America as a beacon for 
freedom with his strong friendship with Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu of Israel, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, and President 
Emmanuel Macron of France. He has championed liberty with 50 Muslim 
nations in Saudi Arabia, with stunning tributes in Warsaw and with the 
National Assembly in Seoul this week.
  President Trump's success in creating jobs is clear with the Dow 
Jones, achieving 50 new highs and soaring. Consumer confidence is at a 
record high, establishing 261,000 new jobs in October alone.
  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never 
forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
