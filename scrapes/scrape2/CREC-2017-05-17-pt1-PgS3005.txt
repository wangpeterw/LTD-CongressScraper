     RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA GRIZZLIES SOFTBALL TEAM

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct 
honor of recognizing the University of Montana Grizzlies softball team 
for their outstanding performance at the Big Sky Conference softball 
tournament. This team has come a long way in a short time, and their 
journey this season is something that all Montanans can appreciate.
  Last week at Ogden, UT, the Grizzlies won the Big Sky Conference 
softball championship for the first time in the school's history. This 
accomplishment is highlighted by the fact that the softball program is 
only in its third year on campus. Four years ago, there was no team or 
coach; today they are conference champions.
  Jamie Pinkerton, the Grizzlies' coach, was also voted the Big Sky 
Conference ``Coach of the Year'' for the second year in a row.
  As conference champions, the Grizzlies will represent Big Sky in the 
2017 NCAA Division I softball championship this Friday as they travel 
to Washington to challenge the Huskies in the regional qualifying 
round. The Grizzlies will have both the Big Sky State and the Big Sky 
Conference rooting for them.
