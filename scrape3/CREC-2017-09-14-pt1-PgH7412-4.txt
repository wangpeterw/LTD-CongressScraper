                         WE MUST NAME OUR ENEMY

  (Mr. WALKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, 16 years ago today, atop a pile of rubble 
that just 3 days before stood tall as the World Trade Center, President 
Bush proclaimed to a hurting Nation: ``I can hear you, the rest of the 
world hears you.''
  With bullhorn in hand and arm wrapped around a firefighter, he added: 
``And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us 
soon.''
  That same day, Congress passed an Authorization for Use of Military 
Force to combat international terrorism. Today, that fight still 
continues, yet the international community has refused to define 
terrorism. How are we, and other nations, to fight a war against 
something that we cannot even define?
  Today, I am introducing the Define it to Fight it Act, a bill that 
withholds 10 percent of our contributions to the United Nations until 
they are willing to define national terrorism, the very thing that they 
are supposed to be fighting.
  To fulfill President Bush's promise, we must name our enemy and then 
make sure they hear us loud and clear, not just for our lifetime, but 
for generations to come.
