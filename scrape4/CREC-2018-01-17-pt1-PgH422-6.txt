                 PROVIDE PERMANENT STATUS FOR DREAMERS

  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, the situation that so many DREAMers--aspired 
Americans who know no other country--face is becoming more and more 
urgent in the face of President Trump's cancellation of their legal 
status in March.
  I want to point out that over 100 are losing status every day and 
losing their permission to be able to go to work--their legal status--
in our country. If we fail to act, one million aspired Americans will 
be unable to work legally and live legally in the only country they 
know, instantly creating over one million more people who are here 
illegally--the opposite of what President Trump ran on and the opposite 
of what the American people want.
  I know that we can pass a solution through this body. I have heard so 
many Republicans and Democrats talk passionately about providing 
permanent status for the DREAMers. Let's pass the Dream Act, any of 
these bills.

  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor a new one yesterday that will 
finally provide some certainty for young people who want to do nothing 
more than work hard, play by the rules, and contribute to make our 
country, the only country they know, the United States of America, even 
greater.
