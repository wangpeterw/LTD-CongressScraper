                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  God of our fathers and mothers, Your glory, majesty, and power 
sustain us. Lord, we ponder the graciousness of Your providence that 
lifts our hearts and gives us hope.
  Keep our lawmakers true to You, obeying You faithfully and trusting 
Your wisdom. Lord, provide them with wisdom to cultivate such reverence 
for You that they will stand for right though the heavens fall. When 
darkness overtakes them, be for them a shining light. May they face 
their foes triumphantly, knowing that with You nothing is impossible. 
May they labor with such integrity that generations to come will 
celebrate their faithfulness.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
