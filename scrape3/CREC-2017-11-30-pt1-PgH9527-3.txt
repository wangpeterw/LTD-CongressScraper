                          REPUBLICAN TAX SCAM

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is fact: the Republican tax scam is 
an attack on America's senior citizens. According to the AARP, 5.2 
million senior citizens, many on fixed incomes, will see a tax hike 
under the Republican bill. Meanwhile, over 60 percent of the tax 
benefits go to the top 1 percent.
  Plus, the bill will trigger an automatic cut to Medicare--$25 billion 
in 2018 alone. In 2019, Americans 50 to 64 years old buying health 
insurance through the individual market will see their premiums 
increase $1,500 on average, according to the AARP. For the first time, 
the bill changes the way Social Security COLA is calculated, reducing 
Social Security benefits.
  Seniors lose in the Republican tax bill, and so does pretty much 
everybody else. Who wins? Millionaires, billionaires, and the 
wealthiest corporations. We should say no to the Republican tax scam. 
Americans deserve a better deal.
