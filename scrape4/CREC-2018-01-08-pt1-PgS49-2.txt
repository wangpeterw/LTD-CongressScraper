                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, abide with us. When other helpers fail and comfort 
flees, strengthen our Senators with Your might. Provide them with a 
perseverance that completes the task, a courage to face every fear, and 
a fidelity that brings glory to Your Name. Help them to live such 
exemplary lives that they will infect others with the contagion of love 
for You and country. Lord, give them the gentleness and symmetry to 
bring healing to our Nation and world. Whatever they do, may they do it 
for You, the Author and Finisher of our destinies.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
