                             SKINNY BUDGET

  (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, this morning, President Trump has released 
the first budget proposal of his administration.
  In reading through the budget proposal, I am reminded of what 
President Trump said in the summer when he was speaking to the African-
American community in a rally in Philadelphia.
  He said: What do you have to lose?
  This is what we have to lose: eliminating the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant program, 
whose sole purpose is to combat poverty nationwide.
  This is what we have to lose: cutting funding for Head Start and 
before- and after-school programs for our kids does not give them a 
chance to get ahead.
  This is what we have to lose: stripping funding for Medicaid in your 
new healthcare law that provides critical services for our most 
vulnerable.
  This is what we have to lose: all of those cuts do not give our 
seniors, our children, and our working families a chance to get ahead.
  Our communities have too much to lose, Mr. President. Our communities 
need the opportunity to make crucial investments that make our 
neighborhoods stronger block by block.
