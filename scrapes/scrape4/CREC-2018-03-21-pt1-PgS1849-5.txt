                                SCHEDULE

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like this morning to give an 
update to my colleagues, given the challenges associated with the 
weather--and also as we move toward a conclusion of the omnibus.
  I have spoken to the Democratic leader. It is my expectation that we 
will move forward with votes today. We are hoping to move them forward 
on the sex trafficking bill, moving them up in the day, hopefully, to 
accommodate safe travel. So we will notify everyone when votes are 
scheduled.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                          ____________________
