                     INFRINGING UPON WOMEN'S RIGHTS

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my opposition to 
H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance 
Full Disclosure Act.
  A woman's right to choose shouldn't depend on her location, income, 
or insurance. It is just 2 days since the 44th anniversary of Roe v. 
Wade, and Republicans are, once again, attacking women's health care.
  This legislation would prevent Federal funds from being spent on 
health benefits that include abortion coverage, causing women and 
families who depend on ACA to lose their coverage.
  A woman who can't afford an abortion and needs one should not be 
stripped of her constitutionally protected right to one because of her 
insurance.
  We have to stand up and fight for our sister's right to choose and 
her right to control her own body. It is not the Federal Government's 
business. It is personal. It is my business.
  I will continue to challenge any attempt to infringe upon women's 
rights and strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in protecting 
that right.
