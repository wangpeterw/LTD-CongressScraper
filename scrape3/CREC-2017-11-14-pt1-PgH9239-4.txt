                        HONORING EVELYN MALZBERG

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I rose to honor our Nation's public 
schools. Today I rise to honor Ms. Evelyn Malzberg, a lady who embodies 
the saying: ``It is never too late to learn.''
  After graduating high school in 1943, Ms. Malzberg thought about 
going to college, but Ms. Malzberg's mom told her that no man would 
marry a woman smarter than he is. So Ms. Malzberg found success 
elsewhere. She married, raised a family, and had a career as a legal 
secretary.
  Somewhere along the way, Ms. Malzberg concluded that she had made a 
mistake. She started taking college courses, one a semester. A few 
years ago, at the young age of 84, Ms. Malzberg graduated from New 
Jersey City University with a bachelor's degree in creative writing.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Ms. Malzberg, a lady 
whose remarkable story proves how valuable the Nation's public 
education system is to our people.
