                         TRIBUTE TO JANET JONES

  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor Janet Jones for her 
distinguished public service to the U.S. Senate.
  Janet began her Senate career in the Office of the Senate Chief 
Counsel for Employment in 2006 as a litigation paralegal. Not long 
after that, she took on the tremendous responsibility of getting Senate 
offices prepared for their mandatory OSHA inspections by the 
congressional Office of Compliance.
  During the 114th Congress alone, Janet pre-inspected almost a half-
million square feet of office space, assisting Senate offices with 
identifying potential hazards and potential safety violations.
  Janet's tireless work with Senate offices over the past 12 years has 
contributed to making the offices that serve this body safer for our 
employees, our visitors, and our constituents. With Janet's assistance, 
many Senate offices, including my own, have earned Safe Office Awards.
  We will miss Janet's institutional knowledge and unparalleled 
professionalism.
  Janet, thank you for your service, and I wish you great happiness in 
retirement.
