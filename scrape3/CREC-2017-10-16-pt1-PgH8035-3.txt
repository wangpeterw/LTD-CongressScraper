  Monsignor Stephen Rossetti, Catholic University of America,

  Good and gracious God, You love all people equally and completely--
young and old, Black and White, Republican and Democrat, Muslim and 
Christian, saint and sinner. Help us to love as You love. And by this 
love, make us one with each other and one with You.
  Amen.
