   SENATE RESOLUTION 280--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF OCTOBER 2 THROUGH 
OCTOBER 6, 2017, AS ``NATIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WEEK'' TO 
 RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN TRANSFORMING 
AND IMPROVING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR ALL PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES

  Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Thune) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 280

       Whereas Congress has emphasized that the use of health 
     information technology is essential to providing coordinated 
     care, expanding access to care, and improving the quality of 
     mental and physical health for all people in the United 
     States;
       Whereas health information technology is essential for 
     improving patient care, ensuring patient safety, stopping 
     duplicative tests and paperwork, and reducing healthcare 
     costs;
       Whereas Congress has recognized that the convergence of 
     medical advances, health information technology, and high-
     speed broadband networks are transforming the delivery of 
     care by bringing healthcare providers and patients together 
     virtually, especially those patients who are in disadvantaged 
     populations and areas;
       Whereas the further development of precision medicine, 
     which tailors medicines and treatments to the unique genetic 
     blueprint, lifestyle, and environmental data of each patient, 
     requires advances in health information technology to compare 
     that data with the information of other individuals in order 
     to predict illness and determine the best treatments;
       Whereas Congress has recognized the need, and taken action, 
     to modernize regulations in order to grow the health 
     information technology market, improve the health of all 
     people in the United States, create high-demand jobs, and 
     stimulate market innovation; and
       Whereas it is necessary to continue activities that are 
     foundational to the transformation of healthcare delivery in 
     the United States, including--
       (1) promoting innovation in health information technology;
       (2) opening interoperability between systems and devices; 
     and
       (3) exchanging health information confidently and securely 
     among different providers, systems, and insurers: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates the week of October 2 through October 6, 
     2017, as ``National Health Information Technology Week'';
       (2) recognizes the value of information technology and 
     management systems in transforming healthcare for the people 
     of the United States; and
       (3) encourages all interested parties to promote the use of 
     information technology and

     management systems to transform the healthcare system of the 
     United States.
