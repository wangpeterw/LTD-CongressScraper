minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Bishop Hendricken 
High School's Academic Decathlon team, the Division II winners of the 
United States Academic Decathlon National Competition.
  The team consists of Mitchell Boyer, Ryan Brady, Darragh Harkin, 
Steven Huang, Jaidan Idarraga, Connor Milson, Cory Morris, Alden Pratt, 
and Dylan Temel. They spent countless hours studying and, on April 22, 
their hard work paid off. Led by Coach Sister Carol Ann Murray, they 
won an impressive 12 gold, 8 silver, and 11 bronze medals and became 
the first Rhode Island team to win their division at the national 
competition.
  The students' dedication and scholastic abilities have made Bishop 
Hendricken, my alma mater, and the whole State of Rhode Island 
extremely proud.
  Mr. Speaker, they have shown the vast academic potential of Rhode 
Island students, and I congratulate them on this great accomplishment.
