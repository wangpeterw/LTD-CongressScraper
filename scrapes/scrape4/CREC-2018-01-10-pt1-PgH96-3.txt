        RECOGNIZING THE BICENTENNIAL OF SPENCER COUNTY, INDIANA

  (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of an important 
milestone in Indiana history, the bicentennial of Spencer County, 
Indiana.
  Founded in 1818 by Captain Spier Spencer, this rural county along the 
Ohio River was the boyhood home of Abraham Lincoln. Years later, when 
recalling his time in Spencer County, the man who became our 16th 
President stated quite succinctly: ``There, I grew up.''
  In addition to the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial and a scenic 
state park, Spencer County is home to St. Meinrad Archabbey and 
Indiana's premier tourist destinations, Holiday World and Splashin' 
Safari. Wildly recognized as the world's first theme park, Holiday 
World draws hundreds of thousands of visitors to the county each year.
  Today, strategically connected to the world by Interstate 64, US 231, 
rail, and the Ohio River, Spencer County has become a leader in 
agriculture, manufacturing, maritime and ground logistics, steel 
production, power generation, and world class family entertainment.
  I proudly salute the citizens and the wonderful hometowns of Spencer 
County on this notable occasion.
