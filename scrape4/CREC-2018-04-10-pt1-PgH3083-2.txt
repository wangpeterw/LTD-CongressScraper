                     GRAND OPENING OF LOTUS VILLAGE

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, on April 20, Lotus House Shelter will 
have the grand opening of Lotus Village, a home for disadvantaged women 
and children that will offer a meaningful solution to prevent 
homelessness in my area of Miami-Dade County.
  Lotus House is dedicated to improving the lives of homeless women, 
youth, and children, providing support, education, tools, and resources 
that empower them to heal, learn, and blossom into who they are truly 
meant to be.
  Today, Lotus House shelters over 250 individuals on a daily basis, 
680 annually, breaking the cycle of childhood abuse, domestic violence, 
and homelessness.
  The opening of the new home, Lotus Village, offers increased 
capacity, a neighborhood health clinic, a children's daycare center, 
and a wellness center. Lotus Village includes programs like child 
therapy, nurturing parenting classes, as well as training programs for 
life skills and job readiness.
  This safe haven is deeply integrated in the fabric of our community, 
and I am incredibly proud of the tireless work of all the volunteers of 
Lotus House Shelter in serving those in need reintegrate into society.
