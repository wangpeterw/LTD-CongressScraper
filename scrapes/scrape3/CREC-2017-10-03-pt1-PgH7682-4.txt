  Pastor Kevin McKee, Chapel on the Campus, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 
offered the following prayer:
  O Lord, our God, creator of Heaven and Earth, sustainer of all 
things, grant this House the wisdom and courage to pursue justice in 
their legislation. Give them compassion and hope as they offer aid and 
relief to those who have suffered from the devastation of disasters. 
Give them unity that is necessary to achieve the highest levels of 
peace in our land.
  Give the women and men of this Chamber the character and courage to

pursue what is right and what is good. May they be able to discern what 
is best not only for their constituents, but for all Americans. 
Understanding the human condition and the mercy of God, may they work 
together to advance true liberty.
  Be present today, O God of wisdom, to direct the affairs and 
deliberations of this honorable assembly and their committees.
  This we ask in the name of Jesus Christ.
  Amen.
