                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Father of love, who made Heaven and Earth, sustain us through this 
day. May our lawmakers focus on Your glory and not their own. Inspire 
them with Your presence so that their lives will reflect Your mercy and 
truth. Lord, give them the wisdom to trust Your plans and to desire for 
You to do as You please for our Nation and world.
  Forgive us when we depend primarily on our strength and ability to 
meet life's challenges, forgetting that You are able and eager to help 
us. God, our deliverer, we bless Your Name from this time forth and 
forever more. Thank You for Your merciful kindness that is new each 
day.
  We pray in Your precious Name. Amen.
