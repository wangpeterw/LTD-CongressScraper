                   HONORING SERGEANT DILLON BALDRIDGE

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant Dillon 
Baldridge, who was killed in action on June 10, 2017, from wounds 
sustained in Nangarhar province, Afghanistan, while supporting 
Operation Freedom's Sentinel.
  He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, 
Combat Infantry Badge, and the Army Commendation Medal with one oak 
leaf cluster. His prior awards and decorations included the Army 
Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal with three oak clusters, 
Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, the Global War 
on Terrorism Medal, Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, Army 
Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, and the Expert 
Infantry Badge.
  Last week, hundreds of North Carolina residents gathered in Ashe 
County to pay tribute to Sergeant Baldridge as he was laid to rest. We 
should all take time to pause, reflect, and honor the sacrifices of 
those like this young man from Youngsville, North Carolina, who have 
given their lives in the pursuit of a more prosperous and free America. 
May we endeavor to live worthy of their legacy and guard vigilantly the 
history and stories of our fallen.
