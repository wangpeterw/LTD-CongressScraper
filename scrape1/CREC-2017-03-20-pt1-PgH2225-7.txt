                         QUESTIONING MR. COMEY

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, in a methodical questioning of Mr. 
Comey today in the Intelligence Committee, let me recount for you and 
my colleagues the responses of Mr. Comey.
  Mr. Trump's tweet, March 4, 2017: Terrible. Just found out that Obama 
had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing 
found. This is McCarthyism.
  Mr. Comey said: No, it did not happen.
  March 4, 2017: Is it legal for a sitting President to be wiretapping 
a race for President prior to an election? Turned down by court 
earlier. A new low.
  Mr. Comey said: No, it did not happen.
  Mr. Comey, the FBI director.
  Again on March 4, 2017: I bet a good lawyer could make a great case 
out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, 
just prior to election.
  Again, Mr. Comey said: No.
  And then again on March 4, 2017, Mr. Trump said: How low has 
President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election 
process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad, or sick, guy.
  Mr. Comey, the FBI director, said: No.
  Definitively, Mr. Trump did not tell the truth. More investigations 
deliberatively to determine the status of the actions of the President 
of the United States accusing a former President of a criminal felony 
which did not happen. It did not happen.
