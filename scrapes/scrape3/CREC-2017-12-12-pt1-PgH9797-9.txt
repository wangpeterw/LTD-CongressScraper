                      GUNNERY SERGEANT DALE SIGLER

  (Mr. McKINLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Gunnery Sergeant 
Dale Sigler from Moundsville, West Virginia.
  Dale's life has been one of leadership and service to his community 
and country. At the age of 17, during the height of World War II, he 
got his parents' permission and enlisted in the United States Navy, 
even before he had finished high school. He served in the Navy until 
1946 before returning home to finish his education. Upon graduation, he 
then joined the Marines and led an exemplary military career as a 
gunnery sergeant.
  Dale retired after 20 years of military service, but his desire to 
serve the community didn't stop there. He went on to serve as a 
chaplain for the local chapters of The American Legion, Veterans of 
Foreign Wars, and Marine Corps League. He was recently awarded a 
Lifetime Achievement Award for his dedicated service.
  Gunnery Sergeant Sigler, we salute you and offer you our deepest 
gratitude. You, sir, are truly a great American.
