                           THE LIBERAL MEDIA

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, the American people hate the # inhuman 
liberal media more and more every day. The last example? A Washington 
Post op-ed, titled, ``I Would Have Aborted a Fetus With Down 
Syndrome.'' My entire hometown of Sugar Land, Texas, was disgusted by 
those nine words.
  I sent the hurtful article to Ammie, Massey, and Kristin, three 
friends with gorgeous Down kids. Ammie was stunned, because The Post 
basically said:

       If you knew your child would have cancer, cerebral palsy, 
     diabetes, be deaf, blind, mute, or autistic, they should be 
     aborted.

  Ammie's Sadie has Down. Ammie says about her daughter:

       Even on my hardest days, her smile can take all the 
     difficulties away from my day. I will forget them. Through my 
     tears, I typed this note.

  Mr. Speaker, none of us is perfect and none of us should be aborted 
because we are not perfect.
