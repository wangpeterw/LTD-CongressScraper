                  RECOGNIZING THE FREEDOM 5K FOR PTSD

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight 
an exciting event at Penn State that raises awareness about veterans 
who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.
  The Freedom 5K for PTSD is the brainchild of some of Penn State's 
cadets. Nicholas Pisciotta organized the 2016 run, and Joshua Stein 
organized this year's event.
  Mr. Speaker, these dedicated cadets said they felt it was important 
to take care of the men and women who have fought for our country and 
are still fighting for the freedoms that we enjoy today.
  The proceeds from the event support the Lone Survivor Foundation, 
which provides support for wounded servicemembers, their spouses and 
children, by empowering them with helpful information on how to address 
post-traumatic stress, mild traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, 
military sexual trauma, and care partner stress.
  The Freedom 5K also honors the spirit of Navy SEAL Lieutenant Michael 
Murphy, a Penn State alumnus, who made the ultimate sacrifice as part 
of Operation Red Wings.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend these current and future servicemembers for 
not only organizing this impactful event, but for caring about their 
fellow military men and women.
