                         PASSAGE OF THE GI BILL

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, the Servicemen's Readjustment 
Act of 1944, also known as the GI Bill, has since provided tens of 
millions of returning Active-Duty veterans with help buying a home, 
starting a business, and going to college. Also, in addition to doing 
the right thing, the GI Bill fundamentally transformed the American 
economy from an industrial-based economy to a knowledge-based economy.
  I was proud to support H.R. 3218 this week that would renew this 
commitment. The bill provides expanded educational benefits for 
servicemembers and their families, including the elimination of time 
restrictions on education credits for veterans who reenter civilian 
life in 2013 or after.
  GI benefits should not come with an expiration date. Our veterans 
deserve our respect unexpired for their service to our country. This 
bill affirms that obligation.
