                        REMEMBERING BOB BANUELOS

  (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of a remarkable member of 
my staff and a remarkable member of my community, Bob Banuelos, who 
passed away suddenly last week.
  Bob spent over 30 years working for the people of Orange County. 
Before joining my team, he also worked for my predecessor, 
Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez.
  Bob had deep roots in our community. He grew up on a small family 
farm in Fountain Valley and was a long-time member of the Orange County 
political environment.
  Bob worked for the less fortunate throughout his community, and he 
was a friend to everybody he met.
  Bob was also the first Native American candidate to run for Congress 
in Orange County in 1992, and he came close to winning. He changed 
Orange County politics forever.
  I am saddened by his passing. He devoted his life to making Orange 
County a better place for everybody to live. We will all miss him, and 
we will never forget him.
