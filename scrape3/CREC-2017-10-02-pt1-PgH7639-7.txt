                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Almighty God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We pray for the gift of wisdom to all with great responsibility in 
this people's House for the leadership of our Nation.
  Lord, once again, our Nation reels in grief and horror after yet 
another mass shooting on our soil. We ask Your blessing upon us all, 
but most especially on those who mourn the loss of their loved ones. 
Have mercy on all Your children who died.
  The debates will, once again, ensue. Speed us to the day when the 
wisdom of Solomon might inspire our congressional Members beyond the 
limitations of sound bites and platitudes before more and more American 
citizens are deprived of their lives.
  Lord, the suffering of our world is all around us. Stimulate our 
hearts and minds so that everything we may do this day would be for 
Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
