                 WELCOMING ARCHBISHOP HOVNAN DERDERIAN

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Schiff) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my friend, Archbishop 
Hovnan Derderian, Primate of the Western Diocese of the Armenian Church 
of North America, and to thank him for delivering the opening prayer on 
the House floor today.
  Archbishop Derderian has had a tremendous impact on people of all 
faiths and has played a vital role in the religious and civic life of 
millions.
  Since his election as primate in 2003, Archbishop Derderian has been 
a dedicated religious servant for the thousands of congregants who look 
to him for guidance, managing a diocese which covers the Western United 
States.
  In the large Armenian-American diaspora community that I am proud to 
represent, Archbishop Derderian is an articulate and steadfast voice 
for the values of faith, family, and community service that are at the 
core of the Armenian people's perseverance and strength.
  Archbishop Derderian and the Western Diocese have joined other 
religious and community leaders in rallying support and aid for 
Armenia, Artsakh, and for refugees fleeing the horrors of civil war in 
Syria and Iraq.
  I thank the Archbishop for all that he does to make our community and 
our Nation stronger. I am proud that Congress today was able to hear 
the moral leadership he brings to his work in the Western Diocese.
