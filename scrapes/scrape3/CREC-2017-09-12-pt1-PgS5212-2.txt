                       TRIBUTE TO CONNOR WESTLAKE

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, Connor Westlake of Bozeman, MT, is 
a driven, determined and diligent 19-year-old who has proven to be a 
leader among his peers and in his community. As an athlete, Connor has 
had a distinguished career and was awarded the Christian Character 
Award by the Montana Christian Athletic Association These experiences 
have led him to apply his leadership in the service of our Nation's 
defense, continuing the legacy of military service of his grandfathers, 
U.S. Marines, U.S. Navy; and uncles, U.S. Navy.
  Connor has spent the past year preparing to enter the U.S. Army, 
where he plans to serve his country in Special Forces with the Green 
Berets. He will war the uniform for the first time later this month 
upon arrival at Fort Benning, GA, where he will be among a group of 
highly qualified recruits who will proceed directly from initial entry 
training to Special Forces training. Upon completion of the rigorous 
and challenging 2-year training, Connor will become a member of one of 
the best and most highly skilled combat forces in the world.

  I join the Westlake family in praying for his success and safety and 
thank Connor as he pursues this noble calling of service.
