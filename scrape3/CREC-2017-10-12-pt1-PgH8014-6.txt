                       THE HOLY CITY OF JERUSALEM

  (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support our friend and 
ally, Israel, and to stand for the obvious proposition that the people 
of Israel and the Jewish people have an ancient connection to the city 
of Jerusalem.
  This connection has been forged through millennia of shared faith and 
shared history, yet the U.N. is actually trying to rewrite history:
  They condemn Israel and call it an occupying power in Jerusalem;
  They prevent Israeli scientists from excavating, even though past 
findings have been significant to Christians, Muslims, and Jews alike;
  They have been silent when Israel's culture has been attacked, 
including the desecration and burning of holy sites.
  Each year brings new horrors from the U.N. Their cruelty and attempts 
to erase history and their anti-Semitism cannot be tolerated any 
longer.
  Today I am introducing a resolution reaffirming the connection of the 
Jewish people to the city of Jerusalem and condemning UNESCO's attempts 
to punish and delegitimize Israel.
  I encourage my colleagues to show solidarity with Israel, to support 
the President's removal of the United States from UNESCO, and to 
support this resolution I have proposed.
