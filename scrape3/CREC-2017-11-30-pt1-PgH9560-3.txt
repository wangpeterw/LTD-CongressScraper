                           WE NEED TAX REFORM

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about tax reform. Tax 
reform should be all about helping those who are in need: Working 
families, veterans, seniors, small-business owners, just to name a few.
  Unfortunately, the plan that the congressional Republicans are 
currently ramming through the Senate with the vote that could happen 
just in a few short hours does exactly the opposite.
  Their plan would overwhelmingly benefit the superrich and the well-
connected at the expense of the middle class, small businesses, not to 
mention veterans and seniors struggling to make ends meet.
  The middle class and small businesses, we can do better by them. 
Instead of giving us a budget-busting half-trillion-dollar tax cut to 
the wealthiest Americans, let's provide greater tax relief to working 
families. Let's keep our promise to the veterans. Let's strengthen 
Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. Let's help the aspiring 
entrepreneurs pursue their passion. Let's ensure better wages, better 
jobs, better opportunities, and a better future for all Americans.
