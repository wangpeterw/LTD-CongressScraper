                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR

  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of the following nomination: Executive 
Calendar No. 303.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The clerk will report the nomination.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Randal 
Quarles, of Colorado, to be Vice Chairman for Supervision of the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for a term of four years.
  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
vote on the nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if 
confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon 
the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's 
action; that no further motions be in order; that any statements 
relating to the nomination be printed in the Record; and that the 
Senate then resume consideration of the Gingrich nomination.
  One modification, Mr. President. I am striking the portion of this 
unanimous consent request relating to the Gingrich nomination.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Is there further debate on the nomination?
  Hearing none, the question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to 
the Quarles nomination?
  The nomination was confirmed.
