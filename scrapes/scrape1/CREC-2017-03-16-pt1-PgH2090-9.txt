minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, today I have introduced a resolution of 
inquiry requesting that the President and Attorney General provide the 
House with any evidence in their possession relating to President 
Trump's claims that President Obama illegally ordered the wiretapping 
of Trump Tower, a task not welcomed but necessitated by the President's 
seemingly baseless accusations that the Obama administration wiretapped 
Trump Tower during the Presidential campaign. These accusations should 
be taken literally and seriously.
  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I have seen absolutely no 
evidence that supports the President's claims. President Trump and the 
Department of Justice have a responsibility to completely clarify the 
President's statement on Twitter.
  If the White House and Department of Justice are unable to produce 
this evidence, as I suspect will be the case, the President owes the 
American people a thorough and immediate explanation and apology.
