                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE

  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware is somewhere 
in the neighborhood, and he has a train to catch in a few minutes. So I 
ask unanimous consent that after I make a few remarks about today's 
events and the voting today, the Senator from Delaware be recognized, 
and that following his speaking, I be recognized again.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
