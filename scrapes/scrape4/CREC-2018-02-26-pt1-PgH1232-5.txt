                              GUN VIOLENCE

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, we have been out of session for a week, and 
much has happened in America. Of course, the most dreadful thing is 
Parkland, Florida, and the Douglas High School. I shed quite a few 
tears thinking about those students and looking at the teachers who 
lost their lives.
  The system failed. The FBI failed to follow up. Apparently, the 
sheriff's department failed to follow up. Mr. Speaker, our President 
failed because he failed to see the problem that we have in this 
country is not giving teachers guns, but giving teachers more respect 
and giving them more counselors and giving them more aid to be able to 
teach. He failed to see that the problem is not just in schools, where 
it is so important and there have been shootings and killings, but 
there are killings in Texas churches and in Las Vegas concerts, and by 
people over 21 years of age.
  Banning bump stocks, which was the response to Las Vegas, is right 
and good and needs to be done by law to be done legally. Banning 
assault weapons being purchased by under 21-year-olds is good, but we 
need to ban assault weapons for everybody, for the 58 victims in Las 
Vegas as well as the victims in that church in Texas--and high-capacity 
magazines. We need to let the CDC study. We need to act.
  God save America and the Chamber.
