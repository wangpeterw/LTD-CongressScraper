                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dom Elias M. Carr, All Saints Regional Catholic School, Glen 
Cove, New York, offered the following prayer:
  O God, beyond all praising, source of light, sustainer of life, 
significance of liberty, we come before You.
  With hearts filled with wonder, we thank You for every gift You send, 
for blessings without number, and mercies without end.
  Turn to us as we lift our hearts before You, and wait upon Your word, 
honoring and adoring You, our good and gracious Lord.
  Then hear us, O God, accepting the love we bring, that we, who know 
Your favor, may serve You, our unimaginable king.
  Look kindly upon these Representatives and their staffs, showering 
upon them the spirit of wisdom, charity, and justice.
  And whether our tomorrows be filled with good or ill, let us triumph 
through our sorrows and rise to bless You still: to marvel at Your 
beauty and glory in Your ways and make a joyful duty our sacrifice of 
praise.
