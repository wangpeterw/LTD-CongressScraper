            ADMINISTRATION'S IMMIGRATION PROPOSAL IS FLAWED

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the administration's immigration 
proposal is flawed. It doesn't include workforce verification, which 
would protect jobs for American workers and reduce illegal immigration.
  The proposal grants amnesty to twice as many people as President 
Obama did. It gives amnesty today but delays legal immigration reforms 
until a distant tomorrow. For example, the elimination of chain 
migration won't occur for 17 years, if then.
  The proposal is also ripe for fraud. Illegal immigrant adults can 
claim they arrived as children, but there is no practical way to 
confirm that.
  The immigration plan is not a good deal for the American people. 
Immigration policy should put the interests of American workers first.
