                    FORT LAUDERDALE AIRPORT SHOOTING

  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, last week, we observed a moment of silence 
to remember the victims 6 years after the Tucson shooting. Just 
yesterday, another moment of silence to remember the five people killed 
and six wounded when they were shot while waiting at the Fort 
Lauderdale Airport baggage claim.
  In those awful moments after the shooting, the airport was thrown 
into chaos and confusion. Yet, before we knew anything of the 
circumstances, every American could tell you what would come next 
because Congress has developed a well-worn routine in response to gun 
violence: first, shocking news of a deadly shooting, followed by 
thoughts and prayers, followed by a moment of silence on this floor, 
followed by a complete failure to take action.
  To truly honor the victims, moments of silence must be followed by 
productive discussions of policy: What will we do to keep our community 
safer? I ask my Republican colleagues, meet with me. Let's at least 
start a conversation here on the House floor. We can no longer remain 
silent during this epidemic of gun violence. Thoughts and prayers are 
all that we have offered the American people, and that is not enough.
