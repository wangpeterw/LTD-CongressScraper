 GRANTING MEMBERS PERMISSION TO EXTEND REMARKS AND INCLUDE EXTRANEOUS 
     MATERIAL IN THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD DURING THE 115TH CONGRESS

  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during the 
115th Congress all Members be permitted to extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material within the permitted limit in that section 
of the Record entitled ``Extensions of Remarks.''
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from California?
  There was no objection.
