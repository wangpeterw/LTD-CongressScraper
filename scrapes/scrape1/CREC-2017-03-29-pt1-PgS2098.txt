       POM-14. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of 
     the State of Michigan petitioning the United States Congress, 
     pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution, to 
     call a convention of the states to propose amendments to the

                   Enrolled Senate Joint Resolution V

       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
     state of Michigan, That pursuant to article V of the 
     constitution of the United States, the legislature of the 
     state of Michigan petitions the congress of the United States 
     of America, at its session, to call a convention of the 
     states limited to proposing an amendment to the constitution 
     of the United States requiring that in the absence of a 
     national emergency, including, but not limited to, an attack 
     by a foreign nation or terrorist organization within the 
     United States of America, the total of all federal 
     appropriations made by the congress for any fiscal year may 
     not exceed the total of all estimated federal revenues for 
     that fiscal year, together with any related and appropriate 
     fiscal restraints.
       Resolved further, That this application is to be considered 
     as covering the balanced budget amendment language of the 
     presently outstanding balanced budget applications from other 
     states, including, but not limited to, previously adopted 
     applications from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, 
     Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, 
     Nebraska, Nevada, Now Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, 
     Pennsylvania, and Texas; and this application shall be 
     aggregated with those applications for the purpose of 
     attaining the two-thirds of states necessary to require the 
     calling of a convention for proposing a balanced budget 
     amendment, but shall not be aggregated with any applications 
     on any other subject.
       Resolved further, That this application constitutes a 
     continuing application in accordance with article V of the 
     constitution of the United States until the legislatures of 
     at least two-thirds of the several states have made 
     applications on the same subject. It supersedes all previous 
     applications by this legislature on the same subject.
       Resolved further, That certified copies of this joint 
     resolution be transmitted by the secretary of state to the 
     president of the United States Senate, to the speaker of the 
     United States House of Representatives, and to each member of 
     this state's delegation to the congress and that printed 
     copies be sent to each house of each state legislature in the 
     United States.
