      TY MUSE IS BROOME COUNTY'S DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN OF THE YEAR

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ty Muse, the CEO 
of Visions Federal Credit Union, who was recently honored by the Boy 
Scouts of America and the Baden-Powell Council as the Broome County 
Distinguished Citizen of the Year.
  Each year, this award is given to an individual in the Broome County 
community who sets a positive example for others and demonstrates 
concern and significant care for their community.
  Mr. Muse moved to the Broome County area 5 years ago and hit the 
ground running. He has been honored for his commitment to helping young 
leaders throughout the region by sponsoring a free track program, 
donating to several local school districts and colleges, and working to 
raise awareness in financial literacy.
  Madam Speaker, I extend both my congratulations and my thanks to Mr. 
Ty Muse for his hard work and dedication to the Broome County community 
and for his commitment to inspiring leaders of the future.
