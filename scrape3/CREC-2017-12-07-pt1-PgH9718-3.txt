                        RECOGNIZING EDDY ACEVEDO

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, today is a bittersweet day for our 
office because we bid farewell to my senior foreign policy adviser and 
subcommittee staff director, Eddy Acevedo--a native Miami boy and a 
proud Nicaraguan American.
  For over a decade, Eddy and I have worked side by side to advance the 
issues critical to U.S. interests at home and around the globe. Eddy's 
depth of knowledge and his political acumen are only eclipsed by his 
passion and his kindness.
  But don't let that fool you, Mr. Speaker. He is a bulldog when it 
comes to advancing our core ideals, like the respect for human rights 
and the promotion of democratic principles. That is why he is an ideal 
fit for his next role as deputy assistant administrator and chief 
legislative strategist with the USAID. I have no doubt that we will 
hear many great things from Eddy in the future.
  Mr. Speaker, Eddy is more than just my most trusted adviser. He is my 
dear friend, and he will be very much missed. So our staff and our 
family wish him and his wife, Luly, all the best as they enter this 
next new, exciting chapter of their life together.
