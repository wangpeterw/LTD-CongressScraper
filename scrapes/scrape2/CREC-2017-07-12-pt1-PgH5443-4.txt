                       RECOGNIZING GASPERI FAMILY

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Gasperi 
family, who will be moving to Kenya in August on a mission to bring 
clean, fresh water to the schools in the surrounding area.
  The Gasperi family seeks to provide clean water to schools in the 
city of Nakuru. Clean water will help the Kenyans avoid waterborne 
parasites and illnesses that interfere with childhood education.
  Ashley Gasperi grew up in Kenya, and, with her husband, Chris, 
started a nonprofit called Ekenywa, which means a new beginning. Their 
mission is to improve the quality of life for school-aged children in 
Kenya and to eradicate poverty.
  Both Chris and Ashley hold their master's degrees in nursing. Chris 
serves as a nurse manager at St. Mary Medical Center's orthopedic 
center, and Ashley serves as a clinical instructor at Temple 
University.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the entire Eighth Congressional District of 
Pennsylvania, we are so proud of the Gasperi family. We wish them the 
best as they work to provide a brighter future and cleaner water for 
all the children of Kenya.
