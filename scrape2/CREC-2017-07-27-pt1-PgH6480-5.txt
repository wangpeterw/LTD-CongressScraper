                         THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK

  (Mr. McCLINTOCK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, this administration was elected to drain 
the swamp, and one of the muckiest parts is the Export-Import Bank that 
makes taxpayer-guarantied loans to foreign companies that buy American 
products, often to use in competition with American companies that get 
no such advantage.
  Now, when politicians are picking winners and losers in the shadows, 
it shouldn't surprise us that we find a particularly nasty breeding 
ground for corruption.
  We can debate the merits of the Ex-Im Bank, but one thing is 
undeniable: it is an agency that needs a taxpayer watchdog on its board 
and not just another lapdog for crony capitalists seeking to fleece the 
taxpayer.
  Scott Garrett is a watchdog. He has sounded the alarm on the Ex-Im's 
more questionable loans, and his leadership on its board would restore 
credibility to its decisions.
  The bank's supporters should welcome an independent voice that could 
restore its reputation, and the President should insist on it.
