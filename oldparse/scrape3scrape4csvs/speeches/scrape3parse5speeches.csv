1132,topic-id,759,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exceptional emergency and operational contributions of the Civil Air Patrol and its 58,000 volunteers. In the near future, I hope to also talk about two other primary missions of the CAP: youth development and aerospace/STEM education.  Literally every day, the CAP responds to life-threatening emergencies, homeland security requests, and a wide range of missions for States and the Federal Government with over 500 single-engine aircraft in every State and in Puerto As an active member since 2004, I have had the privilege of flying many of these missions, so I speak from personal experience.  Over the past 15 months, the CAP has responded to four hurricanes, major wildfires in the West, dozens of other emergencies, including search and rescues, in addition to vital military missions on a daily basis. The high operational tempo has helped ensure that the CAP, for a second year in a row, has flown over 100,000 hours.  The CAP's pace of operations is extraordinary when one considers that these missions are flown by volunteer professionals who pay dues to belong to the CAP, and they must take time from their work or use their vacation times to actually fly these missions.  Vital for communities and for every State are the CAP's disaster relief operations. The mission is best highlighted by the CAP's massive volunteer response to the three recent rapid-fire hurricanes--Harvey, Irma, and Maria--that made U.landfall from Texas to the Virgin  While additional flight hours are still expected, 2,800 hours have already been flown and nearly half a million photographs have been taken for FEMA, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, South Carolina, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin These photos are being used to assess damage and to focus on recovery efforts.  To do this, the CAP has used 118 aircraft and over 1,000 personnel from 44 wings--there is a wing for every State and Puerto Rico and D.C.--and region headquarters across the For large-scale operations, such as long-term hurricane support, the CAP often depends on the assistance of these adjacent wings in different States and different regions of the country.  I was able to view up close and personal hurricane recovery operations when I flew several sorties during Hurricane On one mission, I was responsible for taking full-motion video of three dams along the Texas-Louisiana border to help establish that they were in good condition and safe for those living in surrounding areas. Those assessments could mean the difference between life and death for many communities.  In California, where fast-moving wildfires destroyed over 8,900 homes, the CAP continues to fly photographic missions in support of FEMA and Hundreds of sorties have been flown and 13,586 photos taken. These photos are being used to help emergency managers analyze the damage and assess the assistance needed by those whose homes and businesses have been damaged or destroyed.  In addition to conventional photography, the CAP's California operations have included testing a new leading-edge tactical aerial imagery system, which helped eliminate distortion in photos, making it easier for FEMA to analyze the data and making them a more effective tool for damage assessments. The CAP is pleased to be part of this test program, and it is expected to help improve wildfire damage assessments.  Operational missions for the Air Force and other government agencies occur daily and without fanfare. These include, among others, being a target for Air Force interceptors, helping to train combat ground forces, and escorting military remotely piloted aircraft for training. Air Combat Command's First Air Force provides operational coordination for these CAP missions, which comprise about 80 percent of the First Air Force weekly operational flying.  I was privileged recently to fly with the CAP Congressional Squadron on a Fertile Keynote mission. This mission is unusual, as it provides CAP aircraft as a slow-moving target for its Air Force pilots to practice interception techniques. The Congressional Squadron is unique, as it includes Members of Congress and congressional staff who fly with CAP airmen.  Our mission that day was to simulate a general aviation aircraft that was in controlled airspace without permission. Two F-16 Vipers scrambled from Joint Base Andrews to find and definitely intercept us. These missions provide excellent training at a fraction of the cost to the government, and they are very valuable in training our great men and women who wear Air Force uniforms.  Another key mission is to help train ground combat soldiers who are about to deploy overseas. Two CAP squadrons are tasked with providing this support.  Mr.Speaker, I will certainly continue this discussion later.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9183.txt,2244,BUILD A BETTER TOMORROW,2017,14,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2015, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death for Americans, and diagnosis rates continue to grow each year.  To live a long and prosperous life with this disease, it is imperative that people with diabetes receive proper nutrition and access to healthcare.

This tax plan fails to hear the American people. It gives tax cuts to corporations on the backs of the middle class.

Republicans refused to hear the call, so this week I announced my education tax package. This series of amendments includes reinstating the tax-exempt status of private-use bonds used to build infrastructure and affordable housing; reinstating the State and local tax deduction, protecting the funds used to pay for schools, community development, and public safety; reinstating the student loan interest tax deduction; repealing the tax on tuition waivers and student stipends; and incentivizing investments in STEM education.  Communities across the Nation need the increased access to upward mobility, and education, the great equalizer, is the place to start.

82,topic-id,761,"Today we are holding a hearing with the      Surgeon General, Jerome Adams, to hear his priorities on      how to encourage people to lead healthier lives. Senator      Murray and I will each have an opening statement. Then we      will introduce After his testimony Senators will      each have five minutes of questions.       When Adams and I met before his confirmation hearing, I      said to him that if, as Surgeon General, he threw himself at      one important problem with everything he has, he could have a      real impact on the lives of millions of       At his confirmation hearing, he said, ``I would also make      wellness and community[[Page S7260]]     and employer engagement a centerpiece of my agenda if      confirmed. . . Our health starts in the communities where we      live, learn, work, play, and go to school.''       Adams has said his first Surgeon General's Report will      focus on health and the economy.       It makes sense for that to be his focus, because there is a      remarkable consensus that wellness--lifestyle changes like      eating healthier and quitting smoking--can prevent serious      illness and reduce health care costs.       This is important because the United States spends about      $2.6 trillion treating chronic diseases. This accounts for      more than 84 percent of our health care costs.       $2.6 trillion treating chronic diseases, 84 percent of our      health care costs.       Today, Adams will talk to us about what local      communities, businesses and other organizations can do to      encourage people to live healthier lives, which will help      reduce health care spending on chronic diseases.       The Cleveland Clinic has said if you achieve at least four      ``normal'' measures of good health, such as a healthy body      mass index and blood pressure, and you see a primary care      physician regularly and keep immunizations up to date, you      will avoid chronic disease about 80 percent of the time.       At a hearing we held last month on wellness I said that it      is hard to think of a better way to make a bigger impact on      the health of millions of Americans than to connect the      consensus about wellness to the health insurance that 178      million people get on the job.       One of our witnesses last month, Steve Burd, talked about      an employee wellness program he implemented while CEO of      Safeway that has reduced the biological age of employees by      four years.       He said: ``Given that 70 percent of health care spending is      driven by behaviors, employers can have a powerful impact on      both employee health and healthcare costs. . .healthcare      costs continued to decline by 9 percent per year [at Safeway]      with no material changes to plan design. Safeway's health      actuaries reported this continued cost reduction was due      predominately to improved health status.''       Many employers have developed similar wellness programs to      incentivize people to make healthier choices.       These programs may reward behaviors such as exercising,      eating better or quitting smoking, or offer employees a      percentage off their insurance premiums for doing things like      maintaining a healthy weight or keeping their cholesterol      levels in check.       Last month we heard that that while both employees and      employers benefit from lower health care costs, both also can      benefit in other ways when people live healthier lives.       Michael Roizen the Chief Wellness Officer at the Cleveland      Clinic, told us, ``The culture of wellness at the Cleveland      Clinic has generated remarkable results that have led to      shared benefits--healthier, happier employees, as well as      lower costs for their self-funded insurance program, and      lower costs for our employees and for the communities and      patients we serve.''       In other words, a healthier workplace translates to the      greater community being healthier.       In recent years, a growing number of organizations and      communities have developed innovative programs to incentivize      individuals to engage in healthy behaviors.       For example, BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee partnered      with local, state, and private organizations to fund      community level initiatives across the state, such as      ``Fitness Zones'' in Chattanooga, programs in rural counties      to promote healthy habits, and an interactive elementary      school program to keep kids moving.       An overall healthy community is more economically      productive--there are fewer workplace accidents, less      absenteeism, and a higher rate of engagement.       At his confirmation hearing, Adams also said not all      national problems should have a response from Washington,      D.      I agree--we don't get any smarter flying to Washington once      a week.       Adam's motto as Surgeon General is ``better health      through better partnerships,'' and I hope this committee can      be one partner going forward.       I look forward to hearing how community level partnerships      and engagement can lead to healthier individuals, higher      quality health care, and lower health care costs.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7259-5.txt,1695,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He has spent his career in mining, starting as a miner. He is a member of a union.

Tax Reform  Mr.President, for a few minutes I would like to turn to another subject. Congress has turned its attention to tax reform, and our principal challenge is to find tax breaks and loopholes to eliminate so that we can lower rates for taxpayers.  I have a nomination. The top of the list should be ending the wind production tax credit. Congress has already recognized the need to end the wind production tax credit by passing legislation to phase out the credit by 2020.  The draft House tax proposal reduces the amount available for new wind turbines by returning the credit to its original value instead of adjusting it for inflation, but we should do better. Instead of phasing it out, we should end the wind production tax credit this year. Ending the wind production tax credit on December 31, 2017, would save over $4 billion, which we could then use to lower tax rates for the American people.  The wind production tax credit has been in place for 25 years. It has been extended 10 different times by It was originally set to expire in 1999.  Tax credits are best used to jump-start new and emerging technologies. It has been a quarter of a century. Wind turbines are no longer a new technology.  President Obama's Energy Secretary, Steven Chu, testified that he believes that wind is a mature technology. It is time to end this wasteful and expensive subsidy for a clearly mature technology.  To date, the wind production tax credit has already cost the taxpayers billions. For 8 years--from 2008 to 2015--the wind production tax credit cost taxpayers $9.6 billion. That is more than $1 billion per year.  According to the Congressional Research Service, the wind production tax credit is expected to cost taxpayers over $23 billion between 2016 and 2020, and the cost to taxpayers will continue until 2030. That is because when you extend the wind production tax credit for 1 year, it is really for 10 years.  To benefit from the tax credit, wind developers must just begin construction of a wind project before December 31, 2019. Then those developers can reap the tax benefits for a decade.  Despite the billions Congress has provided in subsidies, wind energy still produces only 6 percent of our country's electricity and 17 percent of our country's carbon-free electricity. By contrast, nuclear is 20 percent of our electricity and 60 percent of our emissions-free, carbon-free electricity.  The wind blows only about one-third of the time. Until there is some way to store large amounts of wind, a utility still needs to operate nuclear, gas, and coal plants when the wind doesn't blow.[[Page S7207]]  On average, wind turbines are over two times as tall as the skyboxes at the University of Tennessee's Neyland Stadium and taller than the Statue of The blades on the windmills can be as long as a football field, and their blinking lights can be seen for 20 miles.  This isn't the first time that I have been to the Senate floor to express my concern about the wind production tax credit, but I believe that the conversation about energy subsidies and taxes is bigger than the wind production tax credit. As Congress examines ways to reduce tax rates and to broaden the base, we must be willing to look at all tax subsidies from mature technologies. That includes oil and gas subsidies. I am here today to challenge my colleagues to be willing to consider all energy subsidies from mature technologies--wind, solar, oil, gas--as candidates for elimination in a tax reform bill. Those dollars could be better spent to lower rates for taxpayers.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Just 16 short years ago, I learned the most valuable lesson of my life. I realized I had to change my priorities. Part of that change was to put God first. A big part of that commitment was the reading and studying of His Word through prayer and meditation. It is easy to say, but difficult to do.  I had come to a point in my life where I made a covenant with God on my knees, which reminds me of God's instruction to Joshua 1:8, ``This book of laws shall not depart from your lips, but you shall meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then, you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have true success.''  I learned to gradually believe all the wonderful promises God made through His Word, and he credited to me His righteousness, just as He did our spiritual father Abraham in Genesis 15:6, ``I learned it was not my will be done, but His will be done.''  I learned what Jesus Christ had done for me and the entire world and how he leads me in all my endeavors and has called me to places I never imagined I would go. One of those is right here.  Years ago, I could never have imagined myself here tonight, speaking on[[Page H9252]]this floor in the United States House of Representatives, representing the great people of Georgia's 12th But here I am, by the grace of  In this endeavor, I meditate often, and as said in Philippians 2: ``Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others more important than yourself. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but look to the interests of others.''  At a time when many Americans are increasingly divided, I often remind myself and those around me to have faith in Him and to remember the Judeo-Christian values our Nation was founded on.  The Bible's influence on or founding documents can still be seen here today and was mentioned tonight. Again, when the Constitutional Convention reached an impasse, Ben Franklin asked clergymen to come in and pray and read the They united around the greatest constitutional document created in the history of mankind.  Americans are looking to Congress to come together to find solutions for rising healthcare costs, a simpler, fairer Tax Code, and let's get our good folks back to work again. It is time to put the American people's interests above political will.  The division in this Nation is real. They are evident right here in this body. How could our behavior ever show the world to believe that God sent His Son to save the world?  This is when we should look to God's provision. The truth can always be found through faith in him. Jesus summed it up when he prayed for us in John 17:21: ``That all of them may be one, Father, just as You are in me and I am in May they also be in us so that the world may believe that You sent me.''  My inspiration is found in Psalms 51:10-12, David's Prayer: ``Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me.''  As we enter the Christmas season, one of the most important seasons of the year, we all must remember to keep His Word close and let it lead us in all that we do.  I am grateful that we have a President who actually wishes a merry Christmas as we all celebrate the birth of the Savior of the world.  God bless.                              {time}  1915  ",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9247.txt,2239,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,14,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
317,topic-id,462,"Madam Speaker, I thank my dear friend and distinguished colleague from the State of Louisiana[[Page H9362]]for his strong leadership and for hosting us this evening, this Special Order, on such an important issue.  Madam Speaker, tax reform in west Texas and in rural America is about giving our hardworking and middle class families a break in allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned money. According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, our plan would increase wages by over 3 percent, create roughly 1 million new jobs, and raise the after-tax income of the average middle-income family by nearly $2,600.  It is about simplifying the Tax Code and reducing the burden on taxpayers so that they don't have to spend a combined almost 9 billion hours and $100 billion just to prepare their taxes every year. Under our plan, 9 out of 10 Americans, as my colleague mentioned, will be able to file their taxes on a form as simple as a postcard.  It is about getting off the backs of our job creators, which are our small businesses, and letting them create more jobs for their communities. Our plan would reduce the tax rate on our Main Street job creators to the lowest it has been since World War  It is about making America competitive again by leveling the playing field for American producers and manufacturers.  Our plan would lower the corporate tax rate and bring jobs back to America, and it would also boost the average American household income by $4,000 and, in some studies, as high as $9,000.  It is about giving our family farmers and ranchers a reason to invest in new tractors and equipment, combines and cotton strippers, so they can do what they have been doing: be more productive even at feeding and clothing the American people.  This plan allows our farmers and ranchers, as well as our small businesses, the ability to write off the full cost of new technology and equipment immediately, and it is about eliminating the duplicative, unfair, and un-American death tax that prevents family farmers, ranchers, and small-business owners from passing down their hard-earned American Dream to the next generation after they paid taxes on it their entire lives.  Today, more than 70 percent--listen to this--more than 70 percent of family businesses don't make it to the second generation; 90 percent don't survive to the third generation. That is unacceptable.  Tomorrow, Madam Speaker, marks an historic moment, the likes of which we haven't seen in over 30 years, to change the current economic trajectory of this country and restore freedom and opportunity for all hardworking American families. Let's seize it. Let's deliver on our promise, and let's give much-deserved relief to the American people and a much-needed boost to the American economy.

On a more personal level, I believe that the Bible is not simply an inspirational book or a comforting book--although it is that. But, I believe the Bible to be the holy word of It tells us the story of God's love for us. It is a story of redemption for those who would put their faith and trust in Christ alone.  John 3:16 tells us that ``God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.''  For me, as a follower of Jesus Christ, this is not only comforting and inspiring but it is True and the Bible is a guide for my life.  Each day--and the older I get--I am reminded of the comforting Truth in Job Chapter 19. Written centuries before the birth, crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, we were told of our redeemer. The one who would save us.     For I know that my Redeemer lives,     And He shall stand at last on the earth;     And after my skin is destroyed, this I know,     That in my flesh I shall see God,     Whom I shall see for myself,     And my eyes shall behold, and not another.

395,topic-id,350,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to engage in a colloquy.  Mr.Speaker, I want to first commend Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means Committee for their outstanding work on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will provide tax relief to millions of hardworking families and businesses.  I would like to address a small provision in the bill that inadvertently impacts Berea College, a small private college in Berea, Kentucky, that is a member of the federally recognized Work Colleges  Work colleges, by definition, do not charge their students tuition, and they also require their students to hold jobs. For over 125 years, Berea College has fulfilled its mission of providing a tuition-free education to students with limited economic resources, primarily from Appalachia, and who are often first-generation college students. Berea pairs its strong academics with a student labor program, honoring the dignity and utility of all work.  Berea could not fulfill its unique and special mission of providing free tuition to all students without a healthy endowment. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a 1.4 percent excise tax on private college endowments over $500,000 per student. There are two federally recognized work colleges with endowments above this level, including Berea College in my district.  I was pleased to learn that the Senate version of the bill exempts schools with fewer than 500 tuition-paying students from the excise tax. This provision would effectively exempt work colleges from the tax, because they do not charge tuition.  I understand it was never the committee's intent for this legislation to negatively impact work colleges that use their endowments to provide tuition-free education. In fact, I understand the intended purpose of the excise tax is to encourage colleges to use their endowments to keep college costs down. In this case, Berea College uses its endowments to defray 100 percent of the cost of tuition.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for his willingness to work with me on a solution in conference, either acceding to the Senate position or another mutually accepted solution that exempts work colleges and allows them to continue their unique mission.

424,topic-id,362,"Madam Speaker, I rise today to adamantly dispute this false narrative that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is only intended to benefit the wealthiest Americans and does not benefit the middle class.  When you hear this fiction from the other side of the aisle, remember these facts: this bill lowers tax rates on low- and middle-income It takes the lowest 10 percent bracket to zero. It doubles the standard deduction, meaning hardworking Americans can immediately take home more of their paychecks. Specifically, the first $24,000 of family income will be completely tax free under this plan.  By slashing our noncompetitive corporate tax rate, this bill will result in more jobs and, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, it will deliver average American households a pay raise of at least 2\1/2\ percent.  With this legislation, a typical family of four earning $59,000, the median household income, will receive a $1,182 tax cut.  Madam Speaker, that is not a tax cut for the rich. That is a tax cut for low- and middle-income hardworking Americans, and that is a fact.  This will benefit people like Jared from Frankfort, Kentucky, who told me: ``The extra income from the tax cut will enable us to have some breathing room.''  It will also help constituents who are living paycheck to paycheck, who have told me they would use these tax cuts to save for a rainy day, make car repairs, occasionally go to a restaurant, and invest in higher education for their kids.  I heard from my constituent in Lexington named Gary, who told me: ``It doesn't matter how I plan to use my money. By definition, it is my money to begin with. Trust me to spend it in the way that applies for me.''  Gary, you are absolutely right, it is your money.  Tax relief is not about handouts. It is simply about allowing the American people to keep more of the hard-earned income that they made.  On behalf of all of the hardworking people of central Kentucky, I urge my colleagues to vote for Gary and to vote for all other taxpayers who deserve to keep more of what they earned. Vote ``yes.''

630,topic-id,202,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to oppose the Republican tax plan and to highlight another devastating proposal in it.  The Republican tax plan proposes to eliminate the medical expense deduction. Eliminating this deduction could raise taxes on nearly 9 million people, including cancer patients and their families, seniors, and those with disabilities and chronic health plans.  Currently, people with high healthcare costs can deduct medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of their total income. Let me give you an example.  If you are a retiree living in southern California suffering from multiple sclerosis and you live on $75,000 a year annual pension, you could write off $70,000 a year in medical expenses, giving that person a tax break of about $20,000. Removing the itemized medical deduction would spell financial disaster for that person.  Now, half of those claiming the deduction have an income below $50,000 per year. So just think about how devastating losing this deduction will be.  I can't stand idly by while my Republican colleagues put forth a tax plan that takes money from the sickest and neediest among us in order to give tax cuts to corporations and the top 1 percent of earners.

818,topic-id,2943,"Mr.President, the Senate Finance Committee is working this week on the Tax Cuts and Jobs It is a very important piece of legislation that the country is looking forward to having passed.  This is a Republican plan to give tax relief to the American people. Just as the name of the legislation says, it actually addresses both issues: tax cuts and jobs.  First of all, the legislation will cut the taxes for American workers. One of the biggest cuts in the plan is that it roughly doubles the standard deduction that people take. Right now, the standard deduction for a married couple is about $12,000. If we double it, people will not pay any Federal income taxes at all on the first $24,000 they earn. That is a big tax cut. It is aimed squarely at lower income and middle-income families in this country.  A lot of people will decide to take this deduction instead of going through the painstaking process of itemizing deductions on their income tax returns. It saves people a lot of time. It also saves them the cost of accountants and lawyers who help them figure out the complicated taxes that they end up paying in this country each year.  Republicans are also working to preserve other deductions that are important to American families. When we put all of these together, we are going to cut taxes for people and put money back in their pockets instead of sending it to  The second thing to know about this tax relief legislation is that it is going to be a big boost for jobs in In fact, it will help America create more than 900,000 new jobs.  It is also going to lead to higher pay. That is because the legislation will cut the taxes that small businesses have to pay. Small businesses create most of the jobs in If we let them keep more of their money, they can hire people and grow their businesses. That is what happens in this country. That is how our economy works; people hiring people matter to grow the economy. They can also give workers a raise and offer better benefits. When Washington takes less and businesses keep more, workers are better off every time.  Republicans also want to bring down the rates that Washington charges other businesses. A lot of people work for small businesses, but a lot of people also work for large businesses as well. If we are able to cut taxes for those businesses, then those workers can get the same raise. How much more money are we talking about? Well, according to the Tax Foundation, it amounts to about $2,600 for a typical middle-income family. That is what you get when you combine the tax cut and the pay raise that people will see across the country. For that family, an extra $2,600 is going to be a very big deal. A majority of Americans say that they don't have enough savings today to cover a $500 emergency expense if one came up.  Millions of American families will be far better off because of the tax relief that Republicans are working on this week. It will boost the economy, help individual workers, and help their families. This is about tax cuts, and it is about jobs. That is how you keep the economy growing. That is how we keep American families thriving.                      Protecting Veteran Memorials  Mr.President, I also want to speak about an issue that is very important to our veterans in Wyoming and across the country. The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act conference report includes a provision that allows America's veteran memorials to be used as a political bargaining chip. I think it is a very bad idea.  There is a specific provision in this report that allows the Secretary of Defense to dismantle a veteran memorial and move it to a foreign nation.  We have one of these memorials at the F.Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, This memorial honors American soldiers who were massacred more than 100 years ago in a town called Balangiga in the On September 28, 1901, a group of 400 Filipino insurgents, armed with machetes, attacked American soldiers in Company C of the 9th It was a sneak attack while the Americans were mostly unarmed and having breakfast.  The insurgents signaled the attack by ringing the bells of the local church. Company C had 75 soldiers, and 48 of them were killed in this attack or died of their wounds or went missing in action. It was the worst defeat for the American Army since the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. These bells were used in an act of war against American soldiers.  The Army legally brought the bells back to America to honor the troops of Company C who were lost in this massacre. The 11th Infantry Regiment brought them to Cheyenne, WY, and today the bells of Balangiga are part of the memorial at F.Warren Air Force  Over the years, the Department of Defense and the State Department have tried a few times to move these[[Page S7244]]bells to the In 2012, President Obama's Department of Defense even tried to cover up the fact that it was secretly making plans to move the bells. I have opposed these efforts every step of the way.  The majority of veterans in Wyoming oppose dismantling this veteran memorial. The Wyoming Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion have both passed resolutions against moving the bells. The American Legion has also taken a stand on the national level. It has opposed the removal and encouraged Congress to pass legislation to protect veteran memorials.  During the confirmation hearing for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, I asked him specifically about the bells of He made a commitment to me that he would include Congress and our veteran organizations in any conversations regarding war memorials.  I recently received a letter from the State Department, and they said that they are unaware of any plans to move the bells to a foreign country. We need to make sure that no plans ever develop.  This conference report will take away any lines of communication between the administration and the Congress on this issue. America needs to make clear that we will never stop honoring our war dead, no matter where or when they sacrificed. To dismantle this memorial would be an insult to the memory of the men who were massacred that day in the  Wyoming has a strong tradition of honoring our veterans, especially those who gave their lives. The United States should not be using our veteran memorials as bargaining chips to negotiate with foreign nations. For these reasons, I oppose section 2864 of the conference report on the National Defense Authorization  I will continue my work to protect our veteran memorials. I will continue to use my voice for the soldiers of Company C who have no voice of their own.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the following be printed in the Record: the names of the 48 soldiers who were massacred in 1901; a letter from the Wyoming Veterans of Foreign Wars; a resolution from the Wyoming American Legion in opposition to moving the bells; National American Legion Resolution 56; a letter from the National American Legion in support of Barrasso amendment 738; a letter from the State Department saying that they are currently not planning to move the bells; and Secretary Tillerson's commitment to include Congress and our veterans in any discussion of our veteran memorials  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   U.Army Casualties at Balangiga, Samar, Philippine Islands, 28                              September 1901       Filipino insurgents overran Company C, 9th Infantry, at      Balangiga, Samar, on 28 September 1901.

John Barrasso,     U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Senator Barrasso: On behalf of the 2 million members      of The American Legion,[[Page S7245]]     we express support for Amendment Number 738 proposed for      inclusion in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act      (NDAA), as written. If adopted, this amendment would require      Congressional authorization to move war memorials overseas      and prohibit moving the Bells of Balangiga from F.Warren      Air Force Base in Cheyenne, WY to the Philippines absent such      authorization, The American Legion was proud to support your      amendment to the 2013 NDAA that requires Congressional      authorization to move war memorials overseas. As you know,      that prohibition expires September 30, 2017.       For more than two decades, there have been attempts by      either the Filipino government or other groups to petition      the United States government for the return of the church      bells taken by American military forces from the belfry of      the church in Balangiga, Samar, Philippines in 1901 during      the Philippine American Military monuments honor those      servicemen and servicewomen whose sacrifice for this country      has preserved the nation and recognizes those who have      sacrificed their lives in service to their country. Returning      any military monument should never be considered as      contributing to the enhancement or reaffirmation of any      friendly relationship with foreign countries.       The American Legion Resolution 56, Protection, Preservation      and Retention of Federal and Military Monuments in the United      States, passed at the 2016 National Convention, urges      Congress to establish such laws to preserve, protect and      retain all federal and military monuments within the United      States from any foreign government or religious order who      attempts to have any federal and military monument removed      from the United States of       Again, The American Legion supports Amendment Number 738,      and we thank you for addressing this important issue facing      America's servicemembers and veterans.

We celebrate the proud and distinguished service of      Wyoming's Sons and Daughters to our great nation, and we are      humbled and grateful for the service and sacrifice America's      Veterans have made in support of liberty and freedom at home      and abroad.       We understand and appreciate the importance of war      memorials, and we share your concern that memorials be      properly managed and the service and sacrifice of fallen      Americans and Veterans be recognized and honored      appropriately.       The Department of State is not aware of, nor involved in,      any immediate plans to the remove or dismantle the Veteran's      War Memorial, including the Bells of Balangiga, from F.     Warren Air Force       There is a specific war memorial provision included in the      House version of the FY 18 National Defense Authorization Act      (NDAA), and the House and Senate versions of the NDAA bills      are currently in conference committee. For more information      about that provision or activities on F.Warren Air Force      Base we respectfully refer you to the Department of       We thank you for raising this important issue. We hope this      information is useful. Please do not hesitate to let us know      if we can be of further assistance.

The U.     Department of Defense in coordination with the U.     Department of State intentionally withheld this information      from The veterans in Wyoming overwhelmingly oppose      taking down this veteran memorial.       1. Will you commit to me that you will not support any      efforts to deconstruct our war memorials that honor our      fallen soldiers and moving them to foreign countries?       2. What is your position on the U.Department of State      withholding these actions from Congress?       The Bells of Balangiga are an important war memorial that      holds real significance for many Americans, especially our      veterans. If confirmed, I will support an inclusive process      with the U.Department of Defense to ensure that Congress      is fully informed and the views of local communities and      veterans are fully respected when evaluating the management      of war memorials.

798,topic-id,4226,"Mr.President, all year the majority has tried to ram through legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with proposals that, in effect, cut healthcare for millions of people to finance tax cuts for those who make millions of dollars in income. All year the American people have made it perfectly clear that this was the opposite of what they wanted. Fortunately, those repeal efforts failed.  Now, instead of listening to the American people and learning from that failure, the majority has doubled down on its tax plan. Like healthcare, they have made no attempt to bring both sides together. In the Senate, we only saw the bill last I am on the Finance I have been on there for years. It wasn't even in legislative language on  I remember back in the healthcare debate, 9 years ago, when people were saying: Read the bill. Read the bill. We came to the markup yesterday to offer amendments. There still wasn't a bill. There was not a bill.  Thomas Jefferson used to say--and it didn't happen--that he hoped that when these legislatures were put together in the U.Congress, you would have to introduce a bill and, then, it would take 365 days before it could be enacted into legislation. Maybe that is where the tea party got the idea in 2009. Where are they now? We have not had a single hearing on this bill.  Now they are marking up the most consequential tax policy in 31 years, one affecting every single American and moving around trillions of dollars in this economy.  Remember back during the healthcare debate when it was 16 percent of our economy and people were saying: Read the bill. You had better read this bill. There is not a school board in Colorado that would accept this process. There is not a city council that would accept this process. We have more process for a small decision about where parking meters should go than we have had in this process.  People are upset for good reason. When you rush big things, when you don't listen to different views, you get bad policy. I have heard the majority leader say that on this floor.  There is a reason why they are trying to rush it through. There is a reason why they don't want America to have a chance to read the bill or for their representatives to this Chamber to read the bill. That is because, just like the healthcare proposals they made, the majority's tax plan is fundamentally flawed. Over the course of the campaign, President Trump--then Candidate Trump--promised the American people: ``No cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid.'' That is not fake news. That is what he said.  He said that ``everybody's got to be covered,'' speaking of health insurance.  He said:       Everybody's got to be covered. . . . Everybody's going to      be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.  He promised the public: ``You're going to end up with great healthcare for a fraction of the price.'' That is what he told the American people.[[Page S7232]]  Yesterday, a year after the election, and after 8 years of saying repeal and replace, repeal and replace, repeal and replace, it turned out that, because there was no idea how to replace it--there was no consensus on the Republican side about how to replace it; they failed twice to do it until yesterday--they added changes to a tax bill, literally in the middle of the night, that would cause 13 million people, according to the Congressional Budget Office, to lose health insurance. It would increase premiums by up to 10 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office, on the individual market each year. You can't make it up. It would lead to a $25 billion cut in That is what is happening here while people are distracted by what is going on in the Senate race in  How does this proposal in any way square with the President's promises during the campaign? All year we saw tax cuts masquerading as a healthcare point.  I went home to Colorado and people said: Michael, you work with people in a bipartisan way all the time. Why aren't you working on this healthcare bill? There is no one in Colorado, including the critics of the Affordable Care Act, who said to me: Michael, I have a good idea for helping me with my healthcare: Give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut. Nobody came and said: Let's cut Medicaid by 40 percent when we are facing the opioid crisis that we are facing.  So they masqueraded it as a healthcare plan, and now we have a healthcare plan masquerading as a tax plan. On top of that, this plan doubles down on the claim that tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America and businesses not only trickle down to everyone else but also pay for themselves. That part is not surprising because that has been the Republican answer for what ails our economy.  When our economy was up and our deficit was down, they cut taxes for the top 1 percent of Americans, making an average of $2 million. When our economy was down and our deficit was up, they cut taxes on the top 1 percent, making an average of $2 million. Now, they are embracing exactly the same game plan in their tax plan.  The Senate bill overwhelmingly benefits people and businesses who have done extremely well in this economy. As a former businessperson myself, I have nothing against that success. In fact, I embrace that success. My issue is that trickle-down economics as a theory for economic growth has been entirely discredited by our own experiences. This is not a theoretical exercise anymore. It is not as if these arguments haven't been made time and again and then proven to be false. That leaves me to wonder why this plan or at least the version we debated yesterday--I am not as sure about it today--gives roughly $50,000 in tax cuts to those making over $1 million.  For Americans earning under $200,000, which is 19 million households, they would actually see a tax increase. Another 54 million households would see virtually no benefit at all.  I agree that America needs tax reform. It is not about a political imperative for doing tax reform. America needs tax reform. That is why I joined the Finance Tax reform means we should clean up special interest carve-outs.  I have to stop for a minute and pause on that point. For years, as part of the Gang of 8, as the Simpson-Bowles Commission came through and was crushed, and as there were bipartisan discussions, always what people said was that, on the corporate side, what we are going to do is to lower the rate and broaden the base. That was the plan. The way we were going to do that was by getting rid of a whole bunch of special interest loopholes.  What this bill does is to lower the rate, but it forgets about the second part of the equation. If you look at the broadening of the base, you actually have to take away someone's loophole, and that is hard to do. So instead, what they are doing is lowering the rate and leaving the loopholes where they are--what a disaster. It took 31 years to get tax reform in this Chamber, and that is the answer?  Today, if you don't like the situation, we have the highest published corporate rate in the world. I don't like that because that is uncompetitive for the United States at 35 percent. But one of the things we know about it is that, because of all those loopholes, very few people pay the 35 percent. Some do, and that is very unfair. The average effective rate is more like 23 percent, not 35 percent, and that is because companies can use loopholes. They can move money overseas. If you are a newspaper company or you are a trucking company here, you can't do that. That is why you pay the 35 percent. That is not fair, but this bill does nothing to take on those challenges--nothing.  We need tax reform to get rid of those special interest carve-outs. We should take steps to help our businesses compete, to unlock our energy economy, and to modernize the electric grid. We need comprehensive and bipartisan reform.  This cannot be done. I want to give Republicans the chance to blame Democrats for things they don't like and Democrats to do the same, so we can actually get a result that is real reform, not something crammed through with 51 votes and a healthcare bill on top of it. It has been a terrible thing to see this Senate slide into the place where it is today.  Mr.President, I say to the Presiding Officer, I know enough about you to know that you are not satisfied with the fact that we have been running this government on 30 continuing resolutions for the last 10 years and that we can't pass a proper budget. We don't have an appropriations process anymore in the It is disgraceful. We would not accept it for any other institution of government or business on the planet. Certainly, we wouldn't accept it in  When I was superintendent of schools, if I had told people: Well, we have a little bit of a disagreement; so I am going to shut the government down until we can deal with this continuing resolution, they would have thrown me out. But that is what we have been doing here for the last 10 years.  Now we have sunk to a new low. There has been no attempt to bring the parties together on this--none. The result is a deeply flawed proposal, completely at odds with what our economy needs.  If you accept the logic of the Republican plan, the problem with our economy is that the wealthiest institutions and individuals in the United States don't have enough money to invest and create high-paying jobs for everyone else.  Sometimes I hear people at home say: I don't have anything against rich people--neither do But the logic that somehow, if you give somebody at the top a tax cut, that is going to result in an increase to other people's income is completely contradicted by the facts.  Here is what has happened in America since 1987, over the last 30 years. This is the median family income. This is middle class in America, which basically for 40 years hasn't had a pay raise--has not had a pay raise. This can't be blamed on some Socialist who is named Barack Obama; this is 40 years of American economic history--no pay raise.  Over that period of time, here is what has happened to corporate profits. If the logic were true, if the logic were correct or right, we would see the middle-class income rising more and doing better as corporate income statements and balance sheets hit alltime highs, which they have. Shown here is the great recession. Here is where we are today. Here is where we were before the great recession. Here is median household income--stubbornly flat.  The balance sheets of the biggest companies in this country are awash in cash--awash in cash. It has not led them to help lift this line. The result of this has been a huge widening of the income gap in  If trickle-down economics really worked, every American would do better as incomes at the top rose. Instead, what has happened is that the top 10 percent, which is roughly 11 million people out of a total of 330 million people in America, are earning an average of $475,000. That top 10 percent now represents a larger share of America's wealth than everyone else.  Look at this. Here is the 10 percent. These are the folks who on average are making $475,000. Obviously, many people in here make a lot more than that, but that is the average. They now earn more than the bottom 90 percent of earners in That is not the way this country has been. You have to[[Page S7233]]go back to 1928--the year before the Great Depression--to see that level of income inequality in In between then and now, what we saw was a rise in the middle class, an economy that benefited everybody and lifted up everyone and gave them a chance to save and provide for their families. That is not happening anymore. The top 1 percent are earning about 20 percent of the income.  It seems to me that the challenge with our economy is not that the folks at the very top don't have enough. They have more than they have ever had by a lot. The top 10 percent have over 50 percent of the income in The bottom 90 percent--it seems crazy to even say bottom 90 percent. It is not the bottom 10 percent; it is the rest of America, it is 90 percent of America who earns less. That is the challenge we confront, the challenge that incomes for everyone else haven't kept pace with the rising costs of housing or healthcare or higher education or childcare.  Several months ago, I met a mom in Rifle, CO, at an early childhood center. That is on the West Slope of She and the other moms were so happy that they had this early childhood center because before that, they had to drive 30 miles to Glenwood Springs for childcare. This mom said to me during the course of our conversation: ``I have a job so I can have health insurance, and every single dollar I earn goes to pay for this early childhood center so I can work.''  There are families all over my State who are stuck in that place, where at the end of every month, they have to decide what they are going to go without. They can't afford housing. They can't afford college. They can't afford early childhood education. Their not being able to afford housing is increasingly becoming a huge issue. There are too many Americans who are facing those unbelievably difficult choices.  Those of you who are here might say: Well, just tough it out. That is your issue. Work harder.  These folks are killing themselves. They are killing themselves, but they are having to make choices and decisions because our economy is not working well enough for everybody and not working at all for everybody. They are having to make choices their parents and grandparents never had to make.  Erin Barnes is another one of my constituents. She lives in Thornton, CO, with her husband and two kids. Both Erin and her husband have college degrees and middle-class jobs. They are working. They are educated. Erin works in marketing, and her husband runs an IT department.  Earlier this month, she wrote to my office, describing how they ``don't have luxuries like cable television, haircuts, lattes, manicures, or even new clothes. . . . My children all wear hand-me-downs from friends. And yet, we make $1,200 less per month than we spend. . . . It's not that we're irresponsible: our monthly mortgage payment is only 25 percent of our income. How are the pieces not fitting together?''  As the Presiding Officer knows, in America, consumer spending drives 70 percent of our economy. When costs rise and middle-class families' wages stay flat, families like Erin's cut back, forgoing books for their kids, birthday presents, healthcare. Multiply that across millions of Americans--the 90 percent we are talking about here--and that has a dramatic effect on our economy because they are the folks who drive the 70 percent of our economy that is driven by consumer spending. That is the problem we need to solve. That should be our focus for their sake but also to drive our economy, not folks who have done the best in the economy and who are doing great. I am glad they are doing great.  One way to help families like Erin's is the American Family Act, which I wrote with Senator Sherrod Brown, which triples the tax credit. Under our plan, Erin's family would gain $300 per child each month. Not only does the Republican plan largely ignore families like Erin's, it burdens her children with another $1.5 trillion in debt for the favor of doing nothing for them.  You will hear over and over again the Republicans' claim that their tax cuts pay for themselves. We heard that in the committee today. Anybody who has lived through what has happened since President Clinton was President of the United States knows that is false. It was the logic that was used in 2001, the logic that was used in 2003, and it is what took us from having a $5 trillion projected surplus--you don't hear that word around here very often--when Bill Clinton finished being President to the record deficits we have today.  Let me make sure I have the right chart up here. I do.  In 1981, Ronald Reagan signed major tax cuts and claimed they would pay for themselves. By the end of his term, our national debt had risen 62 percent.  In the 1990s, President Clinton raised taxes at the top and cut spending to balance the budget, and the economy boomed. That was with a Republican Congress, I was reminded today by Chairman Hatch--one of the truly decent people in this place.  By 1999, the U.Senate, believe it or not, actually held hearings on what to do with a $5.6 trillion projected surplus. I am not making this up.  I know that Democrats have a reputation for not caring about fiscal matters and that Republicans have a reputation for taking them seriously. I don't know how that happened, but that is not the history. That is not the history.  When George Bush was elected President, he passed two tax cuts, prosecuted two wars that were not paid for, and signed a $400 billion prescription drug benefit without paying for any of it. Medicare Part D--didn't pay for a dollar of it. The reason that today we collect $1 for every $3 we spend in Medicare is largely because of what was done under President  When President Obama assumed office, from day one, he inherited a $1.2 trillion annual deficit and an economy in free fall. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month, and unemployment was climbing to 10 percent.  Back then--and I was here--during the worst downturn since the Great Depression, Republican leaders all of a sudden remembered their conservative fiscal discipline, just when the American people needed their help the most. It was not when the economy was going well at the beginning of the Bush administration, not when we had a surplus, but when we had a $1.2 trillion deficit caused by the policies of the previous administration and a failure in the housing market. That drove us into the worst recession since the Great  Citing the debt that we had then, which Barack Obama had not put on the balance sheets of the U.Government, every Republican opposed President Obama's economic recovery package to stabilize our economy, and not only that, they called it a Bolshevik takeover of the United States of  Now, after inheriting a booming stock market and 4 percent unemployment, Republicans propose to add $1.5 trillion to our debt to give roughly $50,000 in tax cuts to those making over $1 million in this country--again, to this line, as shown on the chart.  Today, America's debt is over $20 trillion. We could face another economic downturn 4 months from now or 6 months from now or an armed conflict on the Korean The debt suffocates our ability to respond, just as it has suffocated our ability to deal with the opioid epidemic.  When I got here, there was barely an opioid epidemic in America, and over the last decade, it has flooded our country. But if you live in a rural part of my State, if you live in the San Luis Valley in Colorado, your access to addiction treatment is the same as it was 10 years ago because we are broke, because we can't work in a bipartisan way to deal with these issues. It is disgraceful, just as it was disgraceful to cut taxes in 2003 just after we sent our troops into That was maybe the height of disgraceful.  When we know there may be something imminent on the Korean Peninsula, when we know the Middle East is in the turmoil it is in, is this really the moment we want to do this?  I will say this on this floor: If my colleagues vote for this plan, they forfeit any right to claim they are fiscal conservatives. And I am sad to say this--I really am; I think my colleague from Colorado would know I am telling the truth when I say I am sad to say this--but I have learned over the past 9 years that the only time the majority seems to care about fiscal responsibility is when they are not actually responsible[[Page S7234]]for it. In a sense, it is a devastatingly brilliant political strategy. You come to Washington arguing that the government is incompetent, then you explode the debt, then you point to the debt as evidence of Washington's incompetence. And here is how it all ended in 2016: You elect a President who promised that he would eliminate our debt ``over a period of 8 years,'' that he would deliver ``a giant, beautiful, massive'' tax cut, pass ``one of the largest increases in defense spending in American history,'' while saying, ``I'm not going to cut Social Security . . . and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.'' Why not, he told the American people, since our national debt can be solved by ``eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government, ending redundant government programs, growing the economy,'' and ``renegotiating all of our deals.''  Here is the real problem. And I realize my colleagues are here. I am going to take a few more minutes, if that is  Last year, two-thirds of the Federal budget went to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and other mandatory spending. Of the remaining third, half goes to national defense. After interest on the debt, that leaves just 10 percent for all of our investments in the future--in our future and our children's future--in infrastructure, research, innovation, and education.  Over the years, because of the insanity around this place, Washington has slashed that part of the budget--which is called the domestic discretionary part of the budget--by 35 percent as a percentage of We have been really good at hacking on the stuff that is easy to get to.  This should all seem deeply unfair to Americans in their twenties and younger to know that we are investing--simultaneously, we are investing less in them than our parents and grandparents invested in us, and then we have the nerve to say you need to pay back the debt we accrued; we are not going to pay it back. We are not going to invest in you, and we are going to make you pay it back. We are going to live in the house, but you are going to be stuck with the mortgage.  When I served as the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, we had to make hard choices to close schools, to modernize curriculums, and to fix unfunded pensions. We had intense fights. Like here, people had strong and principled disagreements, but unlike here--unlike in Washington--in Denver, the next generation was cause enough for us to set aside our differences and move forward. We understood that our children had no voice in our townhalls. Their future had no votes at the school board meetings. They only had us to do it for them.  We have forgotten that here in Washington, in these marbled halls and on the carpeted floors of the Senate and the We have abdicated our duty completely to the next generation. Instead, we impose on them all the hard questions we fail to answer in our time.  We are burdening the future with our debts. We are burdening them with the hard choices we avoid, with the easy path we follow, with the baseless claims we accept that tax cuts for folks who are doing great somehow trickle down and pay for themselves. That is false.  If this plan passes, Washington will once again encroach on the rights of our children and our grandchildren to enjoy the same freedom and opportunity our parents and grandparents handed us. What a shameful legacy that would be. What a surrender of our responsibility as  We have to set aside this flawed proposal and this broken process and instead have an honest, bipartisan effort that contends forthrightly with the substantive challenges of our fiscal condition and the political difficulties attendant to solving them. I may be wrong, but I suspect what history will prove is, no meaningful solution can be found by one party alone.

1138,topic-id,643,"Mr.Speaker, after spending a bizarre week in the Ways and Means Committee with a moving target of the Republican tax plan, we find out, amazingly, that it is actually getting worse and worse.  We have just discovered that the Senate is going to repeal the individual healthcare mandate to to provide funding for more tax cuts for America's wealthy.  The cost of that?  There will be 13 million additional uninsured Americans, and everybody in the individual market will see their premiums increase another 10 percent next year and every year therefafter.  Well, tomorrow, Trump is going to come to Capitol Hill to hold a rally[[Page H9258]]with Republican Members to try to make some of these nervous people feel a little more comfortable. No wonder Donald Trump is eager to see this bill pass. It is designed for Donald  First, he is the self-proclaimed king of debt. Well, you got it in spades with this bill because the Republicans have raised the debt ceiling $1.5 trillion to finance these tax cuts for people who, frankly, don't need them. Because you have to pay interest on that, it is a $2.3 trillion additional burden on our children and grandchildren.  It eliminates the alternative minimum tax. Even though Trump refused to honor his commitment to release his tax returns, one was leaked to David Cay Johnston, and it showed the only reason he paid substantial taxes in 2005 was because of the alternative minimum tax. Getting rid of that would save him $31 million in one year.  There is a special break for passthrough entities. It is, theoretically, for small businesses, but many of the passthrough entities are not small businesses. They include hedge funds. Donald Trump's disclosure form lists hundreds of passthrough entities. That is how he does business.  Of course, the biggest and most outrageous loophole is to completely eliminate the inheritance tax over the next 10 years. This will save a couple thousand people, extraordinarily wealthy people, $172 billion that would otherwise come to the government to be able to fund programs for our veterans, deal with the opioid crisis.  Donald Trump will be able to pass off hundreds of millions, maybe a billion or two, tax free. Remember, most of that money had never been taxed in the first place. You don't become a billionaire on W-2 income. It is all appreciated, untaxed capital.  Well, it also shatters a bipartisan agreement for alternative energy. Donald Trump is doubling down on energy of the past, trying to breathe life into a failing coal industry. Their bill would break a bipartisan agreement for wind energy, which we carefully negotiated on a bipartisan basis, and the industry has gone ahead and pledged billions of dollars.  Eliminating that agreement, the only retroactive provision in the bill, puts at jeopardy billions of dollars of investment and tens of thousands of jobs. Score one for Donald  But the worst element of this bill, I think--and there is a lot to choose from--is its Alzheimer's tax. It would deny the medical exemption to over 9 million middle class families to be able to deduct extraordinary medical expenses.  Think of a family that is trying to cope with the challenges of a loved one with Alzheimer's. This costs them tens of thousands of dollars, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars in a year. It takes away the tax deduction from them.  This is an outrage.

1244,topic-id,485,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in yielding me this time.  I have enjoyed listening to the debate back and forth. There is no area in Congress that I have spent more time on, over the course of the last 20 years, than dealing with flood insurance. I was the author of the last major piece with our former colleague, Doug I agree with much of what was said on both sides.  There are remaining significant problems. Insurance is not priced properly. It is not that it is too expensive or it is too cheap, it is not priced properly. We have some winners and losers now, but too many people are subsidized by the majority.  We are not doing all that we can. The Federal Government ends up holding the bag for billions of dollars for unnecessary flood damage with storm after storm after storm; and, by the way, there are more on the way.  It doesn't have to be this way. Part of the problem is that because, inevitably, when we talk about reform, it costs money, and there are some people who end up paying more. It is easy not to update the maps. It is easy not to have people pay actuarial rates. It is easy not to force local governments to do their job and not allow building in harm's way.  I strongly agree that, in times past, low-income and minority people were subjected to real problems and more flooding than they should have been.

828,topic-id,1429,"Mr.President, we are at a critical juncture in our investigation into Russia's interference in last year's election and potential collusion by Americans with Russia's meddling and obstruction of justice that may have occurred. Those issues are under investigation by the Judiciary Committee, which has a unique responsibility because we exercise oversight concerning the Department of Justice and the So the firing of James Comey, among other actions that raised issues regarding potential collusion and obstruction of justice, is very much appropriate and necessary for our inquiry to determine.  We also have a unique responsibility because only the Judiciary Committee can make public for the American people to know and understand what happened that may involve obstruction of justice and, equally important, what can be done to prevent it in the future. The Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate can legislate.  There are other investigations ongoing involving the special counsel, who will determine criminal culpability, and the Intelligence Committees of both the House and the Senate, which have a counterterrorism responsibility, but they rarely legislate in the way that the Judiciary Committee does.  I am proud to serve on the Judiciary I greatly respect the leadership of our committee: Chairman Grassley, who is a straight shooter, cares deeply about the integrity of our judicial process, and has a longstanding and distinguished record of protecting whistleblowers; and our ranking member, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who has been a steadfast champion of judicial integrity.  Every week we are seeing cascading disclosures that reflect potential collusion or cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. These disclosures reflect on the obstruction of justice that is front and center of the Judiciary Committee's investigation.  Just this week, through a stunning expose in The Atlantic, later confirmed by Donald Trump, Jr., himself, the American people learned of secret exchanges between WikiLeaks and Donald Trump, Jr., during the 2016 Presidential campaign. The exchanges began in September 2016--2 months before the election. Over the course of those exchanges, WikiLeaks sent literally dozens of messages to Trump Junior, who sent back at least three messages. He acted at WikiLeaks' behest at least one time, tweeting out a link to the hacked emails of John Podesta, Jr., at WikiLeaks' suggestion. He told other high-ranking officials on the Trump campaign that WikiLeaks had reached out to him in an extraordinarily revealing message. At no point did he rebuff the advances--in fact, just the opposite. At no point did he reject those overtures from And what we are seeing, particularly in the familiar tone, almost intimate nature of these exchanges back and forth, is the possibility that what we have discovered is just the tip of the iceberg in those exchanges.  These revelations are stunning. They are jaw-dropping. The son of the President of the United States--then candidate--actively engaged and may have coordinated strategy with a group that the current CIA Director has called a ``hostile intelligence service.'' The present Director of the CIA, appointed by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, characterized WikiLeaks as a ``hostile intelligence service''--and that is a direct quote--and then observed that it is often abetted by hostile Nation states like  Without subpoenaing Donald Trump, Jr., to testify in public, we cannot be sure we have the full record.  One of the most stunning aspects of this exchange, indeed, was its very personal tone. Many who read the coverage may sense and feel, understandably and rightly, that we are reading fragments of a longer and larger conversation that may have involved other participants or relied on other means of communication. We are inevitably and inexorably left with some very key questions:  How did Donald Trump, Jr., know of WikiLeaks' plan to leak Podesta's emails before they were even released?  Why did WikiLeaks feel confident it could inform Trump Junior that they had hacked Podesta's emails without worrying that he would turn this information over to law enforcement? Hacking is a crime. How could WikiLeaks be in the least bit confident that Donald Trump, Jr., would not report that crime to the proper authorities? And he did not.  Perhaps most crucially, why would Trump Junior see an invitation from WikiLeaks to coordinate efforts as anything other than inappropriate, unethical, and a potentially illegal act?  Given the stakes, my expectation was--and the American people could likewise expect the same--that our committee would act quickly and transparently to answer those questions raised by these messages as well as the interview conducted by our committee staff of Donald Trump, That is what I was expecting when these messages were first provided to the Judiciary Committee roughly 2 months ago. My expectation was that Donald Trump, Jr., would be compelled to testify and that he would be subpoenaed to provide a full record of his communications relating to Russia's interference in our elections. Surely those subpoenas that were discussed, even issued over the summer, would now be reissued and enforced.  The lack of action has been frustrating to me. Likewise, I have been disappointed that we have made virtually no progress toward scheduling a public hearing with Donald Trump, Jr., and other key individuals involved in this investigation. The subpoenas have not been reissued. I have called repeatedly for that action to be taken. The documents have not been subpoenaed. Those key documents that are so relevant and necessary to our investigation have not been subpoenaed, as I have asked to be done repeatedly.  That is why I am here today to raise concerns about the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation into Russia's interference in our election, possible collusion by the Trump campaign, and obstruction of justice.  The threat is that the investigation is stalling. The danger of lack of progress is depriving the American people of information they deserve. I recognize that congressional investigations must operate methodically, systematically, and in some cases confidentially until the committee is ready to release its findings. But that confidentiality can serve an important purpose if it aids an investigation--not if it engenders the kind of lack of trust that is clearly a possibility here, not if it engenders that lack of trust, not if it endangers confidence and trust in the process. There may be a need for confidentiality to encourage cooperation of witnesses, but ultimately the American people deserve disclosure.  There is a need for impetus and urgency in this investigation. The American people must be made aware of key facts and issues raised by these documents and the interviews conducted so far. My hope is that colleagues will join me in asking for more progress, more disclosure, and more transparency, because the American people need and deserve that kind of disclosure.  Without the exposure provided by a free and independent press, justice delayed could have extended into justice denied. That is the danger. Secrecy threatens to stall the investigation, and my hope is that we will have the kind of transparency in greater measure that is necessary for trust and confidence in this investigation.  I hope my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee will join me in demanding that Donald Trump, Jr., and other key figures in the investigation testify under subpoena, in public,[[Page S7252]]under oath, and that documents be subpoenaed as well. The Senate Judiciary Committee has a particularly critical role in exposing the truth. Even if criminal charges are never brought, the American people have a right to know whether their public officials have held themselves to the standard of honesty, loyalty, and integrity that they have a right to expect. This body is in the best position to provide that measure of truth--hopefully the whole truth--to the American people.  There are many Members whose leadership on this issue I appreciate. As I mentioned, Senator Feinstein is sending a second tranche of letters this afternoon on this investigation. But we are allowing time to pass without progress. That opportunity, once lost, cannot be recovered with the measure of importance that it deserves. We must issue subpoenas. We must hold public hearings. We must get to the truth, and it must be done now.  Thank you.  I will refer these remarks to my colleagues with great respect for them and for the leadership of this committee. And I will come back to the floor. I will return to this subject because I think it is so critically important. The American people deserve more information, and they deserve better.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Lee). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

535,topic-id,935,"Mr.President, it is good for both of us and our colleagues to be thinking this month about National Adoption Month, to recognize the celebration of National Adoption Day, which will occur this I have had the great privilege of serving as cochair of the Coalition on Adoption with Senator Klobuchar from It is an opportunity not only for us to work together in a bipartisan way, but at an event we attended just the other[[Page S7193]]day, I was told the adoption caucus in the House and Senate is the biggest caucus of either body and the biggest caucus of the Of course, it should be. It is built on the idea that kids have the need of a family and that there are families out there who want to adopt kids. Whether that is nationally, domestically, or internationally, we really work hard to try to make that more possible.  Our House cochairs have been great to work with. Senator Klobuchar and I are working on several pieces of legislation right now to make it easier for families to adopt and to make sure adopted families have the support they need to stay strong.  One piece of legislation we are working on is the Adoption Tax Credit Refundability It is a little bit outside the norm of the discussion of simplifying the Tax Code, but I was pleased the other day to have some important evidence put on the table when the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee--who, by the way, is an adoptive father of two sons and an advocate for adoption and for kids--when the current adoption tax credit was not in the House bill, he said one of the reasons it is not here is so many families who adopt kids don't pay income tax because of the low level of their income. My thought was, well, that is exactly what Senator Klobuchar and I were saying. That should be a refundable credit as well as a credit, but I am glad to see the current credit back in the tax bill that the Finance Committee is looking at now. We want to continue to look at not only the current credit but expanding that.  According to the Department of Health and Human Services, one-third of all adopted children live in families with an annual household income at or below 200 percent of the poverty level. It is because of that the tax burden is low. They don't pay income taxes. The adoption tax credit isn't as helpful to those families as it is to families who actually have income tax to credit it against.  More than 400,000 children now in the United States are also in the foster care system, and more than 100,000 of those 400,000 kids are ready and waiting for families they can call their own. Lots of other children need to be in families all over the world, but we can be looking carefully at the children in our system now. We both looked--and others have joined us in that--at the foster care system and ensuring behavioral health screening happens within 30 days of getting into that system. Once you get into the foster care system, often it is because of unavoidable challenges families face, and often it is because of challenges kids should never have to face. So that early evaluation of what is going on there can really make a difference in how foster kids are dealt with in the system and how they get ready--as 100,000 of them now are--to leave the foster care system and be adopted.  Before I turn to Senator Klobuchar, I just want to mention some kids right now who are on what is called the Missouri Heart More than 1,200 Missouri children are in need of permanent homes. The Missouri Heart Gallery is a place to look, as we approach the end of this year, to see what the stories of some of these kids are.  Brandon, for instance, who is 12, loves to play games. LEGO sets are his favorite toy. He likes to smile and give hugs. He probably hasn't gotten enough hugs in his life up until now, but it is possible to try your best to catch up with kids who need hugs. He needs a stable and loving family. He is often playing outside. It would be wonderful if he were playing outside a house or a home that he knew was a permanent home for him.  Shaniah and Shanae are sisters who hope to be placed together, and they hope to have a chance to maintain contact with their aunt following placement. Shaniah loves dancing and cheerleading. Her favorite color is green. She hopes to be a scientist one day. Shanae's favorite hobby is singing, and she makes friends really easily between her dancing and singing skills that she shares with her sister. Both of these girls would really bring a lot of life and vitality into what we would hope would be their family forever.  Brandon, Shaniah, and Shanae are in need of permanent and loving homes. This is a time when we ought to be thinking not only about the obstacles to adoption, the things that encourage adoption but also how we can make the support system for both adoption and foster care and adoption out of foster care work better.  I know my colleagues will be eager to join Senator Klobuchar and me in marking November as National Adoption Month and by passing our resolution today.

799,topic-id,881,"Mr.President, for 8 years, working families have seen their wages stay pretty much exactly where they were and, in some cases, they have seen their wages go down and their income go down.  I will say again that the goal of this tax proposal should be to immediately do what we can to see an increase in take-home pay for those families and to do everything we can in the Tax Code to make us more competitive, to see that they have better jobs to start with and more competition for the good work they do.  Our Tax Code clearly is broken. It is taking money out of the pockets of hard-working families and standing in the way of stronger economic growth, and we can and should and must do something about that. That is why the Senate is moving toward the passage of a bill that will address that Tax Code from both ends--more take-home pay now, better jobs with more pay to start with, and more take-home pay later.  According to the Tax Foundation, under the Senate's proposal, middle-income families in Missouri will see an estimated increase of about $2,400 in their aftertax income. When we consider the fact that nearly 6 in 10 Americans say they don't have enough savings to cover a $500 emergency or a $1,000 emergency, $200 a month really matters. There may be people talking about how the Tax Code doesn't do enough of this and enough of that, and at the higher end we should do more or we should do less, but no family who is working hard every day in the middle range of income in our country doesn't think that $200 a month makes a difference to them. At another level--at the $50,000 level--I think for that family, it is about $1,100 a year, so $100 a month makes a difference as well.  This proposal would make our Tax Code simpler and easier to understand by just simply cutting out all of the deductions that only a few people are able to take advantage of so everybody looks at the Tax Code and has more reason to believe that everybody is not only going to be treated fairly, but everybody is being treated the same.  There are deductions in this bill we should keep where they are. There are deductions like the child tax credit that we should increase. In fact, the Senate proposal that that committee will start, with the opportunity to amend further tomorrow--the Senate proposal doubles the child tax credit to $2,000 per child.  Senator Klobuchar, my friend from Minnesota and the cochairman of the adoption caucus, and I were on the floor yesterday, pleased to be talking about tax credits, and certainly I am pleased to see that the adoption tax credit continues to be in this bill.  The new mark also reduces individual rates. The current rate of 22.5 goes lower. The 25-percent rate goes to 24 percent, and the 32.5 goes to 32 percent. What does that mean? That is all very complicated, but what people know, or at least their accountant knows, is that everybody sort of pays the same percentage on the first amount of income and then they pay a little higher percentage if they make it into the second bracket and a little higher if they make it into the third bracket. When all of those percentages go down, the total tax benefit for taxpayers is impacted by that.  There are direct benefits in this bill but also benefits that continue to encourage small business. The estimation for small business is that 97 percent of all business in Missouri are small businesses, and the average tax cut for those businesses would be about $3,000 a year. These small businesses are the engines that drive the economy. They are the engines that drive growth. This bill understands that.  This bill understands working families who haven't had a break in their paycheck in 8 years now, and it is time for them to be able to take home more of the money they earn.  It is also time for us to do everything we can to see that they are going to have more competition for the good work they do in the future. More competition and more ability to compete with other countries and other companies mean better jobs. That is what this is about. It is a tax bill about families and jobs.  I look forward to everyone in the Senate having a chance to amend the bill on the floor and to watch what I think has been a significant improvement in the bill as the Finance Committee has had a chance to look at it. They will have a chance to amend it.[[Page S7235]]Then we have a chance--those of us not on that committee--to look at what they have done and see what we can do to make it even better before we go to conference with the House and put a bill on the President's desk. We will do that. I am confident we will be successful here, and successful this year, in a way that matters to working families.  I see my colleague from Colorado is here.  I yield the floor.

959,topic-id,185,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this disastrous partisan tax plan that cuts rates for wealthy corporations and millionaires while leading to higher taxes for about 38 million working families.  There is a lot to not like about this bill. It actually eliminates the student loan interest deduction. That will increase the financial burden for about 12 million Americans who are juggling their student loan debt with housing, groceries, and childcare. The cost of higher education is already out of reach for too many. We should be making it easier, not harder for Americans to access higher education.  On top of that, removing the State and local tax deduction threatens funding sources for public education and will most certainly lead to cuts to America's public school budgets.  Mr.Speaker, across the country, families are working hard to get ahead. Let's not take away their opportunity. We need a Tax Code that leads to better jobs, better wages, and a better future for America, for our children and our grandchildren. This bill fails the test, and we should reject it and get back to working together.

I commend Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and I would also like to thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.Wilson), the Readiness Subcommittee chairman, and the committee staff who worked many, many long nights on this bill.

This is a very important step to support the recovery of readiness in areas that have been adversely impacted by high operational tempos and made worse by numerous continuing resolutions and the effects of sequestration. However, Congress must go further and provide the Department with budget stability by repealing sequestration so that we can continue to support the training, the maintenance, and the modernization needs of our forces.

Any changes to the Internal Revenue Code are automatically mirrored and adopted as changes to Guam's local tax structure.

243,topic-id,396,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to lend my support to the flood insurance reform legislation that we considered on this floor yesterday and passed.  Let me tell you the reasons and the importance of that particular legislation. One is, the problems that it deals with is FEMA's flood plain maps can be inaccurate and are based on old technology. Property owners in the insurance flood plain plans are required to pay flood insurance premiums, even though they may not be at risk under the old maps whenever you look at it.  For example, today I brought a map from my district--one of the places in my district where these maps are wrong. This is actually Carterville, If you will notice, as the flood plain comes down here from the north, actually, that is really unique because, if you will notice right beside it, out of the flood plain is the creek that actually flows and the ditch that is the creek, and the flood plain is not in that. Yet it is over in the other area here, where it affects homes that are actually charged larger amounts of money on their flood insurance when they are not even in the flood plain. Yet it never even continues to flow on down to Crab Orchard Lake, where the natural water flow goes. So those areas are out of the flood plain, according to this mapping.  The flood zone maps--here is the problem: property owners can challenge the map under existing law, before we sent this over, and you can challenge it, but it would cost you $2,000 to challenge that. Or if you wanted to participate with your city, the city taxes would then be charged $17,000 to challenge the map.  Flood insurance is vitally important and necessary to the people around this Nation and the security that it gives to others that are not in flood plains for not having a cost dropped on them. But the accuracy of these maps are vitally important.  Two things the legislation did that were vitally important, it is easier and more affordable to appeal FEMA about their maps and whether or not something is in a flood plain. It also uses its higher technology to truly draft the flood plain maps in a way that they are fair, and that the costs are not unbearable to many homeowners.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9258.txt,2243,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2874, 21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM",2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

826,topic-id,2407,"Mr.President, I rise to speak in opposition to the nomination of Joseph Otting to be Comptroller of the  I appreciate Mr.Otting's willingness to enter public service. That said, he is not the person we need in this very important financial watchdog roll. We have learned lessons from the quality, the attitude, and the work of the person in this office, and I am virtually sure he is not the right person. We have made a lot of progress in the last 7 years since we passed Wall Street reform. The last thing we need is someone leading the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency working to weaken or eliminate important safeguards, instead of looking out for workers, borrowers, and the stability of our financial system.  The financial watchdogs, including the previous Comptroller, Thomas Curry, took significant steps to right the wrongs that led to the 2008 financial crisis. It is important that we not have this collective amnesia that seems to permeate this body about what happened to this country 10 years ago. Working together, Comptroller Curry and other financial watchdogs strengthened rules for the largest banks. Independently, the OCC enhanced the supervision and examination of these banks, took enforcement actions against bad actors, and took steps to address concerns that the agency had been captured by the industry. There was clear evidence of that by previous people in this job.  This administration is putting the banking industry back in charge of policing itself. We should have learned from that a decade ago. Mr.Otting is yet another bank executive who profited from the financial crisis and is being rewarded by the Trump administration with a powerful job overseeing our Nation's banking system. This is a man who worked at OneWest and made a fortune kicking military servicemembers, seniors, and working families out of their homes, all while pocketing $2.5 billion--that is billion with a ``b''--from the FDIC to protect his bank from any losses.  The bank, OneWest, in this behavior, in this money from FDIC, in this action of kicking military servicemembers and seniors and working families out of their homes--this all might sound familiar to my colleagues; it certainly sounds familiar to the people in the Finance Committee and the Banking It is the same place that Mr.Mnuchin--now-Secretary of the Treasury--worked, doing the same kinds of things and work that Mnuchin did.  Mr.Otting and his former boss, Secretary Mnuchin, refused to provide Senators State-by-State data on OneWest's foreclosures on seniors, servicemembers, and other borrowers. They refused to answer questions about OneWest loan modifications. I think Ohioans--and I hope enough of my colleagues to constitute a majority--would like to know what they are hiding.  It was pretty amazing to sit in the Finance Committee and listen to Secretary Mnuchin and watch Secretary Mnuchin--then-Secretary-Designee Mnuchin--refuse to release information, refuse to disclose information. In fact, he had forgotten about a $100 million investment he had when he testified in front of the committee. We found out later that he had this investment that he forgot to disclose; $100 million is a lot of money. Even to Secretary Mnuchin I think that is a lot of money. Even to this administration, that is a lot of money.  What we do know, thanks to important work by our independent press, is not pretty. What we do know about what OneWest did is not pretty. In January, the Columbus Dispatch--the most conservative newspaper in my State, the second largest paper in our State--ran a front-page story on that bank's abuses. Their investigative journalism found that OneWest used so-called robosignings on mortgage documents. According to the Dispatch, in its fine investigative work, under Mr.Otting's watch from 2009 to 2015, nearly 2,000 Ohioans in our six largest counties were foreclosed on by The abuses were so bad that Mr.Otting signed an OCC consent order--a legal agreement that a bank and its regulator enter into when illegal practices at the bank force the government to step in.  If you are signing an OCC consent order, it is a pretty serious problem. In any other administration, this would[[Page S7249]]have been disqualifying. In any other administration, Mr.Otting--or for that matter, Mr.Mnuchin, who was engaged in the same kind of practices--would have withdrawn their name. In any other administration, if the nominee didn't withdraw their name, the administration would have told them to withdraw their name, but not in this White Frankly, when you walk into this White House, it looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives and people like OneWest executives and people who foreclosed on home after home and, frankly, have almost no contrition and paid almost nothing, suffered almost no consequences for their action.  The consent order documented OneWest's breathtaking list of foreclosure abuses, gouging borrowers with excessive fees and unfairly evicting servicemembers on Active Think about that. They not only evicted servicemembers, they evicted servicemembers on Active In some cases, I assume the wife was serving overseas and the husband was evicted because he couldn't make the payments, partly because his wife is paid so little as a member of the Armed  Mr.Otting was held accountable for one of the major abuses, robosigning, by the bank's regulator in 2014. But during his Senate Banking Committee confirmation hearing, he continued to deny wrongdoing, even when faced with a legal document proving otherwise.  One of the things that amazes the American public is that nobody went to jail for what they caused in the last decade, what they caused in 2007, 2008, and 2009--the pain and the hardship, the pain of plant closings and lost jobs, the hardship of losing your home, the terrible consequences of losing much of your retirement savings. The people who caused this suffered almost no consequence. The American public, first of all, can't believe none of them went to jail. Maybe they are not so surprised anymore that there is no contrition. Then, we reward these people by making them Secretary of the Treasury or Comptroller of the  Mr.Otting was held accountable. In all of these legal proceedings--and I am not a lawyer so maybe I don't exactly understand this, but these people signed some document, but they never really admitted they did anything wrong. Mr.Otting followed that process. Even though we had this documentation, he continued to deny wrongdoing, even when we presented him with that legal document.  Instead of helping families recover from the financial crisis as CEO of Secretary Mnuchin's--not Secretary then--OneWest Bank, Mr.Otting contributed to devastation. So this administration has chosen him to be in charge of one of the key agencies protecting ordinary Americans from Wall I will say that again. He was a big part of the problem, as CEO of OneWest He has committed wrongdoing; we presented him with a legal document proving that. Yet the administration chooses him to be Comptroller of the  It is a job most of America doesn't know much about. I didn't either until I came here. I acknowledge that. It is a job that most Americans don't think much about. It is a job that most Americans don't think has a great impact in their lives, but Americans know what happened 10 years ago. I live in ZIP Code 44105, Cleveland, My ZIP Code in 2007 had more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in the United States of I can't leave my house, if I go more than about 300 yards, without seeing the devastation caused by people like Mr.Otting--people who lost their homes, people who lost their jobs, people who have suffered and lost their life savings because of Wall Street malfeasance, because of companies like I am guessing that Mr.Otting doesn't think about this, and I am guessing that most people here don't think about this.  Pope Francis, soon after assuming the Papacy, admonished parish priests to go out and smell like the flock. It wouldn't hurt all of us to do that a little more around here, to talk to somebody who has lost a job. It typically happened, in my neighborhood near Slavic Village, Cleveland, OH, where the spouse lost her job, and then the husband's plant closed, and then they couldn't keep up with the payments. Then they had to tell their teenage daughter: Honey, we are going to lose our home. First, they had to give away their family dog, probably, because owning a dog costs money, and they were squeezed. They knew they were in trouble. Then they had to explain to their daughter that she is going to go to a different school district--and all the things of life have turned upside down. Your life turns upside down if you are foreclosed on or if you are evicted.  I am guessing Mr.Otting doesn't think a lot about that. I am guessing Secretary Mnuchin doesn't think a lot about that, as he travels on private planes and his wife brags about her expensive clothes. I am guessing very few in this White House think about that, but maybe they should. If he is confirmed--and I assume he will be because the Republicans in this body generally do whatever Wall Street and whatever companies like OneWest want them to do in confirming nominees like Mr.Otting, but I wish Mr.Otting would think about a little bit more about the devastation to which he contributed.  Right now at the OCC, Keith Noreika--previously, a big bank lawyer--has spent his time rolling back rules to protect Americans from predatory payday lenders. He has worked against a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that would have allowed customers to take their banks to court when they were cheated.  Mr.Noreika has done all this as Acting He wasn't confirmed by this body. Get this: His temporary role as a special government employee means he doesn't have to live up to the same ethics or conflicts of interest rules as everyone else. He takes this job as Acting Comptroller while we wait for Mr.Otting; he takes this job as Acting Comptroller, and he does the bidding of all of these financial service interest groups, all of the payday lenders, and all of the people who are preying on working families and preying on low-income people. He leaves and joins some of these companies, and he is very amply rewarded, and he doesn't have to live under any ethics rules.  The people who run watchdog agencies are supposed to be independent voices who protect workers in the economy from financial crisis, not banking industry lapdogs who help their former boardroom buddies on Wall If his record is any guide, certainly Mr.Noreika didn't serve the public. He served as a lapdog. He served the banking industry. If his records are any guide, I am concerned that Mr.Otting will be no different, that the OCC's independence will be compromised under his leadership. He worked side by side with Secretary Mnuchin at OneWest Mr.Mnuchin hand-picked Mr.Otting for this job.  We are already seeing signs of Wall Street influence at some of the agencies, consistent with Secretary Mnuchin's agenda. They have pulled back on Wall Street reforms. They have attacked other agencies for doing their jobs.  For wealthy bank executives and private investors like Mr.Otting, the crisis wasn't a life-changing event. Think about that. The crisis for Mr.Otting wasn't a life-changing event, but those people who live in ZIP Code 441, in Slavic Village in Cleveland, for those people whose homes I drive by every day, people who lost jobs because of the financial crisis, people who lost homes because of the financial crisis, people who lost their life savings because of the financial crisis, those weren't just life-changing; those were life-destroying kinds of events. Yet Mr.Otting and Mr.Mnuchin go forward, and they pocket their tens of millions of dollars, and then they are appointed by the President of the United States to watch over these financial watchdogs.  They saw the crisis. The crisis was life-changing to my neighbors. They saw a crisis as an opportunity to profit by flipping failing banks bought at rock-bottom prices, but not before foreclosing, as the Columbus Dispatch said, all while raking in taxpayer dollars.  If confirmed, Mr.Otting will be in charge of ensuring that all national banks, including Wells Fargo--we certainly heard about Wells Fargo's abuse of millions of its customers. His job will be to ensure that all national banks, including banks like Wells Fargo, are complying with the law, that they operate in a safe and sound[[Page S7250]]manner, and that they protect customers.  To be real, do we think we can trust him to do that after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the financial crisis that devastated Ohio, Colorado, and Massachusetts families? After people lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings, Mr.Otting clearly isn't the right person for this job.  Yesterday, the Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Marty Gruenberg, said:       I confess to having a certain sense of deja vu. Banking      conditions today are strong and the possibility of a serious      downturn anytime soon is generally viewed as remote. That was      certainly true during the pre-crisis years as well. If I have      one key point to make today, it is that we should guard      against the temptation to become complacent about the risks      facing the financial system.  I would comment on Mr.Gruenberg's comments that 11 years ago or so--10, 11, 12 years ago--it didn't seem all that likely to many, at least to those in the Bush administration, that there would be an implosion of the economy and an implosion of the banking system, a crisis; that there was, in fact, the new head of supervision at the Federal Reserve who pretty much said, as late as 2007: We really shouldn't be concerned about a housing crisis. It is only going to hit the higher, upper end of homeowners, and it will not affect the economy. Those are the people this President has put in charge to be the watchdogs of our financial system.  Again, Mr.Gruenberg said: If I have one key point, it is this. We should guard against the temptation to become complacent about the risks facing our financial system.  We need to take Chair Gruenberg's warning seriously. Confirming a banker to the OCC--a banker who will give Wall Street its wish list--is a high price for working families to pay who are still feeling the impact of the last financial crisis.

Madam Speaker, as my colleagues in this body know very well, it has been many years since we have reformed our Tax Over the last few decades, Congress has cut some taxes here and there, but we are overdue for meaningful tax reform.  Hardworking taxpayers in North Carolina are right to ask why it has been so long since we have even reformed our Tax The unfortunate truth is that, for many years, Congress has thrown up the white flag in defeat against K Street lobbyists, and they settled for preserving the status quo. However, tomorrow, we have a rare opportunity to finally deliver a tax bill that puts working families first. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would be the biggest overhaul to our Tax Code in 30 years.  To quickly summarize, this bill would collapse our tax brackets from seven to four; it would double the standard deduction and get rid of many lobbyist loopholes; and it would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, which would allow America to compete and to win.  The nonpartisan Tax Foundation found that, if we passed this bill into law, American workers would see a 3 percent increase in their wages, and our country would see nearly 1 million full-time jobs created  Madam Speaker, yesterday, my office received a letter from a constituent of mine that said: ``As a manufacturer and constituent, I urge you to support tax reform and legislation that will fix our Tax Code that has held manufacturers back for far too long.'' This is just an example of the many letters I have received in favor of this reform effort.  In addition to letters of support that I have received, studies show that, if we pass this bill, a typical household would see their taxes cut nearly $2,000.  Let's think for a second what this means. Instead of the IRS taking it, families could spend it on their children. They could put it in their savings, or they could pay off debts.  I am supporting this bill so we no longer hold manufacturers back from success. I am supporting this bill because it would make life simpler and easier for job creators, savers, and hardworking families.  Last week, in this body, I addressed the fact that there are certain provisions within this bill that my colleagues and I may differ on, and I noted that that is just always going to be the case, but I also suggested that we ask ourselves three questions.  The first question was: Does this bill cut taxes for the vast majority of hardworking American families?  The second was: Will it bring back jobs?  And the third question was: Will this bill simplify the tax filing process for working families next year and in the years to come?  Madam Speaker, the answer to all three of those questions was ``yes.'' I urge my colleagues to vote tomorrow in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Last year, President Trump promised to cut taxes for working families, and that is exactly what this bill will do.

939,topic-id,526,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee for yielding.  Today, the House of Representatives is considering tax reform for the first time since 1986.  In the last 31 years, the world has changed a lot and it is time that we bring the Tax Code into the 21st century. This needed tax reform will put our country on a path to long-term economic stability and help hardworking families around the country get ahead.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help American families in important ways. First, it focuses on Americans in the middle of the earning scale by doubling the standard deduction and creating a new family flexibility credit for nondependents. Taxpayers will be able to deduct even more from their taxable income, reducing the need for tedious itemization.  In addition, the bill repeals the alternative minimum tax. This tax was never intended to be as broad as it has become, but because it was not indexed for inflation when it was introduced, many of us find ourselves having to calculate our taxes twice to see if we are ensnared by the alternative minimum tax. It is time for this one to go away.  With decreased taxation, American families have more money in their pockets, resulting in greater contributions to the economy.  The bill also alleviates some of the cost of raising children by expanding the child tax credit. It preserves the adoption tax credit so parents can continue to receive additional tax relief as they open their hearts and their homes to an adopted child.  This bill reduces the number of tax brackets from seven to four, with rates of zero, 12, 25 and 35 percent for most taxpayers. It does preserve the 39.6 percent rate of the previous administration for the highest earners. These reforms will help simplify the Tax Code and make it more competitive for hardworking American families.  I am grateful the Ways and Means Committee kept the step-up in basis, despite repealing the estate tax by 2024. The step-up in basis is an important component of estate planning when people are planning for future generations. This will allow people who may experience a tragedy to continue ownership of family property without bearing excessive penalties.  Mr.Speaker, I am a supporter of the flat tax. I have introduced H.1040 in every term that I have been in office, but I recognize this bill makes a lot of needed reforms and repeals some credits while maintaining those important to American taxpayers.  Donors will still be able to make tax-exempt charitable contributions, employers will still be able to contribute to 401(k) retirement savings accounts, new homeowners will be able to deduct the interest expense on up to $500,000 of a mortgage, and no changes are made as to Social  I was actually hoping we could lower Social Security taxes. We couldn't. But we certainly do not increase Social Security taxes, despite what some of the fake news says.  Students will continue receiving a credit through the consolidated American opportunity tax credit.  Simply put, this bill will promote growth at middle-income levels, create a more favorable business environment, and continue important tax credits.

981,topic-id,1265,"Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the following letter from Thomas Barthold to Chairman Kevin Brody:                                    Congress of the United States,                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,                                 Washington, DC, November 14 2017.     Kevin Brady,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Chairman Brady: You asked me to comment on the changes      made by H.1 as ordered reported by the House Committee on      Ways and Means in the context of Clause 5(b) of Rule XXI of      the House of       Clause 5(b) of Rule XXI sets special passage requirements      for measures that amend subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), or      (e) of section 1 or section 11(b) or 55(b) of the Internal      Revenue Code in a manner that imposes a new percentage rate      of tax and thereby increases the amount of tax imposed by      such section. H.1 amends the relevant sections by      eliminating the 10-percent bracket, which is obviated as a      marginal rate as a result of the increase in the standard      deduction provided in section 63(c) and makes general changes      to the income thresholds at which the varying tax rate      brackets apply and eliminating several other tax rates of      present law. These changes combined with the increased value      of the child tax credit (in section 24) result in virtually      every taxpayer who formerly would have been in the 10-percent      tax bracket having a lower tax liability under the changes      that would be effectuated by H.1 than they would under      present law.       Similarly, H.1 eliminates the present-law 33-percent      marginal tax bracket. As a result there are some taxpayers      who would claim the standard deduction and had his or her      last dollar of income taxed in the 33-percent tax bracket      under present law but under H.1 after claiming the      increased the standard deduction would have their last dollar      of income taxed in the 35-percent tax bracket. However, in      each such case the taxpayer's total income tax liability is      lower under H.1 than under present law. For taxpayers who      eschew the standard deduction under present law there is      substantially greater variability in resulting tax      liabilities. With the elimination of some deductions that      taxpayers may elect to itemize under present law, it is not      possible to say in all cases that these taxpayers have lower      total income tax liability under H.1 than under present      law. However, by comparison to the case of a taxpayer      claiming the standard deduction, the variability of these      results is clearly a consequence of the changes to the tax      base effectuated by H.1 rather than a consequence solely      of the elimination of the present-law 33-percent bracket.       Because the House rule does not contemplate changes to the      Internal Revenue Code as a whole and the interactions such      changes have on tax liability, H.1 requires a waiver of      the rule's provisions. In its totality, the combined effect      of the tax rate and income threshold amendments made by the      bill, along with the increase in the standard deduction,      would not, in and of themselves, result in an increase in the      amount of tax imposed on virtually any filer as a result of      these changes.       I hope this discussion is helpful. Please contact me with      any questions.           Sincerely,                                               Thomas  The material previously referred to by Mr.Hastings is as follows:          An Amendment to 619 Offered by Mr.Hastings       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      section:     ``5. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST ANY TAX BILL THAT RAISES                    TAXES ON MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES BY ELIMINATING                    OR LIMITING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX       (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the House      of Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution,      motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or      conference report that repeals or limits the State and Local      Tax Deduction (26 U.S.164).       (b) Waiver in the House.--It shall not be in order in the      House of Representatives to consider a rule or order that      waives the application of subsection (a). As disposition of a      point of order under this subsection, the Chair shall put the      question of consideration with respect to the rule or order,      as applicable. The question of consideration shall be      debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point      of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but shall      otherwise be decided without intervening motion except one      that the House adjourn.''                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools[[Page H9279]]     for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and      allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer      an alternative plan.

726,topic-id,1078,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 616 provides for consideration of H.2874, the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, and the conference report to accompany H.2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.  H.2874, the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, reauthorizes the National Flood Insurance Program for 5 years, introduces great private market competition, and provides additional reforms to benefit policyholders and taxpayers.  Mr.Speaker, the Office of Management and Budget has said that the National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is not fiscally sustainable in its current form. The 21st Century Flood Reform Act helps transition it to a more sustainable program.  Importantly, the bill will help foster a robust product market for flood insurance, which allows private insurers to compete, in turn, driving down the price of policies while creating greater consumer choice. This is a win for policyholders and taxpayers alike.  Representing Alabama's Gulf Coast, it is important to me and my constituents that they have access to affordable flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program or a private insurer.  I appreciate the inclusion of provisions in the 21st Century Flood Reform Act to protect current policyholders while making the program sustainable.  I also appreciate Chairman Hensarling's willingness to work with Members whose constituents, such as mine, rely very heavily upon the NFIP to address concerns we raised about the initial version of the bill that passed out of committee.  All in all, this bill is a positive step toward reauthorizing our Nation's flood insurance program, which is currently set to expire on December 8. We must take action to ensure coastal homeowners and others in flood-prone areas have access to affordable insurance.  Mr.Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to get a long-term reauthorization across the finish line and signed into law by President  House Resolution 616 also allows for consideration of the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act that was conferenced between the House and the Senate, reconciling the differences between two different versions.  Mr.Speaker, before I go into the substance of the bill, I would like to take a minute to commend the open and regular order process that has taken place from start to finish.  As a member of both the Armed Services Committee and the Rules Committee, I have followed this bill throughout the legislative process and think we should all be proud of the regular order and the fact that a wide range of members played a role in crafting the final product.  I applaud Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and the entire Armed Services Committee staff for their dedication to an open process. I also appreciate the countless hours they have poured into this conference report.  Just as a quick reminder, we considered 275 amendments during the House Armed Services Committee back in June, and another 210 amendments when the NDAA was considered by the full House in In total, 485 amendments have been considered in the House, and, just as important, there was a clear bipartisan split between the number of majority and minority amendments.  The conference committee continued this bipartisan and collaborative process under the leadership of four chairmen and ranking members. Once again, this year's NDAA is truly a bipartisan and bicameral bill that provides the best for our military and national security.  Mr.Speaker, this NDAA follows through on our promise to our servicemen and -women and our constitutional duty to provide for the common defense of the United States of  The FY18 NDAA conference report authorizes a 10 percent increase in total military spending, reminiscent of the Reagan era defense buildup. The bill authorizes $626 billion for base budget requirements, $66 billion for overseas contingency operations, and $8 billion for other defense activities.[[Page H9192]]That adds up for a total national defense top line of $700 billion.  I am incredibly proud to support a top-line number high enough to begin reversing the readiness crisis that has endangered the lives of our servicemembers and made it harder to defend our country.  Over the past 8 years, and under sequestration, our military has suffered. We have planes that can't fly, ships that can't sail, and soldiers who can't deploy, all while the number of threats around the world keep rising.  I want to acknowledge that this top-line number is significantly higher than the Budget Control Act cap for defense. I look forward to continued dialogue with the Appropriations Committee to raise this cap that has crippled necessary defense spending in recent years.  Every day we operate under a continuing resolution or the BCA caps is another day we are failing our men and women in uniform. The FY18 NDAA fulfills the authorization side of the equation, and I am hopeful the appropriations side will follow.  The FY18 NDAA increases the size of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Army Guard and Reserve, Naval and Air Reserve, and Air Guard to repair and restore readiness.  The bill also authorizes construction of 13 new Navy ships, including three littoral combat ships, as we work to grow toward a 355-ship fleet.  In a well-deserved benefit for our troops, the NDAA provides for a 2.4 percent pay increase for servicemembers, which is the amount our troops are entitled to under current law.  Another small but important provision in this bill eliminates the so-called widow's tax, which requires surviving spouses of servicemembers killed in action to forfeit the survivor benefit pension annuity. The financial burden of this tax is something our military families should not bear.  The bill also continues to advance Chairman Thornberry's priority of reforming and strengthening the military's acquisition process to make it more effective and efficient.  Importantly, the legislation takes into account the Trump administration's $6 billion budget amendment to authorize more funding for missile defense threats against North Korea, Navy ship repairs, and more troops in  Our men and women in uniform all over the world are on a mission to protect and defend the freedoms we hold dear. The way I see it, our mission in Congress is to give these brave men and women the resources they need to succeed. The FY18 NDAA does exactly that and is another step in a multiyear process of restoring our military strength to further protect our national security. Ultimately, this bill is about keeping the American people safe and secure.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 616 and both of the underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Well, under our plan, the standard deduction will be doubled.  Just consider the medium family of four in southwest That family earns a little over $77,000 a year. If that family takes the standard deduction, as most do, they will see a tax cut of $1,739 a year. That comes out to almost an extra $150 a month.  Now, that may not sound like real money in Washington, but for families in Bay Minette or Citronelle or Monroeville, that is important. That is extra money for a car payment. That is additional savings for a child's college. That is money to help pay for home repairs. That is real money.  When you add in the fact that we are fixing our corporate and business Tax Code to make it fairer and simpler, then we can truly make America boom again. President Trump has called it the ``middle class miracle.''  By making our Tax Code more competitive, we can unleash our full economic potential, bring jobs back to America, raise wages, and ultimately get more money in the pockets of working Mr.Speaker, this is exactly what President Trump promised and what the American people sent him and us to Washington to do.

491,topic-id,613,"Thank you, Mr.                         Republican Tax Plan  I come to the floor to speak right now because I know our colleagues are trying to move forward next week on some various proposals that are part of the tax package. I am very concerned and remain very concerned about the measures within the policy that raise taxes on middle-class families because I don't think we should be passing a tax bill that raises taxes on middle-class families. For me, in Washington, obviously, it is a big concern. We don't have an income tax. They are getting rid of our local deductions that are so meaningful to us.  Literally, we have done calculations--and I know there will be calculations in other States--that show you are literally raising taxes on middle-class families to give a tax break to corporations that, in some cases, aren't asking for them or certainly are not paying that corporate rate today.  I think we can do better than these policies. I certainly think we can do better than the policies that are going to be before the Energy Committee next week, if the information we are hearing now or getting word of is that my colleague on the Energy Committee, the Senator from Alaska, is going to propose literally getting rid of[[Page S7136]]the wildlife refuge as a refuge and basically the purposes for the refuge and instead saying that drilling would happen and thereby destroy the refuge.  I know today there are going to be scientists from across the country who are going to give word and testament to the fact that it is too dangerous to have drilling in the same place as a wildlife refuge, that they cannot coexist, that it will destroy the refuge. Apparently, that is what my colleague from Alaska already believes because she is now going to say that to do drilling, you have to change the status of the refuge.  I definitely believe there are much better ways in America to get revenue than basically destroying the wildlife habitat of caribou and of Arctic wildlife that is so treasured in the United States of  I certainly think there are better ways to do it than raising taxes on middle-class families, in both my State and your State that don't have an income tax and would rather continue to have the deductibility. I hope our colleagues will look at both of these ideas and go back to the drawing board. It is not where we need to be. We need to be protecting things that are so near and dear to us.  We definitely don't need to fund tax breaks for millionaires by destroying wildlife habitat. Instead, we should be going back to the drawing board on things that are going to help our economy grow in the future.  I hope the public is well aware that this is kind of dark-of-night tactics, where they want us to leave town on Thursday night only to come back on Monday and start in on a tax policy we haven't even seen. We haven't even seen the language yet.  I think we can do better than to have a rush-rush approach to give tax breaks to corporations and certainly not do it on the backs of working-class families in America--taking away from them viable deductions for education, for housing, for property taxes, for expenditures that they make. We can do better than to leave here and come back on Monday to rush-rush a tax break for corporations while raising taxes on middle-class families and destroying a wildlife refuge that scientists say is so important to our ecology to keep.

806,topic-id,1499,"Thank you very much.  Mr.President, I wish to thank the Senator from Colorado for his leadership in bringing us, the class of 2014, to the floor to talk about the commonsense tax reform measure that we have, the opportunity of decades to make a difference--a big difference--in many of the lives of the people we represent. I would even say most lives.  This is about the sixth time I have been to the floor to talk about what I think is the best tax reform package I have seen in my time here and also the different aspects of tax reform that I think are great for the country and great for my I represent a small State, the small State of West  I have talked about small businesses and families and what it means for them--simplification and creating a competitive environment. But there is nothing like going home and talking to people, whether we are at the grocery store or, as in this past week, when we were all in Veterans Day parades. People are generally so respectful and very happy at a Veterans Day parade. I can't say the same for every parade, but I will say that for the Veterans Day parade, they are generally pretty happy. I was really surprised because I had several constituents--not just one or two but several--say to me: Pass this bill; we want tax relief.  It was totally unsolicited. So West Virginians are paying attention to what we are doing in the  Right now, our colleagues on the Finance Committee are working to advance this bill as early as tomorrow. We are very hopeful that we will be able to consider this bill on the floor of the Senate the week we get back from Thanksgiving, as our colleagues in the House are passing their bill this week. Do you know what? It has been disappointing to me and really to everybody, I think, involved in this, as tax reform has become a partisan issue, an exercise. We have shared goals. We all want to go to the same place in this country--a prosperous place where everybody can thrive and succeed--but to turn your back on what I think is a well-thought-out, much studied plan on tax relief, I think, is to turn a blind eye to every working American, every American business, and every American family, and, personally, I don't think it is fair.  Our goals are shared by many Americans, regardless of their party, because we want to grow small businesses. I am in a State where 95 percent of our businesses are small businesses. We want to allow those small businesses to make the decisions to grow employment opportunities or raise wages. We want to make our bigger companies competitive globally.  People say: You know, what is a big company really going to do for me, working and living here in West Virginia?  I think if we looked at the major companies that are invested in our State, we know that making those companies more competitive will result in those companies creating more jobs, investing more capital, buying more products, and raising wages for workers. So making our companies competitive globally is exceedingly important.  I have heard many of my colleagues say that statistics show that many American families can't even come up with $400 for an emergency expenditure in their family. That is almost a flat tire and the towing expense to get your car fixed so you can go to work or take your kids to school or get to your job and get to your church. I think the tax reform bill in the Senate meets many of these objectives.  The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has found that the bill would provide tax relief to Americans in every single income category, with the largest percent--and this was after working the bill over several months--going where it should go, which is to the middle-income earner.  The Tax Foundation has also found that with the Senate bill, as many as 925,000 new jobs can be created. That is significant. That is significant because, I believe, some of those jobs--and I would hope a great deal of them--would land in the great State of West  In West Virginia, the studies showed that the average middle-income family would gain $1,952 in after-tax income, and the job creation for the State of West Virginia would be 4,784 jobs in our For some people, that might not sound like very much, but in our State, that is significant. It is almost 5,000 more jobs. I will take them. We will take them, and we will provide good workers for them, too. And $1,900 more from your taxes is a major infusion of cash into a family, to make the decisions they want, which they make around their kitchen tables, not the decisions that we are making here on the floor.  Yesterday I heard from members of the West Virginia Chamber of Steve Roberts, who is the president of that group, said that the current system is full of ``negative consequences'' and reduces a business's ability to hire new workers, invest in inventory and equipment, and boost employee pay.  These are the hallmarks. What he is saying here is that the ``negative consequences'' are the hallmarks of what we are fixing and what we are reforming in this bill. He noted:       Employers are eager to grow, reinvest and reward employees      with better wages. We hope Congress will act quickly to      reduce and simplify taxes ensuring a stronger [and] more      economically vigorous nation.  This is something I don't think we talk about, either. If we had economic security in our families and economic security in this country, we would be stronger in a lot of ways that go beyond being stronger economically. In your family, if you have a decision that you have to make and you have to come up with some emergency funds, if you have to borrow or try to figure out a way to make ends meet, it makes you feel weaker. If you can do it yourself, you are stronger. That is what we are doing in this bill.  Also, I want to talk about the transparency here. We are hearing criticisms that this is coming in the dead of night, that nobody has ever heard of it. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Finance Committee alone has held 70 hearings on this since the year 2011. Senators from both parties have had the opportunity to weigh in, experts from both inside the Capitol and outside the Right now, it is undergoing a full markup in committee, and the House has gone through the same procedure. This has been done in the total light of day. This is how legislation is made. So I am very pleased that these tax reform principles in this bill are moving through our  We know that the President is very enthusiastic about this. He will sign a bill that will grow our economy and benefit whom he wants it to benefit and whom we all want it to--middle-income families.  Each Senator has a choice here. We all have our choices. My friends from South Dakota and Oklahoma and Louisiana and Colorado, who are on the floor with me, as well as the Presiding Officer, who is from Arkansas, have choices every day. You can either cling to the status quo and say that, yes, everything is working well or you could really grab this and say that this is good--this is good policy; this is good politics; it will make our country stronger and our families stronger. This will help our small businesses thrive, create more jobs, and raise wages. Above all else, this will benefit our families. I think that it allows for more growth and more opportunity.  The people whom I represent want this. They want to have more of their money at the end of the day to be able to make their own decisions. They want their good, hard work rewarded. They want to see a country that grows and is optimistic and is strong and powerful. Economic strength can give us that.  I just heard from a 70-year-old postal worker from Wheeling, He wrote to me: ``The Senate needs to get these tax cuts and tax reform done.'' That is the simple way that most people communicate in this country. I understand that. I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle understand that.[[Page S7239]]  It would be great to have us join together as a Senate, as a country, to do something we know is going to have the right consequences and the right results of growing this country and providing the relief that people want with a well-studied process, with well-researched data, and with the power of the American people behind us.  Thank you.  I now yield to my colleague from Colorado and thank him again for leading this.

It has never put a single accountant out of business, and it won't do it now. It is another part of the big scam going on.  Why?

We all agree that we need to help make it a stable fiscal platform, but not what this bill does. That is the problem here. This is not a--I have seen worse bills.

Currently, nine countries possess over 15,000 nuclear weapons, and the United States plans to spend $1.2 trillion over the next 30 years to upgrade and expand its nuclear stockpile. As we build up our nuclear arsenal, we are increasing the risk of these destructive weapons ending up in the hands of terrorists.  The language I included in this bill stresses the importance of addressing this danger and requires the Secretary of Defense to explain how the Department of Defense is responding to this threat.

480,topic-id,2389,"Mr.President, I want to continue to share with our colleagues the reasons I oppose the nomination of Bill Wehrum to be EPA's Assistant Administrator for Air and Throughout his career, Mr.Wehrum has clearly shown he is dismissive of the science that is the core of EPA's actions to protect public health. Nothing during this confirmation process has convinced me that Mr.Wehrum's approach will change going forward.  I have said this before, and I will say it again because it makes Mr.Wehrum's priorities clear, our courts have overturned regulations that Mr.Wehrum helped craft while at EPA a staggering 27 times. That is 27 times that the courts determined the rules Mr.Wehrum put in place did not follow the law or did not adequately protect public safety--27 times.  In one of those instances, the courts faulted EPA's lack of action to reduce mercury and toxic air pollution emissions from electric powerplants.  I have worked on controlling mercury pollution since I became a Member of this body 17 years ago, so I would like to spend some time talking about this issue, mercury.  Much of our country's ongoing efforts to clean up air pollution hinge on making sure every State plays by the rules and does their fair share to reduce air pollution. That includes dangerous toxic pollution like mercury. Toxic air pollution gets into the air we breathe, gets into the food we eat, builds up in our bodies without our knowledge and can lead to cancer, to mental impairment, and even to death.  Unfortunately, Mr.Wehrum has spent much of his career fighting to dismantle the Federal environmental protections on which any State--my State, your State, so many other States--depends in order to clean up toxic air pollution.  Twenty-seven is also the number of years ago that President George Herbert Walker Bush signed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 into law. Nearly three decades ago, Congress had enough scientific data to know that mercury and other air toxics, such as lead and arsenic, were hazardous air pollutants that harmed people's health and, as a result, should be regulated by the  The lawmakers--including myself--who sent the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 to the desk of a Republican President thought that the Nation's largest emitters of mercury and air toxics would soon be required to do their part and clean up. Unfortunately, it took 22 additional years for the EPA to issue the Mercury and Air Toxic Rule, which finally, 5 years ago, called for reducing mercury and other air toxics from coal-fired plants, our Nation's largest source of mercury emissions.  The EPA modeled the rule after successful steps that States across our country had already taken. The Agency required coal plants to install existing affordable technology that could reduce mercury and toxic emissions by 90 percent.  Today our Nation's power utilities are meeting the mercury and air toxics standards--they are meeting it--and electricity prices have not gone up; they have gone down. Some of you might find that hard to believe, but it is true. They have actually gone down.  You might ask why it took the EPA 22 years to address our Nation's largest source of mercury and air toxics emissions. That is a fair question. The answer, in part, is that Mr.Wehrum was working at the EPA and had the responsibility to assume this life-enhancing--if not lifesaving--task, a responsibility, sadly, he largely chose to ignore.  In the early 2000s, under Mr.Wehrum's leadership, the EPA decided to take a detour when it came to regulating mercury and air toxics from powerplants. Mr.Wehrum refused to follow the recommendation from the National Academy of Sciences and instead reversed an earlier EPA decision. He determined it was neither appropriate nor necessary to regulate powerplants under the air toxics section of the Clean Air Instead, he chose a different path, helping to write a rule allowing powerplants to pollute more and for a longer time under a mercury cap-and-trade program.  In his push to make regulations on mercury emissions less protective, Mr.Wehrum promulgated a rule that industry not only supported but helped to write. In January 2004, the Washington Post reported that language written for industry by Mr.Wehrum's old law firm--Latham & Watkins--appeared word for word in the proposed rule published in the Federal Register--word for word.  The story reported that ``a side-by-side comparison of one of the three proposed rules and the memorandums prepared by Latham & Watkins shows that at least a dozen paragraphs were lifted, sometimes verbatim, from the industry suggestions.''  After Mr.Wehrum's mercury rule was finalized, the Federal courts found that EPA had exaggerated the rule's benefits and, as a result, the rule was[[Page S7128]]overturned. In fact, the EPA lost so badly that the deciding judge said that under the leadership of Mr.Wehrum, the Agency deployed ``the logic of the Queen of Hearts, substituting the EPA's desires for the plain text of the law.''  So EPA had to start all over again because Mr.Wehrum ignored science and deferred to industry. What makes that delay process so egregious is that our Nation's children were exposed to toxic air emissions from powerplants for an additional decade for no good reason.  In 2011, the Obama administration finally issued a new rule--the mercury and air toxic standard rule--that protects our children, protects our health, and protects our lakes and our rivers. What is more, industry is easily able to meet the rule's targets, and our Nation is already seeing the benefits, but these health benefits do not seem to matter to Mr.Wehrum, who is still fighting for delays in mercury and air toxic emission reductions.  In fact, while representing his industry clients, he has supported a lawsuit against the mercury and air toxic rule. Under his leadership, Mr.Wehrum's law firm has been arguing that it is not ``appropriate and necessary'' for the EPA to regulate mercury and other air toxic emissions. Not appropriate and necessary? That is what he says.  When I asked Mr.Wehrum about his time at the EPA and his work to delay mercury regulations, he was elusive. He seemed to have a selective memory with respect to the actions he did or did not take when he last served at the  When I asked him if he would commit not to weaken the mercury and air toxic rule if confirmed, he basically refused to answer. However, to his colleagues, he is very clear regarding his thoughts on the mercury and air toxic rule. In a trade press article published just 1 year ago, Mr.Wehrum said: ``From our perspective, it's a regulation that made no sense and wasn't justified.''  Mr.Wehrum believes there is no justification for EPA to regulate the largest source of mercury and air toxic pollution--pollution that pediatricians tell us damage children's brains and could affect up to 600,000 newborns every year--600,000 newborns every year.  Mr.Wehrum believes there is no justification for EPA to regulate the largest source of mercury and air toxics pollution--pollution that settles in our lakes, our rivers, streams, accumulates in our fish, and makes them too dangerous to eat.  Mr.Wehrum believes there is no justification for EPA to regulate the largest source of mercury and air toxics pollution, even though power companies have already bought, paid for, and installed the control technology on all powerplants without hiking electricity rates.  This information should be quite concerning to all of us, to all of our colleagues--I don't care where we come from--especially those who have supported the mercury and air toxic rule, as many of us have.  If confirmed, Mr.Wehrum would be part of the review of the mercury and air toxic rule that Mr.Pruitt promises to undertake. Think about that.  This is just one of the many clear examples in which Mr.Wehrum continues to support polluters over science and doctors, even going so far as to give polluters the pen to write the regulations they would have to follow. Unfortunately, there are many more.  Mr.Wehrum also spearheaded regulations when he was last at EPA that weakened air protections for national parks. The courts threw out those efforts to weaken the so-called regional haze rule, compelling the Obama administration to clean up his mess and provide this protection for iconic parks like the Grand Canyon and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park because, again, Mr.Wehrum did not follow science or the law.  Nonetheless, Mr.Wehrum continues to pursue ongoing litigation against EPA's efforts to reduce national park pollution. Last year, Mr.Wehrum declared in an article: ``EPA used the regional haze programs to impose very stringent, and from our perspective, unwarranted emissions requirements.''  Mr.Wehrum also has a long history of ignoring climate change science and the laws that regulate carbon emissions. While at the EPA, Mr.Wehrum was critical of the Agency's decision to deny the State of California a waiver to impose stricter vehicle standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as costs for consumers. Mr.Wehrum personally pushed for this action against recommendations of the career staff who did not believe the George Bush administration political appointee had a legal basis to deny California's request.  I am here today to remind Mr.Wehrum and all those who continue to delay action to control greenhouse gas emissions under the premise that more information about how the climate is changing or whether or not human beings are exacerbating the effects of climate change--the facts are in. The science is clear.  Even if he doesn't want to believe the numbers and the data--Mr.Wehrum lives in Delaware, as do We run races together, sometimes ride the same trains back and forth between Wilmington and However, in the State in which we both reside, for us, the effects of climate change are evident. In our State, we are the Nation's lowest lying Parts of our State are sinking while at the same time the waters are rising along our shores.  By his own admission, while at the EPA, Mr.Wehrum provided support to the government litigation team in a famous case: Massachusetts v. That team argued that greenhouse gases are not pollutants that could be regulated under the Clean Air It is not just me who disagreed with Mr.Wehrum in this instance, the Supreme Court of the United States disagreed as well.  Unfortunately, Mr.Wehrum's views on climate change seem to be the same as they were 15 years ago. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA, which affirmed EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, Mr.Wehrum insisted in 2013 that he ``continues to believe, that Congress never intended the EPA to address an issue such as climate change under the Clean Air Act.''  In his nomination hearing before the EPW Committee, Mr.Wehrum claimed that the climate is changing, but much is unknown--much is unknown--about why and how fast those changes are occurring.  I could go on for a while, as you can imagine, but suffice it to say, these views of Mr.Wehrum are not just curious, they are dangerous. They are dangerous. Ignoring environmental health science just because you would rather not put protections in place hurts all of us in the end but especially the most vulnerable among us. Mr.Wehrum's time at EPA is at odds with the public health mission of that  All of the failed regulations Mr.Wehrum worked on created greater uncertainty for business and left the lives of the most vulnerable populations at risk.  I would like to close by reflecting on why I think today's vote is so important. My wife Martha and I go to a Presbyterian Church in Wilmington most Earlier this year, on an especially lovely spring morning--a morning I had gone out for a run--we joined our congregation in singing a number of hymns, and one of them began with these words:     For the beauty of the Earth,     For the glory of the skies,     For the love which from our birth     Over and around us lies,     Lord of all, to Thee we raise     This our hymn of grateful praise.  It is a powerful passage, and we should let these words really and truly resonate, especially on this morning.  Scripture reminds us repeatedly to love our neighbors as ourselves. We know that and call that the Golden It appears in every major religion in the world--I don't care if you are Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, I don't care what your faith is, there is a Golden Rule in your Sacred In our faith, we call it the Golden  Also found in those pages is another sacred obligation that we are to serve as stewards of this planet to which we have been entrusted, and we have a moral obligation to do so. I know a great many of our colleagues here in the Senate agree that we have a responsibility to care for the world around us and the people who live in it. Most Americans believe that. We all have an obligation to protect the health of our children and our families[[Page S7129]]and the world in which we live. We have an obligation to ensure that we have clean air to breathe--perhaps the most basic, most important right of all. For me, this is not only my responsibility as a parent and as an official elected to serve the people of Delaware; it is a moral imperative, a moral calling.  Americans deserve EPA leaders who believe in sound science. Americans need EPA leaders who will listen to the medical experts when it comes to our health and who will be able to strike a balance that ensures both a cleaner environment and a stronger economy--something we have done for the past 27 years since the adoption of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  Moving forward with this nominee and thus allowing him to execute his extreme agenda once again at the EPA, especially when we have seen how poorly he handled that authority before, would be, in my mind, simply irresponsible. I do not believe Mr.Wehrum is the right fit for this position. I encourage my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, to vote no on his nomination to be EPA's Assistant Administrator for  Mr.President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

487,topic-id,314,"Mr.President, as we prepare to vote on this nominee, I wish to implore my colleagues to take one last moment to think about this decision before us.

The pay was good; the benefits were excellent. They were union jobs, and the picture tubes they put together were so good, this company was able to sell them to Sony in  The people working at this plant were a community. They had wonderful company picnics. They had a softball league. They organized holiday parties for the kids and fishing derbies. Matty Loftus worked there for 30 years. He was able to raise four children on his salary alone.  Chuck Lampman is the same age as Matty Loftus, and they are friends. Chuck went to work for the RCA plant in 1972 when he was 21. He started in production, and he loved that job, too. He says: We were making the Cadillac of American televisions. By the year 2000, we were already starting to make the first generation of flat screen TV panels.  Around that time, Thompson won a worldwide award for making the best 27-inch TVs in the world, and everybody at the plant was so proud. Chuck says: That wasn't just a job; that was a way of life.  John O'Hearn got out of high school in 1975. He got a job at the TV plant right away. He worked production at first, but then he got bumped up into the machine shop. He made lifelong friends at that factory.  In 1994, NAFTA went into effect. Matty, Chuck, and John, they knew about it, but they didn't think too much about it. John remembers people in the machine shop who were interested in politics arguing over the effects of NAFTA.[[Page H9260]]  Through the nineties, these men and women were working the factory 24/7 in three shifts, putting out over 2 million picture tubes a year. They used to say: They will never close us down. We make this company too much money.  And then it came, May of 2001. Management called everybody into the plant and gave them the news. The plant was closing in August, 3 months from then, because they were moving to  People were shocked. Nobody saw this coming. They tried to negotiate with the company, and Matty and Chuck remember the answer. It was: Are you willing to take a $13-an-hour pay cut and work for $3.25 an hour?  Matty remembers the pride that these people had at the plant working the last few months, the pride that they did their jobs with. There was no vandalism. There were no work stoppages, no slowdowns. They finished out their jobs showing the pride in the work that they had had for a generation. He remembers the tears on that last day and how people passed out lists of names and phone numbers so they could all stay in touch.  Chuck remembers on the last day how that trophy for the best 27-inch TV tube was still in the company lobby.  All three of them remember the aftermath. They remember the divorces. They remember the suicides.  Matty still had two daughters in public school. He went through his family savings, and he had to cash in some of his retirement money, take the penalty. Now he works as a security guard making $10 an hour. He is 66, and he can't afford to retire.  Chuck was out of work for years, and eventually he found a job making half the money. He is also 66, and he can't retire.  John can't forget having to tell his daughter, Lindsey, in May 2001 he was losing his job. She was in tears. She was graduating high school the next month. She wanted to go to college.  When Chuck found out the current Republican tax plan is to drop corporate tax to 20 percent for companies doing business in America but to 10 percent for American companies doing business overseas, this is what he said: Haven't we lost enough already under NAFTA?

504,topic-id,352,"Mr.President, I wish to add my words to those that have been said.  Let me begin by saying that the achievement of this tax proposal is not about anyone in this Chamber; it is about the working families who for the last 8 years have not done so well. They have either lost their jobs or their wages have been flat and their benefits have not improved or, indeed, the cost of those benefits have risen dramatically. I can say, with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act that is being introduced today, they will increase their take-home pay, they will have higher wages, and they will have a better life.  Now let's talk about how that would be. How will these working families improve?  The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Ohio, mentioned in his remarks that businesses will have money to invest. There will be competition for workers. And if there is competition for workers, then workers are paid more. They are given better benefits. What do those better benefits and better wages mean? It means they can invest more in their family, in their children's future, and that, in turn, will change their family's life for generations to come.  So on behalf of those working families, I echo Chairman Hatch, that if there is a suggestion by anyone that can make this better, I ask them to bring that suggestion forward because this is not about Republicans, this is not about Democrats, this is not about[[Page S7145]]anybody in this Chamber; it is about those working families who, for the last 8 years, have not done as well as the American dream would say they should.  On behalf of those working families, I congratulate Chairman Hatch for this job. I look forward to the passage of this bill, and I look forward to all of the benefits of this bill coming to help the families of this country and in my State of  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

810,topic-id,806,"Mr.President, the last 8 years were really hard for a lot of families. They have seen their wages stagnate and their benefits not go up. Indeed, what they have been paying for health insurance and flood insurance and many other things has risen even though their wages have not. So the goal of this bill is to decrease taxes on those middle-income, working families in order to give them the opportunity to have better wages, better benefits, and to bring relief to situations that are peculiar. Are they peculiar to Louisiana? No, they are not peculiar to Louisiana, and I will elaborate on that in just a second.  What could middle-class families in Louisiana do with better wages? They could pay off debt. They could provide more for their children. They could just live life a little bit more robustly and not have to, perhaps, move out of one home and into another because they can no longer afford the mortgage on the first. The goal of this is, first, to bring tax relief to working families and middle-class families. It is all part of an effort to cut taxes particularly for them.  Now let's talk about raising their wages. Folks want to have more money in their take-home pay after taxes, but[[Page S7240]]they also want to have higher wages and better benefits. This bill definitely creates that.  Our current Tax Code encourages companies to move overseas. When they earn money overseas, they keep it there and build plants and factories in other countries. They employ folks in other countries but do not bring that money home, employ Americans, or raise wages or give better benefits to those This changes that. Not only do we have tax cuts for the middle class, for working families, but we also encourage businesses to invest here, to create better paying jobs here.  I have heard some say: Well, wait a second. Unemployment is low now. Why does it matter?  Now is the time when workers most benefit if there is investment that creates more opportunity for those here in the United If there is a worker who is a welder and if he can either work here or there, businesses are going to bid for his services. They are going to pay more to get him to work. As they do that, just from supply and demand, wages will go up for the average American worker, for the average American family. Benefits will rise for those families, and the children of those families will have more opportunity. This is what that is about.  There is another way in which we bring relief to those middle-income families. Part of what we are doing here is repealing the mandate of the Affordable Care Americans hate the government's telling them what to do. Yet, as part of the ObamaCare mandate, it tells someone: Even if you cannot afford that insurance, even if you don't buy it, we are going to make you pay a fine.  In 2015, more than 100,000 folks in Louisiana paid a fine for not having health insurance, and 37 percent--almost 40 percent--of those folks had an adjusted gross income of less than $25,000; 78 percent had less than $50,000. Think about this. The families who report incomes of $50,000 or less cannot afford insurance, and they are having to pay a fine because they have not. They are not millionaires or billionaires. These are families who are trying to make ends meet, who make a decision because the exchange policies are too expensive for them to buy, and now they are getting fined. This is part of the relief we are bringing to those working families by getting rid of that mandate.  Lastly, there is another form of relief. Louisiana had its great flood of 2016, which was similar to Maria, Irma, and Harvey, but this was an unnamed storm that affected tens of thousands of people. Through this bill, we bring disaster relief to the folks in They will be able to deduct their losses from their incomes, which will allow them to rebuild their homes and allow them to rebuild their businesses. As they rebuild those businesses, it will allow them to employ those who need jobs so that they may rebuild their homes and their lives.  This bill will cut taxes for those families. It will increase their wages and bring relief not only from economic stagnation but also from a natural disaster that was one of the most expensive storms in our Nation's history.  I am very pleased that this bill is advancing, and I look forward to it being passed. I look forward, most of all, to the increased wages, lower taxes, and the relief that it will bring to those families in  I now yield the floor to the Senator from South  ",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7231-2.txt,1925,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We debate tax cuts, we debate healthcare, and these are crucial issues, but none of those issues matters if we fail to get the resources necessary to defend this Nation from our adversaries.  For far too long, Mr.Speaker, we have failed to do that. Over the last 8 years, we have seen policies that have failed to provide the kind of resources our Defense Department needs. We have also seen, Mr.Speaker, legislation from this body--in particular, the Budget Control Act--that has caused significant damage to the military.  We have heard on the Armed Services Committee, week after week, briefings from every layer of the military--from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, from the Secretary of Defense, and from the combatant commanders--briefings about the extent to which there is a gap that is growing between our abilities and the abilities of our adversaries. Now, this is a gap that people seem to want to ignore, Mr.Speaker, but we do so at our own peril.  I think that we need, as Members of this body, to think very carefully about what we are going to say to our children and our grandchildren one day if they say to us: Why didn't you do all you could to ensure for the defense of this Nation? Why didn't you do all you could when you were in a position to provide the resources?  Mr.Speaker, one of the reasons we don't do all we can is because we enable the Senate rules. We have gotten ourselves in a situation, through the Budget Control Act and through the way that we do budgeting in this House, where we enable the dysfunction of the United States Senate, and we let the United States Senate be in a position where, in fact, they prevent us from doing what we know is right from a policy perspective.

It begins to allow our military to get out from under the burden, the hole that they have been in for the last 8 years.  Funds authorized in this NDAA will ensure that we are able, for example, to modernize our strategic forces. It will also ensure, Mr.Speaker, that we are able to begin to provide funding for the kind of missile defense that we know we need in a situation in which our adversaries have gained tremendous ground.

862,topic-id,894,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  I want to begin, Mr.Speaker, by responding to the gentleman from Texas, who began this debate by saying how this was a continuation of an ongoing effort by Republicans to promote progrowth tax reform in particular.  I want to be very clear, Mr.The proposal that is currently before this House with respect to the tax changes is a tax scam. It is not a tax plan. It is a scam. It gives $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, the biggest corporations, and the millionaires and billionaires. It increases taxes on tens of millions of middle class families. It pays for this big gift back to corporations and billionaires and millionaires by deep cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, infrastructure spending, education--the things that actually create jobs.  It creates additional incentives to ship American jobs overseas, creates incentives for American companies to take jobs here and ship them overseas, not to keep them here in our own country. It is another maybe more robust example of trickle-down economics. It has failed before. It will fail again.  The American people might have the benefit of understanding this more completely if there were actually a process where this was debated, witnesses testified, and experts came in to talk about the implications of this. But this is being done in the dark of night, at the speed of light so the American people won't find out what is about to happen to them. So the idea of describing this as progrowth in this context, both with the provisions and the process, seems, to me, laughable.  Let me just give the American people a couple of examples:  It denies individuals the right to deduct State and local taxes but preserves that right for corporations;  It denies the worker who is forced to leave his home and move because his employer is moving--either do that or he loses his job--from deducting the cost of moving, but it preserves the right of a company who is offshoring jobs overseas to take a deduction for the cost of moving those American jobs overseas.  Those are just two examples. So this isn't a progrowth tax policy. This is trickle-down economics designed to let the people at the very top hold onto more of their money and corporations to keep more of their profits in the hope that it will trickle down to the rest of the American people.  It doesn't work. It doesn't represent a progrowth tax policy. It is a tax scam, and so I want to just correct the record, Mr.Speaker, with all due respect to the gentleman from  Mr.Speaker, I rise, in addition to that, to express my strong opposition to H.2201, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor  In light of the devastating 2008 financial crisis and the regulatory weaknesses revealed by the Wells Fargo and Equifax scandals, we should be considering legislation that will bolster consumer and investor protections; but today, instead, we are considering H.2201, which will enable abusive financial practices.  Generally, a company that seeks to make public offerings must register them with the Securities and Exchange Commission or must fit into one of several exceptions that are designed to balance investor protections with regulatory burdens on smaller companies. This legislation would allow so-called microcap offerings, offerings valued at $500,000 or less in a single year to be sold to 35 or fewer investors, subject only to the requirement that each investor have a substantive preexisting relationship with the company.  Despite the similarity of these provisions to some restrictions currently imposed on unregistered security offerings, H.2201 omits several critical investor protections that are characteristic of existing exemptions. In particular, microcap offerings would be exempt from important regulatory protections set up in the 1933 Securities Act, including registration, disclosure, and fraud protections.  Oversight in the smaller offering space such as the one proposed in H.2201 is important because the SEC has found fraud in the microcap stock markets is of increasing concern to regulators, as such markets have proven to be fertile grounds for fraud and abuse.  Without core protections, H.2201 would leave investors vulnerable to an array of investment scams and abuses, with unsophisticated investors particularly at risk. For example, the bill has no restriction on resale. In the past, failure to restrict the resale of unregistered securities has exposed secondary investors to fraudulent pump-and-dump schemes, as the gentlewoman from California mentioned.  Additionally, groups like Americans for Financial Reform, Center for American Progress, and Public Citizen oppose H.2201 because it would enable a type of investment scam known as affinity fraud. In these schemes, scam artists prey upon members of identifiable groups, such as ethnic or religious communities or the elderly, often by enlisting respected community or religious members to help convince victims that a dubious investment is legitimate. The proliferation of affinity fraud in low-income communities demonstrates that H.2201's preexisting relationship requirement would not provide safeguards against such abuse.[[Page H8672]]  Given existing exemptions for smaller companies would provide ample opportunity for companies to raise capital while also protecting investors, H.2201 is, at best, unnecessary. This bill would simply create a loophole that undermines protections against the kind of financial abuses and recklessness that we have already seen damage our financial system and hurt people.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.2201.  I thank the gentlewoman again for yielding.

Unfortunately, the bill we see here today is not reflective of that approach.  Though a number of changes have, in fact, been made to H.2874 since leaving committee, the new provisions still fail to incorporate many of our priorities for reauthorization or address our concerns with the  Most significantly, Mr.Speaker, in H.2874 is the fact that it will increase cost for policyholders. The bill raises costs on pre-FIRM structures from 5 percent to 6.5 percent.  Additionally, the bill will require a $40 surcharge on primary residences and seeks to increase the reserve fund by charging policyholders an additional 1 percent every year.  The bill also changes the fee to policyholders who opt to pay their policy monthly. Many of our constituents who live in flood-prone areas are not wealthy. These are hardworking Americans who rely on the NFIP to help offset costs and protect their homes from disastrous flooding.  Instead of working to find ways to truly address affordability within the NFIP, the bill proposes to set up a voluntary State affordability program. This proposal then fails to provide States with the administrative costs to set up a program, a cost that may be far too burdensome for many already-struggling  Even worse, the program would offset discounts for eligible policyholders by charging policyholders who are not able to take advantage of the affordability program--yet again increasing costs for homeowners.  Importantly, H.2874 makes no effort to address the debt. Though the NFIP had been self-sustaining for many years, extreme unexpected damage following Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy left the NFIP with over $20 billion in debt. Though some of the debt was, in fact, recently forgiven, the NFIP needed to borrow more from the Treasury following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  The NFIP pays over $400 million a year in interest, money that could go towards making improvements in the program or helping enhance affordability. We need to wipe the slate clean and give the NFIP a fresh start.  H.2874 fails to provide additional funding for flood maps, maps that, in many jurisdictions, are desperately needed if we are going to have updated maps. This bill also lacks funding for new mapping technology that could help improve the accuracy of the flood maps.  In conclusion, the short-term reauthorization of the NFIP expires early next month.

So I just want to commend the Energy and Commerce Committee as well as the leadership of the Armed Services Committee, the leadership of both committees, for working together with the Department of Defense and the FDA to find that middle ground where the military can have access to drugs and medical devices expeditiously in order to meet the rapidly changing threats on the battlefield.  I again thank Chairman Thornberry for his unyielding support on this issue. I also thank Chairman Walden for offering legislation that seeks to put this process on the right path.

667,topic-id,714,"Mr.President, today, I join my colleagues, Senators Shaheen, Isakson, and Menendez, in introducing the International Violence Against Women Act of 2017. This legislation makes ending violence against women and girls a top diplomatic priority. It permanently authorizes the State Department's Office of Global Women's Issues and the position of the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's It requires the Administration to develop and implement an annual strategy to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls for each of the five years after the date of enactment. This bill would ensure that efforts begun under President George Bush and President Obama to combat gender-based violence continue in future  Mr.President, we have witnessed great strides in women's equality in our own Country, and in much of the world, over the past century. Across vast swathes of the globe, however, violence against women and forced marriage remain everyday problems. One out of every three women worldwide will be physically, sexually, or otherwise abused during her lifetime, with rates reaching 70 percent in some countries. This type of violence ranges from domestic violence, rape, and acid burnings to dowry deaths and so-called ``honor killings.'' Violence against women and girls is a human rights violation, a public health epidemic, and a barrier to solving global challenges such as extreme poverty, HIV/AIDS, and conflict. Such violence is often exacerbated in humanitarian emergencies and conflict settings.  In Iraq and Syria, girls and women have been abducted from their homes and villages, sold into sexual slavery, and forced into marriages with fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the In Burma, rape is used as a weapon against the women and girls of the Rohingya ethnic group. In Nigeria, girls as young as 11-years-old are offered a horrendous choice by Boko Haram: carry out suicide bomb attacks against Nigerian villages or live in forced marriages and sexual slavery.  This systemic targeting of women is not confined to conflict zones. In India, the United Nations special rapporteur on violence against women said that they experience such crimes ``from womb to tomb.'' Compounding this tragedy, local police often decline to investigate or seek justice. In Afghanistan, women and girls are concerned that as Western forces draw down and attention shifts away from their country, the fragile gains that have been made there could be lost.  The International Violence Against Women Act--IVAWA--ensures that the U.will continue to take a leadership role in combatting these problems. It establishes that it is the policy of the United States to take action to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls around the globe and to systematically integrate and coordinate efforts to address gender-based violence into U.foreign policy and foreign assistance programs.  Specifically, IVAWA will foster efforts in four areas. First, it will increase legal and judicial protections by establishing and supporting laws and legal structures that prevent and appropriately respond to all forms of violence against women and girls, including ``honor killings'' and forced marriage. Emphasis will be placed on promoting political, legal, and institutional reforms that recognize violence against women and girls as a crime and train police and the judiciary to hold violators accountable and to respond to the needs of victims. Second, IVAWA will increase efforts to build health sector capacity, integrating programs to address violence against women and girls into existing health programs focused on child survival, women's health, and HIV/AIDS prevention. Third, IVAWA will focus on preventing violence by changing community norms and attitudes about the acceptability of violence against women and girls. And fourth, IVAWA will focus on reducing women and girls' vulnerability to violence by improving their economic status and educational opportunities. Efforts will include ensuring that women have access to job training and employment opportunities and increasing their right to own land and property, allowing them to potentially support themselves and their children.  Violence has a profound effect on the lives of women and girls. In addition to being a pressing human rights issue, such violence contributes to inequality and political instability, making it a security issue as well as a moral issue for us all. I am committed to continuing to work with my colleagues to end violence against women and girls and to provide the assistance and resources necessary to achieve this goal.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgS7215.txt,2121,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017,14,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
914,topic-id,246,"Mr.President, Maine is home to strong communities and compassionate citizens. Nowhere are those qualities more evident than in our State's commitment to end the scourge of homelessness.  This effort has taken a significant step forward through the establishment of a single continuum of care for the State of The merger of the Portland Continuum of Care and the Maine Balance of State Continuum of Care will better enable local service providers, the statewide homeless council, and State and Federal agencies to address homelessness throughout Maine while accommodating specific local needs. This consolidation began in 2012 with the merger of the Bangor/Greater Penobscot Continuum with the Maine Balance of State Continuum of I particularly commend the Maine State Housing Authority for its leadership during this process.  Maine's unified continuum of care will create greater efficiencies in the use of Federal funding under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, the first major national response to homelessness. As chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, I am confident that this unification will enhance the ability of Maine's service providers to help guide Federal policies and programs that assist low-income Americans, families with children, young people, seniors, and our veterans in obtaining safe shelter and affordable housing.  With a 9-percent reduction in homelessness from fiscal year 2016 to 2017, Maine is making great progress in aiding our most vulnerable citizens. The creation of a unified continuum of care will accelerate this progress, and I congratulate all who made it possible.

318,topic-id,745,"Madam Speaker, it has been more than 30 years since Congress passed meaningful tax reform. In those three decades, we have seen unbelievable progress in technology, communications, manufacturing, and so much more. I am thrilled we now have a chance to pass meaningful tax reform, an opportunity to finally move to a Tax Code that works for families, small businesses, and Americans across the board.  We have a once-in-a-generation chance to bolster middle class prosperity, strengthen our economy, and help America's global competitiveness. These are not just abstract concepts. These are real people, families, businesses, and workers.  Over this past year, I have traveled through the 35 counties that I represent, and I have been so impressed by the countless Kentuckians who are working to bring jobs of the future into rural Unlike these innovative entrepreneurs, our Tax Code is, unfortunately, stuck in the past.  Like many of my constituents in the First District, I run a family farm and have experienced the challenges of dealing with an outdated and cumbersome Tax know firsthand the difficulties small businesses face when they try to operate, grow, and hire more workers while battling a Tax Code that does not work for them. Passing tax reform is finally within reach, and I enthusiastically support swift passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Throughout our Nation's history, small businesses have served as the backbone of our communities. These companies provide high-quality jobs, contribute to their local communities, and invest money right here at home. That is why I am dedicated to enacting tax relief that allows American small-business owners to keep more of their hard-earned tax dollars, to grow their businesses, and to compete globally.  This bill will create almost 13,000 new jobs in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and will raise after-tax income for middle class families by almost $2,000. More than 59,000 taxpayers in the First District itemize their taxes, and because of the near doubling of the standard deduction and other simplifications, many of our taxpayers will have much simpler returns. And for our Nation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will generate economic growth adequate to increase Federal tax receipts by $1 trillion.  In the First District of Kentucky, there are nearly 44,000 taxpayers who earn small business income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, small-business owners will benefit from the new lower 9 percent tax rate on the first $75,000 of their business income for owners earning less than $150,000. Families and small businesses will have more opportunities to succeed with this framework.                              {time}  1930  Additionally, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces the number of deductions and credits aimed at special interests and other well-connected groups, which will create a simpler, more level playing field for American taxpayers. Getting rid of these special privileges in the Tax Code will ensure that all Americans, not just those who can afford their own tax preparers, get to keep more of their own money.  President Trump, my colleagues in Congress and I have promised to deliver tax reform in a big way. I am proud to be keeping this promise now. My constituents deserve a system that enables them to keep more of their hard-earned money and spend less of their time dealing with our overly complicated Tax  I think it is important to address a concern that I have heard throughout the tax reform debate, one that I take very seriously: our national debt, which currently tops $20 trillion and is growing every day. The debt is a serious problem that poses an impediment to growth, a burden on our future, and a threat to our national security.  While I am glad to finally hear bipartisan interest in addressing this challenge and getting the deficit under control, I think it is clear that any solution must include reducing government spending, particularly on mandatory programs that are the major drivers of our debt. I look forward to continuing to work towards this goal.  The last time we addressed our Tax Code was when President Reagan was in office. Sticking with the Tax Code we have had for decades, one that leaves U.businesses and workers behind, is not an option. Now, I have high hopes for the future with this tax reform framework.  I will continue fighting for reform that will benefit Kentuckians and our Nation as a whole, and I look forward to supporting progrowth solutions that have proven to benefit our Nation and our citizens.

Brian Lacefield was a successful area agriculture banker and agribusiness leader, most recently serving as market president of FNB Bank in Cadiz, A Hopkinsville native, Lacefield previously served as director of Commonwealth Agri-Finance with Hopkinsville Elevator, and he currently serves on the Kentucky Corn Growers board of directors, the Kentucky FFA Foundation, and the Kentucky Agricultural Leadership  I commend President Trump's selection of Lacefield to serve in such an important capacity.  The FSA plays a vital role in the Commonwealth's agriculture undertakings. Just last year, the agency was responsible for more than $330 million of payments and loans to Kentucky farmers.  I am grateful our new director brings with him a wealth of experience in agriculture, and I am confident he will serve Kentucky's farmers well. I look forward to working with Director Brian Lacefield in the years to come and continuing to serve Kentucky's agriculture community.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9189-2.txt,1E+14,21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM ACT,2017,14,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ryan Owens grew up in Edelstein, Illinois, in my congressional district, a town that is in a very rural area with barely one stop sign. Friends and family say that, even at a very early age, Ryan knew he wanted to serve his country as a Navy  After graduating from Illinois Valley Central High School in Chillicothe, Illinois, in 1998, he took the first steps towards his goal by enlisting in the  Ryan served his first tour of duty at the Office of Naval Intelligence in Suitland, Maryland, eventually completing his SEAL training in California in 2002. Over the next 15 years, he completed four tours as a U.Navy SEAL, working all over the globe to fight against terrorism and protect the interests of the United  Ryan was 2 years into his fifth tour as a Navy SEAL when he was tragically killed during an intelligence-gathering operation against an al-Qaida cell in  Throughout his 15 years as a Navy SEAL, Ryan Owens gave much to our country, protecting our freedoms, and helping rid the world of evil. It is for these reasons that I introduced H.3109, which will rename the post office in Chillicothe, Illinois, as the Chief Ryan Owens Post Office  My office and I worked closely with the U.Postal Service, the U.Navy Congressional Liaison's Office, the Central Illinois Gold Star Families, and, most importantly, Ryan's family. All of us were determined to make sure we got this right, choosing a location with strong ties to the community in which Ryan grew up. In the end, it was his wife, Carryn, who decided on Chillicothe, the town where Ryan attended and graduated high school, as the best place for this building to be renamed in his honor.                              {time}  1530  I was proud to introduce our bill with overwhelming bipartisan support here in the House with every member of the Illinois delegation signing on as a cosponsor in support. It is my hope that the House acts to pass this bill today and that the Senate will quickly follow suit.  While we can never repay Chief Owens or his family for the sacrifices he made, renaming the post office in his honor is a small way to thank him for his service and dedication to protecting our great Nation and the values that we hold so dear. We continue, today, to pray for Carryn and his children. We are indebted to his service and his sacrifice to our great country.

394,topic-id,376,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.Neal) for yielding me this time.  Mr.Speaker, you can put all the lipstick you want on this pig, and it is still a pig.  Let's be honest, this isn't tax reform. This is a cut on taxes for corporate America, the corporate friends and my friends on the other side of the aisle, and they had to squeeze all kinds of things in to justify it and pay for it. That is why the middle class is going to suffer. That is why their kids in college are going to start losing their ability to deduct interest on student loans, and they are going to pay taxes on waived tuition when they get a teaching assistant position or a benefit from the university.                              {time}  1745  That is why your local municipalities are going to lose tax exemption for private activity bonds that fund tens of billions of dollars of public improvements all over the United  That is why 8.8 million Americans are going to lose the ability to deduct medical costs. Good luck to families who have to put people in nursing homes for long-term care, patients suffering dementia. How will they work that financing out when they lose this deduction, and how will they feel when they know the reason they are losing this deduction is to finance a corporate tax rate?  What about homeowners losing the ability to deduct mortgage interest or to have it capped artificially so corporate America can get the biggest tax cut in history?  And, by the way, they get to continue to deduct State and local taxes and other kinds of financial interest-related expenses, but not you, not you the middle class.  It adds $1.5 trillion, and that is with dynamic scoring. Dynamic scoring is another way of saying: We kind of fudged the real number. It is more than that, at least $200 billion more than that.  I thought my friends on the other side of the aisle were fiscal hawks dedicated to making sure we didn't have deficits.  This is an inconsistent bill. This is going to harm middle class  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat this bill, and let's start over in a bipartisan way.

193,topic-id,541,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Smith, Chairman Thornberry, Chairman McCain on the Senate side, and Ranking Member  It is very important that Congress continue this great tradition of passing a Defense Authorization This will be the 57th year. My constituents back home want nothing more than for us to cooperate in a bipartisan fashion for the good of the country. This bill, H.2810, does that.  In particular, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Mike Rogers, who has been a great partner, as we do several very important things:  Number one, modernize our nuclear forces and keep the effort going on nuclear nonproliferation; we fund critical missile defense needs in the face of rising threats from North Korea and other countries; we support U.S.-Israeli missile defense; and we also strengthen, dramatically, our capabilities in space.  This Defense Authorization bill takes a decisive first step to address the fragmentation and lack of focus on national security space issues that the Air Force has shown by reorganizing space within the Air Force and within the Department of  While it does not create the Space Corps that we preferred, it achieves many of the goals that we set out to achieve. Notably, it consolidates acquisition, operations, and training of space forces under the Air Force Space Command and eliminates ineffective or redundant authorities across the Our assets in space, unfortunately, are increasingly vulnerable to attack. This reorganization will begin to provide the focus and coordination necessary to effectively address these growing threats.  I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for his strong leadership in this effort and for making this a bipartisan process.  I would also like to thank the Deputy Secretary of Defense for his engagement on this important issue. We will continue to hold the Department accountable during this transition period.  I am also pleased that the bill begins to counter the vulnerability of our GPS systems in space which underpin many defense and civilian systems. We increase the resiliency and alternatives to GPS, including thinking outside the box, by relying on our allies and perhaps even exploiting Russian or Chinese signals as a means to deter attack on our systems.  The conference also dropped restrictions on extending the new START Treaty, which verifiably limits the number of nuclear weapons that Russia or the United States can deploy.  The bill, more effectively, holds Russia accountable for violating the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty by imposing increasing sanctions related to those violations rather than prematurely nullifying the treaty.  The conference report also encourages a dialogue with Russia and China to reduce risks of miscalculations that could lead to an unintended nuclear war in a crisis. Pressuring Russia, while avoiding an unnecessary nuclear arms race or a precipitous nuclear war, should be top priorities for our defense in the current, more volatile environment.  In this context, I support the increased focus on modernizing our nuclear command and control system, which has been too long over-cost and delayed.  Finally, the bill ends years of wasteful spending on the unaffordable and failed MOX project in South Carolina by allowing the Department of Energy to terminate it and move to a solution at a fraction of the cost.  Mr.Speaker, I support this bill.

493,topic-id,999,"Madam President, only 4 days have passed since the terrible tragedy in Sutherland Springs occurred, and, of course, the grieving and pain of the families who have lost loved ones and who had loved ones injured during the course of that terrible shooting incident--our thoughts and prayers are still with them. I am going to be traveling to Sutherland Springs this weekend to offer my condolences and ongoing support in person. It is important that we give the community the time and space they need to grieve.  By now, we all know that 26 people lost their lives during a church service at the First Baptist This included an unborn child. Twenty more were injured, and some of them still remain in critical condition. What is amazing to me is that First Baptist will hold a church service this Sunday, just 7 days after a gunman stormed the building and committed the deadliest mass shooting in Texas's history. What resilience, what incredible resolve to come together 7 days after this terrible shooting and have the congregation that lost 26 of its members come together for a church service.  One little guy many of us will be praying for is 5-year-old Ryland Ryland was shot four times and was partially shielded by his mother, Joann, who, tragically, did not survive. Ryland is fighting for his life at University Hospital in San Antonio, and he remains in critical condition. I know we will all continue to think of him and pray for his recovery.  We continue to hear more about what led to this atrocity--a gunman with a history of domestic violence, animal cruelty, and mental illness. Because of his troubled history, which included convictions for domestic abuse in the military, he was legally prohibited from purchasing a firearm, but he lied about it. Unfortunately, the background check system, which is supposed to alert the dealer not to sell a firearm to a person with disqualifiers such as his, simply did not come back at all to demonstrate that he was, in fact, disqualified from purchasing a firearm. He was legally disqualified because he had beaten up his wife, had fractured the skull of his stepson, and he was legally disqualified because a military court in New Mexico had handed down a felony sentence for his attacking his own family. But as we know now, and as I have said, that information was not uploaded by the U.Air Force or the Department of Defense in the Federal background check database. Under the law it was supposed to be uploaded, but it wasn't. So he got away with lying about his record.  That is what we have to fix. After terrible incidents like this, the most common question I hear people ask or the most common statement I hear them say is this: We have to do something. But here that something we have to do is crystal clear. Troubled individuals like this monster should never have gained access to a gun. When he tried to purchase them, the person who checked the Federal database should have seen his name and criminal convictions and said: No way, no how.  I have had conversations with many of our colleagues across the aisle and in the Chamber about this problem and what we need to do to fix it. Next week, I plan to introduce legislation to fix these flaws in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and to ensure that all Federal agencies upload required conviction records like these in the NICS system as fast as possible. Clearly, that is not being done now, and we must do it and do it quickly to make sure that other potential killers will not be sold a firearm because of the defects in our National Instant Criminal Background Check It is imperative that this information be shared, that violent felons' convictions be uploaded, and that dangerous individuals not gain illegal access to firearms. Unlike law-abiding citizens, these individuals can't be trusted to do what is right because we know that in the wrong hands, guns can do tremendous harm.  I must add that in the right hands lives can be saved too. All we need to do is regard the actions of Stephen When he heard the gunshots going off in the church, he grabbed his AR-15--what some people call an assault rifle. It is a semiautomatic legal weapon. He is an NRA, or National Rifle Association, certified instructor. He took that gun and shot at this killer to try to stop him from killing more people, and he was successful. He wounded the killer and put himself in harm's way. To me, this demonstrates not only the heroism of Mr.Willeford, but it demonstrates another reason why law-abiding citizens should be able to keep and bear arms, in the terminology of the Second Amendment to the U.Law-abiding gun owners are not a threat to the public safety. It is only so when they get in the hands of felons, the mentally ill, and domestic abusers, like the killer in Sutherland So in the right hands, guns can save lives too.  As somebody who is a sportsman and believes in the Second Amendment and believes that law-abiding citizens ought to be able to keep and bear arms to defend their families and communities, I am proud of the work that Stephen Willeford did on that terrible day. I know there are those who believe that the NRA is somehow complicit in some of these terrible events, but I will tell you that the NRA did us all a favor by training somebody like Stephen Willeford so he was prepared on that horrible day to stop the shooter before he killed more innocent people. I applaud him for it, and I applaud them for teaching people gun safety and self-defense so they can protect their families, their property, and their communities as well.  I yield the floor.

499,topic-id,520,"Mr.President, I agree with the Senator from South This is, indeed, a good day for the families who will benefit from this additional money in their paycheck, from the increased standard of living they will enjoy.  For those of us who want to see businesses come back home from abroad, they fled this country because we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. When we say we want to reform that broken corporate tax rate and to bring those businesses and that money home, we join our colleagues--ranging from the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, to Barack Obama in 2011, in a joint session of the U.Congress--in advocating for bringing that business rate down so that businesses will stay in They will hire Americans, and they will improve wages for all working families.  I am proud to join my fellow Finance Committee colleagues on the floor today to support our version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was just released a few moments ago.  I congratulate Chairman Hatch for his leadership, but I am extraordinarily impressed with all the members of the Finance Committee who worked so hard together to try to get us to where we are today. We plan for lower rates.  As you heard, we increased the standard deduction, we expanded the child tax credit, and we reformed the Tax Code so that we can give Americans access to more jobs and higher wages.  Our Democratic colleagues have said they want tax reform too. I mentioned Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer, our colleague from New York, who repeatedly said that we should lower the corporate rate so businesses will come home, hire Americans, and help our economy grow here. So we are all in agreement on that on a bipartisan basis, and there is room for further agreement.  I agree with the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator We invite our Democratic colleagues to come together and join us, particularly starting on the Finance Committee on  If what we want is more, better paying jobs--and we do--then we have to focus on lowering rates on all the job creators, including small businesses, as you have heard. The framework we have developed was designed to cut taxes for middle-class families, not millionaires. It is to help small businesses grow and create more jobs. It is to provide relief for hard-working families by increasing the standard deduction, as our colleague from South Carolina pointed out. One out of ten taxpayers will now have to itemize deductions in order to take full advantage of the law to reduce their tax burden. So it will be simpler, easier to comply with, and lower their tax rate, while enhancing the child tax credit. These reforms will make the 1,000-page Tax Code easier to understand and comply with. Our efforts will simplify what are[[Page S7142]]now pages upon pages of language that only tax lawyers and lobbyists understand.

1157,topic-id,2473,"Madam President, 2 days ago, I visited the community of Sutherland Springs, TX, which is a small, rural community about 35 miles from San Antonio, We all remember the terrible shooting that occurred there just over a week ago at the First Baptist Church, an event that those in Sutherland Springs and across Texas and maybe even across the Nation will never forget. I hope we never forget it because I believe that those events were, by and large, preventable, and I will explain more about that in a moment.  What I saw during my visit and what I found to be so remarkable is that the community has already started the healing process. Already, the church building that was riddled with bullets and the bodies of people who were killed and injured has been turned into a memorial which will forever mark the terrible events of that day and honor the lives of those who lost their lives.  After an excruciating trial that the rest of us cannot even begin to comprehend, the attitude in Sutherland Springs is incredibly hopeful and resilient. First Baptist held its Sunday service just 7 days after the congregation lost 26 of its members. Can you imagine that--just a week later, showing up for another church service a week after a gunman shot up the church, killing 26 people and injuring 20 more.  I went there for no other purpose than to lend a shoulder to the mourning and to try to offer what little encouragement I could. Strangely, what happened is that the reverse occurred: They gave me more hope and inspiration than I ever could have imagined. This shows how the shooter's ultimate plan failed. Evil never triumphs.  Just ask Pastor Mark Collins, who pointed out that the First Baptist Church has been open for nearly 100 years but that on Sunday, the congregation smashed its alltime attendance record.  Ask Pastor Frank Pomeroy, who lost his 14-year-old daughter in the attack but was already back doing the Lord's work of consoling other members of his church when he himself lost his own 14-year-old daughter. Pastor Pomeroy said: ``We have the freedom to choose, and rather than choose darkness, like the young man did that day, we choose the light.'' He said: ``Love never fails.''  It was an emotional service, to be sure. It was an honor and, as I said, an inspiration to join the Sunday worship service and to visit the church that has been transformed into that stunningly beautiful memorial to commemorate the victims.  The day before, I had had a chance to visit with a number of victims--and their family members--who are recovering in local area hospitals. We cannot forget them as they continue to heal or forget the rest of the 20 who were wounded by the gunman that day--a man who was clearly deranged, was a convicted felon, someone who had been hospitalized for mental illness and had escaped, and someone who had been found guilty of domestic violence against his wife, including the fracturing of his infant stepson's skull.  We now know that when it comes to the shooter, there were plenty of warning signs. The gunman's former colleague has said that he was always on[[Page S7196]]edge and that he scared her both while he was in the Air Force and through disturbing social media posts afterward. There were multiple red flags along the way--school suspensions, threats of killing his superiors, depression, the abuse of animals, choking his wife, as I said, fracturing his stepson's skull, and doing time in a military prison. One thing is abundantly clear: We can do more when it comes to spotting these flags, including in the military.  Where the law currently provides that an individual who is convicted of a felony or convicted of domestic violence or somebody who has been found to be mentally ill by a court--we can make sure and do better to make sure that those individuals do not purchase a firearm. Current law disqualifies them, but unless the results are uploaded on the FBI's background check system, there is no way to catch them when they lie. They are asked when they purchase a firearm at a firearms dealer: Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Have you ever been convicted of domestic violence? Have you ever been committed for mental illness? If they lie and the background check system is simply silent, then there is no way to know and no way to stop them, and that is what happened to this shooter.  We know now that the Air Force and the other branches of the military are considering what additional steps to take to make sure this never happens again. I appreciate their prompt response, but it should never have come down to this.  Now we have to do our part to ensure that this sort of preventable disaster never happens again. Don't get me wrong--I don't believe we can somehow wave a magic wand or pass a law that will prevent manmade disasters in every instance in the future, but this one could have been prevented. We could have kept this shooter from buying a firearm through a legal firearms dealer. If the background check system had been accurate, he would not have been able to do so.  Today, I plan to introduce legislation to ensure that Federal agencies report and upload criminal records onto the background check system--records that are already required to be so but often that are not. As we know, this was a major problem that led to the rampage in Sutherland My bill would also reauthorize the two primary grant programs that help the States report and upload their own records and incentivize States to improve overall compliance.  We know that just down the road in Virginia a few years ago, the records of a young man who had been adjudicated as mentally ill by the State of Virginia had never been uploaded into the background check system. Like this shooter in Sutherland Springs, when he went to purchase a firearm, there was never a hit on the FBI's background check system, and he simply lied about his mental health record.  It has been estimated that some 7 million records--including at least 25 percent of felony convictions and a large number of convictions for misdemeanor domestic violence--have not been posted on the background check system. That is outrageous. I doubt that any of us knew this beforehand, but we know it now, and it is within our power to fix it. We can all agree that this has to change and that this cannot stand.  Let me be clear. I think that law-abiding gun owners, under the Second Amendment, can and should be allowed to purchase and possess firearms. As somebody who enjoys hunting and sports and shooting, I believe that every law-abiding American should possess the same right that I have to purchase firearms for recreation, for hunting, or for defending our families or property. In fact, that is what happened in Sutherland Sutherland Springs proves why guns can save lives when in the hands of law-abiding citizens. But if you have a long, documented history of dangerous behavior, if you are convicted of committing violent acts, under the law, you are not allowed to have guns. Today, we have to ensure that those laws will be enforced, and my bill will help to do that.  This is really an incredible story. When I went to Sutherland Springs, I learned more about Stephen Willeford, whom I have spoken about before. Stephen Willeford lived about a block from the First Baptist Church, and he heard the shooting. I think it was his daughter who alerted him to it. He got his AR-15 out of the gun safe in his home, and he ran about a block away while barefoot. He saw the shooter exit the church. He, in turn, decided that it was up to him because there was not anybody else to stop him.  Mr.Willeford, fortunately, is an NRA-certified shooting instructor and an expert marksman, and he shot and wounded the person who committed this mass atrocity, who then dropped his firearm, got in a truck, and led him on a high-speed chase. Thanks to Mr.Willeford and another Good Samaritan, they chased that shooter until ultimately the shooter took his own life. That shows you what can happen when law-abiding citizens--gun owners--can come to the aid of others. When the police are not present and there is nobody else around, Good Samaritans can help save lives.                               Tax Reform  Madam President, I would like to shift to a separate topic that the Senate will be addressing this week, and that is tax reform.  Last Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee introduced our proposal that would enable more Americans to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks--send less of their money to Uncle Sam here in Washington,  Yesterday, the Senate Finance Committee on which I serve began the markup with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with a series of opening statements. Soon--tomorrow, perhaps--members of the committee will have an opportunity to consider and debate more than 300 filed amendments.  This morning, during the proceedings, some of my colleagues across the aisle complained about the process. They said: This isn't a bipartisan bill.  I said: That is because you have refused so far to participate in the process.  They said: The bill is secret.  I said: Well, you are going to have an opportunity to see it, read it, amend it, and debate it on the Senate floor and in committee.  They then had the audacity to claim that this was all just a giveaway to corporations. I suppose what they would rather see is American jobs go overseas because our punitive Tax Code punishes those businesses in the United States with the highest tax rate in the world at 35 percent. Countries such as Ireland, the U.K., and others have lowered their tax rates and lured American businesses, investment, and job creators overseas. Are we supposed to ignore that and accept it? It would be absolutely irresponsible to do so.  Unfortunately, I think some of our Democratic colleagues feel this is more about political posturing than it is about getting the economy growing again or seeing more money in our paychecks, more money that people can use for their family, for school, for retirement, or for whatever reason they want to use it.  Under our bill, a family of four at median income, which is roughly $70,000 a year, will see a savings of about 40 percent on their tax bill. That may be chump change to the folks here in Washington, DC, inside the beltway, but for hard-working Texans and hard-working Americans, that is money they can use and put to good use. We owe it to them. If we can come up with a fairer, simpler, more competitive tax code, we owe it to them to do so.  I mentioned the 300 amendments that have been filed. It is important to note that Chairman Hatch, just like Chairman Brady in the House Ways and Means Committee, is taking this through the regular legislative process. In other words, anyone who is willing to participate in it can introduce amendments and get a vote on those amendments. You are not guaranteed to win, but you are guaranteed an opportunity to participate and to shape the product. That is the way the Senate and House are supposed to work. Once both legislative houses come up with their version of the tax bill, we reconcile those in a conference committee before we send it to the That is what we intend to do sometime before Christmas this year.  We have had 70 different hearings in the Senate alone, countless working groups, white papers published. We have been working on this for years. Now we finally have the opportunity to get it done.  What is so strange about the criticism that I have heard is that many of[[Page S7197]]our Democratic colleagues, both past and present, have called for many of the reforms included in this legislation that they are now criticizing. They were for it before they were against it.  Their previous support makes sense, because we know tax reform can work. A new study by the Tax Foundation found that our proposal would increase the size of the economy by 3.7 percent. It will increase wages for hard-working American families almost 3 percent. It will create 1 million new jobs. If we reduce the business rate and don't chase jobs overseas, we can attract more investment and more job creation here in The Tax Foundation estimates that this bill will produce nearly 1 million new jobs here in It will, incidentally, provide more than $1.2 trillion of lost revenue for the Federal Government, helping us with our deficit and our debt. The study suggests that families would see an after-tax income boost of 4.4 percent by the end of the decade. In Texas, for example, nearly 77,000 jobs are expected to be created by this plan with an income growth for middle-class families surpassing $2,500 a year.  Notably, by repealing the tax on poor Americans known as the individual mandate--half of it is paid by people who earn $25,000 or less, who can't afford to buy the government-mandated health insurance; they pay the penalty. That amounts to a $43 billion tax on poor people in We intend to repeal that and let them keep that $43 billion over the next 10 years in addition to the tax relief we are providing here.  It is not just the Tax Foundation that has pointed out the positive impacts of our plan; the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has too. Its analysis over last weekend suggests that moderate-income folks--not the high wage earners--would benefit most. In 2019, people in the middle of the income spectrum earning between $50,000 and $70,000 would see their taxes fall by 7.1 percent; those earning less--between $20,000 and $30,000--would see in excess of a 10-percent decline in taxes, according to that report.  I know our Democratic friends have trotted out their old, tired talking points and claimed that tax relief is only for the wealthy. But these facts show otherwise, and it is not an accident. We tried on purpose to make sure that every taxpayer, every person across the spectrum, no matter what their tax rate, sees a reduction in their taxes. The JCT's analysis proves that this is real, and while some of our colleagues can't resist the temptation to demagogue the issue, I would suggest that a more productive use of their time would be for them to join us to try to make this product even better.  I yield the floor.

It is called Presiding Officer duty, not Presiding Officer privilege or honor, because it is reserved for the young Senators who are new to the Senate, such as Senator Sullivan and me. It also means that we actually have to listen to our colleagues' speeches, which doesn't happen very often around here anymore.  This morning I had the privilege of listening to the Democratic leader's speech about our tax bill and the fact that we are going to repeal the hated mandate of ObamaCare as part of this tax bill, and I just can't let stand what he said without correcting the record.  First, the Senator from New York said that we are ``injecting healthcare into the tax bill.'' Injecting healthcare into the tax bill? I would remind him and all the other Democrats who have been denouncing this decision on the Senate Finance Committee that the individual mandate is a tax according not to me, not to Republicans, but to the Obama administration. That is what they argued in 2012 to the Supreme Court, even though they contended throughout the debate on ObamaCare in 2009 and 2010 that it wasn't a tax. In 2012, they argued to the Supreme Court that the ObamaCare mandate is a tax, and the Supreme Court upheld it as a tax.  I am willing to bet that the Democratic leader issued a statement in the summer of 2012 applauding that decision which held that the individual mandate is a tax. After all, it is collected on your 1040. It is collected by the It doesn't get more ``taxy'' than that.  My second point is on the claim that 13 million Americans will lose their insurance--lose their insurance--if we repeal the mandate. Well, two-thirds of the American people want us to repeal the mandate, so they must be up to something. Secondly, let's think about what the mandate repeal does. It doesn't cut a single dime out of Medicaid, it doesn't cut a single dime out of insurance subsidies for people on the exchanges, and it doesn't change a single regulation of All it says is that the IRS cannot fine you for being unable to afford the insurance that ObamaCare made unaffordable in the first place. That is right. Today, if you cannot afford your insurance because ObamaCare made it unaffordable, the IRS will fine you and your family up to $2,000 a year, and that number goes up every year. Let me tell you, more than five out of six households who pay that fine make less than the median income in this country. That is right. That is a direct tax on working families and poor people because they can't afford the insurance that ObamaCare made unaffordable. In Arkansas, there are over 55,000 families who already have to deal with the insecurity and financial hardship of not having health insurance and who then have to pay a fine to the That is why two-thirds of the American people have wanted us to repeal the individual mandate of ObamaCare since the very day that law was passed, and that is why we are about to finally repeal that mandate.  In the meantime, it is going to pay for more tax relief for working-class families. We are going to bring rates down for all of our families, preserve more popular or widely used deductions or credits that help people make ends meet, such as the home mortgage interest deduction credit. It will help them be a little more generous to their church or local charities through the charitable deduction. It will help them offset the cost of some of their property or State and local income taxes--all because we are going to repeal the hated ObamaCare mandate.  I know the Democrats are in high dudgeon these days. Turn on C-SPAN, if you have nothing better to do, and watch the Senate Finance Committee, and they will say: Oh, we are injecting healthcare into the tax bill. Oh, 13 million people are going to lose their insurance.  What we are doing is repealing the most hated tax of ObamaCare and giving the American people the freedom to choose insurance that is right for them without being threatened by a fine from the IRS if that insurance doesn't meet some Washington bureaucrat's definition of what is suitable. That is why two-thirds of the American people support the repeal of the individual mandate, and that is why, when we repeal it, the American people are going to have a big victory, notwithstanding what the Democratic leader or any other Democratic Senator has said.

196,topic-id,565,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.2810, and I want to begin by congratulating Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for their really skillful bipartisan guidance of this measure.  The vote that took place last summer when the House passed it the first time through was the largest bipartisan vote, since 2008, for an NDAA, and that didn't happen by accident. It was because of their great work.  I also want to thank my colleague, Mr.Wittman, on the Seapower and Projection Forces It is a very bipartisan effort, and the result, I think, really demonstrates that, when you do it that way, you get good results.  I also want to congratulate the staff, Dave Sienicki, Phil MacNaughton, and also Lieutenant Commander Dominic Kramer, a Navy fellow who is here today. Their support and work were invaluable in terms of getting the seapower portion of the bill to the really solid place that it is today.  Again, last year, 2016, the Navy came forward with a force structure assessment that said: Based on national security needs around the world, our fleet size needs to grow. When the President's budget came over last May, unfortunately, there were only eight new ships in that budget; but our committee, again, showing its independence as a coequal branch of government, produced a seapower mark that boosted that build rate to 15 and, again, has us now on a pathway to achieve the goal that the Navy identified last year.  In particular, in terms of the undersea fleet, our combatant commanders, whether it is an Asia-Pacific or a European command, have been loudly warning Congress that we should not allow the decline in the fleet size to occur.  This bill, again, authorizes $5.9 billion for the Virginia-class submarine program and provides multiyear procurement authority to enter into a contract for 13 Virginia-class, allowing for a build rate to move from two a year to three fast-attack submarines in 2020, 2022, and 2023.  The National Sea Based Deterrence Fund, which, again, our committee created in 2014, extends continuous production authorities which the Navy has told us will save $383 million in the Columbia-class program, which, again, is about smart procurement, which Mr.Smith referred to at the beginning.  Again, there are other provisions in the bill that I would just note. There was no BRAC that is authorized in this bill. We also gave authority to the United States as part of the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative to provide medical treatment to wounded Ukrainian soldiers, as well as training to Ukrainian healthcare specialists, which our allies desperately need. Again, it is a very, I think, smart move by the committee.  Mr.Speaker, as has been noted, this is the 57th year in a row that we have produced an It is because we follow regular order. It is because we respect both sides of the aisle in terms of the contribution that they make.  We still have meat left on the bone to get the 2018 spending bill done, and hopefully the example that Mr.Thornberry and Mr.Smith set in terms of allowing the process to breathe is the way we are going to get to a successful result, just as we did with 2017.  Again, I want to congratulate the leadership of our committee, and I strongly urge all the Members on both sides of the aisle to support passage of this measure.

Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Neal for his tireless leadership pointing out the trail of broken promises that are in this bill for middle class families, who will pay dearly with higher costs for healthcare, home ownership, and, in many cases, Federal taxes.  I would like to zero in for a minute during National Apprenticeship Week on the broken promise that the bill represents to growing the U.economy, which has a shortage of skilled workers. The obliteration of the student loan interest deduction, which will add $24 billion to the cost of higher education; the taxation of graduate students' tuition waivers, 60 percent of which are concentrated in STEM curricula; and the elimination of tax-free employer-funded tuition assistance, to enhance workplace skills, often using apprenticeship programs, moves this country in exactly the wrong direction to close the skills gap in our workforce, which we all know every Member in this body has heard about from employers back home.  Indeed, America's CEOs told the President last February at a White House manufacturing summit: Jobs exist, skills don't.  In fact, the Trump's Labor Department reported 6.1 million job openings in the month of September, a near record high.

1233,topic-id,1141,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for her leadership.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this bill. We must get flood insurance right, and that starts with affordability. If families can't afford insurance, they simply will not buy it.[[Page H9232]]  In my home State of Florida, the number of NFIP policies has dropped 15 percent since 2012, when Congress started raising premiums. If you don't think the government should be involved in flood insurance, maybe that is good news, maybe that is the goal here, but not for the good of the taxpayer, when families who can't afford coverage must turn to FEMA after a disaster.  The bottom line is that unaffordable insurance will fail. This bill makes flood insurance less affordable, hiking premiums, surcharges, as well as fees. Beyond that, this bill would decrease access to coverage for vulnerable families, forcing them into a private market that does not exist.  Yes, we absolutely need 21st century flood reform. Our climate is changing, sea levels are rising, floods are getting worse, and sticking our heads in the sand will only make solutions that much more difficult.  This bill leaves behind the best reform ideas from both political parties, like better mapping, as well as mitigation.  Those who have lived through natural disasters know you can't stop the catastrophic force of Mother Nature, but you can prepare.  I urge my colleagues to reject this ideological exercise and put people over politics.

Charlie Crist,     House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Charlie: On behalf of Pinellas County, Florida, we      urge you to oppose the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, H.     2874. This bill, which is the compilation of the seven-bill      package approved by the House Financial Services Committee      this summer, is detrimental to Pinellas County residents and      local governments. Despite the minor changes proposed in the      amendment, the bill will increase costs for National Flood      Insurance Program (NFIP) policyholders, create unfunded      mandates by increasing regulatory burdens and      responsibilities for local governments, and lead to fewer      participants in the NFIP, which will undermine the integrity      of the program. We strongly urge you to oppose the bill.       The bill would increase premiums on homes built prior to      the first flood map by a minimum of 6.5% each year, with      properties that have made two or more claims subject to even      higher rate increases. In addition to this increase, all      policy holders would be assessed new and increased fees and      surcharges with some of these fees, such as the reserve fund      fee, increasing each year. As these increased costs are      passed on to policyholders, the bill acknowledges that an      affordability assistance program is needed, however it      delegates that authority to states and requires it to be      financed through additional charges on the other      policyholders in the state, creating an even greater      financial burden. These increased costs along with the new      restrictions in the bill on types of properties that can      obtain coverage through the NFIP will undermine participation      in the program, further destabilizing it. The bill does      nothing to invest in new flood mapping and technology, which      would result in more accurate maps and does not sufficiently      invest in mitigation. We ask for your continued assistance in      ensuring that this bill does not become law.       Additionally, we want to thank you for cosponsoring H.     3285, the Sustainable, Affordable, Fair and Efficient (SAFE)      NFIP The legislation is significantly more consumer-     friendly than the House Financial Services Committee      approach.

In fact, in Montana, 32.5 percent make less than $25,000 a year. This is not just anecdotal. In 2015, if you looked across the Nation, 79 percent of those who paid this tax made less than $50,000 a year. In fact, a little over 37 percent made less than $25,000 a year.

Alternatively, if we do nothing, the CBO projects that we will increase taxes by $43 billion because of this poverty tax and that those taxes will be paid primarily by America's low- and middle-income families--$43 billion in taxes on those who can afford it the least.  ObamaCare's poverty tax must go, and there is no better time to get rid of it than right now. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in fighting on behalf of the low and middle classes of our  Benjamin Franklin is credited with this phrase: Just two things in life are certain--death and taxes.

155,topic-id,322,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to work with Mr.Sherman and the rest of the committee on this bill. It is indeed impressive that it was 59-1 in our committee in its present form. It does do some really good things, and I think the message that it really sends is that it is important for our government agency to lead by example.  The SEC holds people that they oversee accountable for maintaining cybersecurity and protecting personally identifiable information.  What we know: on September 20, Chairman Clayton highlighted that they had had a breach of the EDGAR system. This follows on an April 2016 report by the GAO that highlighted some concerns with their cybersecurity program with The concerning thing is that when Chairman Clayton took over the SEC, he found this so much time afterwards. It wasn't part of his in-briefing. So there is a real concern that there could be some systemic cybersecurity risks there.  I think it is great that our committee came together to provide SEC a mandate to get their own house in order in quick fashion, and to do that with not just their existing products, but with products that are on the cusp of launching: notably, the consolidated audit trail.                              {time}  1615  The consolidated audit trail became the subject of some additional concerns because it is so close to launching.[[Page H9142]]What we are trusting here is that Chairman Clayton does the right thing--takes the message from this vote that we are about to take, and then begins to work with our committee to get this cybersecurity risk under control to provide the assurances that the American people want and that the markets need in order to trust that no more data is collected and made vulnerable than is necessary to accomplish the mission, but that whatever data is made available is secure.

870,topic-id,227,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Emmer for his leadership on this bill.  As a small businessman, prior to coming to Congress, I have raised capital for startups, and I can tell you that one option is no option.  I can tell you that the regulatory framework, particularly made worse by Dodd-Frank, is crippling access to capital for small- and medium-sized businesses. This is a very important thing.  One option is no option, and it is great to have this for small, early-stage companies that are trying to raise capital in private placements. Right now, most of this is done for accredited investors.  Effectively, this protects deal flow for people that are already wealthy. It locks people out of access to capital. Importantly, for the entrepreneur, sometimes in disadvantaged communities, they don't have this vast network of accredited investors to go to. They don't know how to access the They certainly don't have the time or money to spend working with the SEC on regulation. They have a business to grow. They need to have access to their friends and family and this early-stage capital to come in. $500,000 isn't much, but it is a start.

308,topic-id,757,"Mr.Speaker, Republicans are bound and determined to rush through this Congress an immense tax bill before Americans even begin to know what hit them. We need to speak up and inform families about this bill and its many bad parts.  I came here to the House a few weeks ago and said: All you need to know about this tax bill is that it is good for Donald Trump and his billionaire buddies. It rewards those multinational companies that have been shipping jobs and profits offshore for so many years and who think they have no responsibility to pay for our national security and other vital public services.  Well, I am here today to admit that I was in error. All of those things are true. It is about Donald Trump and his billionaire buddies and all the additional money they will pocket. It is about shipping the jobs offshore by multinationals who get a new incentive, a giant, new loophole in this bill, but I was wrong to say that was all that it is about. It also now begins to impact one family after another across America in their healthcare.  It is the same fanaticism that drove Republicans to try to take away healthcare 60-plus different times in the last Congress and the same fanaticism that has caused them to push forward with repeal effort after repeal effort. It is the kind of fanaticism that American citizens stood up to.  It was not only the courageous votes of John McCain, Susan Collins, and other Members in the Senate who stopped this wretched healthcare bill that passed through the House, but it was the fact that Americans kept saying: No, don't take the right that my family has to get access to a family physician. Don't take away my neighbors' or my church members' right to get access to protect their family with healthcare.  Today, we learn that this new tax bill is being changed to do just that. It is another assault on the Affordable Care  In the beginning of the rush to force it through the House long before Thanksgiving, before Americans even get to give it attention, the first step that Republicans took here in the committee that I serve on that considered the tax bill last week was on what we call the Alzheimer's tax.  Currently, American citizens have a right that has long existed in our tax law that if you have really serious medical expenses of over 10 percent of your income, such as a family who earns $50,000--which is now, today, a modest income--and they have over $5,000 in medical expenses, they can deduct those from their taxes.  It is called the Alzheimer's tax because so many of the families that rely on disability to deduct medical expenses are older people who have a family member with Alzheimer's. They need long-term, special care, or they need someone with home health care to come and help them with this very serious problem.  Under the bill that is before us today, they will be denied any right to continue to do that. Under this bill, they will get an opportunity to pay a tax on the dollars they are having to expend for Alzheimer's care.  Of course, it is not just Alzheimer's care. It might be a young family that has a child with a serious disability who requires home health aides or physical therapy, or it might be a woman with breast cancer whose medical coverage does not provide all of the treatment that she needs.  Under this Republican bill, you will no longer be able to deduct one cent for all those serious, burdensome medical bills. No, they want to tax you on what you paid in excess of medical bills.  We have moved today to chapter two. The bill that the House will consider will be merged with a Senate bill. The Senate has declared they will end forever the individual responsibility portions of the Affordable Care Those are the provisions that ensure all Americans will participate so that we will have the largest possible risk pool and that people don't sign up for the Affordable Care Act just after they are sick, after they have a problem. Everyone is there. It is just like you don't sign up for fire insurance after your house is on fire.  It is essential for everyone. We must reject this bill as the wrong way for America to go to deny healthcare coverage and impose more taxes on too many                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9263-3.txt,303,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
543,topic-id,735,"Mr.Speaker, after a treacherous extended game of hide-and-seek, Republicans this week are rushing through this House a wretched tax bill. The future of this sneak attack on America depends upon how quickly the truth can catch up with so many lies.  This bill is just a way to curry favor with Washington's special interests, awarding tax windfalls to large multinational corporations and the fortunate few who sit way up atop the economic ladder.  ``Don't worry,'' Republicans say. ``What middle class people lose to pay for this unbalanced tax cut, will eventually trickle down. With a little fairy dust magically, it will appear in your pocket, and you will get more than ever.''  This is a massive corporate tax break where the tail is wagging the dog of a corporate tax break. The Republican gimmick that Americans are being asked to swallow is the same experience we have had previously. The middle class will not enjoy the benefits of this bill. Both history and arithmetic tell us that.  First, they are borrowing this money--much of it--to finance this tax break from the Chinese and the Saudis, and others whom we have looked to to pay for our immense national debt in the past.  Second, we know from experience that tax breaks like this do not create lasting jobs. But it is even worse than all of that because Republicans are creating a special new loophole for outsourcing so many more American jobs.  Candidate Trump, last year, made a central theme about protecting American jobs and stopping outsourcing, but he has endorsed a tax bill that does just the opposite. It creates a gaping new loophole to encourage greater outsourcing of our jobs and our profits abroad. Here is how it all works:  A multinational investor has a choice to make. Do I invest with new manufacturing in San Antonio, or do I choose Stuttgart or Shanghai? If I invest in America under their proposal, it will be a 20 percent tax on my profits; but if I invest abroad in Shanghai or in Stuttgart, the most I pay is 10 cents on the dollar, and more likely, I don't pay anything because of the way this bill is constructed. The bill will create some new jobs, no doubt, but it is a mighty long commute to Europe or Asia to get one of those jobs.  With the help of Washington's special interests, they have rigged up an even more complex international tax-dodging system that pretends to tax foreign investment at half the U.rate. In[[Page H9185]]fact, it permits many of these companies to funnel even more of their profits into tax havens where their liability in America will end up being zero, and much of their profit will not be taxed anywhere, by anybody.  Whatever happened to making America great?  For Republicans, it is not enough to reward future tax dodging. They want to go back and reward tax dodging from the past. And we sure have had plenty of that because, for years, large multinational firms have exploited these island tax havens, setting up artificial offices in the Bahamas or the Caymans to get their tax bill down to little or nothing, leaving working families and those American-oriented businesses, small businesses, large domestic-oriented businesses, to pay the bill for our national security that they decline to pay.  The recent revelations of the Panama Papers and, more recently, the Paradise Papers, have exposed how these companies use these tax laws.  How did the Republicans respond? By granting multinationals with hoards of taxes that they hold in separate accounts they call offshore but sit right there on Wall Street, by letting them pay less than half of what they owe at a rate much lower than most middle-class families pay. It is another Republican myth meant to convince working families to go along with this proposal. Many of these profits come from those companies that claim they are trapped offshore, but it is only the American people who are trapped by this proposal.  Goldman Sachs, itself, has said repatriation is likely to have a limited effect because repatriated earnings are already working here for domestic activities. There is nothing patriotic about repatriation. This is a tax bill borne by the middle class to benefit the wealthy few and these multinationals, to reward them for what they have been doing in the past, and it must be rejected.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9184-2.txt,303,EISENHOWER MEMORIAL GROUNDBREAKING,2017,14,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since its inception, this program has allowed schools in every State to gain recognition for educational accomplishments, particularly in closing the achievement gaps among students.  Barr-Reeve Elementary School's history traces back to 1910 when it was known as Montgomery School and had 20 students. Today Barr-Reeve Elementary teaches students grades second to fifth and has approximately 290 students.  The school supports students academically through small class sizes. When students face academic challenges, teachers help tutor them before and afterschool as well as during recess.  Barr-Reeve Elementary utilizes innovative technology to learn about the geography and culture of the world on a digital level. Students each benefit from having a Chromebook, enhancing their learning and helping to prepare them for the technology based workplaces they will encounter in the future. Many teachers also utilize the nearby Naval Surface Warfare Center located in Crane, IN, for professional development and to take advantage of its lending library that enhances various STEM skills they can teach to students.  Barr-Reeve Elementary School's staff, students, and families work together to teach and foster values that develop strong character. Each month, a different social skill is modeled and taught throughout the school. Students reinforce these positive behaviors through cards handed out by the student council to recognize students' positive character and leadership skills. The student council also instituted a tutoring program during the lunch recess to allow students to help their peers.  Barr-Reeve Elementary School is an example of how dedication, motivation, collaboration, and strong family engagement in education benefits both students and the local community. At Barr-Reeve, parents are not only involved through an active parent teacher organization, but also as coaches, guest speakers, and volunteers in the classroom.  I am proud to recognize Barr-Reeve Elementary School principal Dena Langacher, the entire staff, the student body, and their families. The effort, dedication, and value you put into education has led not only to this prestigious recognition, but will benefit you and the Montgomery community well into the future.

1159,topic-id,1908,"Madam President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island, and I join him in strong opposition to the nomination of Mr.Steven Bradbury to be the general counsel of the U.Department of Transportation.[[Page S7198]]  Mr.Bradbury is a deeply flawed nominee for many reasons, including his unwillingness to recuse himself from issues involving his former clients and dodging commitments to forgo accepting waivers for recusals. However, my opposition to his nomination is rooted in his troubling record while serving at the Department of Justice during the Bush administration.  As we know, Mr.Bradbury was Acting Attorney General at the Department of Justice from 2005 to 2007 and led the Office of Legal Counsel there from 2005 to 2009. When he was nominated by President George Bush to be Assistant Attorney General in 2004, his nomination was so unacceptable that the majority leader at the time offered to confirm 84 stalled nominees in exchange for the withdrawal of his nomination.  Let me repeat that. The Senate majority leader at the time was willing to accept 84 other nominees in exchange for President Bush withdrawing Mr.Bradbury's nomination.  What Senators objected to then--and the reason I am so strongly opposed to Mr.Bradbury's nomination now--is that Mr.Bradbury is the chief architect of the legal justification that authorized waterboarding and other forms of enhanced interrogation techniques we used to hear a lot about during the last Bush For those who might not be familiar with the term ``enhanced interrogation,'' there is another term for it that most Americans probably are familiar with. It is called ``torture.''  The ``torture memos,'' as they are commonly referred to today, represent a dark period in our Nation's recent history that we must never repeat. In my opinion, his connection to these memos alone should disqualify Mr.Bradbury from government service. I understand he is nominated to serve at the Department of Transportation and not the Department of Justice, but his very willingness in the past to aid and abet torture demonstrates a failure of moral character that makes him dangerous to the American people and to our troops regardless of which agency he is nominated to serve in. Those torture memos displayed a disturbing disregard for the intent of Congress and flouted both international and U.law.  If confirmed, Mr.Bradbury will swear a solemn oath to serve the interests of the American public by providing honest and objective legal analysis to the Department and the administration. I doubt he can carry out that oath.  The American Government would, once again, rely on his counsel to make sure Department of Transportation employees do not subvert the law, the intent of Congress, or the U.Unfortunately, he has let both the government and the American people down before, and I have no confidence that he is capable of carrying out this critically important role. Public servants are supposed to serve the public interests, not the political whims of any President, Democratic or  The public should be alarmed by Mr.Bradbury's history of demonstrating complete deference to a President's policy goals, and we in the Senate should do everything we can to prevent the likelihood of that history continuing in the Trump administration.  For my colleagues who may not be familiar with the programs Mr.Bradbury justified in his legal opinion, let me clarify. Detainees, in his opinion, could be sleep-deprived for up to 180 hours--approximately 7\1/2\ days--forced into stress positions. Sometimes they were shackled to the ceiling, subjected to rectal rehydration and feeding, confined in boxes the size of small dog crates. It was also Mr.Bradbury's legal opinion that led CIA personnel to conduct mock executions. His legal opinion led to one man being waterboarded to the point that he became ``completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.'' His legal opinion also led to another man being frozen to death. Some of these abuses were authorized; others were not, but brutality, once sanctioned, is not easily contained.  In 2005, this body voted 90 to 9 to enact the Detainee Treatment Act to prohibit ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.'' That law was enacted after the Supreme Court decided that terrorism detainees in U.custody were protected by the Geneva However, Mr.Bradbury still found legal loopholes to allow torture to continue.  Even the Department of Justice's own Office of Professional Responsibility criticized him for ``uncritical acceptance'' of the CIA's representations about the torture program. This is stunning, and it cannot simply be dismissed.  In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007, Mr.Bradbury defended the President's questionable interpretation of the Hamdan case, a case where the Supreme Court ruled that President Bush did not have the authority to set up military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay, by famously suggesting the ``President is always right.''  This rubberstamp mentality is extremely dangerous, especially in the Trump administration. What will Mr.Bradbury do if President Trump asks him to come up with a legal justification to abolish laws mandating seat belt use or to come up with ways to negate drunk driving laws?  Let me be clear. Mr.Bradbury didn't make America safer, and he certainly didn't make our men and women in uniform safer either--quite the opposite. The actions Mr.Bradbury helped to justify put our troops and diplomats deployed overseas in greater danger.  This is personal to me because perhaps most disturbingly Mr.Bradbury's efforts to enable torture compromised our Nation's values. Our Nation's military men and women are taught the laws of armed conflict, the proper way to care for detainees, the importance of acting in accordance with American values. Mr.Bradbury's actions at the Department of Justice undermined those values. This type of twisted legal wrangling done at a desk far from the field of battle puts larger targets on the backs of our troops. If captured, are they now at greater risk of being tortured themselves? How we treat prisoners under our control affects how our troops are treated.  Let me read to you Warrant Officer Michael Durant's account of what happened to him when he was shot down and captured in Mogadishu, This is from his book.       DURANT'S fear of being executed or tortured eased after      several days in captivity. After being at the center of that      enraged mob on the day he crashed, he mostly feared being      discovered by the Somalian public. It was a fear shared by      Firimbi--  Who was one of the people guarding him--       The ``propaganda minister'' had clearly grown fond of him.      It was something Durant worked at, part of his survival      training. The two men were together day and night for a week.      Firimbi spoke Italian and Durant spoke some Spanish,      languages similar enough for them to minimally communicate.       Firimbi considered Durant a prisoner of war. He believed      that by treating the pilot humanely, he would improve the      image of Somalis in America upon his release.  Mr.Durant talked at length about how he was treated when he was captured in He talked about going for days without his wounds being cared for, being dragged out of his downed Black Hawk by a mob. He talked about being beaten. He talked about someone sticking a rifle into his room and firing and shooting him, where he had to pull the round out of his own shoulder. He talked about being shackled.  All of that is still better than the treatment that Mr.Bradbury's justifications allow to happen now. It makes our troops' jobs harder and more dangerous, and their job is already pretty dangerous. Take it from me, our troops will do any job we ask of them, but we shouldn't be trying to make those jobs more difficult or dangerous than they already are.  I can tell you from firsthand experience, as someone who has bled behind enemy lines, legal gymnastics are a luxury not afforded our men and women in the field. They are at battle and, more importantly, these justifications do not protect our troops who are sitting on the floor of a POW cell. When you are stuck bleeding in a helicopter behind enemy lines, you hope and pray that if the enemy finds you first, they treat you humanely.  When I was in flight school, I began the first of several periods when I was trained in the art of survival, escape, evasion, and rescue. All pilots received this training. Then, when we were deployed to Iraq, we also, as members of[[Page S7199]]the U.troops overseas who were identified as most likely at risk of being captured among U.troops deployed there, received additional training. This is what the Army told me I could expect upon being captured: I could expect to be raped. I could expect to be beaten. I could expect to be starved.  As I sat in my helicopter thanking God that there was another aircraft there to pull me out, even as the enemy were jumping into their pickup trucks, speeding toward us to try to capture us, the very realities of what Mr.Bradbury was justifying happened to me. It is not something that you can look at from the safety and security of a desk in Our troops face this every single day. This is why this nomination is so incredibly, incredibly troubling.  If the warlords in Somalia recognized the Geneva Conventions and treated Chief Warrant Officer Durant's capture more humanely, what does that say about Mr.Bradbury and his willingness to allow far greater forms of torture than what the Somali warlords were willing to do?  Mr.Bradbury lacked the moral conviction in the Bush White House that Somali warlords possessed in Mogadishu, and I don't think he can be trusted to stand up for the values I fought to defend, especially not in the current administration.  You don't just need to take my word for it. Mr.Bradbury's record speaks for itself, but in case this point isn't clear enough, here is what retired Marine Corps General Charles Krulak wrote to the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee about this nominee just this year on June 26 of 2017:       In his role as acting head of the Department of Justice's      Office of Legal Counsel . . . Mr.Bradbury displayed a      disregard for both U.and international law when      authorizing the use of so-called ``enhanced interrogation      techniques'' to interrogate terrorism suspects.  The general goes on further to say:       These interrogation techniques, which Mr.Bradbury      repeatedly approved, included methods that the United States      has acknowledged and even prosecuted as torture and cruel,      inhuman, and degrading treatment.       The use of these techniques not only violated well-     established law and military doctrine, but also endangered      U.troops and personnel, hindered the war effort, and      betrayed the country's values, damaging the United States'      stature around the world as a beacon for human rights and the      rule of law. We know that the United States is strongest when      it remains faithful to its core values. The use of torture      and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment undermines those      values, and Mr.Bradbury continually represented their use as      legal and advisable during his time serving in the Bush       The general goes on to say further:       In recommending these techniques, Mr.Bradbury also      displayed a discomforting deference to the executive branch's      wishes, tailoring his legal recommendations to fit the White      House's preferred outcome, and even testified in a Senate      Judiciary Committee hearing that ``the President is always      right.'' Mr.Bradbury's recommendations also contradicted the      intent of In 2005, Congress passed the Detainee      Treatment Act with a vote of 90-9. The law prohibited abuse      of detainees by the U.military and agencies, but ",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgS7194-2.txt,2123,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2874, 21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM",2017,14,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
729,topic-id,731,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama for yielding.  First, I want to make a comment about how this process has gone in coming up with this compromise with the amendment on the flood insurance package. We have worked in the Financial Services Committee with outside groups, whether it was the home builders or the realtors or the insurance industry. We have worked with Members of Congress from the Gulf States and[[Page H9193]]from the East Coast and from the West We worked with We had a number meetings with the ranking member of the committee, all taking in their consideration, which has brought us to a compromise that I don't know that anybody loves, but everyone says is a pretty darn good bill that strives to make needed reforms in a program that hasn't been working well. When we have programs that don't work well, let's try to fix them.  We have a program that, as was just mentioned, is $25 billion in debt, but that doesn't include the $16 billion we just gave the program and forgave. So really, it is $41 billion in debt.  So when do we think through the policies of a program that continues to run deficits, number one, but, number two, continues to incentivize people to live in harm's way?  I was down in Houston and I got to see a family who was talking about their next-door neighbor whose house was burning down. He was telling the story about his neighbor, and as the house started on fire, he sent the kids outside--like you would because your house is burning--as the flood waters are rising. The dad went to go put out the fire, and as he was putting out the fire, he looked out the window and saw his kids were being swept away by a flood. The current was too strong, so he ran outside to save his kids and let his house burn.  What are we going to do in that neighborhood that had been flooded three times in the last 10 years?  We are going to rebuild houses in the same flood plain. This doesn't make sense. Let's think about a reform that is going to improve the program, that helps people get out of dangerous areas and get into better areas that don't flood. Having a flooding house isn't a pleasant place to live.  Not only that, first responders risk their lives to go save people, and they die. We are incentivizing through this policy to allow people to live in these dangerous areas. I don't have a lot of time left, but the reforms are going to, yes, gently increase some of the premiums for the most highly subsidized properties called the pre-FIRM properties. We offer over $1 billion in mitigation to help families flood-proof their home or get out of their home and go to a better place to live because this improves the solvency of flood insurance. We are helping them with mitigation.  We are helping them with mapping, allowing communities that haven't been mapped to actually map themselves, to pay for it, to take care of their own future and destiny instead of waiting for the Federal We allow for a private market to come in and offer you a premium that might be lower than the Federal  God forbid we offer a family a choice to let the private sector compete with a public offering. My God, if you get a lower price, that is great. If you don't get a lower price, you can stay in the Federal plan.  My goodness, I am going to have some people come up in a second and say: But you could cherry-pick, and that could jeopardize the solvency of the program.  The program is insolvent. It is $25 billion in debt--actually, $41 billion, if you include that $16 billion. It is not a solvent program.  Just think if in Houston and in Florida we had people who had bought insurance in the private market, we would be saving taxpayers money. This is a commonsense bill that makes the program better, that helps families, that empowers communities. Let's stand together. A little bit of reform might go a long way in making government actually work, so I would encourage all of my colleagues on both side of the aisle to vote ``yes'' for common sense.

In a once-in-a-generation vote, we will vote to cut taxes for the middle class and unleash the power of the American economy.  Our Tax Code is more than 70,000 pages of opaque rules and regulations[[Page H9266]]that cost Americans money and jobs. In critical ways, our Tax Code gives explicit economic advantage to our foreign competitors. That changes with this bill.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act puts the American taxpayer and the American economy first. The bill cuts taxes for individuals and families in every tax bracket.  By lowering rates, doubling the standard deduction, and increasing the child tax credit, hardworking American families can keep more money in their paychecks. The average family of four earning $55,000 will see a tax cut of over $1,000.  This bill will supercharge our economy by making everyone play by the same rules. It substantially reduces taxes on small businesses and manufacturers. This means more jobs, more money, and more opportunity for American workers.  Tax reform is the single best thing we can do for our economy. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9265-7.txt,1E+14,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bill passed the Senate at various times and it passed the House, though never quite in the same year at the same time.  Now we face a crisis, literally. It is a crisis involving hundreds of thousands of these young people across It was just September 5 when the President of the United States announced that he was going to eliminate  DACA was the Executive order of President Obama that allowed these Dreamers to come forward, pay a filing fee of about $500 or $600, submit themselves to a criminal background check, and, after that background check, if they cleared it, to be given a 2-year allowance to live in the United States without fear of deportation--2 years at a time--and the legal capacity to work.

They submitted themselves to criminal background checks, and they ended up getting the protection of They went on to go to school, to go to work, to become teachers or engineers, to go to medical school, and to do things that really mean that they will have a future in this country that will be a benefit to them and to all of us.  So President Trump said that program will end on March 5, 2018, and he established a deadline, for those who were going to see their DACA eligibility end during that period of time, for them to renew. The deadline was October 5. It meant that they had to come forward with the filing fee and at least apply to go through the process again. It was quite a hardship on many of these young people to come up with the money for the filing fee and to realize that the clock was ticking in a very meaningful way about their ability to protect themselves. Many of them stepped forward and asked for help from families, from churches, and from friends to come up with the filing fee to make sure that they renewed their DACA eligibility in time.  Let me tell you what happened to some of them who went through this process.  Here is one case. On September 14, Allison Baker, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society in New York, sent one of these young individuals' application to renew this permit that would let him stay and work in the United States legally as part of The date of September 14 should be remembered because the deadline for filing was October 5. To be sure, this lawyer sent this renewal application for this young man by certified mail. Back in the day when I practiced law, that was one way to make sure you had written proof of when you actually mailed something far in advance of a deadline. Tracking data from the U.Postal Service showed that the envelope arrived in Chicago on September 16. It was mailed from New York on September 14 and arrived in Chicago September 16, on its way to a regional processing warehouse of the U.Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that administers the program known as  Then the packet started circling the Chicago postal system in a mysterious holding pattern. From September 17 to September 19, it was in transit to destination, according to the Postal Then its tracking whereabouts disappeared until October 4, where, once again, the Postal Service assured the sender that it was ``on its way.''  On October 6, the day after the deadline, this certified application, which was sent on September 14, arrived, and the application for this 24-year-old man was rejected by our government.  He wasn't alone. We know of at least 33 other cases just like this. Congressman Luis Gutierrez, of my State of Illinois, told the story of another application renewal sent on September 13 for an October 5 deadline. It arrived on October 6, as well. Another sent their paperwork on September 21. It wasn't received until October 9. What Congressman Gutierrez said is very obvious: Because somebody else did not do their job correctly, we are taking innocent young immigrants and making them deportable. That is unacceptable, Congressman Gutierrez said.  What does the U.Postal Service have to say about what I just read to you, those two or three cases? On Thursday, in a rare admission from a Federal agency, the U.Postal Service took the blame. David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, said that there had been ``an unintentional temporary mail processing delay in the Chicago area.''  Remember what I am saying here. Young people, undocumented had applied successfully and had been accepted into the DACA The President announced he was going to end[[Page S7187]]the program, and those--many of them--had to re-sign up, renew, by October 5. They did it. They mailed it. Their application didn't arrive in time.  It doesn't take a big leap of faith or intelligence to realize what should be done. Clearly, this agency should be giving these young people a chance. Once again, they have done everything they can think of to comply with the law and trust our government. They trusted our government to give them DACA status to allow them to stay in the United States, and they trusted the Postal Service, in a matter of 2 weeks, to be able to deliver a letter.  Yesterday I spoke to the USCIS Director, Francis Cissna, and I asked him about this. I said to him: There must be a way for us to acknowledge the obvious. These young people, in good faith, did everything we could ask of them to comply with the law, and now they have been rejected. Now they are subject to deportation because the Postal Service didn't do its job. I asked him: Are you prepared to at least reconsider this decision and give them a chance to renew their DACA status?  He said he was aware of the situation and that it was being considered at the highest levels of the Department of Homeland  I raise this issue because real lives are at stake. These are real people. These are young men and women who are doing everything they can think of to become part of America's future. They are hiring lawyers, they are raising money, and they are filing the documents that are asked of them in the hopes they can stay in the United States of America, and the system is fighting them every step of the way. In this situation, this is totally unfair.  Our government is better than this. Our people are better than this. Our values are better than this. I am pleading with the Department of Homeland Security and those who are seeking positions in that Department to show some common sense and a little bit of heart when it comes to these young people who are simply trying to make a future for themselves and a better United States of                          Republican Tax Plan  Mr.President, this week, Republicans in Congress are determined to barrel ahead at full speed in a rushed, partisan effort to pass a tax plan at any cost. Make no mistake, for working families in Illinois and across the United States, this is a mistake.  Preliminary analysis from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation revealed that by 2019, more than 13 million Americans who make less than $200,000 a year will experience not a tax cut but a tax increase under the Senate Republican plan. That number jumps from 13 million to 21 million by the year 2025.  In my State of Illinois, taxpayers at every income bracket are going to see their taxes increase for this tax reform that is being pushed through at the last minute of this session.  Fourteen percent of the middle fifth of taxpayers in Illinois--those who are the very definition of middle income--will see an average tax hike under the Senate plan of $1,400. So much for a tax cut. It is a tax increase. Mr.President, I don't know about taxpayers in your State, but in my home State of Illinois, a $1,400 tax hike is a gut punch to a working family.  That is not all. Further analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that in addition to the millions of households which will see their taxes rise under this Senate Republican plan, 53 million households--that is 40 percent of all households earning less than $200,000 per year--will see no significant tax change under the new plan.  Let's be clear. If you are a middle-income family listening to that and you are thinking you might want to take your chances under this Republican plan, please look at the facts. Even if you are one of the lucky ones who manage not to pay more under the Republican tax plan, make no mistake, when this plan blows a $1.5 trillion hole in our Nation's deficit, it will be working families who end up paying the bill.  When Republicans' fake math indeed falls short and the deficit is skyrocketing, the Republican budget has already identified how they are going to pay for these tax cuts in the future. Are you ready? They are going to do it with an additional $470 billion in cuts in Medicare benefits--They are paying for a tax cut for wealthy people by reducing the benefits paid out under Medicare to retired Americans and another $1 trillion cuts in Remember Medicaid? That is the program where the major expense is to maintain the lives and health of two-thirds of Americans who are in nursing homes.  So the Republicans want to give a tax break to the wealthy. They are going to ask seniors who are retired to pay more or receive less from Medicare and make a dramatic cut in Medicaid as well. There is no hiding. Congressional Republicans have made clear that one way or another, working families in America are going to pay for what they call tax reform. At the heart of the Republican playbook for how to bankroll massive tax cuts for the wealthy few and the largest corporations is the elimination of three vital tax breaks for working families.  The House Republican plan will be voted on this week. They are dead set to get this done in a matter of days, and they are going to eliminate in the House plan the medical expense deduction. What does that mean? It means, if someone in your family is diagnosed with a serious illness--God forbid, cancer or whatever it is--and your family ends up incurring massive debts, making sure that person survives, if you incur those debts, you currently can deduct them from your taxes that you pay, but the House Republican plan eliminates the deduction.  In my State of Illinois, 370,000 or more used the medical expense deduction. Their medical bills are that high. The Republicans in the House eliminate that deduction. That isn't going to help working families. It puts them at risk of bankruptcy. The 1 reason for bankruptcy in America is medical bills. The House Republican tax plan makes it tougher. More than 370,000 Illinoisans claim an average of a $10,000 deduction for medical expenses, for hospital care, long-term nursing home care, prescription drug costs. That is just wrong.  There is more. The House plan also eliminates the student loan interest deduction. Think about that for a second. Here, we have 1.5 million young people in Illinois paying off student loans. You know what they face: $20,000, $40,000, $60,000, $80,000 in debt. Some of them are still living in their parents' basement because of their student loans. We give them one little break. You know what it is? The deductibility on the interest on student loans, and yet here comes the Republicans to eliminate that deduction.  Why would we ever want to make it harder for these students and their families to pay off that mountain of debt that they incur going to college? But that is part of the so-called Republican tax reform.  They also include the one provision I know my colleague from New York, the Democratic leader, feels very intensely about because our States share the same problem. This compromise proposed in the Senate eliminates the State and local property tax deduction for State income tax, sales tax, and property tax currently in New York and Illinois and many other We hold to the basic principle, Americans should not have to pay a tax on a tax.  Unfortunately, the Republicans in the Senate believe they want to change that. The net result of that is to increase dramatically the burden so many taxpaying families already face. We have seen increases in our State income tax. We face regular increases in property taxes. This is the one deduction that gives these families a little bit of help, and Republicans are eliminating it.  It was a week ago when I had a press conference with the Realtors in my State and the homebuilders, who are dramatically opposed to the elimination of this deduction and other changes that are being made when it comes to purchasing homes and homeownership. They have told me: If you want real economic growth in Illinois or any State, you start with people who are building and buying homes. Sadly, the Republican approach, when it comes to tax reform, refuses to take that into consideration.  We need to stand up for working families in our States of Illinois and New York and across this This tax reform plan that has been proposed by the Republicans, who are determined to get it done in just a matter of a few[[Page S7188]]days, is going to be damaging to so many, and it is not going to help America grow. Middle-income families are going to pay for the cost of giveaways to the wealthiest taxpayers in  I yield the floor.

486,topic-id,3293,"Mr.President, I would like to speak for a moment about Veterans Day, which is just 2 days away.  On Saturday, November 11, Americans will pause to honor the courage and sacrifice of America's veterans. More than 40 million Americans have served our Nation in uniform, in battles from Bunker Hill to Baghdad, and beyond.  Mr.President, as this Veterans Day approaches, I have been thinking about the words of one of those brave patriots. He is the son and grandson of military leaders. When his time came, he too went to war and suffered horrific deprivation and excruciating injuries.  Years later, he said: ``Few veterans cherish a romantic remembrance of war.'' When wars are fought, he said, ``a million tragedies ensue.''  ``War is wretched beyond description,'' he added, ``and only a fool or a fraud could sentimentalize its cruel reality.''  Those are the words of a man whom I am privileged to call a colleague and a friend, the senior Senator from Arizona, John We owe him and all of our Nation's veterans and their families our profound gratitude and respect for their courage, sacrifices, and[[Page S7133]]the hardships they endured for all of us.  Senator McCain endured more than 5\1/2\ years of torture as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam conflict. When he finally came home, John McCain found another way to serve our Nation with honor. We thank him for that.  Mr.President, this week, the Congress dedicated a commemorative chair to honor all Americans ever held as prisoners of war and to honor the more than 83,000 servicemembers who remain missing in action.  The antique, empty chair will stand in Emancipation Hall in the Capitol as a solemn reminder of the servicemembers who were missing for years in captivity and those who remain missing today.  Mr.President, as we prepare to celebrate this Veterans Day, I want to tell you about another veteran, another patriot, who was also a prisoner of war. His war was World War  Like Senator McCain, he survived, came home, married, raised a family, and spent decades in public service. His name is Richard Everybody calls him Dick He is 93 years old, almost 94. He is a lobbyist in Springfield, IL, the capital of my State and my hometown.  Dick Lockhart does not represent the big, monied interests. He represents the little guys--the nonprofit groups, the public workers, the mental health providers and the families who need them, among others.  He is the senior practicing lobbyist in Illinois, maybe in all of He will be giving up that title soon because, on December 31, Dick Lockhart is retiring at the age of 93 from the firm he founded 60 years ago. He is not stepping down because he is tired. He still works 7 days a week, most weeks. He is still physically strong and is as sharp as a tack mentally. No, Dick Lockhart is retiring because there are other things to do, he says. He wants to travel more and write the book that he has always wanted to write and explain to ordinary citizens how to make their government work better.  Dick's life would make a fascinating book, itself.  Born in Ohio in 1924 as an only child, his family moved to Indiana when he was young. The Great Depression hit the Lockhart family hard. Dick's dad lost his job. Sometimes the electricity was shut off at home for nonpayment. The family never owned a car, never took a vacation, and never ate a meal in a restaurant. Dick delivered newspapers and worked as a soda jerk during high school to help pay for expenses.  He was a student at Purdue University when Japan bombed Pearl Exactly 1 year later, on December 7, 1942, he enlisted in the U.Army infantry.  He was assigned to the Army's 106th Division, the Golden In October of 1944, the 106th shipped out to In early December they arrived in a quiet area of southeastern Belgium, near the German border. Military higher-ups assured the men of the 106th to expect an uneventful few weeks and that Germany would probably surrender before  History had another plan.  In the predawn hours of December 16, German forces launched their last major offensive of the war, the Battle of the The U.forces were outnumbered. Lockhart's regiment, the 423rd, fought for days. Finally--out of food, out of water, and out of ammunition--they surrendered.  In all, some 8,000 U.soldiers were captured at the Battle of the  They were packed into railroad boxcars, crammed in so tightly that soldiers had to take turns sitting and standing. After 2 days of being in those boxcars, they arrived at a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany, known as Stalag IX- Camp life was brutal. Medical care was nonexistent. Men died every day. Meals consisted of only thin ``grass soup.'' On one bitterly cold day, Dick Lockhart was beaten savagely by a German prison guard. Decades later, he still experiences back pain from that beating.  One memory still haunts him.  One day, the prison guards demanded that any Jewish prisoners of war identify themselves. For several hours, no one stepped forward. After more threats, Jewish American soldiers began to step forward, apparently thinking that their U.citizenship would protect them. They were wrong. They were shipped off to a notorious hard-labor camp in another part of  On January 20, 1945, Dick Lockhart turned 21 while a prisoner of war in Stalag IX- On April 2, 1945, American soldiers liberated the camp, Dick Lockhart, and the other prisoners. The Army sent Dick Lockhart home on a 60-day furlough with instructions to get some rest and to gain back some of the weight that he had lost in the prisoner-of-war camp.  He arrived home in Fort He knocked at the door and was stunned to see a stranger open it. Months before, his parents had received a cable that read that their only child was missing in the war and was presumed dead. His mother, overcome with grief, went to Ohio to stay with her family. His father moved away to look for another factory job. Fortunately, they left forwarding addresses, and Dick found them soon and was reunited with his parents.  A month later, while Dick was still on leave, Germany surrendered. The war in Europe was finally over.  Dick had always loved So he decided to use his GI bill to go to Northwestern He became involved in reform politics in Chicago--a battle of a different sort. He married and had two children, a son and a daughter.  In 1958 he founded his own lobbying firm to try to advance democracy through good policies and laws rather than through tanks and bombs.  He is honest, hard-working, modest, empathetic, and always an optimist. He has earned the respect of both sides of the aisle for decades of ethical and professional service in the Illinois General Laws he has helped to pass have made life better for countless people in my home In recognition of that fact, the Illinois General Assembly recently voted to celebrate December 31, which will be Dick's last day on the job, as Richard ``Dick'' Lockhart Day in the State of Illinois--a well-deserved honor.  Five weeks after Dick Lockhart and others were captured, American forces won the Battle of the Bulge, liberated Belgium, and sent the German occupying troops back to  Two years ago, as part of the 70th anniversary of that event, Dick Lockhart returned to The children and grandchildren of the Belgians who had been liberated from Nazi occupation greeted him like a hero. He was honored by the nation's King and Queen in a castle--royal treatment that he and all of the American soldiers richly deserved.  When Dick speaks about his experience as a soldier, he is never the hero of any story. He reserves that role for the young men who didn't come home.  He says: ``There is an inscription in a World War II cemetery that reads, `When you go home, tell them of us and say that for your tomorrow, we gave our today.' ''  At the risk of contradicting my old friend, I have to say that Dick Lockhart is, indeed, an American hero.  This Veterans Day, we say to him and to all of the American veterans: Thank you for your service. Thank you for our freedom. Thank you for all of the tomorrows you purchased for us with your courage and sacrifice.                               healthcare  Mr.President, in 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act with one main goal in mind--to help more Americans get quality, affordable health insurance. And it worked.  Since the law took effect, more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans have gained health coverage, including 1 million in  For the first time ever, our Nation's uninsured rate is below 10 percent. Insurers can no longer deny coverage due to a preexisting condition, charge sky-high premiums for being a woman or having a health history, or impose annual or lifetime caps on your benefits.  Young people can stay on their parents' plans until age 26, and we extended the life of Medicare by a decade. These are real improvements that are saving lives.  Was the law perfect? But did it accomplish its primary goal of ensuring that more Americans could obtain healthcare--regardless of their income, gender, or medical history? Yes, it did.[[Page S7134]]  None of that has mattered to President Trump, who has spent the past 10 months orchestrating a deliberate campaign to sabotage healthcare for tens of millions of American families.  From his first day in office, President Trump directed Federal agencies not to enforce the law. He cut the open enrollment sign-up period in half. He yanked advertisements and slashed outreach and enrollment assistance funding.  And he terminated the cost-sharing reduction subsidies that keep costs down for 7 million As a result, individual market premiums will increase 20 percent next year alone.  President Trump has done everything within his power to sabotage and undermine this law.  Despite President Trump's repeated attempts at repeal and sabotage, the Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land, and that means that quality, affordable healthcare options are available.  And we are right in the midst of Open Starting last week--on November 1--Americans who purchased their health plans in the individual marketplace began signing up for health insurance that covers them next year, in 2018. But you only have 6 weeks to sign up. Open enrollment began November 1, and ends on December 15.  This is your opportunity to buy insurance that covers important health benefits--hospitalizations, prescription drugs, doctor visits, maternity/newborn care, mental health and substance abuse treatment.  And there is financial assistance to help you buy these plans. In fact, 8 out of 10 people who purchase health insurance in the individual market are eligible to receive tax credits that help make that insurance more affordable.  In Illinois, about 350,000 people purchase their health insurance in the individual market, and nearly 300,000 of them are eligible for tax credits that will ensure their health plan premiums are below $100 per month.  So, despite the frenzy in Washington over healthcare: health insurance under the ACA is open for business, and the time to sign up is now. Visit www.healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596. I would encourage everyone to sign up early. Don't wait unitl the last minute.  Speaking of waiting until the last minute, I remain dismayed that this Republican-controlled Congress has failed to reauthorize two incredibly important Federal healthcare programs--the Children's Health Insurance Program and the community health centers program.  Nationwide, 27 million people receive care from community health centers. And 9 million children and pregnant women get their healthcare through the CHIP program, including more than 330,000 kids in  Because of congressional inaction, funding for these two programs expired over a month ago, on October 1. And what have Republican leaders in the Senate done over the past month, while funding has lapsed for children, pregnant women, and our Nation's health clinics?  Well, they passed a budget resolution making it easier to give huge tax cuts to wealthy individuals and big businesses. That is right. While States and health centers are struggling to figure out how to keep their programs operating, while families are worrying about when their health coverage may run out, congressional Republicans are focused on tax breaks for the rich.  Facing this funding uncertainty, States and community health centers are trying to figure out how to keep their programs and clinics operating. Ten States--plus the District of Columbia--will run out of CHIP funding in the next month or so.  For example, later this month, the State of Colorado is planning to send health coverage termination letters to lower income families. The letter reads, in part: ``You are receiving this letter because members of your household are enrolled in the [Children's Health Insurance Program] . . . If Congress does not renew federal funding, CHIP in Colorado will end on January 31, 2018 . . . there is no guarantee that they will.''  Imagine how terrifying it would be to receive this letter, to learn that your child is about to lose their health insurance coverage because Congress is preoccupied with tax breaks for the rich.  It is beyond unacceptable that congressional Republicans abdicated their responsibility to reauthorize these critical health programs.  If we truly want to help the communities and people we serve, let's quickly reauthorize funding for children's health care and for community health centers.  And remember, if you need health insurance next year, you have until December 15 to sign up. Don't miss your chance.               Protecting Our Students and Taxpayers Act  Mr.President, last week, I reintroduced the Protecting Our Students and Taxpayers, or POST, I was pleased to be joined by Senators Reed, Blumenthal, Carper, Murphy, and Warren in the Senate and by Representative Steve Cohen in the  Since 1992, Federal law has required for-profit schools to derive a portion of revenue from non-Federal sources. This was meant to keep for-profit schools, which in general rely much more heavily on Federal dollars than traditional schools, from being completely dependent on Federal taxpayers to keep their doors open.  Originally, these schools had to receive at least 15 percent of their revenue from non-Federal sources. In 1998, the threshold was lowered to only 10 percent, creating today's so-called 90/10 rule. Think about that. Mr.President, $9 out of every $10 these schools take in can come from U.taxpayers. But it gets worse.  Only Department of Education Federal student aid dollars are counted as Federal funds. A loophole in the law excludes billions in Department of Veterans Affairs GI bill education benefits and Department of Defense Tuition Assistance, (TA), funds from being counted as Federal revenue. It means, by recruiting veterans and servicemembers, for-profit colleges can actually receive more than 90 percent of their revenue from Federal funds and still comply with the law. This powerful incentive makes our men and women in uniform targets for predatory for-profit colleges.  I have told these stories before, but I think they bear repeating. I have told the story of two former military recruiters at a for-profit college in They were told their job was above all to put ``butts in classes,'' that they should dig deep into the personal lives of their recruits to find their ``pain point.'' If a prospective student was out of work, recruiters were encouraged to say things like, ``How do you think your wife feels about being married to someone unemployed?''  Entrance requirements were low--it didn't matter how long a student stayed as long as it was long enough for the school to receive the GI bill dollars.  There is Paul Fajardo, a marine veteran who served in He used his GI bill benefits to enroll at the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges and had to live out of his car when his school lost its eligibility to receive GI bill benefits. He told the LA Times that Corinthian recruited him and other veterans because ``they knew it was a guaranteed paycheck.''  There is James Long, who suffered a brain injury when an artillery shell hit his Humvee in He used military benefits to enroll at Ashford University after being heavily recruited. He told Bloomberg News that he knows he is enrolled at Ashford, but can't remember what courses he is enrolled in.  These veterans were nothing more than ATMs for these for-profit colleges intent on pocketing their hard-earned education benefits.  And in 2016, for-profit colleges pocketed 34 percent of all GI bill benefits--$1.7 billion--and 44 percent of all Department of Defense Tuition Assistance funds--$220 million. Mr.President, $2 billion that these for-profit colleges were able to count as non-Federal revenue. Non-Federal?  The last time I checked, the Department of Veterans Affairs was part of the Federal Government, and the money it spends--whether on veterans' healthcare or housing or education--comes from U.taxpayers.  When asked in writing during his confirmation process whether GI bill funds are Federal funds, VA Secretary David Shulkin answered simply, ``Yes.''  And the last time I checked, the Department of Defense was part of the[[Page S7135]]Federal Government, and the money it spends--whether on planes or bombs or servicemembers' education--comes from U.taxpayers.  When I asked Secretary Mattis if Department of Defense Tuition Assistance funds are indeed Federal funds, he responded, ``Yes . . . these benefits are Federal funds.'' Seems like commonsense. Yet the law doesn't see it that way.  That is why my colleagues and I have introduced the POST Our bill will close this ridiculous loophole. It will count all Federal education benefits as Federal revenue and take the targets off the backs of veterans and servicemembers. The bill also reduces the Federal revenue limit to the original 85 percent.  Our legislation is supported by, among others, Student Veterans of America, the Military Officers Association of America, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the National Association for College Admission  Last year, in response to a request from Senator Carper and me, the Department of Education publicly released Federal revenue data for the first time that included VA and DOD benefits. The data showed that 186 for-profit institutions received more than 90 percent of their revenue when these additional Federal education benefits were included. Mr.President, 563 institutions received more than 85 percent of their revenue from Federal taxpayers when all Federal sources were included.  I was disappointed that when the Department released its 90/10 calculations this year, Secretary DeVos did not continue the practice of releasing calculations that included VA and DOD funds, though maybe that shouldn't be surprising. After all, unlike Secretaries Shulkin and Mattis, Secretary DeVos has refused, when asked, to acknowledge the obvious--that VA and DOD education funds are indeed Federal funds or support closing the loophole.  But I am confident that the American people will see the current 90/10 rule for what it is--a loophole that makes no sense and that puts those who have served our country at risk.  This week, on the eve of Veterans Day, I will stand with my friend--Senator Carper of Delaware--as he reintroduces the Military and Veterans Education Protection This bill also closes the 90/10 loophole, but leaves the Federal revenue limit at 90 percent. It is a step in the right direction, and that is why I support it.  I hope our colleagues will consider supporting one or both of these commonsense proposals.  I yield the floor.

531,topic-id,451,"Mr.President, last week my home State of Illinois took a major step forward in protecting student loan borrowers.  On November 7, the Illinois House of Representatives voted 98 to 16 to override Governor Rauner's veto of the Illinois Student Loan Bill of Rights, which was designed to protect student loan borrowers from the well documented abuses of Federal student loan servicers. The Illinois Senate previously voted 37 to 19 to override. With the house's action, the bill became law.  I would like to thank all of those in the general assembly who voted for this bill, including Senator Daniel Biss and Representative Will Guzzardi, who sponsored the legislation. I would also like to thank the legislation's author, Attorney General Lisa Madigan, for her leadership and tireless efforts to investigate and hold Federal student loan servicers accountable.  Federal student loan servicers are contracted by the U.Department of Education to handle the billing and other services related to the repayment of a Federal student loan. Too often, these contractors make it more difficult for students to repay their loans by giving them incorrect or incomplete information and guidance, refusing to provide benefits to which students are entitled under Federal law, or incorrectly processing payments. I have heard complaints about servicers from countless of the 1.5 million Illinoisans holding a cumulative total of $51 billion in Federal student loan debt.  Attorney General Madigan has heard those complaints too. In response, she initiated an investigation which resulted in an ongoing lawsuit against the Nation's largest student loan servicer, Navient has become the poster child for poor customer service and abusive practices that make it more difficult for struggling borrowers to repay their Federal student loans.  The Illinois Student Loan Bill of Rights will help to protect Illinois borrowers from these practices. Among other things, the law requires servicers to inform borrowers about their eligibility for income-driven repayment plans and other affordable repayment options. It also prohibits servicers from misleading borrowers, requires them to correctly process payments, and requires servicers to inform borrowers about their eligibility for loan forgiveness due to a disability or harmful actions by the school.  I have worked at the Federal level to provide similar protections for all student loan borrowers. I authored the Federal Student Loan Borrower Bill of Rights, which I will reintroduce in the coming months. This bill was the basis for reforms to student loan servicing contracts initiated by President Unfortunately, much of that work has been rolled back by Secretary Betsy  Thanks to Attorney General Madigan and the bipartisan actions of the Illinois General Assembly, borrowers in our State will now have new rights and protections that neither Governor Rauner nor Secretary DeVos can take away.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7256.txt,326,DEFEAT THE TAX REFORM PLAN,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

822,topic-id,3370,"Mr.President, I came to the floor yesterday to speak on the devastating impact the Republican tax plan would have on working families in my home State of Illinois and other States across the  It is no secret that the Republican plan would finance massive tax cuts for the wealthiest people in They just can't help themselves. Every time they look at the Tax Code, they think there has to be a way to help the wealthiest people in our country. They usually look at the estate tax, which is paid for by 1 out of every 1,000 Americans, and say: We have just got to spare these poor people who have a net worth of over $11 million from paying any taxes to the government. We have to spare them from paying this government for the benefit that this great Nation has brought to them and their families and businesses. That is where they start.  Then they do the alternative minimum tax, which is a tax that was created so that if your accountants and bookkeepers and lawyers are the sharpest on Earth and ended up finding that you had no tax liability, you still paid a fair share for sustaining this great Nation that you call home. They want to get rid of that, too, or at least dramatically modify it.  They start off with the premise of making these tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America the beginning point of tax reform, these giveaways to people who are not even asking for them. They can't help themselves. They always start there, and the American people know it.  When you ask the American people, what is this tax reform all about, they say it is tax cuts for wealthy people. That is where it always starts, and it does when the Republicans are the authors. That is what we face again.  They try to argue that it is going to help working families. It will help some--let me be honest about that--and yet you are going to find many working families who are going to pay more instead of less because of this so-called tax reform. Why would we ever do that?  Why would we give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America--permanent tax breaks--and then turn around and say to working families: Some of you will get help, but many of you will not.  In my home State of Illinois, the elimination of the State and local tax exemption is going to be devastating to our We are in the top five of States where the people in my State who pay income tax, sales tax, and property tax can deduct those taxes from their Federal income that is subject to taxation.  That is not a new idea. It has been around for decades. It really is premised on the following: Americans should not have to pay tax on a tax. If I pay $100 a month, and I pay my local property taxes, I shouldn't be taxed on that $100. It is a double hit. It is not fair, but the Republican plan believes that is what we should do.  I will tell the seven Republican Congressmen in my State, they ought to go home and ask the people whom they represent what they think about this one, the idea of double taxation that they would vote for and go home and try to defend. I think it is going to be tough, very tough.  It is no secret that these tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations will end up raising taxes on a lot of Americans and blowing a massive hole in the deficit.  I am going to quote a fellow who has been retired a few years from His name is Dave He was a Congressman from Dave Obey used to say over and over again--and I am going to repeat it, and I have credited him with it: Too many times politicians are posing for holy pictures, but when it comes to the deficit and the debt, many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle pose for holy pictures about the national debt whenever there is a Democratic President and then get a swift case of amnesia whenever there is a Republican President.[[Page S7246]]  Here we go again. They are ignoring the reality that the tax cuts they are promoting for the wealthiest and biggest corporations are going to end up blowing a hole in the deficit--a hole in the deficit, which is going to have to be paid for by future generations.  I used to watch as my Republican colleagues would get red in the face talking about our national debt, but that, of course, was under a Democratic Under a Republican President, it doesn't seem to be a major issue. Incidentally, there is a way to plug that hole, and somewhere along the way someone slipped and told us what it was.  If you want to plug the hole of $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthy and big corporations, they propose cutting Medicare benefits and Medicaid benefits, cutting the basic health insurance plans that seniors and people in low-income categories use. Is that a sound policy, to try to patch a hole in the deficit by taking healthcare protection away from senior citizens in America--the 40-plus million who count on it--or those who are under Medicaid? I think it is not.  It turns out that Chairman Hatch had a new surprise for us this week. At 10:30 p.m. last night, Chairman Orrin Hatch released additional changes to this bill, which is evolving before our eyes. It is a bill which was not publicly announced until last Friday and is currently being debated in the hopes that when we return a week after our Thanksgiving recess, we will take it up and vote on it.  Does it seem like it is a hurried operation? Of course, it is. They know that if these bills sit out long enough and people read them and consider them, there will be a lot of questions asked that they can't answer.  Chairman Hatch released additional changes to the bill, and they decided to fund permanent tax cuts for some corporations. That is a high priority for the Republicans--wealthy people, big corporations. So how do they pay for permanent tax cuts for the biggest corporations? It turns out that in addition to raising taxes on working families, the Senate Republican tax bill would also raise health insurance premiums on middle-income families. That is right. The Republicans propose that their tax bill would also repeal parts of the Affordable Care As a result, the Congressional Budget Office tells us that an estimated 13 to 14 million Americans will lose their health insurance protection because of the Republican tax giveaway plan. I thought that plan was supposed to help working families. It ends up taking away their health insurance.  For those who can still remain in the market buying health insurance, they can anticipate their premiums for health insurance going up 10 percent. What kind of tax cut is this that ends up raising the cost of health insurance for working families and ends up eliminating health insurance for many middle-income families?  I find it hard to believe the satisfaction so many Republicans take to be able to boast and brag that they passed a bill that took away health insurance for You are proud of that? I wouldn't be. We should be doing the opposite--expanding the reach of health insurance, making sure every American has the peace of mind and health insurance they need for them and their families.  Remember when Republicans campaigned on the promise of increasing the number of people with insurance and decreasing premiums? This tax bill does just the opposite.  Haven't my Republican colleagues learned the lessons of the ACA--Affordable Care Act--repeal by now? We spent the whole year in a vain effort by the Republicans to repeal and barely replace. The American people don't want it. Overwhelmingly, they are against it.  My hospitals in Illinois and across this Nation don't want what the Republicans are proposing in their bill. Patients don't want it. Nurses don't want it. Clinics don't want it. The disabled community doesn't want it. The Republicans are determined to do it anyway.  Senior leaders are against it, faith leaders are against it, the American people are against it, but this is going to be the feather in the cap for the Republican majority; that by the end of this year, they hope to pass a tax reform bill that is going to give tax breaks to the wealthiest, give a permanent tax break to the biggest corporations, make the middle-income families pay for it, eliminate 13 to 14 million Americans' health insurance, and raise their premiums. What a package. You have to work overtime to put together a package that damaging to working families in America, but that is what they are pushing. That is what they are determined to do.                        Drug Price Transparency  Mr.President, maybe it is the time I turn on my television, but it seems to me I just can't escape drug advertising on television. It just comes one after the other, all kinds of drugs--many of which I can't even pronounce their names, can't remember their names. I can't remember why they are being advertised, and then I listen to all of the things that follow when all these drug ads come on.  My favorite--favorite of all time--is one of these drugs in which it says: Be sure to tell your doctor if you have had a liver transplant. Be sure to tell your doctor if you have had a liver transplant. Imagine going to your doctor for a checkup or physical and talking about your condition and failing to mention you had a liver transplant. That is what one of the ads say, and many of the ads are just as baffling as to the warnings and side effects.  One ad says: Don't take Xarelto if you are allergic to Well, how do I know if I am allergic if I don't take it? So many questions and so many warnings.  How many other countries in the world do you think go through this? How many other countries in the world are there where, when you turn on the television, you get ads for drugs? There must be a lot of them, right? It turns out there is only one other country in the world that does this--New The United States of America and New Zealand are the only two countries in the world that allow direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising.  You ask yourself, when did this come about? It seems relatively new, and it is. This direct-to-consumer advertising was legalized in 1985, but it didn't take off until 1997--that is about 20 years ago--when the Food and Drug Administration eased the requirements for detailing the side effects of the drugs that were being advertised.  After the FDA made that ruling, the drug companies decided to dive into this in a big way. Now you see these fancy commercials with popular music, with celebrity actors, golf clubs, lofty treatment promises. Every hour on television--every hour on television--an average of 80 drug ads are aired. The average American sees nine of these pharmaceutical ads every day--nine of them. In fact, drug companies spend more each year on advertising and sales than the entire budget of the Food and Drug These ads saturate our airways so much that there is now a national conference on drug ads and a hall of fame for the best drug ads. Can you believe it?  As common as these direct-to-consumer drug ads are, drug companies spend four times as much as the cost of these ads on an army of sales representatives who target doctors who write prescriptions. These companies in America spend $20 billion a year trying to get these drugs into the doctors' offices and to get the doctors to prescribe them.  I once talked to a young lady who did that for a living for a while. I said: How does that work? She said: I knew the birthday of every nurse in every doctor's office in my territory. I had a standing order every day for birthday cakes, which I delivered on behalf of my drug company in the hopes that that nurse and that doctor would prescribe my drug, and therefore I would be financially rewarded.  I said: How did you know if they ever prescribed it? Well, it turns out the drug companies can go to the local pharmacies, and although they can't get the names of people receiving them, they can test the volume of sales at each of the pharmacies close to the doctors' offices, and that is one of the ways they measure their success.  So let me ask and answer an obvious question. Why do the biggest pharmaceutical companies in America spend billions of dollars to promote and advertise their drugs? For one reason--it increases sales. It increases their profits. You see, patients are more likely to ask their doctor for a specific drug[[Page S7247]]when they have seen the ad for it, whether they need it or not. That is why most countries have banned direct-to-consumer drug advertising. As I mentioned, only New Zealand and the United States make it legal.  Why is that a problem? One reason is, it promotes overuse of medication for often benign conditions. That bit of dry skin that you have on your elbow, that little stiffness in your knee, hooray. There is a drug for it, and you are going to find out on your television set tonight exactly what it is.  They push pills for every natural condition or cosmetic issue, and we waste money on unnecessary drugs, costs that every one of us pays for when the overall cost of healthcare goes up.  Over the past 20 years, since these direct-to-consumer ads have been allowed, the number of people with five or more prescriptions--five or more in America--has nearly tripled. A primary problem with these ads is that they steer patients toward the most expensive drugs, and that raises the cost of healthcare.  Drugs with ads have nine times more prescriptions than those without. It just stands to reason. What are the most advertised drugs? Let's take a look at a couple of them here.  Humira--incidentally, a prescription for Humira, from the disclosure of the drug company, costs $3,743 a month.  Here is one you probably had to write down three times before you could pronounce it, That costs $3,100 a month, a Pfizer drug. Humira costs $3,700 a month; Xeljanz, $3,100. Both are for rheumatoid arthritis.  The drug industry spent over $100 million in advertising for each of the top 16 brand-name drugs in 2015, which means 50 percent of all direct-to-consumer advertising was just for these 16 medications.  Do you ever see an advertisement during the Super Bowl for a generic, lower cost medication? Of course not. It is the same story when it comes to the $20 billion the same companies spend to butter up doctors so that they will prescribe these drugs. Doctors are more likely to prescribe a specific brand-name drug if they have been marketed by drug companies, while they are more likely to prescribe cheaper generics if not targeted with these ads.  These ads often urge patients to ``ask your doctor if this drug is right for you.'' Well, we asked the doctors whether direct-to-consumer drug advertising was right for America, right for the health of We went straight to the American Medical Association, the largest medical society in the United The American Medical Association has called for a ban on direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising. Here is what they said: ``Direct-to-consumer advertising inflates demand for new and more expensive drugs even when these drugs may not be appropriate.''  If a patient finally figures out how to spell Xeljanz or Xarelto on the third try and comes to the doctor demanding these drugs, the doctor often has a choice. He or she can spend valuable time explaining why the patient doesn't need the drug or why there is a cheaper generic or just write the prescription. It is sad that too many doctors just write the prescription.  Sometimes, with these drug ads it is hard to tell whether the commercial is for a pharmaceutical or a sports car, except you know the price of a BMW before you go buy it. With billions in targeted spending on drug advertising, patients and doctors are bombarded with information--all of those side effects, and ``be sure and tell the doctor if you had a liver transplant''--but they are kept in the dark about one major, important element: What do these drugs cost? Ultimately, somebody is going to pay for them--maybe your insurance company, if you are lucky. If not, maybe it is you and your family. Price disclosure is absent from virtually all of these drug ads.  So when a patient sees an advertisement for Xeljanz or Xarelto, or his family doctor writes a prescription for it, the moment of truth may only occur when the patient finally goes to the pharmacy and sees for the first time what they are facing. No other industry conceals its prices when it comes to consumer goods this way. I think that needs to change. I think American consumers have a right to know--in front, on the ads.  That is why I will be introducing a bill, the Drug-price Transparency in Communications Act, or DTC Act, to require the disclosure of prices in direct-to-consumer ads and promotions to doctors.  The American Medical Association recently adopted a resolution supporting me. In addition to that, my bill is endorsed by the American College of Physicians and the Consumers It is a simple thing: Do American consumers have the right to know when it comes to the cost of these drugs? Do they have the right to know that if you take Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis, you are going to spend $3,100 per month? This bill would have the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission oversee these communications, requiring drug makers to disclose the wholesale acquisition cost, known as the WAC, of the drug.  Now, I am sure the response from Big Pharma, which makes a lot of money, will be to say: Well, that is just not the right price for every patient.  I agree, but when we ask the pharmaceutical companies for better price information, they clam up. They will not answer. As long as they refuse to disclose the true cost of drugs and refuse to provide any transparency in the shell games they run between charging different patients different amounts, we have to stick with the one industry-reported, verified number--the WAC--and that price is what we have put in as the required advertising on each of these drug ads on television.  I have asked a lot of stakeholders for their suggestions about other approaches. I am open to them, but everyone understands this price establishment--this price bottom line--and that is why we used it.  Further, my legislation allows drug companies to explain that patients would pay less than the amount they advertise. But let's also remember that somebody has to pay this high cost. If patients don't pay the WAC price out-of-pocket to the pharmacy, their insurance company just might, which is why health premiums keep going up.  Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois told me that they spend more on prescription pharmaceuticals than they do on in-patient hospital care. This is one of the big drivers in the cost of healthcare.  Is it important that we disclose to consumers what the real costs are of the drugs they are being bombarded with on television? I think so. Doctors, patients, and families agree. If drug makers can fill the airways with pharmaceutical ads, then they should tell the whole story and provide clear information about drug costs.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Gardner). The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

834,topic-id,681,"Mr.President, I want to take a few minutes to thank Judge Ann Claire Williams for her extraordinary service to our country. After serving nearly two decades on the Seventh U.Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, Judge Williams announced she would be retiring from the judiciary later this year.  Ann Claire Williams is a trailblazer. She is the first African American to serve on the Seventh U.Circuit Court of Appeals--an accomplishment that one judge called: ``the desegregation of the 7th Circuit.'' This was just another in a series of firsts for Judge She was one of the first two African-American women to clerk for judges on the Seventh In 1985, Judge Williams became the first African American woman to become a U.District Court judge for the Northern District of She served as chair of the Court Administration and Case Management Committee of the United States Judicial Conference--making her the first African American chair of a Judicial Conference committee. Judge Williams also became the first African American president of the Federal Judges Simply put, almost every step of her career has broken new ground.  Born in Detroit, MI, Ann Claire Williams began her career as a third grade music teacher after graduating from Wayne State University with a bachelor's degree in elementary education and master's degree from the University of Michigan in guidance and counseling. Inspired by the television show ``Perry Mason'' the only lawyer she knew growing up--and a competitive spirit, Ann decided to attend law school. She chose the University of Notre Dame and the rest is history--or more appropriately, the rest of her career made history.  Judge Williams has been the recipient of numerous honors and awards. Here are just a few: Chicago Lawyer 2000 Person of the Year; the Arabella Babb Mansfield Award from the National Association of Women Lawyers; the National Bar Association's Gertrude Rush Award; the American Bar Association's Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award; Chicago Inn of Court's Joel Flaum Award; American Judicature Society's Edward Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award; the Black Women Lawyers' Association of Greater Chicago's Pioneer Award; the Leadership Institute for Women of Color Attorneys, Inc.'s Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award; and was recognized by Newsweek Daily Beast as one of 2012's 150 Fearless Women in the  Judge Williams has always been proud of breaking barriers and her history of firsts, but she doesn't want to be the last. Throughout her career, she has been committed to training young lawyers. As a founding member of the Black Women Lawyers in Chicago, Judge Williams uses her story to inspire the next generation--and makes clear through her experiences that young women today can follow the path she paved to reach the top of their fields. She also serves as chairwoman of the Just The Beginning Foundation to help guide more minority law students into the legal profession. Under Judge Williams' leadership, the organization has grown to include programs for students in high school and middle school across the country. For all her achievements, it is her commitment to the future that is truly inspiring.  Recently, Judge Williams said.       You want to be nourished by people that understand your      story and your experience. But once you're nourished that      means you have to go out and deal with the broader world.  Well, Judge Williams has done just that. She serves on the board of Equal Justice Works, a nonprofit dedicated to creating a just society by training lawyers committed to working in the public interest, and despite her busy schedule, she has made time to travel to Ghana, Rwanda, Liberia, and Uganda to train judges and attorneys.  Judge Williams' career is groundbreaking, and she is a role model for countless young women of color--and an inspiration to the rest of us. I am proud to call her a friend.  I want to congratulate Judge Williams on an outstanding career and thank her for all she has done--and all she will continue to do. The country is grateful for her service. I wish her and her family all the best in her next chapter.[[Page S7152]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7151-2.txt,326,REPUBLICAN TAX SCAM,2017,9,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1174,topic-id,737,"Mr.President, today I want to take a few moments to acknowledge former mayor of Evanston, IL--and my friend--Liz  Liz began her service to Evanston in 1989 on the Evanston Township School After 2 years as president of the board, Liz was appointed to the Evanston City Council in 2003 by Mayor Lorraine Mayor Morton had met Liz years earlier when she was picking up her youngest granddaughter from softball practice. She didn't recognize the new coach and asked about her. It was Liz Liz didn't have a child on the team, but she wanted to lend a helping hand in the community.  When Lorraine Morton became mayor, she always remembered how Liz stepped up just to help other people, so when it came time for Mayor Morton to decide whom she wanted to replace her, the first and only name that came to mind was Liz When Liz was first approached to run, her answer was ``absolutely not,'' but after giving it more thought, Liz answered the call to run to help out Evanston's residents who were leaving the community due to the increasingly high cost of living. Liz Tisdahl wasn't running for mayor to help herself, but like her time coaching that softball team years earlier, she was doing it for other people.  Early in Liz's tenure as mayor, she quickly learned what it meant to be the ``face of Evanston'' and the good she could accomplish. At the time, too many Evanston residents struggled to afford housing, so Liz wrote a Federal grant application and flew to Washington, DC, to lobby for money to expand affordable housing in her community--and it worked. Evanston received an $18 million grant. I remember calling her with the good news. Liz later said that was ``the day that I realized that there really was something to this `being a mayor' thing.''  Liz Tisdahl also has successfully lobbied to secure a designation for a Federal qualified health center in Evanston, resulting in the establishment of the Erie Evanston/Skokie Health Since 2012, the Erie Evanston/Skokie Health Center has treated nearly 12,000 patients and provided immediate care for the residents of  In 2009, when Liz Tisdahl first ran for mayor of Evanston, she campaigned under a simple platform: ``Diversity, Sustainability, and Economic Development.'' First, Liz set out to increase employment. She expanded the Mayor's Summer Youth Employment Program, which had 167 jobs in 2009. Since 2012, the program has grown by 100 jobs each year, employing 750 young people in 2016. Liz also created partnerships with Northwestern University, NorthShore University HealthSystem, and other businesses to establish job training and apprenticeship programs for the community's most vulnerable people. In 2009, the unemployment rate of Evanston was 8 percent. When Mayor Tisdahl left office earlier this year, unemployment was down to 4.1 percent.  Liz Tisdahl also worked to make Evanston greener and--as promised--brought changes to the city's sustainability efforts. According to a 2015 emissions report, Evanston reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 18 percent between 2005 and 2015. In 2014, Evanston became one of America's first two cities to receive a four-star rating from the Sustainability Tools for Assessing and Rating Communities For her environmental work and focus on sustainability issues, Liz received the Climate Protection Award from the U.Conference of  Earlier this year, after two terms in office, Liz Tisdahl decided not to run for a third. When asked why, her answer was simple. Although she loved being mayor, she had accomplished her goals. Liz Tisdahl went out on top.  Despite her many achievements, Liz's proudest accomplishment is her family. Now that she is retired, I know she is enjoying more time with her children and grandchildren, but this isn't the last we have heard from Liz She will continue to be a fearless advocate for the people of Since retiring, Liz has joined the board at Curt's Cafe, an Evanston coffee shop that trains at-risk youth, prepares them to become job-ready, and helps them to transition into full-time employment.

1197,topic-id,605,"Mr.President, on Monday, I was in Crystal Lake, IL, in the 6th Congressional I was joined by realtors and local elected officials to talk about how the GOP tax plan would hurt families in my home State of The families in the 6th Congressional District would be hit especially hard since they are in the 12th highest district in terms of the benefit received from the State and local tax deduction--a deduction that is gutted in the Republican House tax plan.  Republicans released this plan last Thursday, have been marking it up in committee this week, with the plan to have it on the House floor next week.  It is already clear that this partisan plan does nothing more than double-down on some of the most damaging ideas from the framework congressional Republicans and the White House released in September--and the bill gets worse the closer you look.  The House Republican bill would bankroll massive tax cuts for the wealthy few and the largest corporations on the backs of hard-working families in Illinois and across the country.  The bill eliminates some of the most vital tax breaks for people in Illinois--making it so that struggling seniors no longer will be able to deduct costly out-of-pocket medical expenses and that the 1.5 million Illinoisans with Federal student loan debt will no longer be able to deduct the interest paid on those loans.  Congressional Republicans didn't stop at eliminating deductions for medical expenses and student loan interest.  Republicans want to take away one of the most valuable deductions for working families in this State--the State and local tax deduction.  Eliminating this deduction to fund a massive tax cuts for corporations and the ultrawealthy was a centerpiece of the Framework Republicans released earlier this year--a move that would raise taxes on one-third of all taxpayers.  After strong opposition within their ranks for eliminating the State and local tax deduction, the House Republican plan released last week proposes a ``compromise'' to obtain the support of congressional Republicans that represent States like  This so-called compromise eliminates the tax deduction for State and local income taxes, and caps the deduction for property taxes, so instead of eliminating the deduction altogether, they just gut it. If you ask me, that is no compromise at all.  The result is still the same: middle-income families would still be double taxed when it comes to income, sales, and some property taxes--once by the Federal Government and again by the  This would make it more expensive for families to fund services at the local level like the local schools, police and fire departments, and local roads and bridges.  Make no mistake, in Illinois--the State with the fifth highest number of taxpayers claiming the State and local tax deduction--would be hit especially hard. Nearly 2 million Illinoisans--roughly one-third of taxpayers in the State--claimed more than $24 billion in State and local tax deductions in 2015 alone.  If Republicans are successful in eliminating or gutting this deduction, it will mean a tax hike for working families across  If completely eliminated, a family of four living in a place like Crystal Lake making around $76,000 per year would pay more than $1,400 more in taxes each year.  And what do Republicans do with the money from raising taxes on one-third of middle-income families in Illinois? They give the ultrawealthy and the largest corporations a tax cut.  That is just plain wrong.  I urge House Republicans to oppose any tax plan that would raise taxes on middle-income families by gutting the State and local tax deduction in order to give cuts to the largest corporations and richest 1 percent.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7151.txt,326,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,9,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,topic-id,783,"Mr.Speaker, I really do believe that the American people deserve a tax system that invests in our people and our community.  We need to have enough income and enough resources to make sure we are fixing our roads, our bridges, and our transit. We need resources to invest in scientific research for families who are wondering about what the answers just might be for their loved ones who have Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or whatever. We need to be able to defend our country. We need to be able to help people get a good education, healthcare, and housing.  These are things that I believe are well worth investment in as a nation.  Yet when we look at the Republican tax bill, we don't see a bill that reflects the needs of the country to take care of our people. What we see is a mass distribution from working people--middle class people--to the wealthiest Americans in the country.  We need a tax reform--a real tax reform--that protects retirement security for today's seniors and future generations; that provides quality education, job training; that researches new medical cures and renewable forms of energy; and that supports our Nation's children.  Mr.Speaker, we need a tax bill that supports America's families and that can help us do better and live higher quality lives.  But, instead, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act--a bizarrely named piece of legislation because it doesn't do anything for jobs--is in front of us. It is what Republicans offer as tax reform.  But here is what it does, Mr.Speaker: it moves more jobs overseas. This bill gives tax breaks to corporations offshoring jobs, driving down American wages.  How many workers lay in the bed at night looking at the ceiling hoping and praying that the plant doesn't close? How do we explain to them that we are going to cut taxes for these big corporations that would incentivize them to offshore? How do we tell them that?  Is that making America great again? I don't think so. It increases taxes for millions of Thirty-eight million middle class households will see an immediate tax increase--averaging $2,000 by 2026.  Is that what we had in mind when we started talking about tax reform? Absolutely not.                              {time}  1100  This Republican tax bill doubles taxes on American families by making folks pay Federal taxes on taxes you already pay to your State and local government.  It is a good thing when local communities say: We are going to raise taxes on ourselves to meet local needs. When States and cities do that, they have been expecting for literally over 100 years that that would be deductible.  Yet the Federal Government, under the Republican tax plan, wants to take that deduction away, which will have the effect of putting downward pressure on what local and State governments can raise to make their citizens' lives better, beginning a downward spiral. As the Federal Government pays less, the States and cities will get less, and you will see services for people go down the toilet.  At the same time, you will see money not trickle down but geyser up to the richest Double taxation will drive down home values and limit local governments' ability to fund law enforcement--which is police, folks--schools, health services, and infrastructure.  Medical expenses, Mr.The GOP tax bill raises taxes on families who have children with expensive disabilities or adults who need expensive lifesaving treatment for longstanding disabilities because it eliminates the medical expense deduction.  I had a lady named Carol, who is a senior, say: Look, I don't know how I am going to make it without this. I need this.  She met with me in my office just Monday, and she pleaded with me to fight this Republican tax bill, specifically on the elimination of medical expenses.  But what about student loans? We live in a country where there is massive student debt, Mr.If you are one of the 40 million people with student loan debt, you will no longer be able to deduct the interest you pay on these student loans, plus it eliminates the learning credits that make your tuition affordable.  As we all know, if you are rich already, you don't worry about student loan interest because you don't borrow the money, you just pay it. But what about the middle class of America? What about the working class people of America? What about folks who really need it?  Mr.Speaker, as I wrap up, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this Republican tax bill. It would have been nice to have real reform, but we are not getting it. Our only option is to eliminate this particularly sad piece of legislation.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9263.txt,1857,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
859,topic-id,840,"Mr.Speaker, while government isn't meant to create jobs, with the help of the President, Congress can set Federal policies that establish a pro-worker, pro-business environment that lifts people out of poverty, helps families, and drives our country forward.  One problem today that is impeding job growth is access to capital for small businesses. American businessmen and -women are often unable to get the loans they need to start a new enterprise or to grow an existing one.  Additionally, if a firm would like to publicly sell stock to raise money, it must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which costs $2.5 million, on average; an amount most small businesses simply cannot afford.  Small and emerging businesses are a key to the economic engine in The Small Business Administration found that these businesses create over half of the new jobs on an annual basis in this country. More importantly, today's small businesses are tomorrow's success story.  Just think of all the great businesses in this country that started with a dream in a garage: Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Disney, Harley-Davidson, and Minnesota's own We want to empower the entrepreneurs in this country to dream, innovate, and create jobs that grow our economy.  That is why I introduced the Micro Offering Safe Harbor This bill will make it easier for entrepreneurs and[[Page H8669]]small businesses to raise money from family, friends, and their personal network without running afoul of the vague and undefined ``private offering'' safe harbor provisions in the Securities Act of 1933.  Thus, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act helps bring clarity to existing law so that our current and future job creators can easily raise capital within the confines of an easy-to-understand provision without the help of an expert.                              {time}  0930  This legislation requires three specific criteria to be met simultaneously in order to trigger a safe harbor exemption for a security offering instead of just one or more. These criteria ensure that: one, each purchaser has a substantive preexisting relationship with an owner; two, there are no more than 35 purchasers of securities from the issuer that are sold in reliance on the exemption during the 12 months proceeding; and, three, the aggregate amount of all securities sold by the issuers does not exceed $500,000 during the 12-month period preceding the offering. The bill also exempts any of the aforementioned security offerings from blue-sky laws, while maintaining antifraud provisions at the Federal and State level.  These provisions protect Americans from criminals trying to swindle them out of their hard-earned money, while making capital more accessible to businesses by investors from around the country.  In fact, I will be offering an amendment to enhance these antifraud provisions. This amendment, which incorporates the suggestions made by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle during a legislative hearing in the last Congress, will ensure that individuals who have been disqualified under the ``bad actor'' disqualification standard, as is listed under current law, are prohibited from using the exemption provided under H.2201, establishing yet an additional layer of investor protection.  Entrepreneurs and small-business owners need access to capital in order to achieve the American Although small businesses accounted for 99.7 percent of all the businesses in the United States last year, only half of them will survive longer than 5 years, according to our Bureau of Labor  Lack of capital or difficulty accessing capital is one of the main causes of failure for many of these small businesses. A 2015 survey conducted by BlueVine found that 75 percent of small and emerging businessowners reported their primary source of funding comes from their own personal finances, followed by banks at 16 percent and family and friends at 6 percent.  While banks and credit unions do their best to offer the funding these businesses need to grow and thrive, there are still 3 million fewer small business loans made annually, today, than there were before the 2008 financial crisis. H.2201 seeks to build off the success of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, better known as the JOBS Act, and will continue to spur capital formation for the true job creators and drivers of our country's economy.  The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act helps small and emerging companies add another tool to the toolkit, enabling them to confidently find alternative ways of raising these funds without having to pay for costly securities experts and without the fear of lawsuits if they operate within these easy-to-understand parameters.  That is why the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act is endorsed by the National Small Business Association; the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council; the National Federation of Independent Business; the Chamber of Commerce; Heritage Action; and Engine, ``The Voice of Startups in Government.''  The House approved an identical version of this legislation during the 114th Congress as part of the Accelerating Access to Capital Act, and language similar to H.2201 was included in the Financial CHOICE Act, which was adopted by this Chamber in  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

861,topic-id,2727,"Mr.Speaker, the time has come for Congress to come together and help small businesses help themselves by making this important update and improvement to the Securities Act of 1933.  I want to thank Chairman Hensarling; Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment Subcommittee Chairman Huizenga; and all of the staff on the Financial Services Committee for their hard work on this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and hope that both parties will use H.2201 as a way to show their support for more opportunities and better lives for our job creators.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the National Small Business Association, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, the United States Chamber of Commerce, Heritage Action for America, and                              National Small Business     Tom Emmer,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Emmer: On behalf of the National Small      Business Association (NSBA), the nation's first small-     business advocacy organization, with more than 65,000 small-     business members representing every state and every industry      across the country, I commend your leadership for introducing      the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act (H.2201) as it will      have an immediate and direct impact on small businesses      looking to raise capital. NSBA has long supported the kind of      simplification this legislation would bring for small      businesses.       Capital is the lifeblood of any small business, and often      small-business owners need capital at various stages; some at      their startup and others later when they are looking to      expand. Despite this ongoing need, small-business lending      from banks has decreased over the last decade and many small      businesses have few options for obtaining capital. According      to NSBA's 2016 Year-End Economic Report, small-business      access to capital remains stubbornly unchanged since the      previous year, with just 69 percent of small firms reporting      they are able to get adequate financing. This drop has real-     world implications: 41 percent said lack of capital is      hindering their ability to grow their business or expand      operations, and 20 percent said they had to reduce the number      of employees as a result of tight credit.       Therefore, raising capital though securities is an      attractive alternative option for many small-business owners.      However, the current regulatory requirements are quite      onerous for small businesses, often requiring expensive      specialized counsel for even very small securities offerings.       NSBA supports this targeted legislation that creates a safe      harbor for small securities offerings which meet requirements      clearly identified in the legislation. Under the legislation,      these exemptions include offerings in which each purchaser      has a substantive pre-existing relationship with the owners,      where the issuer has less than 35 purchasers utilizing the      exemption in the preceding 12 month period, or where the      total amount raised during the preceding 12 month period is      less than $500,000. By creating three safe harbor exemptions      for ``non-public offerings,'' businesses can operate with      clarity and a clear conscience knowing that they would be      exempted from registering with the Securities and Exchange      Commission (SEC). Additionally, the legislation also exempts      transactions meeting the specified requirements from state      registration requirements, commonly referred to as ``blue sky      laws.''       Raising capital for small businesses from friends and      family already takes place on a regular basis, except those      transactions often lack the legal protections and structure      of securities law. In addition to expanding access to capital      for small businesses, this legislation will bring those      transactions under a recognized legal framework, and make      resolving disputes that arise much more efficient. Finally,      bringing these existing transactions under an existing legal      framework will provide a sound legal basis for subsequent      larger offerings requiring registration with the       Access to capital continues to be one of the most pressing      issues facing the small-business community. All small      businesses need an injection of capital at one point or      another, unfortunately in the past several years it has      become difficult for small businesses to get the funds they      need to grow and expand. NSBA is pleased to support the Micro      Offering Safe Harbor Act as it will help small businesses      around the country expand and create new jobs in their      communities.

Tom Emmer,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Emmer: On behalf of the Small Business      & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) and our nationwide      membership of entrepreneurs and small business owners, I am      writing to voice our support for the Micro Offering Safe      Harbor Act, H.2201.[[Page H8670]]       When it comes to raising capital, the existing regulatory      system is onerous and complex. Even for small securities      offerings, compliance and navigating the rules are very      expensive. H.2201 is a needed solution that makes smart      changes to existing law, providing certainty and an effective      option for small businesses that need to raise capital.       H.2201 would exempt from registration requirements with      the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) offerings made      only to the entrepreneur's friends and family, to less than      35 purchasers, and when $500,000 or less is raised. The      offering would be exempt from state registration and      qualification rules, thus reducing costs and complexity. H.     2201 would appropriately scale SEC rules and regulatory      compliance for our nation's small businesses, which in turn      will provide another practical option for entrepreneurs to      raise the capital they need to start or grow their firms.       The United States has much work to do when it comes to      fostering capital formation and encouraging investment and      entrepreneurship. The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act is a      smart solution that will help many entrepreneurs successfully      start and grow their businesses. Thank you for your      leadership.

Jeb Hensarling,     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,     House of Representatives, Washington,     Maxine Waters,     Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: The      U.Chamber of Commerce strongly supports several bills the      Committee is scheduled to markup on October 11, 2017. The      Chamber appreciates the Committee's ongoing work to enhance      capital formation, hold regulators accountable, and reduce      red tape burdens upon American businesses and consumers. The      Chamber supports the following bills.       H.477, the ``Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions,      Sales, and Brokerage Simplification Act of 2017,'' would      simplify Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)      registration requirements for certain mergers and      acquisitions (M&A) brokers who perform services related to      the transfer of ownership of smaller private companies. The      legislation properly balances regulatory relief for brokers      and businesses involved in such transactions with important      investor protections to prevent abuse. H.477 would require      disclosure of relevant information to investors and would not      exempt M&A brokers from existing rules designed to prevent      those who violate the law from continuing to work in the      securities business.       H.1116, the ``Taking Account of Institutions with Low      Operation Risk (TAILOR) Act of 2017,'' would direct federal      banking regulators to scale rulemakings in order to properly      reflect the various risk profiles of financial institutions.      One of the unfortunate developments in recent years has been      ``one size fits all'' regulation in the banking sector. This      legislation would ensure that community and regional      financial institutions are not forced to comply with      regulatory regimes more suited for global, interconnected      institutions.       H.1585, the ``Fair Investment Opportunities for      Professional Experts Act,'' would expand the definition of      ``accredited investor'' under securities laws by allowing      those who can demonstrate relative education or work      expertise to invest in certain private offerings, regardless      of their income or net worth. In addition to providing Main      Street households with greater opportunities to build wealth,      H.1585 would expand the pool of capital available to      private businesses.       H.1645, the ``Fostering Innovation Act of 2017,'' would      extend the Sarbanes-Oxley 404(b) internal controls exemption      for certain emerging growth companies (EGCs) from five years      to ten. This change would prevent the premature phase out of      one of the more popular provisions of the 2012 Jumpstart our      Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act, and would provide a further      incentive for companies to enter public markets.       H.2201, the ``Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act,'' would      provide a means for businesses to solicit and raise limited      amounts of capital without running afoul of securities laws.      Private businesses would be permitted to seek community-based      financing of up to $500,000 per year in order to expand or      hire new employees. Importantly, the bill includes a number      of robust investor protections that would help prevent fraud      and abuse in the market.       H.2396, the ``Privacy Notification Technical      Clarification Act,'' would amend the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley      Act by clarifying that financial institutions are only      required to send customers annual privacy notifications if      there have been changes in the institution's privacy      policies. It also clarifies that such notices need not be      physically provided to a customer if they are made available      online at the customer's request. These provisions would save      costs for consumers and mitigate confusion related to privacy      notices.       H.2706, the ``Financial Institution Customer Protection      Act of 2017,'' would help prevent another ``Operation      Chokepoint'' by prohibiting federal agencies from directing a      financial institution to terminate an account without a      material, documented reason for doing so. This bill would      ensure that agencies do not unjustifiably discriminate      against certain industries. The bill would also clarify      liability under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,      and Enforcement A House investigation of Operation Choke      Point revealed the Obama administration Department Of Justice      had radically and inappropriately reinterpreted the law.       H.3299, the ``Protecting Consumers Access to Credit Act      of 2017,'' would codify the ``valid-when-made'' doctrine,      which states that the characteristics of a loan are valid at      origination, and are not unenforceable when assigned to      another party. The recent Second Circuit decision in the      Madden vs. Midland Funding, LLC case has undermined this      doctrine and threatens to impose a chilling effect on credit      markets nationwide. H.3299 would restore the longstanding      ``valid-when-made'' legal principle and protect consumers and      businesses that rely on robust credit markets.       H.3312, the ``Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act      of 2017,'' would replace Dodd-Frank's arbitrary asset      threshold for labeling a bank ``systemically important'' with      a multi-factor, tailored assessment that considers size,      interconnectedness, substitutability, complexity, and cross-     jurisdictional. Mid-size and regionals banks do not generate      systemic risk and are critical to small business lending. By      tailoring regulation and rejecting a one-size-fits-all      approach, H.3312 would promote Main Street access to      credit and unlock economic growth.       H.3857, the ``Protecting Advice for Small Savers (PASS)      Act of 2017,'' would repeal the misguided ``fiduciary rule''      issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) in 2016. The DOL rule      was built upon a fundamentally flawed and theoretical      analysis that has been refuted by real life experience. A      recent Chamber survey demonstrated the harm that DOL's rule      is already inflicting upon investors, and we have long called      for the SEC to assert its jurisdiction regarding standards of      conduct for broker-dealers and investment advisers. H.3857      would rightly direct SEC to craft a rulemaking under the      securities laws to protect investors and preserve access to      investment choice.       H.3903, the ``Encouraging Public Offerings Act of      2017,'' would allow any company--regardless of size or EGC      status--to take advantage of the popular provisions under      Title I of the 2012 JOBS Act, which include allowing      investors to submit confidential draft registration      statements with the SEC and to ``test the waters'' before      filing an Title I of the JOBS Act has proven to be a      true policy success, and Congress and the SEC should continue      to explore how more companies can take advantage of its      provisions.       H.3911, the ``Risk-Based Credit Examinations Act of      2017,'' would authorize the SEC to utilize `risk-based'      examinations of Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating      Organizations (NRSROs), which would allow the SEC to focus      its limited resources and prioritize its examination agenda,      while reducing unnecessary compliance burdens on regulated      entities.       H.3948, the ``Protection of Source Code Act,'' would      amend the Securities Act of 1933 to require that the SEC      actually issue a subpoena before requiring a person or entity      to produce trading ``source code.'' Source code is the      intellectual property of certain market participants, and      there is no reason for the SEC to put into place a broad      collection mechanism for such sensitive information. This      legislation is necessary after past attempts by the Commodity      Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to collect source code      without a subpoena.       H.3972, the ``Family Office Technical Correction Act of      2017,'' would provide certainty for ``family offices''      defined under securities laws by clarifying that such offices      are accredited investors. This bill would preserve the      ability of family offices to invest in certain private      offerings and help them remain an important source of capital      for growing businesses.       H.3973, the ``Market Data Protection Act of 2017,''      would delay any reporting to the consolidated audit trail      (CAT) until the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority      (FINRA), and CAT operators develop sufficient cybersecurity      protocols to protect the information that is set to be      collected under the Recent cyberattacks have      demonstrated that vulnerabilities exist within our capital      markets, and H.3973 would help safeguard the personal and      sensitive information of market participants.

It would create an exemption to the Securities      Act registration requirement for businesses that make a      securities offering to 35 or fewer people with whom they have      a pre-existing relationship and that raise $500,000 or less.      This will reduce the need for main street businesses to      retain sophisticated securities counsel and improve their      access to capital.       Heritage Action supports this legislation.                                  ____                                                       Engine,                              San Francisco, CA, October 11, 2017.     Jeb Hensarling,     Chairman, House Committee on Financial Services, House of          Representatives, Washington,     Maxine Waters,     Ranking Member, House Committee on Financial Services, House          of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: On      behalf of Engine and our community of startups,      entrepreneurs, investors, and innovators, I write to express      support for several bills scheduled for consideration before      the House Committee on Financial Services tomorrow.      Specifically, Engine reiterates its support for H.2201,      the ``Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act,'' which will facilitate      capital access for promising startups.       Engine is a nonprofit and advocacy group that supports      high-growth, high-tech startups through research, advocacy,      and policy analysis. We work to foster and promote forward-     looking government policies and a regulatory environment in      which entrepreneurs can launch innovative, new companies that      grow and thrive. Through conversations with diverse startups      across the country, we know that capital access remains a top      challenge in getting a business off the ground.       A large portion of startups rely on small, nonpublic      offerings (also known as a ``private placements''), such as a      ``friends and family'' round, to raise seed capital. In fact,      a 2014 survey by the Kauffman Foundation found that over 28      percent of startups raised some amount of funding from their      personal network. However, the Securities Act does not      clearly define what constitutes a public offering, or      conversely, a nonpublic offering, making it easy for early      stage companies to unintentionally run afoul of the law when      doing a private placement.       H.2201 would create three bright line safe harbor      exemptions for non-public offerings. Under the legislation,      offerings would be exempt from registration with the      Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if each purchaser      has a substantive pre-existing relationship with the issuer,      there are 35 or fewer purchasers, or the amount being raised      does not exceed $500,000. These exemptions would bring much      needed clarity for startups and ensure that a company doing a      small, private placement is not forced to complete burdensome      paperwork or spend precious resources on an expensive lawyer      in order to comply with ambiguous regulatory requirements.       Finally, H.2201 would exempt these micro-offerings from      state blue sky registration and qualification laws,      decreasing the regulatory complexity for startups doing a      small raise.       Engine appreciates the Committee's consideration of this      bill and its continued work on capital access issues for      emerging firms. We look forward to further engagement with      the bills' sponsors and Committee members on these important      issues.

881,topic-id,241,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the amendment I am offering today will enhance antifraud and consumer protections for small businesses and startups seeking to take advantage of the micro offering exemption outlined in the underlying bill.  While the legislation itself requires three specific criteria to be met simultaneously in order to trigger a safe harbor exemption for a security offering, my amendment adds an additional layer of protection to further safeguard investors from bad actors.  Specifically, my amendment prohibits the exemption from being available for those who have been disqualified under the bad actor disqualification standard established by the This language was included with the support of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle during consideration in committee in the 114th Congress, and I am hopeful they will support its inclusion again in the 115th.  I want to reiterate that nothing in the base text of this bill erodes or limits the ability of Federal or State regulators to prosecute fraud, nor would it prevent private common law causes of action for fraud or breach of contract between the interested parties.  This amendment builds upon these existing protections and drives home the point that the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act is purely focused on helping our small businesses and entrepreneurs access the tools they need to grow and create jobs in an orderly and legal manner.

1232,topic-id,231,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, which will reauthorize and reform our National Flood Insurance  The NFIP provides important relief. Millions of Americans rely on this program to provide coverage when disaster strikes. The nearly 50-year-old NFIP program, however, is in desperate need of reform.  Today's legislation will not only reauthorize the program for 5 years, it will take steps to better align premium rates to risk, improve FEMA's mapping and appeals process, and begin to correct the way the NFIP manages what are known as repetitive loss properties.  Most importantly, H.2874 lays the groundwork for a private flood insurance marketplace to take hold, which will improve the fiscal stability and solvency of the NFIP for future generations to come. This bill is a good start, but these reforms must continue to be built upon in the years ahead.  I am thankful for the hard work of Chairman Hensarling, Housing and Insurance Subcommittee Chairman Duffy, and the entire Financial Services Committee staff for working to get this bill to the floor today.

He understands the critical role Congress has to play in our foreign policy and why it is so important that this body take the time to talk about the civil war in Yemen and America's involvement. The United States wields tremendous power, diplomatic, military, and developmental, and we have an obligation to debate how those tools are used.  We have heard about Saudi and Iranian involvement in the civil war in Sadly, Yemenis are caught in the crossfire. The devastation of Yemen's infrastructure has led to 900,000 cholera cases. At least one Yemeni child dies every 10 minutes, on average, from malnutrition, diarrhea, or respiratory tract infections.  Last week, the Saudis intercepted a missile targeting In response, the Saudi-led coalition closed all Yemeni ports of entry. Since last week, no humanitarian assistance has been allowed to enter Fuel shortages are limiting access for USAID partners at a time when more than 75 percent of Yemenis require some level of assistance, including 6.8 million people entirely reliant on food aid. The people of Yemen are facing a very dire situation.  Let's be clear, neither military action nor food aid will solve the conflict in A political solution is essential for moving Yemen towards stability. That will require some compromise, an exit strategy for the Yemeni Government's Gulf partners, and a real commitment by the international community to prevent Iranian weapons from getting into  So what does all this mean for America's role?  As this resolution notes, the United States provides midair refueling for the Saudi-led coalition and participates in intelligence cooperation.  Today's debate reminds us that the United States is engaged with partners around the world under a range of authorities. Some of these activities are covered by a current Authorization for Use of Military Force--AUMF--some are not.  In my view, we should have more clarity about the way we use American military might not just in Yemen, but around the world. After all, it is Congress' responsibility to declare war or to limit a President's authority to wage war when necessary.  I have said for years that we should sunset the 2001 We voted then to give the President authorization to go after the people and groups that attacked on 9/11.

I rise in opposition to this record-breaking closed rule, the 50th closed rule in a year, which is more than any time in any yearly period previously.[[Page H9195]]  I think our rules should be open. I think closed rules are not good for this institution regardless of who does it, and I would urge the majority party to think about open rules so that the legislature can truly work its way.

1108,topic-id,252,"Mr.Speaker, let's put rhetoric aside when it comes to the Republican tax bill. This is a bill that gives tremendous tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires while it hits the middle class.  The facade of it may look like middle class people are getting a tax break, but when you add on all the deductions that they will now no longer be allowed to take, it is a negative for the middle class.  The government is always accused of giving you something in one hand and taking it back in the other hand. A classic bait and switch, that is what this bill is about.  In my home State of New York, which is a high tax State, people will no longer have the ability to deduct State and local taxes or deduct mortgage interest to the degree that they have now.  So when you add it all up, what does it do?  Higher taxes for the middle class, lower taxes for millionaires and billionaires like our President--a classic bait and switch.  When you talk about New York, New York is a donor We give more money to the Federal Government than we get back, and this is just hitting New York in the head again.

814,topic-id,416,"Mr.President, thank you very much.  Mr.President, I appreciate the point made by the Senator from South Dakota, and I am glad to join in this conversation this afternoon.  About a decade ago, the worst economic recession since the Great Depression devastated our middle class households and families across the country. In its aftermath, our economy consistently underachieved.  Last year, the United States saw less than a 2-percent increase in the amount of goods and services we produce. The reason is our stagnant economy, which suffers from an outdated tax system that stifles economic growth through high tax rates and an unreasonable compliance burden. Small businesses, which I am partial to because they make up about 97 percent of employers in Iowa, are taxed as much as 44.6 percent on their profits. Every year, these job creators spend over $18 billion just to comply with Federal tax laws and regulations.  Middle-class families and individuals around this country need some relief. By streamlining our cumbersome tax system and eliminating loopholes that primarily benefit the wealthy, Congress has an opportunity to lower tax rates for middle and lower income wage earners. Likewise, by creating a more competitive tax system for businesses, we can foster greater growth and investment in the United States and boost wages for more  Tax reform also provides Congress with an opportunity to lead by example and offer up its own unnecessary tax break. That is why I introduced the Stop Questionable, Unnecessary, and Excessive Allowances for Legislators Act, also known as the SQUEAL This legislation would eliminate a provision of the Tax Code that allows Members of Congress to deduct up to $3,000 annually in living expenses that they incur while in Washington, As we seek to achieve the ultimate goal of lowering rates for families and small businesses, Congress should start by eliminating handouts to our politicians.  It is long overdue for our country to pursue a simpler tax code that provides much needed relief for hard-working Iowans and that puts our economy back on track. I look forward to working with my colleagues on a path forward that reduces the burden of a complicated tax system--the burden that is placed upon our families, our hard-working individuals, and our small businesses.  With that, I will turn the floor back over to the distinguished Member from South Dakota, and I thank him for accommodating the Members of our class. We are hopeful that we will be able to move forward with smart, effective tax reform.

599,topic-id,664,"Mr.Speaker, the tax bill being considered, H.1, is a frontal assault on the middle class and it will do lasting damage to our country.  The bill is a dishonest bait-and-switch for the 36 million middle and lower class families who will see their taxes increase under this plan to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans and large multinational corporations. It is paid for by eliminating the few remaining benefits in our Tax Code for the middle class and charging $1.7 trillion to the national credit card, leaving our children and our grandchildren to pay for it.  This bill lets the middle class down at every turn, and it should be defeated. It eliminates the deduction for medical expenses, which over 9 million middle class Americans claimed in 2015, including over 1 million taxpayers in my home State of This is especially harmful to older Americans struggling with high medical costs and serious illnesses, like cancer and Alzheimer's, and Americans with disabilities.  It takes direct aim at college students across the country, raising the future costs of higher education by $65 billion over 10 years by eliminating the deductibility of interest on student loans.  It taxes employer tuition assistance benefits for students and tuition waivers for graduate students by treating this as income, making it more expensive for future scientists, medical professionals, educators, and other leaders to get an education.                              {time}  1015  It eliminates the lifetime learning credit and the deductibility of interest of student loans at a time when student loan debt in the United States just reached $1.5 trillion. This is a bitter pill to ask our Nation's student borrowers to swallow.  Very importantly for my constituents, this bill bulldozes the State and local tax deduction. Almost 200,000 of my constituents claimed an average State and local tax deduction of $31,193 in 2015. Under this plan, businesses can still claim this deduction. For example, the National Education Association estimates are that 250,000 education jobs will be put at risk because of this lack of deductibility. Just yesterday, the Fraternal Order of Police spoke out in opposition to this bill's dismantling of this deduction, noting that their salaries and the equipment that they use are paid for by State and local taxes on property sales and income. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that California stands to be the biggest overall loser in this plan and faces a $12.1 billion tax increase in 2017 alone.  The bill also takes aim at the most valuable asset of the middle class:[[Page H9259]]their home. It limits the mortgage interest deduction used by homeowners, and this is eminently unfair. Californians just experienced the worst wildfires in our State's history, with over 14,000 homes lost. What does this bill do? It removes the deductibility for property losses due to natural disasters. I find this to be especially cruel.  What the bill does do is take special care of the wealthiest 5,500 estates in this country by doubling the estate tax exemption to $22 million and then repealing it, removing the whole thing, by 2024.  Finally, the bill has terrible implications for the future of Medicare and the guarantee it has provided for Americans for over 50 years. Without budget changes to offset the $1.5 trillion increase to deficits over 10 years, the bill will trigger automatic spending cuts under the statutory pay-as-you-go.  The Republican majority and the administration claim that this tax plan will ``pay for itself.'' It is bad math, because we were promised in the early 2000s that jobs would be created, that the economy would grow, and the outcome was $1.8 trillion of debt.  The investments that pay off the most are the investments we make in the American people, in education, in job creation, in infrastructure. These are critical areas that always expand our economy.  This House should reject this unfair, unbalanced, fiscally irresponsible plan that dims the future of our country by attacking the middle class.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9258-2.txt,355,21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM ACT,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You have to keep a clean record, get a background check, and a medical exam. Then, and only after then, for a few more years, you can apply for citizenship.

76,topic-id,1236,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from the great State of He has consistently done a very great job in leading these efforts for the Congressional Black Caucus, as well as our chairman, Cedric  Mr.Speaker, this is an interesting time that we are in, obviously, in the country, and it is a rather challenging time. Mr.Speaker, I would like to let[[Page H9164]]you know, last year this time, on November 14, 2016, I was sworn in. So I have been here for 1 year, Mr.In that 1 year, when I stood in this well of this House, I talked about the importance of putting country first and moving America forward.  I said at that particular time that I thought it was extremely important that we work together, and all my colleagues, at that time, from Pennsylvania, stood with me, Democrats and Republicans alike. I talked in this well of the House on November 14, 2016, about the need to concentrate on the people first; that I thought it was extremely essential that we understood that we should talk about the issues that are most important to people and not what is important to us; that we now are in a governance mode, not a political mode.  There will be time to have discussions about political next year, but this particular time we need to put people first.  Mr.Speaker, our country has not seen bipartisan tax reform since 1986, and that was when President Reagan was President of the United States, and Speaker Tip O'Neill was Speaker of this  I think it is safe to say, the U.Tax Code is in need of major facelifting. But let me make it very clear when I say the way the Republican Party and the Trump administration are going about tax reform is all wrong.  One of my main priorities in Congress is to help keep moving the city of Philadelphia forward. The Republican tax bill impedes our ability to move our city forward. At a time when older cities and suburbs are pressed for funding, this destructive tax plan is yet another way the Republican Party is taking resources from our cities.  What do I mean by this?  On Friday past, Mr.Speaker, I joined with the mayor of the city of Philadelphia, Mayor Jim Kenney; the city council president, Darrell Clarke; Congressman Bob Brady; and HELP USA to hold a press conference to call attention to how our neighborhoods would be hard hit by this Republican tax plan.  We stood in front of what used to be a school building in Philadelphia, but has now been transformed into a supportive housing facility that will soon house 37 veterans and individuals aged 55 and older. It is these kinds of investments and transformations that will move our neighborhoods forward that are at stake under the GOP tax plan. We have a lot to lose under the Republican tax plan.  Mr.Speaker, you may recall that the President, at that time, Candidate Trump, went to the city of Philadelphia and asked, specifically targeted to the African-American community: ``What do you have to lose?'' That is what he said.  He talked about the schools. He talked about the neighborhoods. He talked about all of the challenges that we face in urban America and, particularly, to the African-American community.  So, Mr.President, we have a lot to lose under the Republican tax plan. The repeal of private activity bonds would be devastating for hospitals--I have a number of hospitals in my district. Temple University, Einstein, Lankenau, University of Penn, Saint Joseph's University--universities, and other nonprofit institutions in Philadelphia and Montgomery County who depend on these bonds and rely on public-private partnerships to address critical infrastructure needs, finance valued projects, and ensure affordable housing.  The list of harmful provisions in this bait-and-switch tax bill goes on and on.  I just received a letter from Chairwoman Val Arkoosh and Vice Chair Ken Lawrence of the Montgomery County Board of They wrote to me to tell me how residents in Montgomery County are alarmed by what is happening in this tax bill. They are extremely concerned about the fate of the State and local tax deductions. Without SALT, taxpayers are going to be feel an extreme tax hike. They are extremely concerned about the fate of the State and local tax deductions because this will have an extreme impact on local government.  That is just not right, Mr. Just the other day, I spoke with local labor leaders who expressed their great concerns on this tax scam. Mr.Speaker, that is true, it is a tax scam. It is something where jobs will continue to go overseas, not to our communities.  In a district that has 27 percent poverty in the Second Congressional District, I am truly concerned about the loss of jobs. They are incredibly fearful of what this plan means to the lives of hardworking families across our They know it is going to be too many of their families who are going to be among those hit the hardest.  Mr.Speaker, remember what I said when I got elected and sworn in. I said that we need to put people first. This tax scam does not put people first.  These are the stories, fears, and concerns of real people in our neighborhood. These are the people we should be concerned with. These are the people on the front line; people who have serious questions about the intentions of this tax plan.  What is the Republicans' response?  To push it through for a win. Let me repeat that. To push it through for a win. That is wrong and unacceptable.  We are in the business of building a stronger tomorrow for our students, our seniors, our veterans, hardworking families, and all who call our neighborhoods home.  Instead of taking away more resources from our cities and suburbs, we should be looking for ways to build, invest, and enhance the existing infrastructure our cities have to offer to make them what they are, to attract prospective home buyers and current homeowners. Let me repeat that. We should be looking for making ways more attractive to prospective home buyers and current homeowners.  Mr.Speaker, we have a real opportunity here to make a difference. Again, I am happy to be a part of the Congressional Black Caucus under Chairman Richmond's leadership, as well as Mr.Veasey, in leading this effort because this is the kind of effort that we have to raise the consciousness and convince people they must resist.  We must resist, no matter what they say the numbers are, and keep our voices loud so that they can hear that we are not accepting what is taking place here.  Mr.Speaker, I stand here with my colleagues expressing the concern and the outrage that I have about this tax scam. This is not about the people. This is about the interest groups. We have a chance to make a change, Mr.Speaker, and we need to work together.  I said almost 1 year ago on this day, in this well of this House, that the only way we can move America forward is when we work together. I don't say that just to be saying it. I say it because that is what I did when I was in the Pennsylvania Legislature, working together to make a difference. That is the only way we are going to move the needle, when people work together.

Statutory constraints limit the      ability of these agencies to share data and thus to achieve      higher efficiency for Federal statistical programs.       ``(3) The quality of Federal statistics depends on the      willingness of businesses to respond to statistical surveys.      Reducing reporting burdens will increase response rates, and      therefore lead to more accurate characterizations of the      economy.       ``(4) Enhanced sharing of business data among the Bureau of      the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau      of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes will      improve their ability to track more accurately the large and      rapidly changing nature of United States business. In      particular, the statistical agencies will be able to better      ensure that businesses are consistently classified in      appropriate industries, resolve data anomalies, produce      statistical samples that are consistently adjusted for the      entry and exit of new businesses in a timely manner, and      correct faulty reporting errors quickly and efficiently.       ``(5) Congress enacted the International Investment and      Trade in Services Survey Act (Public Law 94-472), which      allowed the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic      Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to share data on      foreign-owned companies. The Act not only expanded detailed      industry coverage from 135 industries to over 800 industries      with no increase in the data collected from respondents but      also demonstrated how data sharing can result in the creation      of valuable data products.       ``(6) With part B of this subchapter, the sharing of      business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of      Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics      continues to ensure the highest level of confidentiality for      respondents to statistical surveys.[[Page H9287]]       ``3576.

612,topic-id,761,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am here today to support H.4174, introduced by Speaker Ryan and of which I am an original cosponsor.  The American people deserve an efficient and effective Federal I think we can all agree on that. Taxpayers have the right to know their money is being spent wisely. All too often, decisionmakers throughout the Federal Government make choices without sufficient evidence and data to inform them and guide them in making those decisions.  In the previous Congress, Speaker Ryan and Senator Patty Murray introduced the bicameral and bipartisan Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission Act of 2016. The Commission was charged with studying and making recommendations related to access and use of evidence to support effective policymaking. Believe it or not, they finished in about a year.  The Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking released their report September 7 of this year. The Commission made 22 recommendations on how to improve how evidence is accessed, produced, secured, and maintained by the Federal  On September 26, 2017, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing entitled ``Recommendations of the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking.'' At that hearing, four members of the Commission explained the intent of the recommendations and the need for more evidence to improve policymaking.  According to Ron Haskins, the co-chair of the Commission, evidence showed that many of the Nation's social programs produced modest to no impacts.  H.4174, the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2017, addresses several recommendations from the final report issued by the  The bill lays the groundwork for critical examination of what is working and what is not working in the Federal Policy decisions should be based on facts. Those folks of my generation will remember Sergeant Joe Friday in ``Dragnet:'' ``Just the facts, ma'am.''  That is what we are trying to get ahold of here.  According to the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking, too little evidence is produced in the Federal Government to meet this need. The Commission also found cumbersome and idiosyncratic data access procedures create confusion, impose unnecessary costs, and are a barrier to evidence building.  Additionally, according to the Government Accountability Office, agencies' continued lack of evaluations may be the greatest barrier to their informing managers and policymakers and constitutes a lost opportunity to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of limited government resources.  These barriers are standing between the taxpayers and the effective government that they had paid for and that they deserve.  H.4174 removes some of the barriers the Commission identified and encourages agencies to expand the use of evidence in decisionmaking.  First, each agency will need to designate a chief evaluation officer and submit annual evidence-building plans to Congress and the Office of Management and This bill also establishes an advisory committee to review, analyze, and make recommendations on how to expand access to and use of data for evidence building.  It also includes the OPEN Government Data Act that Representative Kilmer and I introduced. The OPEN Government Data Act addresses the Commission's recommendation to expand access to information about data. The OPEN Government Data Act requires Federal agencies to develop a comprehensive inventory of Federal data and increases access to specific data assets that are appropriate for public release. This isn't personally identifiable, confidential, private, or classified information.  It also establishes an open-by-default standard for Federal data, meaning data will be available under an open format and open license, and it will be[[Page H9290]]in a machine-readable format. We are going to crowdsource some of this evidence building. We are going to let the private sector or nonprofits or whomever access this data, find ways to use it, build data, and, again, get more bang for the taxpayer's dollar.  The bill further improves data management and collection by codifying the position of chief data officer and clarifying the CDO roles and responsibilities.  Finally, H.4174 establishes a process by which statistical agencies can access data, ensure effective and consistent privacy protections, and develop methods to reduce the sensitivity of data. This will expand opportunities for use of the data by the evidence-building community.  The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2017 was reported favorably out of the House Committee on Oversight and Government  I come back to the bottom line on this: Americans expect policymakers to make decisions based on facts.

1161,topic-id,3205,"Mr.President, I want to begin by thanking the Senator from Not only did she serve this country, she sacrificed for this country. I for one, as I see her rolling up and down the aisles and through the halls, am just so proud and so thankful for her, for her family, for her work, and particularly I thank her for these comments. I think the Senator is very worthy, and I am delighted to be her colleague.  Mr.President, I, too, rise in strong opposition to the confirmation of Steven Bradbury to serve as general counsel in the Department of  Steven Bradbury has a troubling history of disregard for United States and international law and seems unable to offer objective legal analysis. Both of these troubling characteristics were on display when he helped justify the CIA's torture program.  I was on the Intelligence Committee during this period of time--and still am--and one of the things we wanted to see were the Office of Legal Counsel memoranda. The OLC memos were never given to us, although individuals from the Department came and spoke to us about them.  Steven Bradbury was head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel from 2005 to 2009. During that time, he wrote four legal memos--finally declassified, finally here--and this is what they look like. Those memos provided the legal foundation for waterboarding and other interrogation techniques that were tantamount to torture.  The first memo, written on May 10, 2005, concludes that the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques was lawful. This memo, which addressed torture techniques including waterboarding, was written to replace the previous classified Office of Legal Counsel opinions.  The second memo, also written on May 10, found that the use of multiple interrogation techniques would not violate U.law because there would be no severe mental pain or suffering, just physical distress.  The third memo, written on May 30, 2005, reaffirmed a previous OLC opinion that the CIA's use of torture, such as waterboarding, was not prohibited by the Convention against Torture, so long as it was done overseas. That memo also concluded that constitutional prohibitions against cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment or punishment did not apply.  The fourth memo, written on July 20, 2007, concluded that the continued use of six enhanced interrogation techniques by the CIA, including forced nudity and extended sleep deprivation, did not violate the Detainee Treatment Act or the War Crimes Act or the Geneva  By writing these four memos, Bradbury not only provided the feeble foundation upon which the CIA violated well-established law and military doctrine, he also endangered U.troops--as the Senator from Illinois has pointed out--betrayed our country's values, and compromised our standing as a world leader.  The tactics used by the CIA were not only more brutal than was known, they also didn't produce actionable intelligence. We have a 7,000-page document, with 32,000 footnotes, which took 6 years of reviewing cables and information--all factual, not declassified, and a summary was declassified--and to date, nothing in it has been contradicted. Capturing terror suspects and torturing them in secret facilities failed.  Among Bradbury's many troubling conclusions in these memos were that neither the Constitution's prohibitions against inhumane treatment nor the U.Convention Against Torture applied to the CIA's activities outside U.territory. That is interesting.  Even more troubling, Bradbury's 2007 memo was written with the purpose of evading congressional intent. It is stunning that the head of the Office of Legal Counsel would knowingly work to find loopholes in the law to justify the use of torture.  On October 5, 2005, the Senate voted 90 to 9 to approve the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. This law stated: ``No individual in the custody or under the physical control of the United States Government, regardless of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.''  However, less than 2 years later, Bradbury's fourth torture memo explicitly allowed the CIA to continue many of the abusive interrogation techniques that Congress clearly intended to prohibit in the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. These include forced nudity and extended sleep deprivation. This should be a disqualifier for[[Page S7204]]continued service in the U.Government, regardless of the position, I believe.  It is true that Congress settled this matter in June of 2015 when, thanks to Senator McCain, we voted overwhelmingly to prohibit torture in that year's National Defense Authorization Act, but that doesn't change the fact that Bradbury did his best to bypass Congress a decade earlier by writing those torture memos.  It is also true that as general counsel of the Transportation Department, Bradbury wouldn't be tasked with duties connected to detainees. But by ignoring the intent of Congress in order to justify the CIA's continued use of torture, Bradbury ignored the law to achieve a desired result and that is unacceptable.  Even the Justice Department found fault with Bradbury's actions. After the OLC torture memos came to light, the Department of Justice conducted an investigation of the facts and the circumstances surrounding those memos and DOJ's role in the implementation of the CIA interrogation program.  On June 29, 2009, the Justice Department found ``serious concerns'' about the objectivity and reasonableness of Bradbury's work. This included evidence that he gave into pressure in order to produce opinions that would allow the CIA torture program to continue.  The Department of Justice report cited several Bush administration officials who believed Bradbury was producing opinions with the goal of allowing the program to continue.  Jim Comey, who served as Deputy Attorney General at the time of Bradbury's memos, said there was significant pressure from the White House--specifically Vice President Cheney and his staff--to allow the program to continue. Comey said that one would have to be ``an idiot not to know what was wanted.'' Comey also said that in his opinion, Bradbury knew that ``if he rendered an opinion that shut down or hobbled the [interrogation] program the Vice President . . . would be furious.''  John Bellinger, who in 2007 served as legal advisor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, wrote to Bradbury and stated that he was ``concerned that the [2007 Bradbury] opinion's careful parsing of statutory and treaty terms'' would be considered ``a work of advocacy to achieve a desired outcome.''  The DOJ was also concerned that Bradbury relied too heavily on the CIA's reviews of its own interrogation program, which of course were positive.  During a time when we needed independent voices in government to check the CIA's actions, Bradbury failed to rise to the occasion. He failed to fulfill the responsibilities of his position.  The Senate twice refused to confirm Bradbury as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel during the Bush administration because of this very issue. Nothing has changed since that time. I urge my colleagues to oppose his nomination.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Strange). The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr.Mr.President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the nomination of Steven Bradbury to be the general counsel of the Department of I must say to my colleagues, of the years that I have been here, I never thought that we would be considering the nomination of a person who supported the commission of what the Geneva Convention says are war crimes. That is a serious, serious issue. And the Constitution charges the Senate to give its advice and consent to senior executive branch nominations as a check against the appointment of people to an important government position who, because of one failure or another, should not be entrusted with the interests of the American people. I do not believe that Mr.Bradbury deserves that public trust, and I will oppose his nomination. I am astonished that we are here, considering the nomination of a person who is in violation of the Geneva Convention, the rules of war to which the United States of America is signatory.  Some of us remember that Mr.Bradbury served as the acting head of the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel from 2005 to 2009. During this time, he authored a few of what have become to be known infamously as the torture memos, which provided the legal justifications for 13 types of enhanced interrogation techniques employed by the CIA against detainees held by the United States under law of war authorities.  My dear friends and colleagues, the term ``enhanced interrogation techniques'' is a euphemism. These memos provided a legal framework for the use of methods that include waterboarding, which is a mock execution and an exquisite form of torture in which the victim suffers the terrible sensation of drowning. In discussing this practice, we are speaking of an interrogation technique that dates from the Spanish Inquisition and has been a prosecutable offense for over a century. It is among the crimes for which Japanese war criminals were tried and hanged following World War II and was employed by the infamous Khmer Rouge in I repeat. The Japanese war criminals were tried and hanged following World War II for--guess what--waterboarding. Of course, the Khmer Rouge, whom we all know about, was also one of those.  I must say to my colleagues that in the years I have been here in the U.Senate, I never believed that I would be voting against an individual who justified the practice of torture. All you have to do is read the Geneva Conventions, to which the United States of America is signatory, and you will see that Mr.Bradbury's memos, which basically justified torture, were in direct contravention.  The memos of which Mr.Bradbury was the author provided the justifications for the inhumane interrogation of detainees by using methods such as forced nudity and humiliation, facial and abdominal slapping, dietary manipulation, stress positions, cramped confinement, striking, and more than 48 hours of sleep deprivation. I would challenge Mr.Bradbury to go through 48 hours of sleep deprivation before he signs off on another memo. Worse, the legal justifications for these techniques were interpreted to permit their use simultaneously, over long periods of time, which constituted what I and many others who are familiar with these techniques believe are torture--torture inflicted by the representatives of a Nation founded on the ideal that all people are born with equal dignity and that even enemies who scorn our ideals, once they are our prisoners, are to be spared cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.  The memos authored, in part, by Mr.Bradbury justified the use of these techniques under article 16 of the United Nations Convention against Torture and declared them not in contravention to article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, which prohibits ``outrages upon personal dignity''--those are the Geneva Conventions to which the United States is signatory--and violence to a life of a person. Most people, including, I am sure, Mr.Bradbury, have never been tightly bound, made to remain in a stress position, and deprived of sleep for 48 hours. Let me assure my colleagues that anyone who has suffered such treatment will know that he has been tortured.  The two main memos that Mr.Bradbury wrote and signed were entitled ``Application of United States Obligations Under Article 16 of the Convention Against Torture to Certain Techniques that May Be Used in the Interrogation of High Value al Qaeda Detainees'' and ``Application of the War Crimes Act, the Detainee Treatment Act, and Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions to Certain Techniques that May Be Used by the CIA in the Interrogation of High Value al Qaeda Detainees.''  In the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's study of detention and interrogation program, CIA leadership and interrogators frequently cited these two Bradbury memos as the legal justification that permitted them to use enhanced interrogation techniques. These techniques amounted to de facto torture. Put simply, Mr.Bradbury's memos were permission slips for torture. I repeat to my colleagues who are about to vote for him that his memos were permission slips for torture.[[Page S7205]]  I wonder, of someone who is responsible for what he justifies, how he sleeps. I wonder how he gets rest. Doesn't the face of that person who has been deprived of sleep for 48 hours ever pop into his mind?  I have long said that I understand the reasons that governed the decision to approve these interrogation methods, and I know that those who approved them and those who employed them in the interrogation of captured terrorists were dedicated to protecting the American people from harm. I know that they were determined to keep faith with the victims of terrorism and prove to our enemies that the United States would pursue justice relentlessly and successfully no matter how long it took. I know that their responsibilities were grave and urgent and that the strain of their duty was considerable. I admire their dedication and love of country, but I argued then and I argue now that it was wrong to use these methods, that it undermined our security interests, and that it contradicted the ideals that define us and which we have sacrificed so much to defend.  While Mr.Bradbury has justified his work on these torture memos as the duty of a lawyer representing his client, the Commander in Chief of the United States, I believe that he had a higher duty, as do all who serve this country, to defend our most cherished ideals from wholesale violation in the name of self-defense. Leave aside the fact that, as intelligence-gathering tools, torture is mostly useless and has been proven to be so by the record assembled by the Intelligence We have led by example and sacrificed blood and treasure to advance our ideals around the world only to undermine our good reputation in a crucible in which we allowed fears to get the better of our decency.  While it is true, as Mr.Bradbury and his supporters claim, that the memos issued under his name improved upon the sloppy and more expansive legal work done by his predecessors, I do not think that that absolves Mr.Bradbury of his role in this dark chapter of American history. Indeed, a more meticulous justification for torture is still a justification for torture--and, arguably, a more pernicious one.  Let's not pretend that there was no direct connection between the legal work done by Mr.Bradbury and the abuses that followed. The memos that bear his name made it possible for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed--a monster and a murderer, to be sure, but a detainee held in U.custody under the laws of armed conflict--to be waterboarded 183 times. I repeat. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times. This technique was used so gratuitously that even those applying it eventually came to believe that there was no reason to continue. They were ordered to do so anyway.  The memos also made it possible for Abu Zubaydah, an alleged al-Qaida operative, to be subjected to waterboarding two to four times a day, rendering him so distressed that he was unable to speak. The damaging effects of waterboarding cannot be overstated. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on torture, Zubaydah's waterboarding sessions ``resulted in immediate fluid intake and involuntary leg, chest and arm spasms'' and hysterical pleas. In at least one session, ``Zubaydah became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth,'' and he required medical intervention.  The memos that bear Mr.Bradbury's name also made it possible for a Libyan detainee and his wife to be rendered to a foreign country where the woman was bound and gagged, while being several months pregnant, and photographed naked as several American intelligence officers watched.  I wonder what our average citizens would think when we tell them that an agent of the American Government took a woman who was several months pregnant and bound, gagged, and photographed her naked as several American intelligence officers watched. I am told that that picture still exists somewhere in the archives that has recorded this shameful period in our history.  In voting against Mr.Bradbury's nomination, as I also voted last week for similar reasons against Mr.Steven Engel's nomination to head the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, I am making it clear that I will not support any nominee who justified the use of torture by The laws of war were carefully created to be precise and technical in nature but also to leave room for interpretation, even at the risk of abuse by the executive branch. This makes the duty of government lawyers all the more significant. They must serve as guardians of our ideals and our obligations under international law. They are the safeguards and checks on the conscience of our government, and I cannot in good faith vote to confirm lawyers who have fallen short in this awesome responsibility.  I will cast my vote against Mr.Bradbury, not because I believe him to be unpatriotic or malevolent but because I believe that what is at stake in this confirmation vote, much as what we stand to gain or lose in the war we are still fighting transcends the immediate matter before us. Ultimately, this is not about Mr.Bradbury; this is not about terrorists. This is about us--who we are and who we will be in the future.  This is about what we lose when, by official policy or official neglect, we allow, confuse, or encourage those who fight this war for us to forget that best sense of ourselves. This is our greatest strength: When we fight to defend our security, we also fight for an idea--not a tribe, not a land, not a King, not a twisted interpretation of an ancient religion but for an idea that all men are created equal and endowed with unalienable rights.  It is indispensable to our success in this war that those we ask to fight it know that in the discharge of their responsibilities to our country, they are expected never to forget that they are Americans and the defenders of a sacred idea of how nations should be governed and conduct their relations with others, even our enemies.  Those of us who have given them this enormous duty are obliged by our history and the many terrible sacrifices that have been made in our defense to make clear to them that they need not risk our country's honor to prevail and that they are always, always, always Americans--and different, stronger, and better than those who would destroy us.  Mr.Bradbury's work many years ago did a disservice to our Nation and its defenders. I cannot in good conscience give him my trust to serve us again.  I am confident, because of the way this system works, that Mr.Bradbury will be confirmed, probably. This is a dark, dark chapter in the history of the United States We are legitimizing offenses against the code of the Geneva We are harming the commitment that our forefathers made that we are all created equal. Unfortunately, we have now betrayed that sacred trust.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

494,topic-id,1224,"Madam President, I rise today to share my strong support[[Page S7139]]for Steve Grasz, who has been nominated by President Trump to fill a vacancy on the U.Court of Appeals for the Eighth The junior Senator from Nebraska and I asked Nebraskans to express their interest in this position, and we conducted a thorough process of the applicants. I must say that, with more than 5,700 lawyers, Nebraska proved itself to have a talented legal community that has demonstrated an unwavering dedication to the rule of law.  However, in our search, one candidate stood out above the rest, and that was Steve He is an outstanding Nebraskan and a talented legal mind. The President agreed. That is why he accepted our recommendation in August, and he nominated Steve for the Eighth  Like so many other Nebraskans I have heard from during this process, the President recognized Steve's temperament, intellect, and skill as worthy on the Federal bench.  Steve excelled in his education at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the University of Nebraska College of He then built a distinguished legal career, practicing appellate litigation over the past three decades. For 12 years, Steve served Nebraska as the chief deputy attorney general. He did so with dedication to justice, passionately defending our citizens and upholding the laws of our  Steve has handled numerous constitutional litigation matters in the Nebraska Supreme Court, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the U.Supreme In doing so, he has earned the respect of the Nebraska legal community.  For many years Steve has earned the Martindale-Hubbell ``AV Preeminent'' peer review rating, the very highest available. This peer-reviewed rating is based on legal knowledge and ethical standards, a nonpartisan litmus test.  Steve also serves on the executive committee of the appellate practice section of the Nebraska Bar Association, and he was selected as a fellow by the Nebraska State Bar Foundation, an honor reserved only for the top lawyers in my Nebraskans agreed that Steve has the extensive legal experience needed to serve on the Eighth Yet the American Bar Association has rated Steve as ``not qualified'' for this position on the Federal bench.  As someone who spent months reviewing Steve's extraordinary qualifications for this judgeship, I was shocked when I heard the assessment. Something didn't add up.  But after a review of how the evaluation was conducted, things became more clear. The ABA rating of Steve Grasz appears to be based on his work defending Nebraska's pro-life laws as well as his personal views, which he shares with a majority of Both evaluators discounted his remarkable legal career, choosing instead to focus on innuendo in their report because he associates with political organizations they disagree with.  There is nothing wrong with participating in the democratic process. Indeed, Steve's own evaluators have done just that. Steve's first evaluator, Cynthia Nance, has received several awards from the Democratic Party of His second evaluator, Laurence Pulgram, a San Francisco attorney, works as a liberal activist and has donated thousands of dollars to the Democratic Again, the fact that these Americans have decided to engage in the political process is not shameful. They have every right to do so, just like everyone else. But here is the problem. They claim to be leading an impartial evaluation of Steve, when in fact they are really trying to take down his nomination and further their own political agenda.  A deeper review of the ABA evaluation shows a report that is long on anonymous sources and short on substantiated evidence.  This is not the first time that the ABA has been criticized for using anonymous sources, either. In 2006, while discussing Vanessa Bryan's ABA rating, the senior Senator from Connecticut stated:       I have even greater concern with the credibility of      anonymous sources when those sources are used as evidence for      a subjective characteristic such as judicial temperament. . .      . I urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to only consider      anonymous criticisms when such criticisms can be verified      from other sources.  Even worse, the sourced evidence the ABA produced for their report doesn't hold up to scrutiny, either. One of the Nation's leading experts on judicial appointments also agrees that the facts are few when it comes to Steve's ABA rating. In his examination, Ed Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, called the ABA evaluation ``feeble beyond the point of incompetence'' because it ``selectively quotes'' portions of an article written by Grasz to misrepresent his views. Whelan concludes that ``it would thus seem that . . . the ABA . . . is unable to distinguish between its role as advocate and its role as adjudicator of the merits of judicial nominees.''  As we learned more about this evaluation process, it is clear that the ABA uses its power as a reviewer of judicial nominees as a way to support its partisan agenda, instead of making a determination based on the merits of judicial temperament.  During Steve's confirmation hearing last week, my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee asked good questions that brought even more details to light. That is how we discovered that Steve was asked a number of inappropriate, leading questions during his ABA evaluation. These questions had no relevancy toward his ability to serve our Nation as a judge. He was asked for his personal opinion on social issues, including abortion, and he was later questioned about where his children went to school.  In response to a line of questions from the junior Senator from Arizona, Steve explained that his ABA evaluator continued to use the term ``you people'' during the interview. When Steve finally asked what he meant by ``you people,'' the evaluator told him he meant ``conservatives and Republicans.''  Steve also told the committee:       At least a half hour of that time was devoted to discussing      a white paper that I had written on the judicial selection      process for state judges in There was one paragraph      in that rather lengthy article [where] I had criticized the      oversized involvement of the American Bar Association in that      process, and I had mentioned some of their political      activities including their role in the debate over abortion      rights as well as Second Amendment rights of individuals.  He continued:       It seemed to be a topic of great concern to the      interviewer.  These tactics used by the ABA are not right. They show contempt for ideas that do not fit the interviewer's personal beliefs and in no way portray an attempt to consider carefully whether or not Steve Grasz is capable of being a fair judge. This wasn't an evaluation. It was a partisan, shameful attack. It was intended to further the political agenda of the two evaluators and damage Steve's sterling legal reputation.  In the days since the biased ABA rating was released, Nebraskans have spoken out, and I couldn't be more proud of them. In letters, online, on Facebook, and in the pages of our State's newspapers, our citizens have come to Steve's defense.  Richard Kopf, a senior U.district judge for Nebraska said he was ``stunned'' reading the ABA assessment of The ABA interviewed Judge Kopf about Steve, and although he did not know Steve personally, on two occasions he told the evaluator he believed Steve was ``well qualified.''  Judge Kopf wrote in the Omaha World-Herald:       One can only speculate, and my speculation was that ",CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7138-2.txt,2179,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1, TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT, AND",2017,9,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

778,topic-id,1962,"Madam President, I thank Senator Leahy, my good friend.  New developments in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the election have, once again, raised concerns about the accuracy of statements made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions during his appearance before the In light of the Attorney General's failure to tell the truth about not just his own interactions with Russian operatives, but also the extent to which he knew about Russian contacts by other members of the Trump campaign team, I call upon Attorney General Sessions to return to the Senate Judiciary Committee and provide us with a complete and accurate accounting of the facts.  There is no question that Russia--a hostile foreign power--meddled in our election. Russia carried out this attack in order to undermine confidence in American democracy, to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign for President, and to help Donald Our intelligence agencies have confirmed this to be true. But in order to keep our country safe and prevent an attack like this from happening again, the American people need to understand what happened, including whether members of the Trump campaign either participated in the Russian operation or turned a blind eye to it. We need to get to the bottom of this, and to do that, we need to know the truth.  Regrettably, Attorney General Sessions, our Nation's chief law enforcement officer, seems to have a real problem telling the truth about both his own interactions with Russians and those of the larger Trump campaign team. At his confirmation hearing in January, when I referenced a breaking report from CNN that there had been a ``continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government,'' I asked him, ``If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?'' This was a simple, straightforward question: ``What will you do?'' The implication was, would you recuse yourself? But rather than answer that question, then-Senator Sessions said: ``I didn't have--did not have communications with the Russians.'' That, of course, was not true. It was later revealed that Attorney General Sessions had met with the Russian Ambassador at least three times during the campaign. Only after two of those meetings were uncovered and disclosed--7 weeks later--did Attorney General Sessions announce his recusal from the Russia investigation.  After he was confronted with the truth, the Attorney General began to subtly change his story. His first answer, under oath before the Judiciary Committee in January, was that he ``did not have communications with the Russians.'' But after his meetings with the Russian Ambassador were exposed, Attorney General Sessions began to qualify his explanations. In a[[Page S7173]]statement issued on March 2, the day after his Russian contacts were revealed, he said: ``I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.'' But in July, the Washington Post published a report suggesting that the Attorney General did discuss campaign issues with the Russian According to the report, American intelligence agencies intercepted communications between the Russian Ambassador and the Kremlin in which the Ambassador described his conversations with then-Senator The two men reportedly talked about substantive policy matters, including campaign-related issues.  In response to this report, the Justice Department issued a statement stating that Attorney General Sessions stood by his testimony and again claimed that the Attorney General did not discuss ``interference with any campaign or election.''  Each and every time new information comes to light about the Attorney General's contacts with the Russians, he has responded not by coming clean and admitting that his initial testimony was inaccurate but by shifting his story and moving the goalposts. The truth has a nasty habit of catching up with Attorney General  Recently, unsealed court documents revealed that in early October, former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with Russian operatives during the campaign. The unsealed documents also revealed that Mr.Papadopoulos didn't just meet with Russian operatives during the campaign, he did so with the express goal of facilitating meetings between the Russian Government and other Trump campaign officials, including the candidate himself, Donald According to the court documents, Mr.Papadopoulos made no secret of his Russian contacts. He described his Russian meetings in emails to senior campaign officials, and according to Mr.Papadopoulos, he discussed his Russian contacts with then-Senator Sessions directly.  On March 31, 2016, Mr.Papadopoulos attended a meeting of the Trump campaign's National Security Advisory Committee--a group led by Attorney General Sessions, who chaired the committee and advised the candidate on foreign policy and national security matters. The court documents revealed that after Mr.Papadopoulos introduced himself to the group, he ``stated, in sum and substance, that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin.'' Mr.Papadopoulos made that pitch while seated two seats to the left of Attorney General We know that for a fact because then-Candidate Trump posted a photo of the meeting on There is then-Senator Sessions, there is George Papadopoulos, and there is then-Candidate Donald  After the court documents were unsealed, reports about what happened at the March 31 meeting began to emerge. Reportedly, Mr.Papadopoulos spoke about facilitating a meeting between the candidate and the Russian President for a few minutes. Then-Candidate Trump reportedly ``listened with interest and asked questions of Mr.Papadopoulos.'' But according to an adviser present at the meeting, then-Senator Sessions reacted negatively to Mr.Papadopoulos's idea and reportedly ``shut [Papadopoulos] down.'' Attorney General Sessions is reported to have said: ``We're not going to do it'' and ``I'd prefer that nobody speak about this again.'' If those reports are accurate, they would signal that then-Senator Sessions reacted quite strongly to the suggestion that then-Candidate Trump should meet with President Such a strong reaction suggests that Attorney General Sessions would have remembered a conversation like that.  Mr.Papadopoulos wasn't the only member of the campaign to tell Attorney General Sessions about his Russian contacts. Earlier this month, Carter Page--yet another former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who is under scrutiny for his Russian contacts--testified to the House Intelligence Committee that he told then-Senator Sessions about a trip to Russia that Page was going to take in July 2016, where he met with Russian officials and state-owned businesses.  Nonetheless, time and time again, Attorney General Sessions has claimed under oath that he was unaware of any communications between Russians and members of the Trump campaign.  During his confirmation hearing in January, when I mentioned reports that there was a ``continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries of the Russian government,'' the Attorney General said that he was ``not aware of any of those activities.''  My good friend Senator Pat Leahy asked him in writing whether he had ``been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election.'' The Attorney General answered, simply, ``No.''  In June, Attorney General Sessions appeared before the Senate Intelligence In his opening statement, he said: ``I have never met with or had any conversations with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign.''  Senator Risch asked him: ``Did you hear even a whisper, or a suggestion, or anyone making reference within that campaign that somehow the Russians were involved in that campaign?'' Attorney General Sessions replied: ``I did not.''  Senator Joe Manchin asked him: ``Are there any other meetings between Russian government officials and any other Trump campaign associates that have not been previously disclosed that you know of?'' Attorney General Sessions said that he did not recall any such meetings.  Senator Kamala Harris asked him: ``Are you aware of any communications with other Trump campaign officials and associates that they had with Russian officials or any Russian nationals?'' Attorney General Sessions replied: ``I don't recall that.''  Just last month, during the Attorney General's most recent appearance before the Judiciary Committee, Senator Lindsey Graham asked him: ``Did anybody in the campaign--did you ever overhear a conversation between you and anybody on the campaign who talked about meeting with the Russians?'' This time, Attorney General Sessions replied quite carefully. He said: ``I have not seen anything that would indicate collusion with Russians to impact the campaign.''  But when I asked him to clarify his shifting explanations for his own interactions with the Russian Ambassador, Attorney General Sessions said that when he first heard about reports of a ``continuing exchange of information'' between Russians and the Trump campaign, that he was ``taken aback by this dramatic statement that I'd never heard before and knew nothing about.'' He said that ``a continuing exchange of information between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government . . . did not happen, at least not to my knowledge, and not with me.''  Describing his January testimony, he said:       [A]nd I said, I'm not aware of those activities. And I      wasn't, and am not. I don't believe they occurred.  Setting aside the convenient amnesia that Attorney General Sessions seems to experience when asked about his own interactions with Russians or those he witnessed, I find it disturbing that he went so far as to claim, as recently as October of this year, that he didn't believe that any meetings between Trump associates and Russians ever occurred.  Just think about the Trump campaign members we know to have met with Russians from publicly available information: Carter Page, former campaign adviser; Paul Manafort, former campaign manager and chief strategist; Michael Flynn, the disgraced former National Security Advisor, who in 2015 spoke at a party honoring Russia's state-owned television network, where he sat next to Vladimir Putin; Jared Kushner, White House senior adviser and son-in-law; and Donald Trump, Jr., the President's son. Each and every one of these former members of the Trump campaign have had unusual contacts with the  Nonetheless, just last month the Attorney General said:       I'm not aware of those activities. And I wasn't, and am      not. I don't believe they occurred.[[Page S7174]]  I wanted to say to Attorney General Sessions: Listen, I understand that you are recused from the Russia investigation, but do you think that means you are not allowed to watch the news or read a newspaper? My God, what is going on here?  It is clear that Attorney General Sessions has an ongoing difficulty remembering his own interactions with Russians and the extent to which he knew about Russian contacts with other members of the Trump campaign. As the record demonstrates, Attorney General Sessions has misrepresented the truth about those contacts to Members of this body time and time again. The interference by a hostile power in our Nation's elections represents an attack on democracy itself, and the inability of our Nation's top law enforcement official to speak with a clear and consistent voice about what he knows of the Russian operation is disturbing.  Tomorrow morning, the Attorney General will appear before the House Judiciary Committee, where I am confident he will once again face questions about this issue. It is my hope that this time Attorney General Sessions will answer those questions honestly, but in light of his misrepresentations to Members of this body, Attorney General Sessions has an obligation to return to the Senate and explain himself.  Getting to the bottom of Russia's interference in the 2016 election is a matter of national security, and Attorney General Sessions owes the American people an explanation about what he knows. He needs to return to the Senate Judiciary Committee to set the record straight.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The American public, probably to the tune of about $1 trillion, bailed out Wall And here we go again. Major support for the American corporations who are hiding trillions of dollars overseas.  Let me just give you one other example. There is a lot of talk around here from our Republican friends that somehow, if we reduce the corporate tax rate, we will see jobs being generated and some $4,000 a year of new money in the pockets of American workers.  Really? You think so?  Let me give you an example of one of America's great corporations, AT&I think we all know AT&We probably have them on our smartphone. In the last decade, AT&T was capable, using various tax loopholes and deductions, to lower its effective corporate tax rate, not to 20 percent, but to 8 percent.  So over that period of time, while they were reducing their effective tax rates, that is their real tax rate, from whatever it was to 8 percent during that decade, did they create new jobs?  What they did was to lay off 80,000 workers. And at the same time, guess what? The CEO, he raked in $124 million.  So what is going on here?  The American corporations, back in the seventies and sixties, actually invested more than 50 percent, almost 60 percent, of their after-tax profits in expanding their business--investment in plants and equipment and wages and hiring people.  Today, less than 10 percent is spent on expanding their businesses. Instead, they are pumping up their stock prices with buybacks and with dividends.  So what is going down?  Tell me that this is going to somehow create jobs.  And, by the way, the gentleman didn't quite pick this one up, so let me add to the weight of this terrible bill. They use what is called territorial tax system. Corporations will not be taxed for their profits globally, but, rather, they will only be taxed for their profits within the United States, so it is even a further incentive to offshore your jobs to the lowest tax place in the world: Used to be Ireland, but the EU decided that Ireland was cheating the rest of the European countries; put a stop to that, so now they are off.

574,topic-id,326,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman, very, very much. There has been much discussion. We are going to be yielding this floor to our Republican colleagues, and I see them beginning to assemble, all of them who, just 3 weeks ago, were deficit hawks.  I am going to point this out, and I am going to leave it here for my colleagues who will be talking about why we ought to increase the deficit.  The current structural deficit is about $500 billion. We are going to add, just this year, $115 billion on top of that. You can see that. But over the next decade, that present structural deficit will grow to nearly $1 trillion a year, and we will add to it another couple hundred billion dollars.  The deficit hawks have a choice. They can live with the deficit, forget they ever were deficit hawks and just increase the deficit with this 1 percent tax bill, H.1, or they could do what I call the Texas two-step.  Keep in mind, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee is a The Texas two-step is first you seriously cut the revenues with this tax bill that is not a reform but, rather, a bill that actually 50 percent of the $1.5 trillion reduction goes to the American corporations and the top 1 percent. Forget about the deficit or do the Texas two-step: cut the revenues and then cut the programs.  What are the programs?  You mentioned Already in the budget that passed this House with Mr.Ryan as Speaker was a $500 billion reduction to Medicare and a $700 billion or $800 billion reduction to Medicaid, 60 percent of which goes to the elderly in nursing homes. That is what they have in mind.                              {time}  1830  Secondly, they are going to talk about a trillion-dollar infrastructure. No way. The money is gone.

576,topic-id,402,"Exactly, and you might add education to that. So what do you do? Student loans of which $1.4 trillion and nearly a trillion of that is owned by the Federal Government, these students are paying interest to the Federal Government; and to add to that, we are going to deny them the ability to deduct the loan interest that they are paying.  This is really just hypocritical, and it is very harmful to the economy. We want to do job training. Forget it. The money is gone. The Texas Two Step will deny us the money that we need for education, reduce the revenues, and then cut the programs to attempt to bring back under control the deficit. It did not work. It will not work. And what it means is, the American economy that is recovering is going to be given a wallop on the side of its head, and we are going to see some real serious problems as we attempt to build the foundation for future economic growth. The money will not be there.  Mr.Speaker, I suspect that that emergency meeting of the Rules Committee is to specifically deal with the problem that was announced by the Congressional Budget Office just 3 hours ago that said this tax bill will, because of the sequestration law--it is a law--will create an automatic $25 billion reduction in Medicare immediately and another $111 billion reduction in programs, not to be determined by the Representatives of the people of the United States but, rather, by Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, who is known to be really weird in his budgeting proposal.  He will make a $111 billion reduction all on his own, if this tax bill passes as it is written today.  This is serious business, This is about your future. This is about your ability to have a decent job in America, a decent infrastructure, a decent education system, and medical services.  What about the children's health program which is not yet in place? It is unbelievable that, without one public hearing, the Republicans are determined to pass a $1.5 trillion tax cut of which 50 percent of the benefit goes to the top 1 percent, and America's corporations are given yet another reason to offshore their jobs with what is called territorial pricing.

801,topic-id,853,"Mr.President, I want to talk about the last time we did tax reform, in 1986. In 1986, I was in the sixth grade. I had just come back from Camp Cheley, from sixth grade camp. I think the Atari 7800 was the popular model that we all wanted for I believe the Ford LTD station wagon was rolling off the assembly lines that year. ``Top Gun'' was 1 at the box office.  That was 1986. It is important because that is the last time we did tax reform in this That is the last time we enacted meaningful, comprehensive tax reform.  This Congress has an incredible opportunity before us today. Our colleagues have an opportunity to grow this economy, to get wages growing again, and to create opportunity for the American people that they haven't seen in far too long.  Over the past decade, Americans have been working harder than they ever have before, but they have watched as the haves have more and the have-nots have less, and they are tired of it. We have seen stagnant wages and work hours growing. That is what this debate is about. It is about people who want to stand up for Coloradans and people around this country to make sure we grow this economy so people can stop working two or three jobs that they have to now just to try to make ends meet, so they can finally start to see wages grow.  I am going to be joined throughout this afternoon's debate by the class of 2014, Members of the Senate who were elected in 2014 as a result of a message of economic opportunity--Senators from Georgia and North Carolina and West Virginia and Arkansas elected because we believed in an America that was growing again. We believed in an America that didn't have to settle for second place, it didn't have to settle for mediocrity or decline, but an America that with the right economic policies, the right tax policies, we could lift the burdens off the backs of the American people, off the backs of American businesses, and get this country back to work. That is what this debate is about.  Over the past several weeks, we have heard a lot of debate about what the Senate bill is going to be, what the House bill is going to be. Over the past several years, the Senate Finance Committee has held over 70 committee hearings on the issue of tax reform, countless reports, paperwork done, economic models to show what this tax reform needed to look like. We have had open debates from both sides of the aisle, a chance to say how do we reduce the tax burden on the American people and get this economy moving again.  What the Senate has come up with is a package that is estimated to create 1 million jobs across this country--1 million jobs across this country--according to the Tax In Colorado, that means a $3,000-plus increase in average aftertax income. If you don't think $3,000 is a heck of a lot of money to people, look at the statistics.  The statistics show that the average American family--a significant percentage of them; percentages of American families--don't have 24-hour access to just a few hundred dollars. They can't find--they don't have access to just a couple hundred dollars in a 24-hour time period. One-third of Americans, if they had to come up with $500 today, it would be a fiscal crisis for their household.  We are talking about an opportunity to grow wages. In fact, the Tax Foundation says a 4.4-percent increase in average aftertax income will occur as a result of the Senate bill.  I will yield to my colleague from We are going to get this easel out of his way, but first I want to show one chart that shows how wage growth can happen.  If you look across the world and you see nations that have low statutory tax rates and you see nations that have high statutory tax rates, you will see that those nations that have the lowest statutory corporate tax rates see the highest wage growth. People who work in these countries with low statutory tax rates, they see the highest average wage growth. Countries with high statutory tax rates--this red line right here--their wage growth is less than 1 percent. Do you know where the United States falls? The United States falls as the highest statutory corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. Our wage growth is at the bottom.  Low tax rates result in high wage growth. This fight is for the middle class of This fight is for hard-working American families. This fight is to grow wages across the State of Colorado, from the Eastern Plains to the Western Slope, and around the country. I hope all of us will be engaged in this fight.

319,topic-id,1983,"Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for yielding.  Madam Speaker, the last time this Nation passed major tax reform, yours truly weighed 112 pounds at the beginning of wrestling season. I had a full head of hair, I never set foot west of Mississippi, nor outside the United States of  Madam Speaker, the last time this country addressed tax reform, the Soviet Union was welcoming a new leader[[Page H9363]]named Mikhail It has been too long.  It is an honor to represent the Fifth District of Virginia because I think it is historically unique. I have spoken from this podium and this floor about the amazing characteristics of that particular historical region.  Among the great individuals from the Fifth District of Virginia was a flawed man, an imperfect man, a slaveowner named Jefferson, who gave us a near-perfect document, named the ``Declaration of Independence.''  While not perfect, Jefferson had perfect insight, and, perhaps, you could argue he was prescient when it is said that he said: ``I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.''  It has been enlightening tonight to stand on this floor. If you are watching at home, I suppose that you can turn the volume down on C-SPAN, because I don't intend to yell, as so many others have before me. And I will tell you that it is funny to listen to my colleagues across the aisle who say: This is a 429-page bill.  I would point out that saying the number of pages doesn't actually make the bill longer and that the Affordable Care Act, that they had us pass, so that we could find out what was in it, was 2,300 pages with over 20,000 pages of regulation. So there is a little disingenuity, at the very least, for them to lament the first real overhaul in our draconian tax structure in nearly two generations by suggesting that 429 pages is a long document, when such a hearty and robust undertaking is afoot.  Madam Speaker, I would submit that the government needs the people and not the other way around. That is what makes us the United States of  It is a clever ploy to attack the rich and the job creators, but let me point out the fact that 97.3 percent of taxes are paid by the top 50 percent of wage earners. So, therefore, when you attempt to cut taxes for working class people, someone who is in the 51st percentile will, indeed, receive a tax cut, but they are, by no means, rich.  It is a clever ploy to attack corporations, because corporations don't have faces, but people do.  And who do corporations provide jobs for?   President Obama acknowledged that our corporate tax structure was among the most backward in the world, and it needed to be addressed, but he didn't address it. President Obama acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act had ``real problems,'' but no one on the other side of the aisle will address them. So, too, did President That is two Presidents from the other side of the aisle in a row, but no one will address them. Instead, we will create fear and demagoguery and attack faceless corporations, because faceless corporations don't have faces, but people do.  We need to stop destroying jobs and opportunity and prosperity through the demagoguery of class warfare, attacking corporations, without acknowledging that the very people who benefit from their existence are the people who have the opportunity to send their children to college, to make memories on a vacation, to pursue and achieve dreams, to marry the love of their life with the very incomes achieved by these corporations.  Now, let's talk a little bit about corporations, because I know something about corporations, and we know something about corporations in Virginia's Fifth  Dan River Mills stood in Danville, Virginia--a company started in 1881. It closed its doors in 2006. In 2008, the smokestacks from Dan River Mills that had been a symbol not only of the skyline of that once thriving town, but also an identifying factor in the landscape of the city, were torn down as jobs went away.  Another corporation, Burlington Industries, Klopman Mills, in Pittsylvania County, hurt Virginia, and prospered from 1940 through 2007. When they left, over 1,000 jobs went with them as well. And the real estate for the property that once employed generation after generation, sending innumerable children to college, and fulfilling the humble dreams of working class Virginians, sold for a paltry $750,000.  Vaughan-Bassett Furniture--and I would commend to anyone watching at home, the book ``Factory Man,'' by Beth Macy, which chronicles John Bassett, III's struggle to keep 700 furniture jobs in this country, in my district--that corporation changed people's lives and gave them jobs.  Lane Manufacturing, for generations it was a tradition--in my part of the world, at least--that a young woman, prior to being married, might receive a Lane cedar chest--a hope chest. In fact, no less an iconoclast than Shirley Temple was used to peddle Lane cedar chests as something that would be an aspirational goal for a young, working class woman, as she set forth on pursuing the dreams of her life. From 1902, until just about 15 or 20 years ago, hundreds and hundreds of jobs, in Alta Vista, Campbell County, Virginia, left.  So many companies--some still around--all shadows of their former selves, as corporate money and jobs went offshore.  And why?  Because we have incentivized the departure of the very means by which our families have prospered and done so in order to vilify an entity incapable of defending itself, while neglecting to understand that the beneficiaries of the opportunity created thereby were their very neighbors and those who, in their demagoguery, they said they worked to protect.  Last year, in Danville, Virginia, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, who is still there--God bless them--had a cookout for the employees of Goodyear Tire, and the family members, thereof, and anybody who had ever worked for Goodyear They thought maybe there would be 800 or 1,000 people who attended this cookout. By the time it was over with, you couldn't get a pack of hotdog buns from a Food Lion within 30 miles, because that 1,000 people became 2,000 people, and became 3,000 people, and became nearly 4,000 people. These people didn't come to eat a hotdog with Goodyear They came to eat a hotdog with their family, their friends, and their community.  I stood last week at Piedmont Precision Machine Company, in Danville I looked at $1.6 million worth of new equipment that allowed this American small business to continue to compete with competitors abroad. And the rich man, who owned the company, said: Tom, I am going to have to take a loan to pay my taxes. But if you pass this bill, we will make some money, I will get more equipment, and we are going to hire some more people.  So understand that people don't come to eat hot dogs with Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, they come to eat hot dogs with their family members, their community, and people who have seen generation after generation receive opportunity, by virtue of their hard work, and opportunity provided by the very entities vilified by our opponents, without acknowledging the beneficiaries of the opportunity they provide are the very ones they purport to protect.  So Piedmont Precision Machine Company toils on. We work to attract more employers in Danville and Pittsylvania, and Henry County, and Martinsville area. Maybe Kyocera is going to come. We hope so. We think that if we get those jobs, we think that we might be able to move manufacturing jobs in high-tech to southside Virginia from Northern Virginia and But what I am hearing from the job creators is they want to see this thing get done. And when those jobs come from California, Northern Virginia, China, and India to Campbell County, Bedford County, Lunenburg County, and Mecklenburg County, it will be because we acted in a brave, bold manner, despite the divisive rhetoric that denies the reality that people benefit from opportunity, and opportunity is best provided, not by the government, but by people of initiative.  Now, I have heard so much rhetoric about what you oppose if you support this tax bill, so let's see if we can't flip that shoe onto the other foot. If you oppose this bill, you oppose lowering rates for working and middle-income families, while retaining the highest rate. That doesn't sound like a tax cut for the rich to me.  If you oppose this bill, you literally oppose doubling nearly the standard[[Page H9364]]deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for an individual filer; and you oppose, if you oppose this bill, doubling the standard deduction from $12,700 to $24,000 for a married couple.  Why would people oppose that? Do they think the government can make better decisions with the money they earn than they can?  If you oppose this bill, then you oppose simplifying the Tax Code by eliminating years of carve-out deductions made for special interests.  Quite literally, a convoluted Tax Code benefits who?  Tax attorneys and accountants.  I suppose that the other side of the Chamber is the party that has a vested interest in keeping tax attorneys and accountants at work. I want to see people in Mecklenburg County at work.  If you oppose this bill, you oppose establishing a family tax credit; you oppose raising the child credit by $600 per child; and you oppose establishing a new credit of $300 per family member so that you might be able to help your mom, dad, aunt, uncle, or a disabled relative, who you choose to help in your home.  Why would people oppose that?  If you oppose this bill, you oppose reducing small business taxes to the lowest rate since the Second World  If you oppose this bill, you oppose establishing a super low nonpercent rate for small startup businesses making less than $75,000 a year in income.  Why would you oppose startups?  If you oppose this bill, you oppose removing incentives that drive businesses to take money and jobs overseas. Don't talk to me about that. We know something about that in Virginia's  So, finally, let me submit this: for the folks at home, who are smart enough to figure this out on their own, if you pay $100 more because a deduction is eliminated and your taxes are cut by $1,000 or more, as would be the case for a family of four making $58,000 a year, that is not a tax increase.                              {time}  1945  I have never, to my knowledge, other than the United States Army, worked for anything resembling a corporate entity in my life, but I know a lot of human beings who have, and I have seen what happens when we, through our divisive rhetoric, drive them away.  This isn't about corporations. This isn't about the rich. This is about human beings.  I think it was succinctly summarized, if perhaps by accident, by my colleague in the other Chamber, Senator Schumer, who said:       It is our research that indicates that if you pass this,      some people's taxes might go up by 2023.  Think hard. What that acknowledges is that between now and then, people's taxes go down.  While Mr.Jefferson also said that:       The fruits of the working class are safest when the      assembly is not in session.  I would submit that if indeed these problems exist, they should work with us to improve our Tax Code, which hasn't been touched since I literally weighed 112 pounds and had a full head of hair, and to start being part of the solution and stop being part of the problem.  Again, the government depends upon Americans, not Americans upon the government.

To protect the endangered pallid sturgeon, Congress funded a bypass channel and weir improvement so that the fish could circumvent the diversion that had been there for 110 years. The proposed construction would also protect regional groundwater, the environment, and agricultural communities.  Unfortunately, a U.district judge blocked the project this summer because, as he claims, it does nothing for the sturgeon. His ruling to halt construction does nothing to help the sturgeon. His ruling does nothing to help the communities that rely on the project's irrigation water.

893,topic-id,4045,"Mr.Speaker, I just want to start out echoing what my friend, Congressman Rick Nolan, was saying: We should not be about the rich getting richer.  There are different strategies to try to accomplish fairness in a free country. If it is truly free, people are going to have to have the opportunity to fail as well as succeed. The only other alternative is the government kills any incentives to be more productive and just says: We are going to flatline everybody across the board, no matter how much you produce.  We have seen, over and over throughout history, that never works. Income redistribution never works. You kill the incentives. And, as I was told back in the summer of 1973, in an exchange program at the Soviet Union, by a bunch of farmers who were sitting in the shade mid-morning in the middle of the summer, I asked--and I tried to use my best Russian: When do you work out in the field? I couldn't tell what was cultivated and what wasn't. It all looked terrible.  They all laughed. I thought maybe I had translated something wrong. But one of the farmers, in Russian, said: I make the same number of rubles if I am out there in the field, or in the Sun, or here in the shade, so I am here in the shade. That is why socialism doesn't work.  So there have been many different strategies that have been utilized[[Page H8686]]throughout this Nation's history, and throughout the history of the world, to try to create--sometimes it is not an effort to create fairness in this country. It has normally been, thank But under the Obama administration's efforts to redistribute income, it brought about, for the first time in our Nation's history, that the top 1 percent of our Nation made 95 percent of the income.  I just was staggered. But that happened under the Obama administration. And, obviously, that tells us that the strategy for encouraging success, financial success, was an abysmal failure. Under the 8 years of Commander in Chief Obama, as he commanded over the economy, he made sure--I don't think it was intentional--but his efforts made sure that the very richest in the country became much richer and the rest of the country suffered.  And those on food stamps skyrocketed to the highest level ever. I think over 50 million. We had 95 million Americans, for the first time in our history, who got so tired of applying for jobs, unsuccessfully, they quit even applying.  And so how does the Obama administration respond? They responded by not counting those 95 million in the unemployed numbers because they were no longer looking for jobs. The economy, it really hasn't recovered. People have been flatlined, or less, when adjusted for the little inflation we have had.  So it is time to try something different than the Obama efforts that put 95 percent of the Nation's income in the top 1 percent's pockets. We are already seeing that change, and I am hoping that our efforts, especially in creating tax cuts, will cause the economy to just skyrocket, the way it did after the 30 percent tax cut kicked in under President Reagan by 1983.  I do want to touch on something that came out in the last week. This article from The Hill says: ``Early Comey draft accused Clinton of gross negligence on emails.'' It turns out--we find out now--that FBI Director Comey started drafting months before Hillary Clinton was interviewed, and months before discussion with Cheryl Mills and the other potential targets of the criminal investigation over the destruction of Hillary Clinton's emails.  It should have been obstruction of justice. That is not gross negligence when you tell somebody to go destroy your phone with a hammer, and you have them use BleachBit to take out everything in your phone or in your computer. That is not gross negligence, that is intentional obstruction of justice, when you know that there is a subpoena after the things you are destroying.  But FBI Director Comey decided to play politics instead of law and order. Maybe that would make a good new series on television or Netflix--not ``House of Cards,'' but ``House of Injustice''--where we play politics with justice, instead of trying to do justice, trying to fulfill the oath to pursue justice.  In any event, he had ``gross negligence,'' as the term he attributed to Hillary Clinton, in that first draft. But, apparently, when he realized that gross negligence would be a crime, he eliminated what would clearly have been a complete accusation of a crime having been committed by Hillary  So, interesting, just more information coming out about why James Comey should not--well, he should be considered someone worthy of investigation himself. He admitted to leaking information in order to manipulate the Justice Department, not by being up front and recommending a special counsel--oh, no. He wanted to create a special counsel, just like he did when he told John Ashcroft to recuse himself.  Ashcroft, obviously, not knowing what Comey had in mind, but he was going to appoint his child's godfather to be special counsel--Patrick Fitzgerald--and let him go on a witch hunt trying to get Karl Rove or Vice President Cheney--unsuccessful. So he manipulates and creates a case against Scooter Libby, so he could at least have a scalp to show for the millions and millions of dollars that were wasted.  But from Comey's standpoint, his child's godfather made a lot of money, and Comey got to lash out at the Bush administration, so probably from their standpoint it worked out real well.  But it also points to the fact that since James Comey has been involved up to his eyeballs in what is going on as FBI Director, whoever were to be special counsel, if anyone, they would need to be someone who is not close friends with James And, as Comey apparently pointed out to the Washingtonian, when they were doing a big article on him back in 2013, basically, Bob Mueller--if the world were on fire, Bob Mueller would be the one standing there with him to defend him at the end.  So, clearly, Mueller, if he were interested in ethics, would have refused--and actually interested in following the law himself--he would have refused to be appointed special counsel. But we now know that since Mueller, as FBI Director, was involved in the investigation of Russia's efforts to gain United States uranium, to try to corner the market on uranium, and they were apparently committing crimes in their efforts paying bribes, whatever is necessary, to try to acquire United States uranium, the investigation went on apparently for 3 or 4 years, as an undercover person.  Well, Mueller and the U.attorney in charge of the investigation, named Rod Rosenstein, actually the guy who appointed Mueller to be special counsel, they ended up ensuring that the records of that long-term investigation would be sealed, and they even went to court and got a court order to seal it.  And whose name was on the motion to seal those documents? Rod He did have a deputy sign on his behalf, but Rod Rosenstein was sealing the records so people couldn't know that Russia was committing crimes while they were trying to acquire U.uranium.                              {time}  1230  If people saw that the FBI and the Justice Department knew that Russia was committing crimes, paying bribes trying to acquire U.uranium, then they would have been complicit with the effort to approve the sale of uranium to a country that was committing crimes to get it. If they had not approved that, then it is doubtful that the Clintons would have struck the megamillions Russian lottery the way they did, and their foundation.  So the last two people in the country that should have been involved in an investigation into potential Russian collusion should be a person named Rod Rosenstein and another person named Robert  I have great respect for his valiant service to our country in This isn't about This is about manipulating the justice system. It is about sealing an ongoing investigation that showed crimes being committed to put our national security at risk, and not speaking up against the sale of 20, 25 percent or so of America's uranium to an entity that would provide it to  We now know that that uranium did not stay in the United States, as some had said. Well, when you are going to sell uranium to people who have been paying bribes, acting illegally, is it any surprise that if they are willing to violate the law, that they would be willing to violate the terms of an agreement or other laws regarding that uranium?  So I am still hoping--and, yes, I believe in prayer, so I am hoping and praying that justice will be done, that those who should not be investigating will step out of the picture or be forced to step out of the picture, and we can have a fair investigation into potential crimes.  Another very important piece of information that has come out about the shooter in the Sutherland Springs massacre has been this scream, this cry for more gun control, and that is immediately after we had a radical Islamist terrorist screaming ``Allahu Akbar.'' Even on FOX they said that means ``praise be to God.'' It means ``praise be to Allah.''  If you want to look for ``praise be to God,'' you can look for somebody to actually say in English, ``Praise be to God;'' or you could look on top of the Washington Monument, where American leaders had inscriptions on all four sides of the metal capstone on top of the Washington Monument; but on the side facing the U.Capitol, they had inscribed in Latin, ``Laus Deo,'' meaning ``praise be to God;'' not ``praise be to Allah,'' but ``praise be to God.''[[Page H8687]]  The reason they had ``Praise be to God'' facing the Capitol is that this is east of the Washington Monument, and what they aspired to have was the first rays of God's sun every morning striking ``Praise be to God,'' enlightening those words before anything else in our Nation's Capital was lit; ``Praise be to God,'' then the rest of the Capital City would be lit. That is why it is there.  It turns out that the New York killer, the radical Islamist, he came to the U.under the diversity visa lottery program that was started because apparently some Senators and a few Democratic House Members believed that we were having too many Hispanics come in and we were not having enough Irish come in. So they created this program so immigrants like Irish, who were not being properly represented in the numbers, could have a chance to come into the U.the way so many Hispanics were.  Well, I didn't think we cared about national origin that we needed a special program to give some other countries a chance that Hispanic countries would not have, but apparently some thought that was going to be appropriate.  It is high time to get rid of the program. We have known for years terrorists have been trying to win the lottery, and terrorists have won the lottery.  My friend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte, had a terrific op-ed in The Hill, entitled: ``Visa lottery program is too much of a gamble for our nation and needs to end.''  Republicans in the House voted to end the diversity visa lottery back in 2005. The Senate wouldn't take it up. Senators were still there that helped start the program, like Senator Then Democrats had the majority for the next 4 years after 2006. They certainly weren't going to end the diversity visa lottery program. They are the ones who wanted it.  Then, in 2012, in the session after we got the majority back, we voted again to end the lottery, but the Senate, again, wouldn't take it up.  In the last session, we didn't get it voted out, but I am grateful to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte, for pushing, as he has, and I am hoping we can get that bill to the floor that will allow us to end it.  In that op-ed, Chairman Goodlatte says: ``The visa lottery, which was enacted 10 years prior to 9/11, is foolish in the age in which we live. Those in the world who wish us harm can easily engage in this statistical gamble with nothing to lose. The Office of the Inspector General at the State Department has found that it poses significant national security risks. In fact, Saipov``--the New York City radical Islamic terrorist--'' is the fifth person who has been accused or convicted in connection with terrorism plots to have come here through the visa lottery.  ``In another instance, Hesham Hadayet, an Egyptian terrorist who killed two and wounded several others at Los Angeles International Airport on July 4, 2002, was a lawful permanent resident who received his green card through the program''--the diversity visa lottery program--``since his wife was a visa lottery winner.''  So this Egyptian terrorist was a lottery winner, or his wife was, and the two people who he killed in L.Airport and those he wounded were the losers of that lottery.  Chairman Goodlatte goes on to say: ``Additionally, in August of 2002, Pakistan national Imran Mandhai pleaded guilty to conspiring to wage jihad by plotting to destroy electrical power stations, the Israeli consulate, and other south Florida targets. He entered the United States with his parents, who had won the visa lottery, in 1998.  ``Similarly, in August 2002, two diversity lottery winners from Morocco--Ahmed Hannan and Karim Koubriti--were indicted as members of an alleged terrorist `sleeper' cell in In June 2003, a jury convicted Koubriti of conspiring to provide material support or resources to terrorists, and Hannan of possessing false documents.''  So visa lottery applicants, some of them--many of them submit several applications under different names in order to increase their chances of winning the visa lottery.  Chairman Goodlatte continues: ``And marriage fraud is rampant in the program. `Pop-up' spouses often appear in between the time that the applicant registers for the lottery and the time when the applicant is interviewed by the State These `spouses' pay the applicant in order to be part of the applicant's green card winnings.''  Winnings from the visa lottery.  Chairman Goodlatte continues: ``The United States has the most generous immigration system in the world, admitting more than 1 million legal immigrants each year.''  There is no country in the world that allows that many people to come into their country legally. We are far from being the largest country either geographically or population-wise, yet we are the most generous country in the world in allowing people into our country legally.  Chairman Goodlatte goes on: ``Eliminating the visa lottery does not negate our Nation's generosity, but makes our immigration system smarter and safer for the age in which we live. Our immigration policy should be based primarily on our national needs, security, and economics, as opposed to an arbitrary system. The visa lottery is too much of a gamble for our Nation to make with today's ongoing threat of terrorism and must come to an end.''  There is no other country in the world that is so stupid regarding its own national security and national interests that it allows a lottery to determine who would get a visa to come into their country. It, hopefully, will be ending soon.  That is why there was this article in The Daily Caller: ``GOP Senators Distance Themselves from Diversity Visa Program They Helped Create.''  There are some who helped create the diversity visa lottery program in the Senate who are saying: You know what? Maybe it is time to get rid of it.  I hope we will.  Yesterday, though, in the House Judiciary Committee, we did have a bill come up. It is being urged by law enforcement, Federal law enforcement, by the Justice Department, FBI, the National Security Administration, CIA, our intelligence folks. They are saying: We have got to have this 702 program reauthorized that will end on December 31 of this year.  Well, we know that the system has been abused. We were assured when I was here early on in Congress that: Gee, just reauthorize this, because there are no Americans who are going to be harmed by allowing these warrantless wiretapping situations. The only way an American could be caught up in this wiretapping would be if they are talking to a known foreign terrorist or a member of a known foreign terrorist organization.  So that gave me some security. And back then--some years back when we were authorizing the program, I said to my friends that were against the program because they were afraid an American would be caught up: Well, if they are afraid of being caught up in this wiretapping or this tapping into phone calls, then just make sure that their foreign terrorist friends call them on somebody else's phone.  That was glibly said. Little did I know that it is not just known foreign terrorists and it is not members of known terrorist organizations; it has gotten so far afield that even if a Member of Congress has an innocent visit with a diplomat or an ambassador from a foreign country, that can be--and apparently, we are told, has been--used to listen in and monitor conversations. But we were assured there is a great safeguard, because if an American is picked up under this monitoring of foreign terrorists, then the American name will be masked so nobody will know who it was.  So through the Fourth Amendment, we will protect them from having a warrantless search of a conversation without a warrant from a judge, which requires that they are proving probable cause to believe that the individual is involved in a crime, has committed a crime. And then with that probable cause being proved--as a judge, I signed felony warrants for searches, for seizures, for arrests, but you had to have probable cause.                              {time}  1245  But you had to have probable cause. This allows them to grab those conversations without probable cause.  So with all that we have begun to learn, and especially when we found out how liberal the Obama administration was with unmasking American[[Page H8688]]names and that we had people who have shown themselves to be extremely political in their decisions and activities, even being willing to go on Sunday morning television shows six times in 1 day and lie intentionally to the American public about the Benghazi matter, that that same political person would be unmasking American names right and left, and although I know there is one Republican who said, ``Oh, I talked to her, and I'm convinced that she's fine,'' well, I am not. We need that being thoroughly investigated, as well as the other unmaskings being properly and thoroughly investigated by people who are not so gullible.  This is serious stuff. When we in Congress allowed this loophole around the Fourth Amendment requirement for warrants in order to seize or obtain evidence, we anticipated that it would be carefully and strictly adhered to. And then we see the unmasking has been so liberally done, and there certainly seems to be a prima facie indication, when you look at who unmasked and the people who were unmasked, that you have one political party in power investigating their political opponent for political gain. And, once again, thank God it didn't end up the way they hoped.  But this is still quite serious, and that is why I applauded my friend, another fellow felony judge in our background. Former Judge Ted Poe and Zoe Lofgren from California, Democrat, had a good amendment in my opinion, and it was going to require that before law enforcement--once they obtained these American names and numbers, well, law enforcement, apparently, once they have obtained these American names and numbers and phone numbers and conversations, and obtained them without probable cause in compliance with the Fourth Amendment, there are countless numbers of queries being made into the database on that individual or on the phone number just doing phishing expeditions, and then, if they find something, seeing if they can use that information to help prosecute them on another matter. Those are truly phishing expeditions. They should not be allowed without a warrant.  We will say you obtained the information legally, even though you did it in violation of the Fourth But if you are going to go back and research that database, you should have probable cause before you start being allowed to basically listen in on conversations or follow up on all kinds of activity that was gathered without any probable cause.  This is what the government does that the Founders were afraid of. They didn't know that there would be cell phones some day or the highly technically proficient ability to communicate we have now. But they knew that mankind would not change. It has not changed. There has always been evil. There will always be evil in this world, and we have to guard against becoming part of the problem when we are in the government.  The Founders' safeguards, all of those amendments, basically, were safeguards, whether it was the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Tenth, I mean, those are critically important--Sixth Those are all important to preserving our rights. So I was saddened that that amendment failed: 12 voting for it, 21 voting against it.  I appreciate the chairman and the ranking member, Mr.Conyers, agreeing to an amendment that Mr.Cicilline made, my Democratic friend. And, in fact, I had an identical amendment I was going to make, except mine added two other safeguards, two other laws.  My friend and neighbor--office neighbor, that is--agreed to accept my friendly amendment, to add those other two laws, to ensure that when the U.Government went after and examined and queried this 702 material--the warrantless wiretapping, as The Hill calls it--that these laws would apply to those queries to hopefully increase the concern by those making the queries that they could be punished.  But this article goes on and says: ``The current law allows Federal investigators to search collected data belonging to American citizens, an authority critics say circumvents Fourth Amendment protections against unlawful search and seizure.  ``The Liberty Act would require criminal investigators to obtain a court order before viewing the content of any American's communications collected under the NSA program--but would not require a warrant to search the database in the first place.''  So the Liberty Act it is referring to actually was used as the amendment to that bill.  Anyway, I know Mr.Conyers is quoted in the article, saying: ``We have been assured in explicit terms that if we adopt this amendment today''--talking about the Poe-Lofgren amendment--``leadership will not permit this bill to proceed to the House floor.''  And that was also a concern mentioned by our friend from New York, Jerry  But I would submit that we should not be afraid of Republican leadership doing the wrong thing. At least, it doesn't hurt, I guess, to have a healthy fear because that certainly has happened. But we still ought to be pushing to do everything we can to ensure that the U.Constitution is properly followed and we don't continue to have loopholes around it.  So that is an ongoing fight, and the Senate has got to take it up. But there are concerns that the Senate is just going to rubberstamp what the NSA wants. They are not going to have any of the safeguards that we put in the bill as it is already, which I still don't feel is enough, and that is why I voted against it, as did the man who sits next to me in the Judiciary Committee, Jim Andy Biggs voted against it as well.  So there were a number of us who voted against the bill because the proper protections, in our opinion, are not there. We have just got to continue to advocate for that.  I also want to mention a bit of fake news that came from the Huffington  I have met ",CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8685-4.txt,1801,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017,9,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

27,topic-id,557,"Mr.President, I join my colleague, the ranking member of the Rules Committee, as she seeks unanimous consent to adopt our antiharassment training resolution. It is closely modeled on a Senate resolution I introduced 2 days ago with Senators Feinstein, Klobuchar, Ernst, Gillibrand, and several other colleagues.  This resolution's adoption marks the first time that this Chamber requires sexual harassment training for all Senators, staff, interns, and fellows.  I wrote legislation on this topic after contacting the Rules Committee chairman last week to urge that everyone in this Chamber receive antiharassment training. This measure's passage with the Rules Committee chairman's support, just days after I called for the Rules Committee to institute a harassment training requirement for this chamber, is a sign of the wonderful things we can accomplish when we work together in a bipartisan way.  More than two decades ago, I sponsored the Congressional Accountability Act as a sign of our commitment to promoting fairness in the workplace. This 1995 statute requires Congress to follow the same civil rights, labor, workplace safety, and health laws to which other employers are subject.  It is certainly time for us to make antiharassment training mandatory, but we also may want to revisit the statute to ensure that it is working as intended. According to the Washington Post, over 1,000 former staff have contacted Congress in the last week to urge that we revisit policies relating to sexual harassment, and I am fully committed to doing so.  The resolution we have developed would ensure that the Rules Committee has the authority necessary to ensure that every Member of this Chamber, every employee on the Senate payroll, and every unpaid Senate intern receives antiharassment training.  All of us work hard to ensure that our offices are professional, free of harassment, and places where merit is rewarded, but I think we have to acknowledge that in our society, despite our best efforts and intentions, sexual harassment remains a serious problem. We must work together to make sure that the Senate remains free from harassment.  It is important for every Senate office to have a consistent stance on this particular issue. Every office should receive the same training so the Senate maintains a culture in which harassment is not tolerated. This is a common interest we all share. The voters who sent us here expect the best. We owe it to the American people to hold ourselves and our employees to the highest standards of conduct and professionalism.  I will close by again thanking Senators Klobuchar, Feinstein, Ernst, and others for working so closely with me on the measure's development. I also want to take this opportunity to thank the staff of the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment and the Office on Compliance, who worked with our offices on draft after draft of this resolution. Finally, I want to thank our other cosponsors, including our majority leader and minority leader. I urge my colleagues to embrace a sensible approach to preventing sexual harassment by supporting its immediate adoption.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.  The resolution (330) was agreed to.

497,topic-id,544,"Mr.President, the last time Congress really did the big job that is before us right now was 1986. It did quite a bit to modernize the Tax That was 30 years ago. In the generation since, the Tax Code has grown out of control. Everybody knows that. It has been a dream come true for accountants and lobbyists who make their living from certain provisions of that Tax But for the American taxpayer, the gigantic Tax Code is not a dream, but a nightmare for most Americans.[[Page S7141]]  This has helped the powerful and the well connected, but it has hurt American workers. It has hurt American industry, and it hurts America's ability to compete with the rest of the world.  The bill unveiled today takes a giant step forward to make our Tax Code simpler, fairer, and more competitive. It catches us up with our major trading partners, who have been lowering business tax rates while we stood still, and it keeps us uncompetitive. It will give us an opportunity to export more when we are competitive in the global economy.  This bill will also help bring back jobs and create new ones. It will boost American wages by promoting economic growth and incentivizing investment.  The centerpiece of the legislation is where it ought to be--in the center of our population, middle-class America, so it has middle-class tax cuts. The average middle-class family of four would see a tax cut of more than $1,400 and an increase in the child tax credit of $650--above the $1,000 that is already there per child, which would mean real help for working parents.  Nearly doubling the standard deduction means that many lower income Americans will be removed from the tax rolls completely, and the tax filing season will be much simpler for millions more.  Small businesses will also see significant tax relief from the rate reduction on the individual side but also from an innovative, new small business income tax deduction. Two-thirds of the jobs in this country are created by those very same small businesses, and we ought to give them some better equity with big C corporations.  It will provide much needed tax relief to nearly all small businesses, down to the smallest family-owned corner store and family farmer.  Our bill recognizes the importance of small businesses in our economy. After all, as I just said, they are responsible for a majority of those new jobs. The tax savings they receive could be spent on a new hire. It could be spent on giving raises to employees in those same small businesses. It could be invested in a growing company. All of this adds up to Americans seeing more ``Now Hiring'' signs throughout our country.  Landmark tax relief during the Kennedy and Reagan administrations grew wages, created jobs, and made the United States more competitive, so there is enough history behind what we are trying to do to know that it will accomplish the goals we are trying to accomplish.  Today, Congress has a golden opportunity to do, again, what was done in Kennedy and the Reagan years, and it has not been done for 30 years: tax cuts, tax simplification, and tax reform.

779,topic-id,1185,"Madam President, in the last several weeks, there has been a lot of discussion regarding the blue-slip courtesy that applies to judicial nominations. I want to take a moment to clarify a few things. My position hasn't changed. Like I said in November of last year, I intend to honor the blue-slip courtesy, but there have always been exceptions.  First, the blue slip has always been a Senatorial courtesy. It is premised on the idea that home State Senators are in a very good position to provide insights into a nominee from their State for the Federal judiciary. It is meant to encourage consultation between the White House and home State Senators about judicial nominations. That is why I value the blue-slip tradition and ask for the views of Senators on all nominees to courts from their respective  Throughout its history, the many chairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee have applied this blue-slip courtesy differently. That is a chairman's prerogative. The chairman has the authority to decide how to apply the courtesy. Over the past 100 years, there have been 18 chairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee who recognized the value of the blue-slip courtesy, but only 2 out of these 18 chairmen required both Senators to return positive blue slips before scheduling a hearing.  The practice of sending out blue slips to home State Senators started 100 years ago, in 1917. Chairman Charles Culberson started the blue-slip practice to solicit the opinions of home State Senators, but he did not require the return of two positive blue slips before the committee would proceed on a nominee. In fact, in the blue slip's very first year, Chairman Culberson held a hearing and a vote for a nominee who received a negative blue slip. His successors over the next nearly 40 years had the same policy. It was not until 1956 that the blue-slip policy changed under Chairman James Eastland, a Democrat from the State of Chairman Eastland began to require both home State Senators to return positive blue slips before holding a hearing and a vote.  Chairman Eastland, as history tells us, was well known for his segregationist views. Unfortunately, it is likely that he adopted a strict blue-slip policy to veto judicial nominees who favored school desegregation. This is what Villanova Law School Professor Tuan Samahon explained: ``When segregationist `Dixiecrat' Senator John Eastland chaired the Judiciary Committee, he endowed the blue slip with veto power to, among other things, keep Mississippi's federal judicial branch free of sympathizers with Brown v. Board of Education.''  After Chairman Eastland retired in 1979, Senator Kennedy became chairman. He got rid of Senator Eastland's policy. He didn't want a single Senator to be able to unilaterally veto a judicial nominee. Senator Kennedy's policy was that an unreturned or negative blue slip wouldn't prevent the committee from conducting a hearing on a nominee. Then along comes Senator Strom Thurmond, continuing this policy when he became chairman. So did Senator Joe So did Senator Orrin Each of those chairmen allowed hearings for nominees who had negative or unreturned blue slips.  In 1989, Chairman Biden sent a letter to the White House articulating his blue-slip policy. This is what Chairman Biden wrote: ``The return of a negative blue slip will be a significant factor to be weighed by the committee in its evaluation of a judicial nominee, but it will not preclude consideration of that nominee unless the Administration has not consulted with both home State Senators prior to submitting the nomination to the Senate.''  Obviously, chairmen from both parties saw the danger of allowing one or two Senators to veto a nominee for political or ideological reasons. My predecessor, Chairman Leahy, reinstated Chairman Eastland's strict blue-slip policy. Some believe he did so in order to exert firmer control over the new Bush administration nominees, but even he said he wouldn't stand for Senators abusing the blue slip to delay or block nominees. Chairman Leahy said the blue-slip courtesy was ``meant to ensure that the home state Senators who know the needs of the courts in their state best are consulted and have the opportunity to make sure that the nominees are qualified'' and should not be ``abused simply to delay [the Committee's] ability to make progress filling vacancies.''  Chairman Leahy also said:       I assume no one will abuse the blue-slip process like some      have abused the use of the filibuster to block judicial      nominees on the floor of the As long as the blue-slip      process is not being abused by home-state Senators, then I      will see no reason to change that tradition.  As I have said all along, I will not allow the blue slip to be abused. I will not allow Senators to block nominees for political or ideological reasons. This position is consistent with the historical role of the blue-slip courtesy. It also matches my personal experience with the blue slip.  I am going to tell you about a personal experience I had when I first came to the U.In my first year in the Senate, a vacancy arose on the Eighth At the time, I served with a Republican, my senior Senator from Iowa, Roger Jepsen, and we had a Republican President, Ronald Senator Jepsen and I thought the nominee should be a State judge from Des Moines so we recommended his name to the White House--not like we do now in Iowa, submit two or three names, four names sometimes, for the President to pick from. In 1981, the White House decided they would like to consider another name for the vacancy. The other individual, Judge Fagg, was a State court judge in The White House interviewed the judge who was supported by both Senator Grassley and Senator Jepsen along with having interviewed this other nominee.  President Reagan, ultimately, nominated the other nominee for the vacancy. He was not the person Senator Jepsen and I recommended, but the White House thought that he was better suited to the circuit court, and that ended up being the correct decision. Judge Fagg served with great distinction for more than two decades. Even though he was not our pick, Senator Jepsen and I returned our blue slips on the nominee. That was not unusual as more deference has always been given to the White House, particularly for circuit court nominees, which is different from district court nominees.  When Judge Fagg was nominated to the Eighth Circuit, both Senators from Iowa were Republicans, and the blue slip practice did not change when Senator Harkin, a Democrat, was elected to the Senate, succeeding Senator  Senator Harkin and I served together for 30 years, and we did not have any problems with judicial nominees. Generally, when there was a Republican[[Page S7175]]President, I sent a list of names to the President, and when there was a Democratic President, Senator Harkin sent a list of names to the White We served together for those 30 years and never had any problems with blue slips, not once.  During the Clinton administration, a vacancy arose on the Eighth The White House nominated Bonnie Campbell for the court.

1130,topic-id,375,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of an important bill that could help so many families with loved ones struggling with life-threatening diseases. I am talking about the Right to Try Act which would allow terminally ill patients to request access to experimental drugs after all other available treatment options have been exhausted as well as prevent the Federal Government from interfering with States that have already passed such laws.  While Missouri passed a right-to-try law in 2014, I was reminded of the importance of this bill just last year. As I was returning to my office one morning after votes on the House floor, I was stopped by a little boy, Zack Mongiello, who ran after me to catch my attention. Zack, who is only 11 years old, is one of the most effective advocates for the right-to-try campaign. His father, Frank, was diagnosed with ALS a few years ago.  This devastating disease has an average life expectancy of 2 to 5 years, with half of those diagnosed surviving for only 3 years. Ever since that life-changing diagnosis, Zack's family, including his mother and five siblings, have been doing all they can to ensure passage of this important bill.  When Zack came running up to me that day last year, his message was clear and powerful: ``My dad is dying,'' he said. ``Please help.'' I was incredibly moved by this, as I think anyone would be. Here is his picture. This precious little boy, whose family is dealing with the unimaginable, convinced me and numerous other legislators of the urgency of this legislation. We must act now.  I want Congress to help Zack's family and other families who have no other options. Washington should not stand in the way of Americans with life-ending illnesses who want to try to save themselves and have no other available options.  That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the Right to Try Act and was glad to see the Senate pass their version of this bill. It is now time for the House to act, and I call on my colleagues to support this potentially lifesaving legislation. Please join me so that we can give families like Zack's more options and hopefully more time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9187.txt,2032,EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE WITH RESPECT TO UNITED STATES POLICY,2017,14,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During my time as Governor and now as Senator, Linda has been a tremendous partner and relentless advocate. Thanks in part to Linda's advocacy, we were able to increase funding for critical prevention, treatment, and recovery services in New Hampshire, extend substance use disorder coverage to the Medicaid Program, and pass and reauthorize Medicaid expansion--providing quality, affordable health coverage to more than 50,000 Granite As the State legislature debated whether to reauthorize Medicaid expansion, Linda fought for the program at every step along the way, calling it ``the most important tool New Hampshire has in its fight against the opioid epidemic and more broadly the substance misuse crisis we are facing in our state.''  Linda has also strongly spoken out in defense of the Essential Health Benefits that require insurers to cover substance misuse and mental health treatment, she has stood up against cuts to[[Page S7261]]Medicaid and other programs that Granite Staters struggling with substance use disorder rely on, and she has worked effectively to help reduce the stigma that has hurt our efforts to combat this crisis for far too long.  People like Linda perfectly exemplify New Hampshire's all-hands-on-deck spirit, where we roll up our sleeves and work together to strengthen our communities. Linda's dedication to supporting those struggling with substance use disorder, first responders, and treatment providers has strengthened our State's response to the substance misuse crisis, and her advocacy will continue to help us stem and ultimately reverse the tide of this epidemic. I join all Granite Staters in thanking Linda for her service and congratulating her on a well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7260-2.txt,1E+14,915,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, Mr.Bradbury's previous actions during his time at the Department of Justice showed that he lacks the judgment and commitment to our shared values that are a prerequisite for any lawyer privileged to serve the people of the United States of  During his time as the acting head of the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, Mr.Bradbury was one of three primary lawyers who helped lay the groundwork for the Bush administration's defense of what they described as ``enhanced interrogation techniques.'' The so-called torture memos that Mr.Bradbury helped write were used to justify the Bush administration's decision to use torture that included extreme sleep deprivation, cramped confinement, and waterboarding. Mr.Bradbury helped find legal loopholes that were an affront to our American values. And he failed to fulfill the special responsibility all lawyers have to the quality of justice in our legal system.  Mr.Bradbury's past government service reflects a lack of sound legal judgment. In fact, a 2009 review by the Department of Justice raised questions about the objectivity and reasonableness of the conclusions found in the memos he authored. Rather than standing up for our values and laws, Mr.Bradbury deferred to the wishes and pressure of the President he was serving.  Furthermore, during his confirmation hearing, when referring to his legal justification for these so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, Mr.Bradbury stated: ``If I had my druthers, I wouldn't have engaged in having to address those issues.''

937,topic-id,1539,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am very pleased that the gentleman from Texas, my good friend, yielded me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  Once again, my Republican colleagues have decided that the best way to govern is through obfuscation, mathematical gimmicks, and a rushed and closed process, and all in an obvious attempt to hide from the American people the devastating consequences the Republican-led tax scam bill will have on working class and middle class  Just so we are all crystal clear on this point: Who, under this tax bill, benefits on the backs of working and middle class Americans? Yes, folks, it is the wealthy corporations and the richest among us.  The Republican majority has made lofty claims about their bill, saying that because of this legislation, everyone gets a tax cut, jobs will be plentiful, and that the economy will grow exponentially and astronomically. The White House has even said that the tax cuts would result in each household receiving an additional $5,000 to $9,000 in annual income.  Mr.Speaker, it seems there isn't anything that Republican leadership won't say to get their own Members to vote for this bill.  Mr.Speaker, they can make all the claims they want, but the actual tax experts who have analyzed this bill paint a much darker picture about the consequences of this legislation. According to one nonpartisan tax analysis, today's Republican plan will result in a tax increase for 38 million middle class  Not to worry, though. While these hardworking middle class families have to deal with the tax increase, the richest 0.2 percent of Americans will get a windfall. In fact, the estate provision in this bill alone would allow the heirs of just 11 ultrawealthy individuals to pocket up to $67.5 billion. An estimated 80 percent of the tax cuts in this legislation will go to wealthy corporations and the richest 1 percent.[[Page H9271]]  Mr.Speaker, even more astonishing, a recent analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office indicates that this Republican tax bill could trigger automatic cuts to mandatory spending to the tune of $136 billion, including $25 billion in the Medicare cut.  Let that sink in, because actually what is getting ready to happen here is we are going to have a $1.5 trillion deficit, and these deficit hawks on the other side are then going to turn right back around and say that we need to pay for these things. Then watch out Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, because that is the objective, in my view, in the first place.  In order to cut taxes for the ultrawealthy and corporations, my Republican colleagues are not only raising taxes on the middle class, but are now potentially triggering a $25 billion cut to  If this inequity were not staggering enough, Americans also have to keep in mind that today's Republican tax giveaway to corporate America and the ultrawealthy is not only on the backs of the middle class, but also future generations, as this bill will explode our national debt by an estimated $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years.  Not surprisingly, Republicans are making the tired excuse that these cuts will pay for themselves. If they did, then we would have the easiest jobs in the world. Just cut taxes, and magically we will have even more revenue to pay for the important needs of our country. That sounds a lot like the old trickle-down-which-never-worked economics. It sounds that way to me, and we all know that as far as economic theories go, that one was and is a complete and total dud.  Mr.Speaker, to summarize the majority's attempt to overhaul our Tax Code for the first time in 30 years: they raise taxes on middle class Americans, cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, and manage to explode the debt all at the same time--all this while also leading the most closed Congress in history and shutting out Members of Congress who represent nearly half of the American people.  Hear that, America: a lot of your Representatives had no opportunity to say or do anything regarding the measure that we are discussing.  Mr.Speaker, let us step back and really get a full view of how callous this bill is for our Nation by looking at how the bill treats middle class Americans versus its treatment of the ultrawealthy and corporate  Under this Republican tax scam bill, a working class schoolteacher who buys supplies for his or her students would not be able to deduct that expense, but a corporation that buys supplies for itself would be able to use such a deduction.  Under this Republican tax bill, a middle class homeowner would see their property tax deduction capped at $10,000, but a corporation would not face the same cap.  Under this Republican tax bill, if a worker was forced to relocate for his or her job--footnote there, including the military--because the company moved or, in the case of the military, they were relocated, he or she would not be able to deduct that moving expense; but if a corporation decided to relocate, even to relocate overseas, it will be able to deduct its moving expense.  Mr.Speaker, the list goes on. But we shouldn't be surprised. As the old adage goes, bad process makes for bad policy.  Not since the Republicans' failed attempt to strip healthcare away from millions of Americans have we seen a process that is this bad.  Take, for example, the last time Congress passed major tax reform legislation in 1986 and what that process looked like. During that effort, the Ways and Means Committee held a month of public hearings and took testimony from over 450 witnesses.                              {time}  1300  The legislation before us now has had no--zero--public hearings and testimony from no--zero--expert witnesses.  During the last tax reform overhaul, the Ways and Means Committee spent 26 days marking up the framework of the legislation. This time around, Republicans spent only 4 days marking up the legislation.  The 1986 legislation framework was released a year before it was passed in the In contrast, the framework for this bill was released less than a month before they started today's process of jamming their final bill through the There were no hearings and no amendments made in order. From start to finish, there was less than a month of actual consideration.  Much like the majority's rushed healthcare processes that produced an abysmal, destructive bill that would hurt working class Americans, this rushed process has produced a tax bill that benefits corporations and the wealthiest Americans, all while managing to raise taxes on the middle class and adding $1.5 trillion to the deficit.  Mr.Speaker, the Republican majority is lurching from one bad bill to the next with speed--not thoughtful policy--seemingly being the only goal. It begs the question: What is the rush?  As a matter of fact, I don't even think we need a tax bill of this consequence. According to them, the economy is roaring, unemployment is low, interest rates are low. So what is wrong with certainly leaving the wealthy in the category that they are in?  Why are my Republican colleagues setting an arbitrary deadline of passing a tax bill by Thanksgiving, instead of focusing on thoughtful policy and getting the substance right in a bipartisan fashion?  Everyone agrees that we need to do something about the Tax Democrats have been ready to work with Republicans on this effort, but have been shut out of the process at every turn. Why?  The only logical conclusion is that this has nothing to do with policy and everything to do with politics. It has nothing to do with helping the middle class, but instead is a callous political maneuver aimed at salvaging a stalled and ever-failing Republican agenda.  We are about to end the year with nothing having been done of consequence. Mr.Speaker, don't take my word for it. This conclusion is not based on my own opinion. Some of my Republican colleagues have admitted as much.  When asked about the need to move on to tax reform quickly, one of my esteemed colleagues on the other side of the aisle was heard to say: ``My donors are basically saying, `Get it done or don't ever call me again.' ''  Likewise, on the other side of the Capitol, one Republican has stated that, if the Republicans fail on tax reform, just as they did on healthcare, financial contributions will stop.  Mr.Speaker, I don't think politics should dictate our efforts to reform something as significant as the Tax Our guiding light should be to help working folks get a leg up. The only way to do that is to work in a bipartisan, deliberate manner, hearing from experts and the American people, as they did in 1986, and not as my Republican friends have done this time around, spending a mere 3 weeks, with no hearings, no bipartisan efforts, simply to give us something done before  That approach only gets you what we have here before us today: a bill that, in my opinion, does more harm than good to middle class Americans and puts our country further into debt.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

After that failure, they moved on to today's attempt to jam an abhorrent tax bill through For the sake of middle and working class Americans, I hope my Republican friends ultimately meet defeat once again.  Mr.Speaker, we set the record with this particular measure of 51 closed rules in this session, the most closed rules in the history of What that means is a lot of the Representatives who had good ideas, more than 100 of them that offered amendments last night, were unable to be heard because of closed rules.  After this closed, disgraceful process, this Republican majority has presented, in this instance, a piece of legislation that skews tax cuts in favor of the ultrawealthy and rich corporations.  Now, let's make it very clear. Wealthy people shouldn't be disrespected for their wealth, but I don't know any wealthy people who are knocking down my doors, saying that they need a few more thousand dollars. But I know a lot of poor people who need a few hundred dollars, and this particular measure is not doing many of the things that would allow for them to be able to get on that last rung of that ladder and lift themselves up.  I heard the gentleman say a rising tide lifts all boats. They had the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show,[[Page H9277]]the largest one in the world, the week before last. All those yachts were lifted, but those little dinghies with the people fishing out in Lake Okeechobee were not lifted one doggone bit by this particular measure.  This bill does so on the backs of middle and working class people and future generations.  With this bill, the former deficit hawk Republican majority would add $1.5 trillion to the debt while potentially triggering $25 billion in cuts to I might add that is where they are headed.

496,topic-id,882,"Mr.President, today, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I am releasing a chairman's mark for the Senate version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, legislation that is the culmination of years of effort to reform our Nation's Tax We have been at this a long time, and today marks a significant step forward in this effort. While we refer to this document as a chairman's mark, it has really been a group effort, with significant input from all the Republican members of the Finance Committee and great work from all of our staff. I want to thank everyone involved for their hard work, as well as their feedback, perspectives, advice, and ideas.  The last time Congress enacted a comprehensive overhaul of the Tax Code back in 1986, President Reagan famously noted that the American people would finally have a tax code they could be proud of. And in 1986, that was likely true. At that time, updates to the Tax Code were necessary to keep pace with the technological and geopolitical changes our Nation had been facing. That sounds pretty familiar, Mr.It is, after all, what we have been saying for the last several years. The world of 1986 was vastly different from the world we live in today. Advances in the past three decades have been monumental. Yet our Tax Code has not advanced, and it is failing us.  The American people have dealt with years of stagnating wages, sluggishness in labor markets, and weak growth in the economy. Businesses are fleeing our country to find more favorable conditions in other countries. We have been working for years to address these issues and to meet the needs of the 21st-century global economy.  Fortunately, we now find ourselves in a position to make good on all of these years of hard work. A big part of that is the fact that our current President is fully engaged on tax reform, unlike his most recent predecessor. So we have been focused this year on providing middle-class tax relief, reforming the business tax system, and fixing our obscenely outdated international tax regime.  The mark we are releasing today will accomplish all of these goals and more. It will reduce individual rates across the board and direct substantial relief to low- and middle-income families and workers. It will bring down corporate tax rates--a goal long shared by Republicans and Democrats--and provide businesses with new opportunities for growth and expansion. It will modernize our international tax system, bringing to an end our worldwide tax regime, a relic that should have been retired many years ago. We have been laser-focused on reducing taxes for the middle class, and that is exactly what this bill will do.  Combined, these changes to our broken Tax Code in the chairman's mark will give hard-working taxpayers across the country bigger paychecks and more opportunities. They will grow our economy, raising wages and improving the standard of living for all They will once again make America the best place in the world to create, grow, and keep a business--where we create more jobs and sustain a vibrant, growing economy.  I will have more to say on the specifics of the mark in the coming days. For now, I just want to give my colleagues on the Finance Committee an opportunity to share their thoughts on the steps we are taking today.  Before we get to that, I do want to acknowledge the elephants in the room. Only Republicans will be standing up today to speak in favor of the mark, and I expect we will hear some negative comments from our friends on the other side of the aisle soon enough. On that point, I will just reiterate what I have said many times in the past: Our desire from the outset of this endeavor has been to have Democrats join us in this effort.  I have personally invited my colleagues to come to the table, to share their views, and to work with us in good faith. Yet I expect that we will hear a lot about supposed process fouls in the coming days. Let me make it clear to anyone listening: As chairman of the Senate's tax writing committee, I haven't turned anyone away from the process. I haven't refused to listen to anyone's ideas or suggestions. And I continue to say, with conviction, that I am still willing to have them onboard and hope they will be willing to get onboard and join us in this effort.  A critical objective in the effort is to provide relief and support to the large swath of Americans in the middle class who have been left behind, without economic gain or opportunities for growth.  Our tax reform efforts--represented in the chairman's mark put forward today--show that we are listening to those calling out for relief. We have a historic opportunity to help, and that opportunity should not be squandered by anyone on either side of the aisle for cheap political points.  With that, I am grateful to be a member of this body and grateful to be chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which is a very powerful and hard-working committee--both Republicans and I am grateful to make these remarks today.  I yield the floor.

506,topic-id,2807,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss a couple of pressing issues regarding our healthcare system and to ensure that Americans are aware of some critical deadlines for their health options in the marketplace.  It is that time of year. Healthcare open enrollment has started, and Americans across the country can sign up or change their healthcare plans to make sure they are getting a plan that works best for them and their families.  I have long said that the health reform law, otherwise known as ObamaCare, is not perfect, and I have been pushing since I have been here to make it work better for North Dakota families and small businesses. But there are many pieces in that healthcare law that are helpful, and I wish to make sure that Americans and North Dakotans take advantage during this open enrollment period.  Every individual and family should be able to get access to affordable, quality healthcare, and no one should have to go bankrupt to pay for healthcare for a child with a disability, a sick family member, or just an emergency that you never thought could happen. That is why I am encouraging everyone to please make sure you explore your options and sign up for healthcare coverage.  It is more important than ever that folks take advantage of this open enrollment period early because there are many changes this year that, unfortunately, make it more difficult for individuals and their families to sign up for health insurance. Even if you already have a plan, it is worth checking out healthcare plans, as these prices change from year to year.  First, open enrollment today is a month and a half shorter this year than it has been in the past. Open enrollment is from November 2--right now--until December 15. That is just 45 days. Do not wait to check this out. It is best if you go today to find out if there is a better plan for you or if you need to secure health insurance on the marketplace.  Second, the administration has significantly reduced funding for in-person assistance, called navigators, who help individuals and families sign up for healthcare coverage. This action is leaving millions of Americans and thousands of North Dakotans without the critical help they need to understand their options and enroll in meaningful healthcare coverage.  I want to make a point here. For those of us who in the past have always had the option of getting healthcare coverage through an employer, there is always someone in that employment office, in the payroll office, or in human resources who helps you through. This is not unique in needing this assistance. It is not unique to the marketplace. It is access and information that you have through your employer, if you are getting your insurance through your employer. The idea was that the same opportunity for information should be made available in person on the marketplace, but it is not. So we have to try and fill in those gaps. Because we have these gaps, we are in many ways seeing a number of cutbacks and a number of folks not getting access to the information they need.  In fact, the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's Health Board does not have enough funds to operate as a navigator, and they will not be able to help North Dakotans sign up for coverage as they have done in previous years. Another navigator in my State, Minot State University, has had its Federal funds cut by over 96 percent.  Since 2013 the uninsured rate in North Dakota has been reduced from 11 percent to 8 percent, in large part because of the work of these navigators. The navigator grantees in my State have provided an invaluable service by guiding families through the process of determining the best private health insurance coverage for them, as well as through traditional Medicaid and Medicaid expansion application processes. Many North Dakotans who sign up for coverage qualify for Federal assistance to help afford that coverage. So it is vitally important that they understand Medicaid, that they understand Medicaid expansion, and that they understand the tax implications of the plans they are selecting.  But even those numbers that show the decrease in uninsured in North Dakota don't tell the full story. Not only have navigators responded to daily inquiries both during and outside of the open enrollment period, but they have identified and responded to the challenges of increasing enrollment, particularly in rural and hard-to-reach areas of the State that are less likely to have access to coverage through an employer.  Slashing funding for navigators also has implications for Indian The Indian Health Service has had challenges delivering quality care to Native Americans in my State and certainly in our region. But those issues have lessened as more Native Americans have enrolled in traditional Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, and private health insurance, enabling these families to access quality, affordable healthcare to stay healthy. Thanks to the increase of third-party payments, we are no longer limited to life-or-limb care at Tribal IHS facilities in the Great Plains service area.  Adding to the turmoil of the enrollment process, the administration also announced that it is cutting off Federal funding that helps make healthcare affordable for families, known as cost sharing reduction payments. As a result, many individuals and families will see their premiums skyrocket by double digits. Due directly to this decision and the uncertainty it has injected into our healthcare system, one insurer has exited the healthcare marketplace in North Dakota and another has reduced its health insurance plan offerings, leaving many counties in my State with only one insurer for consumers to choose from. Ironically, North Dakota was one of the best covered States in terms of options and choices. That option and that source of pride has been diminished as a result of the lack of consistency with cost sharing reduction payments.  A recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that if the administration stopped paying the cost sharing reduction payments, as it has now done, there would be serious consequences for individuals and families across the country. The report said families' premiums would jump about 20 percent, many families would be left without health insurance options as the lack of payment would force many insurers to leave the market, and it would also add $194 billion to the deficit over a decade.  Despite these efforts to sabotage the marketplaces and jeopardize access to coverage for families, we have fortunately seen a surge of encouraging enrollment numbers in the first week of enrollment. But the American public deserves better, and I will do everything I can to ensure that consumers know their options, that consumers are connected with opportunities for meaningful coverage, and that they are provided certainty in the future about healthcare costs.  On November 1, I had launched a new page on my website, heitkamp.senate.gov, to help provide resources and enrollment information to North I sincerely hope folks who are looking to buy health insurance on the marketplace in North Dakota take advantage of that website.  Access to affordable quality healthcare is a must, and I am proud to have worked with a group of Republican and Democratic Senators, led by Senators Alexander and Murray, to reach a deal to offer some immediate[[Page S7146]]fixes to make healthcare more affordable and accessible in North Dakota and across the country. Our bill would specifically address many of the new challenges that face folks during open enrollment.  The deal we unveiled last month would provide certainty for insurers and customers by restoring the cost sharing reduction payments for 2 years and restoring Federal funding for outreach and enrollment efforts in States, including the navigator services that I talked about earlier. It incorporates an idea that I have been championing for many years, which is to create a lower cost copper plan with lower premiums and higher deductibles to increase coverage options for young, healthy families, where they aren't so much worried about the day-to-day costs of healthcare but that catastrophic event that could throw them into a lifetime of poverty.  The agreement would also provide flexibility for States to continue to explore their options to deliver the best healthcare options to their citizens. This recognizes that one size does not fit all and that we need to have more flexibility for States to experiment and to provide the kind of quality of care and the kind of care options that work best for their  On top of having significant bipartisan support, there is a bonus. The bonus is that CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that enacting the legislation would reduce the deficit by $3.8 billion without substantially changing the number of people with health insurance coverage.  Now Congress needs to pass our bill. I have long said there are good parts of the healthcare reform act and parts that need to be fixed. Our bipartisan deal is an important step to help families afford healthcare coverage so the health reform law works better for North  How rare is it in this body to have this many people come together to propose one piece of legislation? I know that if you put this bill on to the floor tomorrow, it would easily pass with over 60 percent of the We need to get this done. We need to get it done to ensure the American public that we are serious about responding to their concerns about healthcare but that we are also serious legislators who can, in fact, fix the problems that we have in this country.  This isn't everything that we have been working on, but it certainly is the most important and the highest priority to pass the Murray-Alexander bill. But there are other proposals to improve healthcare that I am working on. I recently introduced a bill to delay the health insurance tax for 2 years and make coverage more affordable for the 156 million consumers across the country impacted by the fee. It would also make the tax deductible moving forward, providing more certainty for families to plan into the future.  Reducing the impact of the health insurance tax--a fee that directly impacts the healthcare affordability for families and small businesses--has had broad, bipartisan support. In 2015 Congress passed a 1-year delay of the fee. This delay benefited consumers, seniors, employers, State employees, and The average premium reduction from that delay of the fee was 3 percent.  If we think about the health insurance tax and we think about the sales taxes that many States enact, many States will tell you we don't enact sales tax on the necessities of life, whether it is food or whether it is electricity. Clearly, this is a necessity of life, having this health insurance. This health insurance tax is nothing more than a regressive sales tax on premium costs, and I believe we need to find a better and more commonsense alternative.  Another commonsense bill that I have introduced to help make healthcare more affordable for middle-income families is a bill that would address what I call the current cliff problem on premium assistance that many middle-class families and seniors face when they earn above 400 percent of the Federal poverty level, putting affordable care out of reach.  Right now, those earning just a nominal sum over--$1 over 400 percent of the Federal poverty level, which is $47,550 for an individual and $97,200 for a family of four--are no longer eligible for any premium support to make health insurance more affordable. This perhaps is one of those issues that I have heard more about than almost any other issue in the Affordable Care  What my bill would do is to get rid of the cliff and instead insert a slope. The bill would enable more young, healthy families to be able to obtain affordable healthcare coverage while diversifying the insurance pools, and it would make sure seniors with high medical costs aren't forced to lose those hard-earned retirement savings or go without care. Smoothing out that cliff will make health insurance more affordable, will make this bill more responsive to our middle-class taxpayers and middle-class families, and will provide some certainty for these families as they look at the high cost of healthcare and insurance premiums into the future.  I also cosponsored a bill to provide stability in the insurance marketplace by making the current reinsurance program for individual health insurance market permanent. It would be similar to the successful programs used to lower premiums and spur competition in the Medicare Part D This reinsurance program would provide funding to offset larger than expected insurance claims for health insurance companies participating in State and Federal insurance marketplaces, and it would encourage them to offer more plans in a greater number of markets, improving competition and driving down costs for patients and families.  It is that catastrophic cost, which is unpredictable for the actuaries, that drives up high cost. If they know that catastrophic cost above a certain amount is subject to a reinsurance plan and those costs are shared more broadly than just within that system, the healthcare that they can provide and the insurance commissioners can secure with a reasonable rate would be greatly reduced.  Lastly, another critical program that ensures access to coverage throughout the country and in North Dakota is the Children's Health Insurance Program, or I have to tell you, I know many, many families who, without CHIP and without their ability to find that temporary opportunity to use CHIP to insure their children, would be bankrupt today. They would have incurred healthcare bills just from a simple fall off a swing set, and they would be spending a lifetime trying to figure out how they are going to pay or they would be finding their way into the bankruptcy court.  CHIP is a program that has been used since the late 1990s, and more than 2,000 North Dakota children currently rely on it for affordable healthcare. It provides a critical bridge between Medicaid and private insurance coverage for children. We have to act fast to reauthorize CHIP and let thousands of children across the country who are on CHIP and their families know that we care about them, that we are standing up for them, and that we are not going to leave them behind.  Unfortunately, the authorization for this critical and lifesaving program expired at the end of Without action from Congress, some States will already run out of Federal funding before the end of the year. Some already have and require emergency funding from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to shore up their programs so that they can still provide that continuous coverage while we fail to act here in the  While my State of North Dakota is not scheduled to run out of funding until April of next year, this is not a way to administer an ongoing and critical healthcare program. We need to get this program reauthorized now before it is too late and we have unnecessarily hurt American children and have created unnecessary unpredictability for families who need and have found some incredible benefit in covering their children with this program.  The Senate Finance Committee has marked up bipartisan legislation, the Keep Kids' Insurance Dependable and Secure Act, to extend authorization for the program for 5 years. Congress needs to act now to make sure these families know their children have dependable and secure coverage. No parent and no family member should have to wonder if their children will get critical care. Put yourself in their shoes.  Since I came to the Senate in 2013, I have said there are parts of the healthcare law and the healthcare system that need improvement to make sure it is working for hard-working[[Page S7147]]North Dakotans and hard-working As I have outlined, these are some tangible, commonsense policy proposals that have strong bipartisan support, and we can, in fact, make this system better. We can, in fact, tackle this challenge of healthcare, and then we can roll up our sleeves and reduce costs and make healthcare more affordable and less costly in this country.  We can do all of that. We have a country and a group of American citizens who are counting on us to do our job to make sure that, into the future, they will have the certainty that they need, the predictability that they need, to get their healthcare coverage and to make sure that their families will never have to worry about having to file bankruptcy because a child has fallen off of a swing set.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

856,topic-id,756,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, we know that, unfortunately, after 8 years of bad economic policies from the Obama administration, working people did not receive a pay increase. We know that we had one of the lowest labor participation rates in modern history. We know that the economy was limping along at 1\1/2\ to 2 percent economic growth.  But, fortunately, Mr.Speaker, a new day has dawned and now, all of a sudden, we see that, with the policies of Republicans in Congress, with the policies of the Trump administration, we are seeing promising signs. What we are seeing all of a sudden now is 2 quarters, Mr.Speaker, of 3-plus percent economic growth. This means a difference to working families. They are finally seeing increases in their paychecks, increases in their take-home pay.  That is why one of the most exciting policies that are being worked upon today that we hope to see soon is fundamental, pro-growth tax reform for the entire American economy; one that would grow our economy and that makes a Tax Code fairer, flatter, simpler, more competitive; one that would lower rates for families and allow 90 percent of Americans to fill out their forms on something akin to a postcard; something that would help our small businesses and entrepreneurs.  I look forward, Mr.Speaker, to having that legislation on the floor soon. But we have legislation today that is also important to our small businesses and our entrepreneurs, H.2201, by the gentleman from  What is so important about this legislation, Mr.Speaker, is that it would allow our entrepreneurs and our small businesses to more effectively be able to reach out to family and friends to get the needed capital to start their businesses.  A 2014 survey by the Kauffman Foundation found out that over 28 percent of startups raise their funding from their personal network. Mr.Speaker, we have a challenge, and that is the Securities Act does not clearly define what is a public offering or, conversely, a nonpublic offering. So this makes it very difficult for our early-stage entrepreneurial growth companies to go out and do any kind of private placement to raise funds from friends and family.  Now, we know that a private placement is already something that is established in law. But what isn't established is a bright line, safe harbor for these business enterprises to go out and raise these funds.  So what we also know, unfortunately, from our Securities and Exchange Commission is that a registered offering is simply not economically[[Page H8668]]feasible for a small business, an entrepreneur, an issuer who is seeking to raise less than $1 million.  So too often, Mr.Speaker, we have a number of these enterprises that, frankly, just never get jump-started because they don't have the opportunity for a private offering. That is why it is so important.  I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Emmer) for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the House floor today.  So it is a simple piece of legislation. Again, it simply allows a bright line, safe harbor for very small offerings. It requires that each purchaser has a substantive preexisting relationship with an officer, director, or shareholder of the issuer.  The issuer must reasonably believe that there are no more than 35 purchasers of the securities, and the aggregate amount of all securities sold by the issuer cannot exceed $500,000 in a 12-month period.  So, Mr.Speaker, we are talking about a very small portion of startups, but a very vitally important section of our startups that need capital.  Mr.Speaker, a few decades ago there was a company where a gentleman borrowed money from his father to import Japanese sports shoes, and he purchased 200 pairs of these Japanese sports shoes. He started a business called Blue Ribbon Sports, and today we know it as  A few decades ago there was an investor out in Omaha, Nebraska, who borrowed money from seven friends and family members, including his sister Doris and Aunt Over the next 9 years, this initial investment grew, and this gentleman purchased something called Berkshire Hathaway, the textile company that has now led to the Berkshire Hathaway empire.  In 1994, there was a gentleman who took a loan from his parents, moved to a two-bedroom, small apartment, and launched a company called  We want to make sure that the next Berkshire Hathaway, the next Amazon get launched, and that is why it is so critical we enact H.2201.

So all of a sudden, it is because of Dodd-In addition, we know that the ranking member supports the Federal Reserve policy of paying interest on excess reserves where the Federal Reserve takes taxpayer money to pay the big banks not to loan money. So if the ranking member was curious why the big banks aren't loaning to the small businesses, which they aren't--and prior to the Trump administration, we know that small business lending by banks was at a 25-year low--it is the very reason, Mr.Speaker, that we need the bill, the legislation of the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Emmer) so that we can unlock this.  Again, there is no surprise why, after 8 years of Obamanomics and the thinking from my friends on the other side of the aisle, small businesses have languished and why the economy has dropped down to a 1\1/2\ to 2 percent GDP growth. In fact, I think President Obama is one of the few Presidents in American history never to enjoy a year of 3 percent economic growth.  Now, he may personally have enjoyed it, but the American people didn't, Mr.But the good news is that there is a change in administration and a change of attitude. That is why it is so important that we be able to get capital to our entrepreneurs, to our small businesses. Let them thrive again on Main  We hear so often the ranking member decry Wall We are talking about offerings of a half a million dollars. No on in Wall Street would touch that with a 10-foot pole. This is about Main Street, not Wall Street, Mr. It is interesting, as I listen to my friend, the ranking member, decry the fact that someone might be able to raise capital under this particular set of circumstances. Well, I have a news flash for all my colleagues. Already the SEC can grant a private offering for exactly the set of circumstances that my friend, the gentleman from Minnesota, puts into his bill. All the gentleman is doing is creating a bright line, safe harbor, so that the next Nike or the next Amazon isn't stopped from launching their enterprise by having to spend a million dollars on lawyers and accountants trying to navigate this uncertain murky labyrinth of SEC waters trying to determine what is a private offering and what is a public offering. That is all he is doing.  Again, this is already legal. It simply is discretionary to decide what is a private offering and what is a public offering by the Securities and Exchange  We now, Mr.Speaker, have had two quarters of 3-plus percent economic growth. We are seeing working We are seeing their paychecks increase yet again. We are seeing hope and resilience in the American Dream yet again, but we have so much more work to do, and that is why H.2201 is so critical.  It takes small businesses today to be the big businesses of tomorrow. They are the creators. They are the job engine of They are the drivers of increased paychecks, greater economic opportunity, and a bigger, bolder American I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for this great legislation. I encourage all of my colleagues to adopt it.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.

1219,topic-id,543,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria: the images of the human misery and the economic devastation are still clearly imprinted on our minds.  Unfortunately, we know that part of this is a result of a failed National Flood Insurance Program, which, Mr.Speaker, faced three important challenges.  First, it is a bankrupt program. It is unsustainable. Taxpayers are on the hook for $1.2 trillion, running an annual actuarial deficit of $1.5 billion. It has already received two different bailouts, for a combined total of about $25 billion.  Also, it incents and subsidizes people to actually live in harm's way.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, it is a government monopoly that, notwithstanding subsidized rates, still, unfortunately, has unaffordable premiums for many.  Today is a good day, Mr.Speaker, because today the House gets to vote on the 21st Century Flood Reform  I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.Luetkemeyer) for his leadership on the mapping reforms and reinsurance. I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Ross) for his reforms on opening up the market. I certainly want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.Duffy) for his tireless effort and leadership in bringing this bill to the floor.  There are a lot of good reforms in this bill, Mr.Speaker, for both taxpayers and ratepayers. Let me just briefly touch upon two.  It is an absolutely revolutionary reform, Mr.Speaker, that we can break open the government monopoly and bring in market competition, innovation competition, and more affordable rates for so many.  Milliman, one of the actuarial experts within the marketplace, released a study a couple of months ago talking about the market competition, saying: ``Based on our estimates, this would hold for 77 percent of all single families in Florida, 69 percent in Louisiana, and 92 percent in Texas,'' who all would see cheaper premiums.  We know that is not theory. It is actually happening in the market today. In the nascent part of the market that is open, people are getting hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars of savings.  One of the great tragedies that I saw in my native State of Texas, in Houston, was how few people actually took up flood insurance. Think, Mr.Speaker, if we had competition, if we had advertising, if people could roll that into their homeowner rates, how many more people would have been protected by the ravages of these hurricanes.  One more reform, briefly. We have these repetitive loss properties where people live in areas that flood over and over and over. I met a couple of families in They had three floods in 8 years. We have got to help them.  This bill provides more money for relocation, for flood-proofing, and for mitigation, than any other flood reform bill, all by 25 percent. We would prioritize these areas.  We also have to realize that if we are going to make this program sustainable, we cannot have 1 percent of the properties causing 25 percent of the losses.                              {time}  1515  Ultimately, if all we do is rebuild the same properties in the same fashion in the same location, that is neither wise nor compassionate. We have an opportunity to enact historic reforms. We should do it today.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Five years ago, Superstorm Sandy devastated my district. Ocean County, my home, was the epicenter of that storm. You might remember the photographs of the iconic Jet Star roller coaster sitting in the ocean. That was my district.  Even today, I have thousands of constituents who are still out of their homes. Now, thousands more are experiencing the same thing because of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  140 million Americans live in coastal counties, and the NFIP has done a lot to help with zoning standards, building standards, flood plain management standards. It hasn't been run perfectly, but this program is desperately needed by people in areas like mine.  The NFIP has fiscal issues, and this bill seeks to address them. It is the only Federal disaster program that actually collects money in advance of a disaster.  When I got on this committee a year ago, I set out on this issue to do four things: a long-term reauthorization, improve affordability, increase accountability, and enhance mitigation efforts.  This is a 5-year reauthorization. It reduces the mandatory annual cap on premium increases; it brings more accountability, including my language to forbid NFIP from hiring disbarred lawyers; and it doubles the mitigation coverage from $30,000 to $60,000.

1253,topic-id,509,"Mr.Speaker, first, I have some good news for my friend on the other side of the aisle. I would have him pay very careful attention to title VI of the 21st Century Flood Reform It has everything to do with the whole Sandy appeals process. We have 25 pages of reforms dealing with what the gentleman was describing, including Section 601, Penalties for Fraud and False Statements in the National Flood Insurance  And, indeed, after Sandy, many of the policyholders were wronged and there was much that we learned from that experience, and we tried to listen very carefully to a number of our colleagues from New Jersey and New York and, indeed, took many of the provisions which they have suggested.                              {time}  1630  The gentleman from New Jersey, indeed, has some very legitimate issues and concerns. Many of them, I hope and trust, have been addressed in this[[Page H9237]]bill. It is not too late. I would urge the gentleman to look at that title IV of the bill and perhaps he would be encouraged to support it.  Otherwise, Mr.Speaker, I must urge rejection of the motion to recommit because, as you heard from the gentleman from New Jersey, he says it is all about delay. We can't delay getting people out of harm's way. We can't delay getting people out of neighborhoods that have flooded four, five, six, seven times in the last 8 years.  For those who can't afford flood insurance, we can't delay getting them market alternatives, where, in the 2 percent of the market that exists today, particularly in Pennsylvania, there are people that are not just saving hundreds of dollars, Mr.Speaker, but even thousands of dollars. We can't delay.  We know that this is a program that is unsustainable. It is a bankrupt program that is being funded, regrettably, by a bankrupt nation. Taxpayers are on the hook for $1.2 trillion and an annual deficit of $1.5 billion of actuarial deficit a year.  This thing isn't just broke, Mr.Speaker, it is bailout broke. We can't delay. We can't delay trying to put this back on a path of sustainability so the next time we have a serious storm or superstorm, we want there to be funds available to actually pay claims.  So, no, Mr.Speaker, we cannot delay. We cannot delay, and we cannot continue to do what we have done in the past in these repetitive loss areas and have our hands unclean by putting people back in the exact same neighborhoods that haven't just caused the loss of their property, but one day may very well cost the loss of their lives. We cannot delay.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a rejection of the motion to recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

1230,topic-id,2534,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my chairman.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill sponsored by my friend, Representative Sean  He has worked tirelessly in crafting a solution here, along with Representative Luetkemeyer, Representative Ross, and our full committee chairman, Mr. While the National Flood Insurance Program provides needed insurance coverage, it has numerous problems as currently constructed, and the 21st Century Flood Reform Act seeks to implement much-needed reforms in this program.[[Page H9230]]  In addition to reauthorizing the flood program for 5 years, this bill provides increased transparency to the public, provides more information to people living in harm's way about past damages and the risk of flooding, ensures mapping is timely and accurate, ties rates to risk, gives consumers greater choice in flood insurance options, and incentivizes mitigation and risk reduction.  Currently, in Arkansas, we have one private insurer that offers flood insurance. A second underwriter is near approval by our Insurance Commissioner Allen  The benefits to the consumer through private insurance are significant, as noted by the Milliman study.  For example, one private insurer in Arkansas covers up to $2 million in coverage per occurrence, Mr.Speaker, as opposed to the NFIP, which limits coverage to $250,000, across all rating categories at premiums substantially below the  Further, this private insurer can offer replacement value, reimbursement for living expenses if an individual or family is displaced by a flood. The NFIP does not.  For almost 50 years, the experiment in government-provided flood insurance has proven to be ineffective, inefficient, and indisputably costly to hardworking taxpayers. The time for action is now.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record USA Today, Washington Post, Washington Times, and Chicago Tribune articles.                  [From the USA Today, 7, 2017]                Make Flood Insurance Reflect Actual Riskafter hurricanes, taxpayers can't absorb ever increasing tabs: Our view       In 1968, in the wake of Hurricane Betsy, Congress decided      it had enough. Flooding was destroying too many homes,      leaving financial and physical devastation in its wake.       So lawmakers created the National Flood Insurance Program,      a government-run insurance fund for homeowners in flood-prone      areas.       And that's when things got really bad.       The NFIP has been losing money ever since. The program is      nearly $25 billion in the red and is running annual deficits      in the range of $1.4 billion. That's because it's a creation      of Congress and therefore sets its premiums according to what      is politically convenient rather than what is actuarially      sound.       With Hurricane Harvey devastating the Houston area, and      Hurricane Irma bearing down on the Southeast coast, the      program is certain to take a massive loss this year.       What's worse, the NFIP's woes are self-generating. Because      the premiums are well below what should be charged, this      effectively subsidizes construction in flood-prone areas. And      that means its losses grow as more flood-prone land is      developed.       Hurricane Katrina, which ravaged the Gulf Coast in 2005,      exposed just how costly and counterproductive the program had      become. In 2012, after years of debate, Congress enacted a      law that made flood insurance rates more reflective of actual      risks and expanded the areas considered flood-prone.       This generated Category 3 blowback from homeowners and the      real estate lobby, and in 2014 Congress passed another law      undoing much of the first.       Now, with catastrophic losses mounting and sea levels      rising, it's time to revisit the issue.       Making federal flood insurance more reflective of reality      would only go so far in dealing with the problem of building      in flood-prone areas. That's because many homeowners don't      have flood insurance and because much of the damage that the      government eventually pays for is not covered by the program.      (Private insurance typically covers damage from wind but not      water.)       With Katrina, for instance, the flood insurance payout was      $16.3 billion. But Congress passed supplementary spending of      more than $100 billion to provide intensive relief and      temporary housing, as well as fix broken levies.       With Harvey and Irma, the federal tab beyond of flood      insurance is likely to be even higher. Only an estimated 20%      of homeowners in the area affected by Harvey even bothered      with flood insurance, a number that has been dropping in      recent years. But making flood insurance reflect actual risks      is a vital first step in coming to grips with reality.       In the past several decades, Americans have flocked to      coastal communities, many of them in parts of the country      prone to hurricanes. With the hit to taxpayers growing and      the danger increasing, restraint--even some reversal--of this      trend is needed.       While people in the hurricane zones deserve disaster      assistance and the nation's sympathy, taxpayers can't simply      absorb ever increasing tabs for flood losses. The government      needs policies that encourage people to build their homes in      safer places. Harvey and Irma are just the latest sobering      wake-up calls with that message.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, 30, 2017]               After Harvey, Flood Insurance Needs Reform       Congress must be generous in helping to repair the damage,      to lives and to property, from Hurricane The full      extent of the destruction may not be known for a long time      but is evidently catastrophic, just as the damage wrought by      Katrina and Sandy was. Even as they demonstrate that they      have a heart, lawmakers must also show that they have some      brains. Specifically, the United States is long overdue for      smart reforms to one of the major government institutions      designed to help people cope with the risk of natural      disaster: the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which      has underwritten a total of 5 million policies providing      homeowners and some businesses $1.2 trillion in coverage.       Now almost half a century old, the NFIP grew out of what      was, at the time, a basic reality of the insurance business:      Flooding risks were actuarially imponderable, so insuring      against them was uneconomic for the private sector,      especially in places such as the hurricane-prone Gulf of      To fill the gap, the federal government offered      coverage on two conditions: that local communities would take      appropriate land-use and other measures to prevent      development in risky low-lying areas; and that homeowners      would pay actuarially sound premiums.       Elegant in theory, the plan gradually succumbed to real      estate interests, with the result that flood insurance      enabled rather than managed development along coasts and in      other flood-prone areas--ultimately putting more people and      property at risk than might otherwise have been the case. As      it happens, well-to-do people benefit disproportionately from      this program; they're the ones who tend to build big houses      on the beach. The NFIP has spent many millions of dollars to      repair properties that have been repeatedly flooded.       Prior to Katrina, the NFIP was nevertheless generally able      to pay for coverage through the premiums it collected.      Massive losses from that storm and Sandy, however, have      driven it into de facto bankruptcy; the program has been      forced to borrow more than $24 billion from the treasury to      pay claims, a debt that was nearly unpayable even before      Harvey hit. At the moment, the program has $1.7 billion on      hand, plus $5.8 billion left on its line of credit with the      Treasury--and some 373,000 policyholders in the Harvey flood      zone who will expect to get paid.       Coincidentally, the program is due for reauthorization on      30. Ideally, this deadline would galvanize Congress to      ensure enough money is available to pay current commitments,      while reforming NFIP for the future. What's needed are      tougher flood-risk mitigation requirements, more realistic      premiums and encouragement for private-sector involvement in      the business, based on modern technology that may enable      insurance companies to underwrite risks they could not have      underwritten in the 1960s.       Recent history, alas, doesn't make us optimistic: Congress      did reform the program on a bipartisan basis in 2012, only to      see much of that undone under pressure from coastal-state      lawmakers in 2014, after ``There is a tide in the      affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to      fortune,'' Shakespeare wrote. Congress, though, tends to go      with the political flow.                                  ____               [From the Washington Times, 6, 2017]                Fixing Flood Insurance in Harvey's Wake         private insurers could help in matching cost and risk       Hurricane Harvey took the most devastating flooding in the      city's history to Houston, and the cost of repairing the      damage will be astronomical. Sadly, the federal flood      insurance program is already underwater and Harvey will only      add to the flood of red ink. It's clear that Congress must      reform the program so the premiums property owners pay more      closely reflect the flood risk. Until that happens, nature's      frequent fury will continue to undermine the finances of      everyone.       With the angry water from the Category 4 hurricane damaging      200,000 Houston-area homes and business firms, early      estimates place the cost of restoration as high as $190      billion. That would eclipse the $108 billion loss in the 2005      Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy in 2012. President      Trump expects Congress to quickly approve a $7.9 billion down      payment for emergency relief.       The National Flood Insurance Program, designed to wield the      financial muscle of the federal government to protect flood-     prone property, has proved to be a money sieve. It covers      about 5 million flood-prone properties nationwide, worth      about $1.2 trillion, and collects about $3.5 billion annually      in premiums. The program was $25 billion in the red before      Harvey hit--a clear indicator that overall, property owners      who are required to carry flood insurance are not paying for      the risk.       Among the existing program's shortcomings are its policy of      grandfathering older structures built in low-lying regions      before accurate floodplain mapping began, encouraging owners      to renovate rather than demolish. Between 1978 and 2004,      these risky properties comprised 1 percent of the program's      insured properties but accounted for 38 percent of the damage      claims, according to the Government Accountability      The federal program is subsidizing insurance[[Page H9231]]     for expensive waterfront property along the Southeastern      coastline, favoring the wealthiest homeowners.       Congress has made several attempts to put the insurance on      a sustainable financial footing, without success. The program      will expire at the end of this month, which offers      legislators an opportunity to resolve the unintended      consequences of the program.       Several constructive bills were reported out of the House      Financial Services Committee in Among the proposals are      provisions giving more leeway to private insurers who      currently offer only federally approved policies. Doing so      would allow insurers to set premiums tailored to individual      properties, resulting in a closer match of insurance cost and      flood risk. Other provisions would limit claim payments for      repeatedly flooded properties and require the use of      replacement cost in setting insurance rates.       The House is seeking a five-year reauthorization of the      National Flood Insurance Program and the Senate version calls      for a 10-year term to ensure continuity. Both versions back      provisions to allow a gradual increase of private-sector      involvement in flood insurance. It's an idea endorsed by the      free-market Cato Institute, which says ``the ideal `reform'      to the [program] would be to fully privatize flood insurance.      That would be more likely to fix the system in a way that      would limit the long-run government liability than any      alternative legislative approach.'' Allowing private insurers      to have a larger role in future flood protection is sensible.       No one could have foreseen the once-in-a-lifetime deluge      that swamped Houston, but actuaries make their bones      calculating risk, including in their calculations such      unpredictable natural disasters as tornadoes and earthquakes.      Insurance premiums undistorted by Washington rules would give      consumers a clearer picture of flood hazards, helping them      avoid the mistake of building in the path of storms like      Hurricane With monster storm Irma bearing down on      Florida, the need is urgent for Congress to safeguard      Americans from future property loss and new heartbreak.                                  ____               [From the Chicago Tribune, 7, 2017]          The Folly of Paying Americans To Live in Harm's Way       In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey's hit on Texas, and      with Hurricane Irma threatening Florida, let's all      acknowledge one reason for the vulnerability of Americans who      live in low-lying coastal regions of the Sun Belt: The      federal government has been paying people to locate there.       Not explicitly, of course. But an abundance of inexpensive      housing is a big attraction. And a big factor in the low cost      of housing in the Houston area is that developers are free to      build almost anywhere, including marshy, low-lying areas      where land is cheap.       The chance of being swamped deters some people, but the      government offers flood insurance to pay for repairing and      rebuilding. The owners of a Houston home that flooded 16      times in 18 years got more than $800,000 in payments--for a      house worth just $115,000.       The folly of the government's flood insurance program has      been evident for decades, and some Midwestern communities      have been in on the action. We've written about how federal      flood insurance has serially benefited many of those who      refuse to move from river flood plains, sometimes to a fault.      After the Mississippi River flood of 1993, one Grafton, Ill.,      resident explained to a reporter that he had collected      $24,000 in federal insurance for damage to his small house      from floods in 1979, 1982, 1986 and 1992. For '93, he      expected an additional $32,000. His total insurance premiums      since buying the house in 1975: $6,000.       Houston, according to a new study by the National Wildlife      Federation, accounts for more than half of all the properties      that are flooded and paid for over and over. It has ``managed      to host three `500-year floods' in the past three years,''      notes Michael Grunwald of Each one costs taxpayers      large sums. Yet development in these precarious spots      continues apace.       ``Why are we writing flood insurance (policies) for new      construction in flood zones?'' asks Craig Fugate, who headed      the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Obama      administration. ``Think about it: If you're going to build a      new structure in the flood zone, the private sector can      insure it. And if they can't insure it, then why is the      public subsidizing the risk?''       It's a big subsidy. Thanks to past storms, the flood      insurance program has a $25 billion deficit. The      Congressional Budget Office found that coastal counties at      risk from tropical storms make up just 10 percent of all the      counties with federal flood insurance policies--but generate      75 percent of the claims and most of the deficit.       So why is the public subsidizing the risk in these places?      Because the people living there, the politicians they elect,      the businesses they patronize and various interest groups      (such as homebuilders and the real estate industry) have      strong stakes in preserving this program. They've been able      to prevent the sort of reforms needed to make it actuarially      sounder and closer to self-sustaining.       In 2012, Congress passed a modest package of sensible      changes that would have raised costs to the flood-prone. But      two years later, feeling the political heat, lawmakers      backtracked.       Homeowners located in areas that are expected to flood      every 100 years are required to buy flood insurance if they      want federally insured mortgages. But they pay rates far      lower than the risks warrant.       That gap deprives builders of incentives to stay out of      low-lying areas that are vulnerable to flooding--or to      elevate structures to keep them dry when the waters rise. It      also promotes the destruction of wetlands that could reduce      flooding. Oh, and it helps to tilt migration toward      vulnerable coastal regions like those of Texas and                                  ____  ",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9209.txt,2223,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2874, 21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM",2017,14,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

872,topic-id,261,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.  I, too, stand in strong support of this legislation.  A recent poll out by Ernst & Young showed that millennials are starting businesses at a rate that is only one-third of prior generations.

Over 78 percent said that they wanted to start a small business eventually, but they had insufficient means to do so. This bill starts to rectify that problem.

132,topic-id,1081,"Mr.Speaker, I was here when Democrats and Republicans came together to enact bipartisan tax reform in 1986. We paid for our tax overhaul and never once asked future generations to foot the bill.  President Trump said in July that tax reform is, and I quote, ``going to be easy.'' I will admit that, to someone like him who is new to government and who may not understand fully how Congress works, what we achieved in 1986 may, in hindsight, appear to have been easy. It wasn't.  It was difficult because it required compromise; it was difficult because it required trust; and it was difficult because it required both parties to make tough choices and share the burden of taking responsibility, along with the benefit of claiming victory.  Somewhere along the way, Mr.Speaker, it seems that many in the Republican Party lost sight of this truth. First on healthcare, and now on taxes, they have decided that it would be easier not to work with Democrats at all, so they have chosen a partisan path, where the only ones with whom they have to compromise are themselves. It is ``going to be easy,'' they said.  And the result: We now expect, on this floor, a bill so dangerous and so reprehensible to the taxpayers of this country that nearly every major organization representing taxpayers, small businesses, workers, farmers, seniors, home builders, realtors, teachers--and I could go on--oppose this bill.  There are more serious problems with the Republican tax bill than time to address them on this floor, so I want to highlight the three that make it so utterly dangerous to our economy and to the middle class.  First, most of the benefits of the tax cuts Republicans are proposing will benefit only those at the very top 1 percent; the 99 percent left behind. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center's latest analysis, under the Republican plan, 47 percent of the tax cuts will benefit that top 1 percent, just 1.2 million households making more than $900,000 a year.  Let me repeat: the top 1 percent will get nearly half of all the tax cuts in this bill, and 50 percent for the 99 percent.  Second, the Republican plan raises taxes on 36 million middle class families. That is not what the Speaker said it was going to do. He said he would give everybody a tax cut. That was not true, and is not true. 36 million middle class American households will see their taxes go up over the next 10 years as a result of this Republican plan.  And third, the Republican plan will explode the debt by more than $1.7 trillion over the next decade. This bill is the granddaddy of all debt creators. This means that those tax cuts, more than half of which benefit only the top 1.5 percent, will be paid for by a huge tax increase on our children and on our grandchildren.  The late Senator Russell Long from Louisiana liked to cite an old ditty about who gets stuck with the pain of tax increase. He said: ``Don't tax you, don't tax me, tax that fellow behind the tree,'' meaning, of course, that none of the voters want a tax increase, so if you raise taxes, make sure it is someone else who is out of sight and out of mind.  In this case, sadly, Mr.Speaker, that fellow behind the tree is a child. This is a tax increase on all those children. It is a child who can't vote and doesn't have a voice in this debate.  The Republican plan asks Members to pile $1.7 trillion or more of debt onto our children and grandchildren and put the fiscal sustainability of our country at further risk. When confronted with this fact, we heard only the same arguments we heard in 2001 and 2003, before the last major Republican effort to cut taxes precipitated the worst recession in our memory and a period of severe budget tightening that led to disinvestment in our country under the threat of sequestration.  That argument, flawed and false, is that these tax cuts will grow the economy so much that the ensuing growth will magically erase all the deficits we know their plan will accrue.  So easy, Mr.Speaker, so easy. The cuts will simply pay for themselves, we[[Page H9182]]are told. We have been told that before, of course. The cycle repeats: Republican promises that tax cuts will pay for themselves, followed by massive deficits, 189 percent increase in the deficit under Ronald Reagan, followed by Republicans insisting that we respond with austere cuts to investments in our people and in our opportunity. So easily they forget.  But middle class Americans will not forget who is responsible when their taxes go up, when their tax increases pay for tax cuts for the top 1 percent, and when, in the years ahead, more and more investments need to be cut to pay the interest on the debt under which this plan will bury the children and grandchildren of  And all because my colleagues across the aisle wanted to skip out on doing what they knew would be hard, just as they did when former Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp introduced his comprehensive tax reform that was responsibly paid for. That is Dave Camp, Republican, State of He is retired now, but he offered a responsible bill, and it was not even considered by his committee.  He asked his colleagues to do something hard, of course, but they dismissed it, dismissed it out of hand, because it would have required hashing out a difficult compromise. But easy is no synonym for successful.  President Kennedy told us that we choose these things, that is, tackling our greatest challenges, ``not because they are easy, but because they are hard.''  So I ask my Republican friends--no, I urge them, set aside this dangerous, reckless, and irresponsible bill. Instead, let's choose the hard path that involves hard choices and trust and all of those things that made tax reform successful in 1986, which are the missing elements in this flawed bill.  Mr.Speaker, Democrats are ready to sit down with you and work on this challenge, together. It won't be easy, that is a promise, but if we do it together, if we do it in a way that doesn't balloon the debt or raise taxes on the middle class, we have a chance to do it right. Let's take that chance.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9181-4.txt,566,SGT. DOUGLAS J.

When they come back, that is $20 billion in revenue each year. They will spend another $3 billion each year on R&Then they will spend $6 billion in manufacturing.  The gentleman and I have had so many discussions about how to bring manufacturing jobs back. That is why I am so excited about this bill coming to the floor the next week.

1099,topic-id,675,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.  I don't share his enthusiasm for this bill, which I think will be very harmful, will explode the debt, and be a bait-and-switch on the middle class whether it will get a tax cut early and a tax increase later on.  Is the gentleman aware, when he talks about growth, that in the comparable 9 months of 2016 to the same months in 2017 under Trump, that there were 326,000 more jobs created in 2016 than have been created in 2017 in those analogous months?  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I am a little confused that the gentleman is not enthusiastic about this bill. I have read what some people on the other side of the aisle have said about this bill. I heard one phrase that the gentleman recently used about the middle class. I would just caution my friend in inferring anything negative to the middle class with this bill because there were some on the other side of the aisle that made some comments.  Like most things we say, we get fact-checked. The Washington Post, to a few Senators and my own Senator from California, tried to claim this was poor for the middle class.  Do you know what happened?  She did not receive one Pinocchio, she did not receive two Pinocchios, and she did not even receive three She received four Pinocchios on that statement. That is the most Pinocchios you can get.  Mr.Speaker, if I may, I wanted to do the research. I wanted to look. Is this tax bill good for all of America? Especially because I want the gentleman to be enthusiastic about it, I looked at Maryland's Fifth Now here are just a few facts:  Currently, in the Fifth Congressional District of Maryland, 47 percent of the filers take the standard deduction. So not only will they be better off, it will actually double, and they will see the increase in their pay on day one, January 1.  Another 11 percent have itemized deductions. They will no longer with our new higher standard deduction, so they will also save more money, not to mention the time and confusion by not having to itemize. That means, before we even look at lowering tax rates, 58 percent of my friend's district is better off on day one.  Now, how about the median family of four?  A median family of four in Maryland's Fifth Congressional District earns $123,000. For the 20 percent of those families that don't itemize today, they will receive a tax cut of $5,000. For the 80 percent who are itemizing today, they will get, on average, $2,200 in a tax cut.  But those are not the only people I am worried about. How about the single mother who is earning $30,000 in your district?  Well, she will no longer have to pay any tax under this plan. In fact, she will receive a refund of about $500 to $700.  How about the small business, the entrepreneur, the factory creating jobs?  The small-business owner making about $400,000 in Maryland's Fifth Congressional District will see a savings of nearly $19,000.  So what I am confused about is: How can't you be excited about this bill?  In short, Mr.Speaker, to the people not just in my friend's district, but all of America, let me state this: under our plan, the average family of four earning $55,000 a year will not pay any tax.  For so many days and so many years, I have heard from the other side of the aisle and my friend talking about the middle class. We have a bill that is on the floor that is going to help the middle class, the single mother not to pay any tax and getting money back; the median family there getting $5,000 back; the small business getting 19--I don't know how much more we have to do to get my friend excited, but next week he will have the opportunity.

1100,topic-id,1547,"Mr.Speaker, a lot more is the answer.  Why is the NFIB, Mr.Speaker, against this bill if it is so good for small business? Why is the AARP against this bill if it is so good for small business? Why is the Peter Peterson Foundation, which is worried about the national debt, against it?  Mr.Speaker, since I have been here, my Republican friends have been talking about we have got to balance the budget. The President said he is going to balance the budget in 9 years. That was hooey.  Our Republican friends have said they are going to balance the budget. They said it in the Price budget. They said it in the Ryan budget. The budget deficit keeps getting bigger, and they have been in charge of economic policy for a long time.  The fact of the matter is, Mr.Speaker, I have got a list of 50 groups that are against this bill because they think it hurts both the debt and middle-income people.  The distribution, according not to fact-checkers but the Joint Committee on Taxation, $1 trillion of the tax cuts go to business, $230 billion to individuals, and $170 billion on estates essentially. Now, that doesn't add up to the $1.7 or $1.8 trillion that has been computed to be the deficit created--the additional debt--by this bill.  In fact, that is why this bill is being rewritten right now. I guarantee my friend--and he can call me this next week--that the bill that was introduced last Thursday will not look like the bill that we will consider on the floor. It won't.  It won't because, first of all, the debt is a problem for, apparently, some people. It is a big problem for me. We ought to pay for what we buy. That is what the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr.Camp, did: a bill that was paid for--an honest bill that was paid for, as was the 1986 tax reform bill. It did not add to the debt.  This adds an extraordinary amount to the debt. As a matter of fact, it adds in one fell swoop the debt that was created on the Reagan administration approximately $1.7 trillion. It is being rewritten now.  My presumption is, as we have done 49 times this year, that this bill will be presented under a closed rule in a transparent Congress, where everybody's views are going to be considered. I stand here and say that the gentleman is not going to bring this bill to the floor with an open rule where amendments can be offered, where people can discuss options, and we can see what the ramifications are to middle class taxpayers.  The Joint Committee on Taxation also pointed out that, of this figure, individuals are going to get a tax cut of[[Page H8681]]which Mr.Ryan talks about of $1,182--a typical family, he refers to them--but that figure will start to go down in 2019 and will go down further in 2020 so that it is a bait-and-switch. You get it up front, but we are going to take it away.  In the Ways and Means Committee, one of the reasons, Mr.Speaker, I tell the majority that I am not very enthusiastic is because they asked: Do we also do this for businesses? Do we also do it for the estate tax? Do we also do it for the wealthy?  The answer to that question is no. Only the middle-income worker has their tax cut reduced over the next 5 years, but not so with business, not so with the wealthiest taxpayers in America, and not so, obviously, with the estate tax. So that, I can tell the gentleman, is why I am not nearly as enthusiastic about it as some others would be.  We limit State and local tax deductions, which the middle class takes. We limit the mortgage interest deduction used by homeowners. We eliminate the student loan deduction and we eliminate the medical expense deduction. So if you have a major medical expense, you are going to lose under this bill.  It eliminates the deduction for moving expenses if your employer wants you to go more than 50 miles from your home. It eliminates the deduction for the adoption tax credit. That could be a credit of $13,570 per eligible child that you will lose. It eliminates the deduction for teachers that helps them purchase pencils, papers, rulers, and other materials for students.  It eliminates the deduction for dependent care assistance--a substantial challenge for many of our families in It eliminate personal exemptions, which Americans can currently deduct for themselves, a spouse and dependents that grows to the size of the family. If you have a large family, you lose under this bill. If you have one child, the majority leader may be right. When you get to two children, three children, and four children with no deductions, you are going to lose under this bill. That is why I am not very enthusiastic about it.  I tell this leader, Mr.Speaker, perhaps the changes will make me more enthusiastic. Perhaps there will be a recognition that this is not the bill that is going to do what it is purported to do.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I just caution the gentleman on some of the things that he says because I do not want him to end up with any The gentleman knows my fondness for him. Just today in The Washington Post we had a joint editorial about our trip down to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and to the Keys in  The one thing I do want to say to the gentleman is I know he mentioned a few people in the very beginning, NFIB, whether they support the bill or not, I say: Just stay tuned.  When the gentleman talks about will there be changes in the bill, this is the process. When you go through committee, do you not want to have the committee to have input?  So there will be some changes. Substantially? But I do want to also advise my good friend--maybe I could refer the gentleman to clause 5(a) of rule XXI of the House That will tell my friend how a bill comes to the floor coming out of the Ways and Means Committee when it deals with taxes.  Now, I know the gentleman talks about debt. I know the gentleman brought up teachers, that it is a $250 tax credit. The only concern I have is that it is only in Washington that they could be opposed to a bill because they think we are eliminating a $250 tax deduction while we are giving somebody $12,000 more tax free. There is a lot more there going around, and I think that is a much bigger gift. If you ask the American public what they wanted, I will guarantee you which side they would pick.  Now, the gentleman talks about debt--and I have great respect for my friend--but just a few weeks ago, the gentleman voted for a budget that called to raise taxes by $3.9 trillion. That same budget would also increase the deficit by $6.8 trillion--that is not what the gentleman said on the floor; that is what he did on the floor--over 10 years. It assumed a $764 billion deficit in 2027.  Now, we had a budget on our side. A budget lays out the framework for the future. The Republican budget resulted in a $197 billion surplus in 2027 and a $2.6 trillion deficit over 10 years. So I am concerned about the budget, and my votes show that. I want to put us on a path where we balance.  We had this debate just a couple weeks ago, and that debate set up the mechanism to go to tax. And the one thing I have learned time and again--and my friend and I have had this discussion--we have got to protect the entitlements for the future, but we know that is what is going to break us if we don't do something about it.  We have got to grow the economy. As we have watched the history of America, every generation has improved on the generation before it. But 75 percent of Americans believe this generation will not.  Why?  Because of the last 10 years. It has been our lowest growth that we have seen in decades. We have always averaged more than 3 percent GDP, but we didn't then. We have just gone through two quarters at 3 percent where we had five hurricanes.  I watched the Atlanta Fed look at this and say that we could be above 4 percent.  Do you know what opportunities we have?  So it just won't be the Maryland Fifth District that is getting that money back or the small businesses that are hiring more with that $19,000.  But imagine what that family will do with that $5,000. They will get to determine that. They will buy more than just a pencil. They will invest in their kids' future.  So I think that it is an opportunity for all of us to come together, put people before politics, and let's make sure this bill goes out in a very strong vote.

1101,topic-id,1463,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.  Mr.Speaker, I heard almost word for word the majority party intone that vision and prediction when we passed the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts--almost word for word. That economic policy stayed in place until 2009.  Why?  Because the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the                              {time}  1145  And what did it bring us?  An almost Hoover-like depression. Not quite, because when we came into office, we invested in bringing back a declining economy.  Mr.Speaker, the majority leader didn't respond when I said the growth of jobs was better in 2016, under Barack Obama, than it has been under Donald  We are going to have an opportunity to debate this bill, but I will tell my friend, when he says this is the process, the process is going to be that the chairman of the committee will come in with a major amendment to this bill that none of us on this side will have seen, and the bill will be brought to the floor next week.  My friend, the majority leader--and I want to say something: he is my friend, and we do cooperate on a positive fashion--and I disagree strongly on this issue. I am against the creation of debt.  He mentions the budget. That is a fair point. But I have been pretty consistent throughout my career to join with the Peterson Foundation that says we have got to get a handle on this debt. We have a growing economy and 4.4 percent unemployment. The stock market is going up.  So what do we have here?  An extraordinary stimulus bill with $1.5 trillion, $1.6 trillion, $1.7 trillion, $1.8 trillion of debt, presumably, as the majority leader admits, to stimulate the economy. Very frankly, if Democrats were doing this, we would be savaged by the other side.  We will debate this, and we will look forward to seeing how the bill is going to be when it comes to the floor. Hopefully, we might get the manager's amendment, or, better said, the chairman's amendment, prior to its coming to the floor. I would hope we would have, at least, maybe even 48 or 24 hours' notice of what that amendment is going to look like so that not only[[Page H8682]]we, but the American people, who will have no opportunity to come in and give their opinions or testify, at least they will know what we are voting on. We will try to make sure they know.  One other issue I would like to speak about, Mr.Speaker, before we end, and that is the request that the President of the United States made to us.  He talked about the order issued by President Obama dealing with childhood arrivals who came here as minors, not on their own volition, called DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood There were a number of Republicans who had a press conference today, and they said we ought to pass that bill before the end of this year. I urge the majority leader to pass this bill by the end of next week, before the Thanksgiving break.  This, Mr.Speaker, I believe is an issue on which, as Mr.Barton said, who is one of the senior Members on the Republican side of the aisle, if it is brought to the floor, it would have over 300 votes.  Representative Barton said that, not me. I said that last week. I am glad that Mr.Barton agrees with me.  We need to take care of this issue at the request of the President of the United States, who said: I love these kids. He didn't follow that with: I am not going to send them out of the country. What he said was that they were not protected the proper way and asked the Congress to take care of this.  I have urged the majority leader, Mr.Speaker, for the last 2 months, to bring this to the floor. I know that a task force has been appointed. I don't know that the task force has reached a conclusion, but I would urge the majority leader and Speaker Ryan, who urged the President not to rescind the protection of these young people, urged him not to rescind President Obama's order. But when he did, the President said: I am going to do it because it wasn't done properly. It is the Congress' responsibility.  Mr.Leader, I would urge you to bring to the floor the Dream Act, which is the manifestation of the response to that. There are other options as well. We understand that. But something ought to be brought to the floor so that these young people are not twisting in the wind through Thanksgiving and This is the country they know. This is the country in which they have been brought up.  When Rush Limbaugh says, ``We are not going to send these kids home,'' I can't believe that any of us on this floor are going to vote to send these young people home. We need legislation to pass to protect them and to give them the confidence.  There is a wonderful editorial--I urge all of you to read it--from Bob Gates, our former Secretary of Defense under both Presidents Bush and He wrote an editorial about the thousands of, essentially, DACA children, young people, who have served in our Armed Forces valiantly. As a matter of fact, he said the attrition rate is a lot less with DACA-protected individuals than it is with others.  Bob Gates is right. We ought to act. President Trump, in this instance, is right. It is our responsibility. We ought to act. Fred Upton said that today in the press conference. Joe Barton said that in the press conference. The gentleman from Washington State, who led the press conference, said that.  Mr.Leader, this is an issue I think on which we agree. The tax bill is going to be an issue on which we are in contention. Let's give the American people another example, as we have in the past, of a place where we can work together, get something constructive and positive done for our country and for these young people.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The gentleman does know that we have put a task force together. I happen to serve on that task force. We have met over a half dozen times.  It is true that when the President made his decision, he made it based upon whether it was legal or not for an action the executive branch took. The courts said it was not. So it was, rightfully so, moved back into this body, which is the legislative body.  He gave us 6 months to get the job done. That i what we are continuing to work on. I look forward to continuing to work with the gentleman to get this done. I believe we will be able to.  There is one point I do want to bring up to points the gentleman made prior. I do know that he is concerned about this.  As the gentleman does know, if we just get 1 percent of growth in the GDP, that will add over a trillion dollars of extra revenue. The Atlanta Fed is already saying we are going to get 1\1/2\ trillion dollars. Who knows how high we can go, but I would never want to put a ceiling on I will always bet on I just want to unshackle the things that hold us back.  You are correct; you talked about how we now have the lowest unemployment in decades. For the 58th time since the election a year ago, the stock market broke a record. Business confidence is at an all-time high.  Most of that is happening because America has the anticipation of us passing a tax bill. That is why I think this is a moment that will be significant for every  They will look back on their vote for next week as one of the most important votes they would ever take. What is the future you want to have for your children; what is the opportunity you want to give them?  Did you put the rhetoric aside; did you look at the bill based on constitutionality; did you look at the bill based upon your own constituents?  Take your partisan hat off, and when you look at that at the end of the day, if it empowers your small businesses, if it gives every American more money in their own pocket, if the projections are that it is going to grow the economy, do what is right. Do what is right for America, and I believe, at the end of the day, history will treat you well.

Why do I say that?  The Joint Committee on Taxation tells me that. Other think groups tell me that from the conservative side of the ledger.  So we will argue this bill, but I will repeat again that I have heard that argument over and over and over again. I heard it in 1981, and we exploded the debt. I heard it in 2001 and 2003, and we exploded the debt. We had the deepest recession anybody on this floor who is sitting here now has experienced. I hear it today.  The reason the Peter Peterson Foundation is against this is because they believe exploding the debt by another $1.5 trillion will be an extraordinary detriment to our country.

152,topic-id,1024,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, cybersecurity is critical to consumers, investors, market participants and, frankly, the very markets themselves. However, in April of 2016, the GAO--the Government Accountability Office--identified weaknesses regarding information security protocols at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and noted that the SEC's failure to implement an agencywide data security program had occurred.  Once confirmed in May of this year, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton initiated an assessment of the SEC's internal cybersecurity risk profile and their approach to cybersecurity from a regulatory and oversight perspective. The SEC's internal assessment found that the agency had inadequate controls and that there were serious cyber and data risks.  Unfortunately, in September of this year, Chairman Clayton issued a statement on cybersecurity in which he revealed that a cyber breach ``previously detected in 2016 may have provided illicit gain through trading.''  Specifically, a software vulnerability existed in the test filing component of the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval--also known as the EDGAR system--which resulted in access to nonpublic information. While this breach provided hackers access to highly sensitive material, at the time, the SEC believed ``the intrusion did not result in unauthorized access to personally identifiable information''--or PII, as we commonly refer to it--therefore, ``jeopardize the operations of the SEC, or result in a systemic risk.'' And that was a quote from the SEC's report.  However, unfortunately, in a follow-up disclosure shortly after that, Chairman Clayton revealed that personally identifiable information, including names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, were actually compromised for two individuals in that particular breach.  The GAO report and the EDGAR data breach underscore what is now even of greater concern, the sufficiency of risk control mechanisms for the SEC-approved consolidated audit trail, or also known as the CAT system. The CAT will be the most comprehensive repository of market data we have seen, and it will collect and identify every order, cancellation, and trade execution for all exchange-listed equities and options across all U.markets. It will also collect personally identifiable information beginning 1 year after it begins accepting market data.  Thesys Technologies, which was selected to be the plan processor for the CAT, is scheduled to begin accepting data from self-regulatory organizations who must provide data to CAT on Wednesday, November 15, just merely days from today.  Many of my colleagues, as well as market participants, have voiced concerns about the cost of building and implementing such a system and the amount of PII that will be required to be collected by the  Last Congress, several Members wrote to former SEC Chair Mary Jo White expressing serious concerns[[Page H9141]]about the security of such sensitive information held within that CAT system, as well as those who will have access to such information.  As I mentioned, the deadline for the SROs to begin reporting to this CAT system is just 2 days away. It is paramount that the SEC has adequate data security controls in place before that implementation.  Previously, in committee, I had put it this way: That is a repository of the information of gold. Gold is the equivalent of information today. What they are doing is they are putting more gold into that data vault, and we don't have the security to support it.  So while the CAT may be a helpful resource for the SEC, and even the self-regulatory agencies or organizations--SROs--once fully implemented, insufficient data security controls will undermine confidence in our markets and may very well result in the CAT being counterproductive.  Thus, I joined with Financial Services Committee Chairman Hensarling in writing Chairman Clayton to ``encourage the SEC to delay implementation of the CAT system until the SEC can implement information security safeguards and internal controls to ensure the security of confidential and sensitive data.''  No assurances for a delay in implementing the CAT have been provided, and even if they have, it is appropriate for Congress to set baseline standards to ensure that controls are in place. In other words, Mr.Speaker, we are trying to do our job.  H.3973, the Market Data Protection Act, introduced by Representatives Davidson and Sherman, is necessary to ensure that the SEC is properly securing critical data that supports our financial markets as well as the personal information of millions of customers with broker-dealer accounts.  Specifically, the bipartisan legislation would mandate that the SEC, FINRA, and the operator of the consolidated audit trail, in consultation with the SEC's chief economist, develop comprehensive internal risk control mechanisms to safeguard and govern the storage of market data, all market data-sharing agreements, and all academic research using that market data.  The bill also halts market data reporting to the consolidated audit trail until the operator of the CAT system develops such internal risk control mechanisms that they are deemed satisfactory.  The EDGAR security breach and the recent massive Equifax data breach--and I might add, Mr.Speaker, we just saw a report of an NSA breach that had just happened, our largest database--well, this would become the second largest database in the country.  Those breaches--in which the sensitive information of nearly 150 million Americans have been compromised, in the Equifax breach--only underscore the importance of proactively ensuring that any highly sensitive data being collected by the Securities and Exchange Commission or at the SEC's discretion, subject to their oversight, is protected with appropriate safeguards. We owe that to the American people.  The importance of cybersecurity at the SEC cannot be overstated. The SEC's ability to safeguard nonpublic financial information and other highly sensitive data instills confidence in the markets.  SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar recently commented regarding CAT that ``deadlines are important, but the SEC has one chance to get this right. We have to make sure that we have everything locked down. We can get it done, or we can get it done right. We need to get it done right.''  I couldn't agree more with Commissioner That is why this legislation is so urgently needed. I commend the bipartisan work of Representatives Davidson and Sherman, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this very important bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

501,topic-id,862,"Mr.President, today is America's lucky day. And we all know what the definition of ``luck'' is--luck is when opportunity meets preparation. We are very lucky as a country and we are very lucky as a Senate that our majority leader, Mitch McConnell, was where he is and is where he is at the time he is. It was his vision a few years ago that the tax issue was going to emerge as the central issue in the growth and development of our country and that unless we met the challenges of our Tax Code, opened up opportunity for our public, and expanded opportunity for our businesses, the American people could succumb to a high-tax system without productivity.  We also got lucky because Senator McConnell picked a man to be chairman of this committee--Orrin Hatch--who brought years of experience in the U.Senate and the compassion that Orrin Hatch has as a Mormon and as an American to a tax code that is by no means simple--it was always complex--to make it simpler and fairer, pro-family and pro-jobs.  Let me tell you something. There are a lot of disappointed people overseas right now because those who have been picking our pockets by inverting American corporations to foreign systems because their taxes were lower than ours are out of luck. Now those people are going to be incentivized to come to America, to make investments in our country, to expand opportunities and jobs in our country. No longer will companies want to leave America; companies will invest and be more That is fantastic, and that is why this is a pro-jobs tax bill. It is going to create a lot of opportunity, and opportunity is what Americans want and what Americans need.  For the average American family--and let me talk about my family for a second. I think I am pretty average. My wife and I are fortunate. We have three great children and nine great grandchildren. I was lucky enough to have worked in a small LLC--limited liability partnership--real estate brokerage company, mom-and-pop brokerage company. My wife taught in public schools. Our children went to the University of Georgia and to the public schools of our community. We saved for their education. We did everything we could to invest in hope for them in the future, and today they are all gainfully employed. They are all happy, but they are all struggling, as everybody else is, with a burdensome tax system, with less opportunity than we would like for them to have. By simplifying the tax system, by making it fairer, as we have done here, we have given more opportunity to my grandchildren, my children, and more opportunity to  Lastly, I want to make this point: There are only two ways to raise taxes or raise revenue. One is to charge more. That means you raise somebody's taxes. The other way to do it is to create opportunity. So people create companies and jobs because the opportunity is there. When you create opportunity and when jobs are created, revenues increase. When people do better in their jobs, their incomes go up. When companies have people who do better in their jobs, they expand. When they expand, they produce more revenue that becomes taxable. So we raise our revenue not by lowering expectations but by raising opportunity for our people and for our children.  We are very lucky as Americans today. I am very lucky to be in this U.Senate today. We are lucky to have had leaders in place at a time that was right to address our country's biggest challenge and do it the right way.  When I was in the Georgia Legislature, I sat next to an oldtime rural-hat politician who ran the Ways and Means Committee of the Georgia I will never forget that one day he and I were sitting side by side as we were listening to a gentleman make a speech in the well. The gentleman in the well paused a minute to try to make a point, and he said: Ladies and gentlemen, let me tax your memory. And my old friend, the rural-hat politician, said: Damn, I wish I had thought of that.  That is the way we have done taxes in this country for a long time--just taxed people's memory, tried to look for an opportunity to tax something for us. What we are doing here is we are creating opportunity. We are raising revenue through prosperity. Americans will raise revenue for their pockets first before the country gets the revenue second.  So it is our lucky day--lucky to have good leaders, lucky to live in the greatest country on the face of this And if we do our job--if we pass this bill before the end of this year and[[Page S7143]]change the Tax Code of the United States of America to a fairer, pro-jobs, pro-family tax code--then we will have made our contribution to history at a time when it was our opportunity. I hope it will never be said that we let our country down when that opportunity was available to us.  I yield the floor.

559,topic-id,1608,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) for yielding, but also, most of all, for his leadership on so many critical issues around jobs and infrastructure and, of course, for pulling together this Special Order hour tonight on this very important subject, because I think that the American people should understand that Republicans in Congress are trying to literally rewrite the U.economy with no hearings. There were a couple of markups, but those are not hearings.  We only just have been receiving some of the information about what is even in the bill to be able to then see what the effects are. The reality is that we owe it to the American people to share how this bill will affect their wallets, their housing, their education, their healthcare.  Contrary to what the majority would have you believe, this tax bill is yet another vehicle for Republicans to raise taxes on millions of middle class families and reward the wealthiest and the largest corporations by handing them trillions of dollars worth of taxes.  I think that Democrats certainly would love to see, as my colleague said, real tax reform; by that, I mean tax reform that benefits the middle class and tax reform that would allow us dollars to invest in jobs, in infrastructure, in education, in healthcare.  The twist this time that I find interesting is that the Republican majority has mysteriously jettisoned its dogmatic fidelity to reducing deficits because--make no mistake about it--however you slice it, this Republican tax bill will explode the budget deficits.  Mr.Speaker, Representative Garamendi talked about the two-step earlier, and that is right. We are all going to be dancing a two-step, because what the Congressional Budget Office literally just released is an analysis that said that this tax bill will lead to an immediate $25 billion cut in  This bill has many provisions in it. We have been talking about the State and local tax deduction elimination, and that is very important to my home State of We have about 800,000 people who are able to utilize that deduction and were able to reduce their tax liability by more than $2,600 in Republican and Democratic districts[[Page H9243]]across our This deduction is significant to our communities because, really, it guards against double taxation.  The Fraternal Order of Police just came out against what I am calling the Republican tax scam and the SALT deduction elimination in particular, the State and local tax deduction elimination.  Why did the Fraternal Order of Police come out against this?  They came out against this because they understand the two-step that we are going to be dancing. They know that this tax bill and those kinds of deductions are ultimately going to lead to, and this is their words: endangering the ability to fund these essential law enforcement agencies that actually keep our communities safe.  Another crucial mistake that the Republican tax bill makes is eliminating tax-exempt bonds. For folks who are out there who are listening, the way to think about this is, if you have an affordable housing problem in your community, if you have a shortage of housing, which is happening across the country, then these tax-exempt bonds are the way that we help encourage and leverage local and State dollars for affordable housing, with these tax-exempt bonds. They advance, also, vital transportation projects, and they support infrastructure projects and hospitals and colleges and charities.  For example, in my district, Seattle Pacific University has been able to use these private activity bonds to finance nearly $42 million in construction and renovations to the library and to the school of law. Similarly, the University of Washington Medical Center has been able to use these bonds to finance critical medical research that has been beneficial across the country.  In eliminating several education-related tax deductions, the Republican tax bill is also cutting off valuable paths forward for students of all ages to not only improve their lives, but also to join a workforce that depends on 21st century skills.  Mr.Speaker, I know that Mr.Garamendi spent a lot of time on this, but repealing the student loan interest deduction is in this bill.  Let me just remind people that we have $1.4 trillion in student loan debt across the country. That is actually more than credit card debt in this country.  This bill, in order to get tax cuts to the largest corporations and wealthiest 1 percent of individuals, would repeal that interest deduction for student loans. In Washington State, that would harm more than 275,000 taxpayers who claim that benefit, and it would raise their yearly taxes by more than $1,000 a year, on average.  This bill also hurts our responsible employers who provide tuition assistance to help workers continue their studies at associate's or undergraduate or graduate levels. Tens of thousands of students in Washington State have benefited from this deduction, and that is true across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 70 percent of all companies offer tuition assistance.  There is another provision in this bill that everyone should be concerned with, and that is eliminating the medical expense deduction. That deduction basically says that, if you are suffering from a long-term, very expensive disease, if you have somebody in a nursing home and you have to pay for expensive long-term care for people, or maybe somebody who has cancer, that you can deduct medical expenses for those kinds of illnesses. This bill says: No more.  Once again, repealing the estate tax, which benefits 5,400 of the wealthiest families in this country, in order to provide that tax benefit, we are actually going to take away this critical tax deduction from regular working families around medical expenses.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, the Republican tax bill repeals the new markets tax credit, which, again, was created, really, to incentivize investment in low-income and rural areas. That tax credit is responsible for creating more than 12,000 construction jobs and an additional 11,500 jobs in related industries across my State, just as an example. It is extremely shortsighted to repeal that, especially for an administration and a party that says that they care about investing in jobs and infrastructure.  We haven't seen any package for jobs and infrastructure. I am not sure if you have, but I certainly haven't.  The reality is that this bill, because of this two-step that Mr.Garamendi described, which I will just remind people what that is: the transfer of trillions of dollars in wealth from the middle class to the largest corporations and the top 1 percent, and then through exploding the deficit, which this bill does, suddenly triggering automatic cuts as well as a rationale for cutting more from Medicare, from healthcare, from education, from transportation. That is what we are looking at.  The early word on the Senate Republican tax bill seems to be just as bad, because I just heard before coming onto the floor that Senate Republicans are now saying that, once again, they are going to try to strip healthcare from Americans by including a repeal of the Affordable Care Act individual mandate.  My State knows exactly what happened because we had a situation like that about a decade ago, and we had to dig our way out of that. What it meant was that, essentially, healthcare became way too expensive for everybody. There were too many people who were not buying healthcare, so you were stuck with all the people who needed healthcare, who were very sick. It exploded costs and, literally, Americans across the country ended up suffering because of that.  They weren't able to get rid of healthcare. Three times we have beaten that back. The American people, Republicans and Democrats in urban and rural districts across the country, said: We want our healthcare. Do not take our healthcare away from us.  Once again, the Republicans plan to incorporate this provision and try to once again strip healthcare.  Mr.Speaker, insanity is said to be doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. I really fear for the threshold that we are crossing. I fear for our economy; I fear for our middle class families; I fear for our low-income families; and I fear for the future of this country and for the future of our children, because the reality is what we should be doing, if we were going to raise money through taxing people more, is we should be investing that money into infrastructure, jobs, healthcare.  Not only are we not cutting the taxes for people who need it the most, but we are increasing their taxes to give a tax break to the wealthiest, and we are destroying all of the investments that we need to make into the U.economy and into our communities and into our middle class families.  This is an incredibly important issue. I don't think people realize that the Republicans are trying to push through a vote on this bill as early as this  I really believe that there are some Republicans across the aisle who have come out already and said that this is not a bill that helps our families, that helps our middle class families and our communities. They have been courageous to say that.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank them for doing that, and I want to urge other Republican colleagues across the aisle to do the same thing so that we can protect the livelihoods of our children and our families into the future.  Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative Garamendi so much for his leadership and for his constant speaking out on the need to invest in infrastructure and jobs.

It is all being done simply to subsidize the lifestyles of the rich and shameless. It is a Ponzi scheme. It is a heat-seeking missile aimed directly at middle class families. It is a flimflam, and it must be defeated.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9266-3.txt,2149,PASSING TAX CUTS,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
231,topic-id,3041,"Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a freedom fighter, a beloved mother of her embattled country, Ukraine, Amina  Amina Okuyeva was killed on October 30 in a cowardly act. Hitmen fired on Amina and her husband, Adam Osmayev, from behind bushes as they drove by. Amina was struck in the head. The world lost a brave and beautiful soul, but her loss will not be in vain.  Born in the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa, Amina was a mother, a medical surgeon, a Ukrainian police lieutenant, and a Muslim activist known for her stance on equal rights for men and women in uniform.  She was a born leader. At the start of the Euromaidan movement, Amina joined the peaceful protest in Ukraine in the bitter cold, a protest against repression. To show solidarity, she lived with her husband on the streets in a tent.  When Russia illegally invaded Crimea in eastern Ukraine, Amina was the first woman to join the Kyiv-2 volunteer battalion. She was awarded the Hero of Ukraine Medal to honor her bravery at the battle of Debatsevo in the grizzly fight against Russian aggression.  She fought valiantly towards progress and against oppression. Her bravery symbolizes the extraordinary strength of Ukrainian women as the fountainhead of that society, holding the country together during significant duress.  With her assassination, the world has yet again witnessed how the enemy of democracy will stop at nothing to silence those who stand for freedom and justice. Amina had been a target before due to her unyielding patriotism. A failed attempt occurred in June when an assassin, pretending to be a journalist, shot at her. Tragically, evil persisted, and on Monday, October 30, it succeeded in snuffing out the beauty of Amina and wounded her husband, but her spirit endures larger than life itself.  Amina is one of many fallen victims to Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine and its clandestine efforts to snuff out championships of freedom. The list includes Nikolai Andrushchenko, Nikolai Volkov, Denis Voronenkov, and numerous other valiant souls who placed their lives forward in liberty's struggle.  I include in the Record an extensive list of lives purged by Kremlin-related assassinations.           List of Kremlin-Related Assassinations or Attacks       ``Two common causes of death for contemporary Russians are      heart attacks and falling to one's end from great heights. In      some cases, these fatal events actually even have something      to do with high cholesterol or tragic mishaps.``--journalist      Michael Weiss, Daily Beast                                  2017       April 19--Nikolai Andrushchenko, a 73-year-old Russian      journalist who openly criticized President Vladimir Putin's      administration died just over a month after he was attacked      and beaten by unknown aggressors. The Novy Peterburg founder      died in a Petersburg hospital from injuries attributed      the 9 March 2017 attack. Andrushchenko, a former      Petersburg city council member, was placed in a medical coma      after suffering major blunt trauma to his head, but never      recovered.       March 27--Nikolai Volkov, head of the Russian Interior      Ministry's construction department was shot dead in Moscow in      a residential neighborhood near his home at 10.30pm. A man      was seen grabbing Vokov's bag and then shooting him before      fleeing. Police, who stated that the body was riddled with      bullets, also stated that they believed the motive to be      robbery, further suggesting that they did not ``believe''      that the killing ``was directly related'' to Volkov's job.       March 23--Denis Voronenkov, 45, Russian politician who fled      to Ukraine gunned down outside hotel in       March 21--Nikolai Gorokhov, 53, was thrown/pushed head      first from fourth story window. Russian security services      claim, ``he fell'' trying to move a bathtub that was being      lifted over a balcony. Experts have replied that when people      ``fall'' from a balcony accidentally, it is almost never      headfirst. Unidentified workers were on the balcony. Gorokhov      represented Sergei Magnitsky, a fellow Russian lawyer who      exposed Russia's largest ever tax fraud. Gorokhov was set to      testify in Moscow against investigator in Magnitsky case. He      was also consultant for Preet Bharara's anti-Russian mob case      in New He remains in intensive care, in a coma, with      severe head injuries.

His daughter is      married to brother of Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime      ``consigliere.'' Ukrainian parliamentarian Andrii Artemenko      asked Oronov to set up a meeting in late January with Michael      Cohen, where they were joined by former Trump Organization      employee Felix Sater, a known mobster and supposed FBI      informant. Oronov/Artemenko presented Mr.Cohen with a peace      plan for settling territorial disputes between Russia and      Ukraine, giving full control of Crimea to Putin, as well as      allegedly[[Page H9186]]     compromising information on Petro Poroshenko, that they hoped      would force Poroshenko's resignation. Mr.Cohen took their      plan and their compromising information and forwarded to      then-National Security Advisor Michael       February 20--Vitaly Churkin, 64, Russia's ambassador      to the United Nations, died of an apparent heart attack;      autopsy proved inconclusive.       February 2--Journalist and opposition politician Vladimir      Kara Murza became violently ill and temporarily paralyzed for      2nd time in less than two years due to poisoning. VKM father,      in an apparent effort to save his son from Russian      authorities, continues to deny that he was poisoned. However,      VKM and VKM wife state that it was purposefully effort to      poison. VKM wife stated that in 2015 after murder of Nemtsov,      a VKM colleague, Russian special services did not want to      outright kill her husband with the first poisoning did not      want to kill him, only ``frighten him and destroy him slowly      with illness.'' However, now they believe they did want to      kill him and effort failed since VKM was taken to doctor      immediately after showing symptoms. VKM left Russia on      19 and is now in the U.Recently testified at a      congressional hearing on the Russian opposition.       January 26--Alexander Kadakin, 67, Russian envoy to      India, died after a short illness.

Both men were      last seen the first week of December when in a Stalin-style      touch, a bag was suddenly thrown over Mikhailov's head during      a meeting of fellow intelligence officers, and he was dragged      out. Mikhailov has not been seen since. And is now almost      certainly dead. Sergei Mikhailo was believed to have been a      U.intelligence asset within the Russian government. The      third arrest was of Dmitry Dokuchayev, a hacker known by the      name ``Forb.''       January 9--Andrey Malanin, 54, Russian envoy in      Greece, was found dead in his apartment in Athens on bedroom      floor. Greek police stated that ``at first sight'' it appears      he died suddenly from natural causes. No autopsy was      performed, although that is standard procedure when a      diplomat dies.                                  2016       December 26--Oleg Erovinkin, 61, Russian intelligence      official found dead in the backseat of his car parked on the      streets of Russian government agencies have not      released an official cause of death. He was a former general      in the FSB and served as chief-of-staff to Igor Sechin, the      president of state-owned oil giant Russia watchers      have speculated that he might have been a source of      information in the 35-page dossier that detailed alleged      links between the Trump campaign and       December 20--Andrey Karlov, 62, Russian ambassador to      Turkey, fatally shot in the back in The shooter, a      Turkish police officer, shouted ``do not forget Syria''      during the assassination.

Krivovhad served in the consulate as duty commander      involved with security affairs. Russian consular officials      first said Krivov fell from the roof. Then, they said he died      of a heart attack. The initial police report filed on the day      of the incident said Krivov was found ``with an unknown      trauma to the head.'' After conducting an autopsy, New York      City Medical Examiner ruled that Krivov died from bleeding in      the chest area.       August--The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced that      Russian runner Yulia Stepanova's online doping management      account had been illegally accessed. The doping scandal, for      which she blew off the lid, rocked sport and cost over 100      Russians their place at the Rio The Russian runner      says she fears for her life and has been forced to move after      hackers tried to find her location. Stepanova has been in      hiding in the United States with her husband Vitaly, a former      Russian anti-doping official, after giving evidence that the      Russian government for years facilitated widespread cheating      across nearly all Olympic sports.       July--Interfax news agency reported that Aleksandr Poteyev,      64, an intelligence officer accused of defecting and      betraying a ring of Russian spies living undercover in      American suburbs, had died in the United However, the      U.has not confirmed these reports. Poteyev exposed Anna      Chapman and gang of 10, after defecting and entered      witness protection.

January 14--Grigory Rodchenkov, 58, the director who ran      the laboratory that handled testing for thousands of Russian      Olympians and who developed a three-drug cocktail of banned      substances that he mixed with liquor and provided to dozens      of Russian athletes, helping to facilitate one of the most      elaborate--and successful--doping ploys in sports history,      fled to the U.S., seeking asylum and protective custody.      Within the next month, two of his colleagues died.       January 4--Igor Sergun, 59, the head of the GRU      (Russia's military intelligence directorate), who has long      done secretive dirty work at the order of the Kremlin in the      war against Ukraine died suddenly.

Lesin founded the television network Russia Today (RT). The      Daily Beast reports that before his death, Lesin was      considering making a deal with the FBI to protect himself      from corruption charges. Lesin had been at the heart of      political life in Russia and would have known a lot about the      inner workings of the rich and powerful.       May--Vladimir Kara Marza, opposition journalist, deputy of      Open Russia poisoned for the first time.       February--Boris Nemtsov--just hours after urging the public      to join a march against Russia's military involvement in      Ukraine, Nemtsov was shot four times in the back by an      unknown assailant within view of the Putin took      ``personal control'' of the investigation into Nemtsov's      murder, but the killer remains at large.                                  2013       March 23--Billionaire Boris Berezovsky, instrumental in      Putin's rise to power, had a falling out with Putin which led      to his self-exile in the United Kingdom, where he vowed to      bring down the president. Berezovsky was found dead inside a      locked bathroom at his home in the United Kingdom, a noose      around his neck, in what was at first deemed a suicide.      However, the coroner's office could not determine the cause      of death.                                  2012       Alexander Perepilichny, 44, a former member of the Klyuev      Group, dropped dead while jogging in his adoptive home of      Surrey, There was no cause of death stated, but the      assumption by the British coroner's initial finding was that      nothing looked suspicious, even though Perepilichny was a      healthy 44-year-old with no known chronic or debilitating      ailments. Then Monique Simmonds, a researcher at the Royal      Botanic Gardens at Kew, hired by the coroner at the behest of      Perepilichny's life insurance company, uncovered traces of a      rare and toxic plant, gelsemium, in the victim's stomach.      Gelsemium, as it turns out, does not grow in the verdant      climes of It is only found in China, where it is a      favored poison of assassins. Russian hitmen, too, have been      known to access the flower's quiet, lethal capability. At the      time of his death, Perepilichny had been helping the Swiss      government locate and freeze chunks of the missing $230      million, some of which, the U.government concluded, wound      up in Manhattan real estate and American banks.                                  2009       November 16--Sergei Magnitsky, anti-corruption attorney      died in police custody in Moscow detention center after      allegedly being brutally beaten, then denied medical care. He      had been working for British-American businessman William      Browder to investigate a massive tax fraud case. Magnitsky      was allegedly arrested after uncovering evidence suggesting      that police officials were behind the fraud.       July 15--Natalya Estemirova was kidnapped outside her home,      shot several times--including a point-blank shot in the      head--and dumped in the nearby woods. A journalist who      investigated abductions and murders that had become      commonplace in Chechnya where pro-Russian security forces      waged a brutal crackdown against Islamic militants. Like      fellow journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Estemirova reported on      civilians who often got caught between these two violent      forces. Nobody has been convicted of her murder.       January 19--Stanislav Markelov a human rights lawyer known      for representing Chechen civilians in human rights cases      again the Russian military. He also represented journalists      who found themselves in[[Page H9187]]     legal trouble after writing articles critical of Putin,      including Novaya Gazeta reporter Anna Politkovskaya, slain in      2006. Markelov was shot by a masked gunman near the       January 19--Anastasia Baburova, a journalist from Novaya      Gazeta, was fatally shot as she tried to help Stanislav      Russian authorities said a neo-Nazi group was      behind the killings, and two members were convicted of the      deaths.                                  2008       Semyon Korobeinikov, allegedly a clothing salesman, lost      his footing on a balcony and tumbled to his demise. A year      later, Korobeinikov was named as the purchaser of Universal      Savings Bank, a dubious financial institution that had been      fingered by investigators as a way-station for stolen Russian      money. Only he didn't buy the bank. It was part of a      government ruse to exonerate the true owner, an ex-convict      called Dmitry Klyuev, implicated in a series of massive tax      frauds that cost Russian citizens $1 billion. Korobeinikov      might have therefore borne witness against Klyuev, if he      wasn't conveniently dead.                                  2006       November 23--Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB agent, died      three weeks after drinking a cup of tea laced with deadly      polonium-210 at a London hotel. A British inquiry found that      Litvinenko was poisoned by Russian agents Andrei Lugovoi and      Dmitry Kovtun, who were acting on orders that had ``probably      been approved by President Putin.'' Russia refused to      extradite them, and in 2015 the Russian president granted      Lugovoi a medal for ``services to the motherland.'' After      leaving the Russian Federal Security Service, Litvinenko      became a vocal critic of the agency, which was run by Putin,      and later blamed the security service for orchestrating a      series of apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 that left      hundreds dead.       October 7--Anna Politkovskaya, a Russian reporter for      Novaya Gazeta whose book, ``Putin's Russia,'' accused the      Kremlin leader of turning the country into a police state.      She wrote extensively about abuse in She was shot      at point-blank range in an elevator in her building.                                  2004       July 9--Paul Klebnikov, chief editor of the Russian edition      of He had written about corruption and dug into the      lives of wealthy He was killed in a drive-by      shooting in an apparent contract killing.                                  2003       October--Mikhail Khodorkovsky jailed for ten years.       Sergei Yushenkov, the affable former army colonel, had just      registered his Liberal Russia movement as a political party      when he was gunned down outside his home in Yushenkov      was gathering evidence he believed proved that the Putin      government was behind one of the apartment bombings in 1999.       July 3--Yuri Shchekochikhin, a Duma deputy, journalist and      author who wrote about crime and corruption in the former      Soviet He was investigating the 1999 apartment      bombings for Novaya Gazeta when he contracted a mysterious      illness in July 2003. He died suddenly, a few days before he      was supposed to depart for the United His medical      documents were deemed classified by Russian authorities.       April 17--Sergiey Yushenkov, 52, the affable former army      colonel, who had just registered his Liberal Russia movement      as a political party was gunned down outside his home in      Yushenkov was gathering evidence he believed proved      that the Putin government was behind one of the apartment      bombings in 1999. He was shot three times in the back by a      single assailant using a pistol with a silencer, police said.      It was the 10th killing of a member of parliament since 1994. International Press Institute figures on Russian journalists who were               murdered or died in suspicious circumstances       2011--three Russian journalists dead (including newspaper      editor Khadzhimurad Kamalov, shot 14 times as he left his      office); 2010--two dead; 2009--five dead (including a young      reporter from Novaya Gazeta, caught in a hail of bullets);      2008--four dead; 2007--one killed; 2006--two killed,      including Anna Politkovskaya, and Yevgeny Gerasimenko--found      in his Saratov flat with a plastic bag pulled over his head      and computer missing; 2005--two died; 2004--three, including      Paul Klebnikov; 2003--three more; 2002--eight editor      (including Valery Ivanov, editor, shot in the head); 2001--     one; 2000--six dead reporters and editors.

404,topic-id,154,"Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts, Ranking Member Richard Neal, for his exceptional leadership in trying to fix this horrendous bill.  Madam Speaker, the GOP-led tax and deficit disaster rewards the big corporations and billionaires. It will accelerate job outsourcing. Indeed, 50 percent of the tax benefits go to the top 1 percent.  This tax scam locks in--get this--a $621,500 tax bonus to each billionaire in the billionaire class, the top one-tenth of 1 percent. Do you really think they need it?  Meanwhile, this tax scam raids money from the pockets of 38 million middle class taxpayers, likely those caring for their sick relatives or trying to help their kids in college.

437,topic-id,436,"Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and mentor in the House, the dean of our delegation from Massachusetts (Mr.Neal), for his leadership on this issue and so many others.  Madam Speaker, I am always heartened by the quotes of President Kennedy offered by any Member of this body. I would like to think that they would seek to emulate him not just on the marginal tax cuts that were put forth some 50 years ago, but also on his stance on immigration, on civil rights, and on                              {time}  1845  But those are issues for another day, Madam  The issue today is a vote that we will take on this floor tomorrow to rewrite an American Tax Code that will touch every single American life.  True tax reform is complicated, it is cumbersome, and, above all else, it is deeply personal. But this bill is none of those things. It is a massive, permanent handout to corporations passed off on American families. It is a terrifyingly precise attack on patients with chronic illness, a heartless roadblock for low-income students, and a choice to value inherited wealth more than hard-earned income.  It is a gift to corporations paid to the richest among us, and it is paid for by long nights, by double shifts, by vacations not taken, and of hardworking American families sacrificing for their hope for a better tomorrow.  You are asking them to fortify your tax cuts and stock options with their classrooms, your corporate profits with their roads and bridges, your balance sheets with their hard-earned retirement and healthcare benefits.  For all the talk about the boost to corporate profits, 80 percent of the stocks in this country are owned by 10 percent of Ask yourself who is going to actually be the beneficiary of all that money. That is what this bill does.  You have heard from my Republican friends over the course of the past couple days about how much this will save the average American family, but not about the 36 million people and families who will experience a tax hike.  What they aren't telling you is what is going to happen the moment this bill is passed. Luckily for the American public, one of the chief economic advisers to the President has said so. He said that after this bill is done, they are turning directly toward welfare cuts, Social Security, Medicare, and So when you hear questions about how much this bill is going to save you, ask how about your retirement.

804,topic-id,989,"Mr.President, it does not take a genius to see that something is stalling the American economy. The economy has been better lately, I think, frankly, in anticipation of the Congress's passing these tax cuts. The fact remains that 2016 was the 11th straight year that our economy--the greatest economy in the history of the world and the strongest economy in the history of the world, even when it has the flu--failed to achieve 3 percent annual growth, which has been our average every year since 1960.  Something is wrong. The experts I have talked about tried everything. They tried monetary policy, changing interest rates. They tried deficit spending. Do you remember President Obama's stimulus program? The Federal Reserve has tried quantitative easing out the wazoo. The experts have tried everything except what they should have done first; that is, to let the American people keep more of the money they earn, because they can spend that money they earn better than the government can.  We have two groups of policymakers in Washington, I am sorry, but this is what it has come down to. I am not talking about liberals or conservatives. I am not talking about Republicans and The two groups I am talking about are as follows. We have one group of policymakers in Washington who believe in more freedom, and we have another group of policymakers in Washington who believe in more free stuff.  I am not criticizing policymakers for wanting to help people who are less fortunate than us. The fact of the matter is that the U.taxpayers at the State and the local levels spend $1 trillion a year helping people less fortunate than us. That money didn't just fall from heaven. We thank heaven for it, but it came out of people's pockets. We spend $1 trillion a year in our country helping people who are less fortunate than us. In our country, if you are homeless, we house you. If you are hungry, we feed you. If you are too poor to be sick, we will pay for your doctor. I am very proud of that. I am not criticizing. In fact, I join my colleagues in wanting to help people who are less fortunate than us. The fact of the matter is, it takes money, and that money is generated by the American taxpayer. The American taxpayer is not generating very much because the American taxpayer is not making very much.  Let me talk to you about the middle class.  I can talk about the business side of this bill, and this is going to help every business in It is going to help C corps, LLCs, Sub S corps, family farms, and single proprietorships. It is going to help large businesswomen and businessmen, and it is going to help small businesswomen and businessmen.  But I want to talk about the personal income tax side. This bill will give a tax cut to just about every Our opponents can probably find one or two people under certain circumstances who aren't going to get a tax cut, but the fact remains, if you look at the numbers of the joint committee on the budget, if you make between $20,000 and $30,000 a year on average, you are going to get a 10-percent tax cut. If you make between $50,000 and $70,000 a year, you are going to get right around a 7-percent tax cut. If you make $1 million or more a year, you are going to get roughly a 5-percent tax cut. As for the middle class, we can debate what the middle class is, but I consider the middle class to be somewhere between $30,000 and $100,000 a year. You can pick your own definition. They are the ones that I am concerned about the most--not exclusively, but the most. Let me tell you what this bill is about in terms of the middle class: this, the wallet--their wallet--because the middle class is angry in this country, and they ought to be angry.  Every day, they say: Kennedy, I get up every day. I go to work. I obey the law. I pay my taxes. I try to do the right thing by my children. I try to teach my kids morals. I try to save for retirement. But I am getting fed up.  They tell me: Kennedy, I look around, and I see a rigged economy. I see too many undeserving people at the top getting bailouts, cutting corners, and making deals. I see too many undeserving people at the bottom getting handouts. I am in the middle, and I get stuck with the bill. I can't pay it anymore, My health insurance has gone up, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and my kids' tuition has gone up. My taxes have gone up. I will tell you what has not gone up--my income.  These are the American people, the middle class. They are busy earning a living. They may not read Aristotle every day, but they are smart and they get it. They know the median household income today is basically the same as it was in 1999, and for that, every policy maker responsible for that fact in Washington, DC, and elsewhere ought to hide their heads in a bag.  This bill is going to fix that, and that is why it is so incredibly important that we pass it. Yes, it is important for our business community. Yes, it is important for the large corporations. Yes, it is important to repatriate those trillions of dollars.

55,topic-id,1122,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for his work on this resolution, Ranking Member Engel, and leadership on both sides: Majority Leader McCarthy and the Speaker, and Minority Whip Hoyer and Leader  I think one thing we can all agree on, as Chairman Royce mentioned, is the humanitarian crisis in It is, arguably, the largest humanitarian crisis currently in the world. There are almost a million people suffering from cholera. This is a manmade crisis because of the bombing of civilian targets that has made the treatment of water impossible. Almost 7 million people face famine.  One hope out of this debate, the first one on the House floor on Yemen, is that we will collectively demand humanitarian access to people in There is no justification for the ports to be closed. There is no justification for the Sanaa Airport to be closed.  In The New York Times just this morning, there was an article stating that chlorine medicine tablets are not being allowed in for people suffering from cholera. That is not a Republican or Democratic issue. That is an American issue. This Nation stands for human rights. We stand for compassion and decency.  We should demand, collectively, that there is humanitarian access to people who are suffering and that the ports and airports be opened. This resolution calls for that, as has our U.Ambassador, Nikki Haley, who made that clear.  The second part of this resolution, which I think goes a long way, is the acknowledgment of our own role in the refueling of Saudi planes and in the assistance of Saudi targeting.  The resolution explicitly acknowledges that the United States has been engaged in the assistance of Saudi refueling and assisting the Saudis in targeting. It explicitly also recognizes that the 2001 authorization of force that the United States Congress passed does not apply to the Yemeni civil war.  Chairman Royce was absolutely correct that there is an al-Qaida threat in Yemen to the United Our military, under the 2001 authorization of force, has the full authority to take counterterrorism measures to deal with al-Qaida; but what our military is not authorized to do is assist the Saudi Arabian regime in fighting the In many cases, the Saudis have aligned with al-Qaida to fight the Houthis, undermining our very counterterrorism operations.  This resolution makes abundantly clear that we cannot be assisting the Saudi regime in any of its fight with the Houthi regime. We have to limit our involvement in Yemen to take on al-Qaida and to take on the terrorists that threaten the United  The chairman and I have a disagreement about the War Powers Resolution, but I will say that the negotiations were in good faith. As I told some of the groups that were upset about the resolution, this is a body of 435 Every Member has their perspective. Ultimately, we have to come to a consensus that moves the debate forward. In our view, the War Powers Resolution does apply.  If I can quote from a plain reading of section 8(c), it says that, for purposes of the War Powers Act: ``the term `introduction of the United States Armed Forces' includes the assignment of members of such Armed Forces to command, coordinate, participate in the movement of, or accompany the regular or irregular military forces of any foreign country or government. . . .''  I believe a plain reading of that statute suggests that refueling Saudi planes constitutes coordination with a foreign government in a foreign conflict. Frankly, it is precisely what the drafters of the statute wanted to prevent after They wanted to prevent us from getting entangled in foreign conflicts where our national security was not at stake without a debate on the floor of  We currently have troops in harm's way in 13 countries around the world. In many of those countries, we have not debated in the United States what the mission is or whether we should be there or whether it is making us any safer. That is certainly the case in  We know that, to the extent Iran is involved with the Houthis, that has been exacerbated because of the Saudi actions. It is debatable how much Iran was involved in the first place, but what we do know is that their minimal involvement--or, perhaps, now, greater involvement--was triggered because of the Saudi escalation in bombing  What is the United States' stake in a proxy war in Yemen? How is that making us any safer?  If anything, it is creating another generation of Yemeni who will view the United States with suspicion.  Nicholas Kristof wrote, in The New York Times: ``We Americans have sometimes wondered how Russia can possibly be so Machiavellian as to support its Syrian Government allies as they bomb and starve civilians. Yet we're doing the same thing with Saudi Arabia, and it's just as unconscionable when we're the ones complicit. . . .''  Our military has the highest standards. We take such great care in minimizing civilian casualties. Why would we want to aid Saudi Arabia, which doesn't share American values, which doesn't have the regard for human life that we in the United States do? We are bearing the brunt of their horrible actions.  So it is time, I believe, not just to stand up for humanitarian access in Yemen, but to question whether the aid that we are providing Saudi Arabia is making our country any safer and whether it is consistent with American values.                              {time}  1715  Finally, I will say to those who argue that we need to support the Saudis as a counter to Iran, there is no question that Iran has taken actions that are not in the United States' interest, but I suggest that we learn from our own history.  I remember, from history, the time when so many in our country said: Let us arm Saddam Hussein to be a counter to  That didn't work out so well for the United It was our arms that fueled Saddam Hussein's rise that led to two costly wars for the United  My belief is the balance-of-power framework that has dictated our foreign policy and the interventionism has not made us any safer. I wish we would exercise more restraint in our foreign policy and return to the traditions of John Quincy Adams who said:       We should not go overseas for monsters to destroy. These      are not conflicts where we can judge who is on the right      side; rather, we should be restrained, offer our hopes and      prayers to those fighting for freedom, offer our humanitarian      good will but not engage in interventionism abroad.

56,topic-id,2032,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.McGovern), who has been a real advocate and champion for the War Powers Act in this institution.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California for yielding me the time and for his leadership to bring before this House the critical issue of U.policy towards  Most importantly, I want to thank him for his determination to provide this House with at least 30 minutes to debate the complicity of the United States through its support of the Saudi-led forces in the civil war in Yemen in one of the greatest humanitarian crises taking place on this planet.  I personally believe that the House should be considering Mr.Khanna's original resolution, 81, but Republican leaders made that impossible by threatening to put forward a rule that would have blocked the right of Congressman Khanna to ever call his privileged resolution up for debate.  Mr.Speaker, according to the United Nations, Yemen is suffering the fastest growing cholera epidemic ever recorded. At the same time, Yemen faces the world's biggest food emergency.  Saudi Arabia has blocked Yemen's ports and airports. Just last week, it sealed the country's borders. As a result, the people of Yemen have been cut off from nearly all humanitarian aid during this horrific famine and cholera epidemic, and the ability of humanitarian agencies to provide relief has been significantly impeded.  The U.has called the Saudi closure of Yemen's borders to aid deliveries catastrophic. Even the International Committee of the Red Cross was forbidden to cross the northern border with a delivery of chlorine tablets to prevent cholera.  We learned today from the Saudis that two smaller southern ports and one Red Sea port will be open soon, although we don't know what that means, but the main port, where over 80 percent of Yemen's food supplies enter, will remain blockaded and closed.  Mr.Speaker, it is well documented that the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi forces, in particular, have carried out a ruthless, brutal bombing campaign that deliberately targets hospitals, schools, food markets, and civilian population, including children. The World Food Programme has warned that hundreds of thousands of children will be on the brink of starvation if the blockade lasts for even 2 weeks.  That deadline of death and starvation will arrive next Tuesday, just 2 days before we, here in the United States, sit down to enjoy our Thanksgiving with our family, friends, and loved ones.  Will the Members of this House spare a thought for the children, mothers, and fathers of Yemen as we sit down and feast in the warmth and comfort of our own homes? Or will this Congress finally, after more than 2\1/2\ years of sheer horror, send a clear message to Saudi Arabia that its actions are intolerable?  Mr.Speaker, Saudi Arabia's actions, thus far, and the coalition it leads in the Yemen civil war may very well rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the United  It is past time for this House to clearly and unambiguously declare that the United States will no longer provide or sell military aid, equipment, and munitions to potential war criminals; that the United States will no longer supply midair refueling to Saudi and coalition bombers headed to Yemen to wreak havoc on the suffering Yemeni people; that the U.will no longer share intelligence with the Saudi coalition; and that we will no longer remain a complicit and passive partner in carrying out one of the world's greatest humanitarian crises.  Mr.Speaker, I know the Houthi rebels attempting to take power in Yemen are also guilty of war crimes. Last November, the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission held a hearing on the human rights situation and humanitarian crisis in Yemen, so I know full well the atrocities committed by all parties in this war.  Mr.Speaker, Yemen is just one more proxy in the region of religious and political struggle for dominance between Sunnis, Saudi Arabia, and Shiite For some in Congress, that power struggle trumps every other consideration.  For me, it is yet another reason to act with extreme caution and examine whether and how we allow ourselves to support potential war criminals in pursuit of consolidating their own regional agenda and power.  I am concerned that this power struggle is escalating further throughout the region. Rather than the U.policy working to cool things down, we seem to be encouraging it to heat up.  I, for one, Mr.Speaker, do not want the United States to be complicit in supporting the killing and maiming of children. I do not want the United States to be complicit in the deliberate targeting and attacks against schools, hospitals, markets, and homes. I do not want the United States to be complicit in bombing water treatment plants at any time, let alone in the middle of the worst cholera epidemic in the world. I do not want the United States to be complicit in supporting a blockade that condemns tens of thousands of children to famine and death by starvation.  Once again, I thank Congressman Ro Khanna and my other colleagues who have supported this effort to have this[[Page H9152]]debate. I want to thank them for their leadership on this important issue, but this is serious.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the record a Washington Post, November 9, 2017, editorial, and an article from The          [From the Washington Post--Editorial, 9, 2017]                          The Crisis in Yemen       Saudi Arabia's blockade could trigger a full-blown famine.       Saudi Arabia has charged that a missile launched from Yemen      toward Riyadh's international airport on Saturday was      supplied by Iran and assembled by Tehran's Lebanese client,      It says this could be considered ``an act of war''      and claims the right to ``respond to Iran in the appropriate      time and manner.'' Yet the only action taken so far by the de      facto Saudi ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, has been to besiege      some of the world's most desperate people--the cholera-     stricken and literally famished civilian population of       The press of multiple international crises and President      Trump's monopolization of media attention have helped obscure      the severity of the humanitarian emergency in Yemen, a poor      country of 28 million that has been devastated by civil war      and a Saudi-led military intervention. According to the      United Nations, it is suffering the fastest-growing cholera      epidemic ever recorded, with about 895,000 cases and nearly      2,200 deaths since At the same time, it is facing the      world's biggest food emergency, with 7 million people      requiring urgent assistance.       Children have been disproportionately afflicted. According      to U.figures, 27 percent of the cholera victims are under      the age of 5. Officials estimate that Juvenile cholera cases      will reach 600,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, hunger      has left half of children under 5 stunted, and 2.2 million      are affected by either moderate or severe malnutrition.       Saudi Arabia bears heavy responsibility for this suffering.      For 2\1/2\ years, it has pursued a ruthless but unwinnable      war against ethnic Houthis who have captured much of the      country, including the capital, Sanaa, and the largest port,      Bombing raids have repeatedly struck hospitals and      food markets. Worse, in the name of preventing Iran from      delivering weapons to the Houthis, the Saudis and their      allies have blockaded the country by sea and air, closing      Sanaa's airport to commercial traffic and slowing food      imports at       Now, in reaction to the missile firing, the Saudis have      announced a more thorough closure of ``all Yemeni ground, air      and sea ports.'' Though a government statement said it would      take ``into consideration the continuation of the entry and      exit'' of humanitarian supplies and aid workers,      officials say that aid flights have been blocked. The World      Food Program warned that hundreds of thousands of children      would be ``on the brink of starvation'' if the blockade      lasted even for two weeks.       Saudi officials say the siege is meant to prevent what they      claim was the smuggling of missile parts into Yemen from      It has offered no proof of the rocket's origin, and      experts point out that Yemen is known to have imported Scud      missiles from North Korea before the war. In any case, the      blockade will not deter either Iran or the Houthis, but it      could trigger a full-blown famine among innocent children.      The Trump administration, which has blithely backed Crown      Prince Salman in his reckless adventures, should consider the      cost.                                  ____                   [From the Guardian, 7, 2017]  Closure of Yemen's Borders To Aid Deliveries is `Catastrophic', UN                                  Warns                           (By Karen McVeigh)       After Saudi-led coalition seals stricken country's borders,      aid agencies caution that deliveries of food and medicine are      critical for population's survival.       Humanitarian groups and the UN have urged the Saudi-led      coalition to reopen aid channels into Yemen, after a decision      to seal the stricken country's air, sea and land borders.       The UN described the closure of aid channels as      ``catastrophic''. Food, medicine and other essential supplies      are ``critical for the survival'' of the country's 27 million      population, weakened by war, the International Committee of      the Red Cross (ICRC) added. Yemen is in the grip of the      world's worst cholera outbreak and 7 million people are      already on the brink of famine.       The coalition said on Monday it would close the borders to      stem the flow of arms from Iran, after it intercepted a      missile attack by Houthi rebels near the international      airport in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Iran has denied      supplying the missiles. Humanitarian operations, including UN      aid flights, are blocked because the air and sea ports,      including Hodeidah, where most aid is delivered, are closed.       The UN reported it was not permitted flight clearance for      two humanitarian flights bound for Yemen on A Red      Cross shipment of chlorine tablets, to prevent cholera, was      not allowed in at the country's northern border, the ICRC      said. Medical supplies, including insulin, are expected.       Yemen has been named the UN's number one humanitarian      crisis.       ``We hear reports this morning that prices of cooking gas      and petrol for cars and so on [are] already spiralling out of      control,'' Jens Laerke, from the UN office for the Co-     ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told a news briefing.      ``So this is an access problem of colossal dimensions?'       Johan Mooij, Yemen director of Care International, said:      ``For the last two days, nothing has got in or out of the      country. Fuel prices have gone up by 50% and there are queues      at the gas stations. People fear no more fuel will come into      Hodeidah port.''       He explained that food insecurity was helping cholera to      spread. ``People depend on the humanitarian aid and part of      the cholera issue [is] that they do not eat and are not      strong enough to deal with unclean water?'       There have also been ``daily airstrikes'' in Sana'a, he      said, adding: ``People fear the situation is escalating.''       Robert Mardini, ICRC's regional director for the near and      Middle East, said: ``Insulin cannot wait at a shuttered      border since it must be kept refrigerated.       Without a quick solution to the closure, the humanitarian      consequences will be dire.''       Mardini said he was also concerned at the ``steadily      growing'' number of civilian casualties and the targeting of      non-military infrastructure, such as water treatment plants      and civilian airports. ``Such actions are in violation of      international humanitarian law,'' he said.       The war is between the Houthi rebels, who are allied with      former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, and forces loyal to      another president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was ousted by      the Saudi Arabia has led a military intervention      since 2015 to counter the advance of the Houthis, and aims to      reinstate       Both the coalition and rebels have been criticised by the      UN for blocking aid to civilians.       Rupert Colville, a spokesman from the UN high commissioner      for human rights, told Reuters the agency would study whether      the blockade amounted to ``collective punishment'', unlawful      under international law, and said he hoped it would be      temporary.       The agency has expressed concern over a series of recent      attacks on markets and homes that have killed scores of      civilians, including children.       Last month, the UN put the coalition on a draft of its      blacklist for killing and maiming 683 children during the      conflict in 2016 and for carrying out 38 verified attacks on      schools and hospitals.

I would ask the gentleman if he would add to that the amount of the debt that is being borne by each one of those families. Because the way I have got it calculated, it costs a family of four about $20,000 for your debt that you are willing to levy against our children and grandchildren in order to give the richest 1 percent of Americans a massive tax break.  You can't deny the math that almost all the benefit goes to the people at the top. The top 1 percent are huge beneficiaries. You can't deny the math that 5,400 families will get a massive tax break. You can't deny the math that says that every single American will take on additional debt; a family of four, $20,000 in debt.

613,topic-id,1022,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Imagine you are a coder and you have a great idea for an app that predicts the weather or identifies traffic flows or helps people navigate the social service system. You know how to code the app, but you can't afford to set up your own system to collect the data--the weather data or the traffic data or what have you.  Now, imagine you build the app and you can pull data that the government is already collecting so you can build the app and use the data. It turns out that you have got something that is either good at predicting the weather or helping commuters or helping folks navigate the social services system or whatever and it grows into a business. You can actually employ people. You can put people to work. A project that may have started as a hobby could become your life's work.  The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, and specifically title II of this bill called the OPEN Government Data Act, will actually help make stories like that become a common thing. This bill gives entrepreneurs and innovators huge amounts of publicly funded data so that they can innovate and come up with applications that we haven't even thought of yet.  It also means that government agencies can share data more easily and ultimately provide services more effectively. Most importantly, it allows citizens to participate in their government by making government more transparent and accountable.  Mr.Speaker, data is the spark that drives innovative ideas, and I drafted the OPEN Government Data Act with Representatives Farenthold and Senators Schatz and Sasse to support new startups by providing innovators with the legal elbow room to use public information and public data and to create jobs. It reduces the burden to entry by lowering the cost to access and format data. It will open new business opportunities.  Making more government data public will pump up the data analytics boom currently driving new innovation, and I expect that access to this data will lead to things that we haven't even thought up yet.  I am proud to work with Speaker Ryan, Chairman Gowdy, and Senator Murray to incorporate that bill into this broader legislation. It will help us measure how government programs are actually working or not.  Establishing a data inventory will help government officials understand what data they have so that they can use it, and they don't duplicate work that is already getting done.  Making the government's data searchable and accessible will help public servants make better decisions, and it will help the public and the press hold government more accountable.  Let me give you an example. Mr.Speaker, I represent more military veterans than just about any Member of this body. Like many of us, I was horrified to learn several years ago that the Department of Veterans Affairs was struggling to provide the services and treatments that were earned by military veterans. Now imagine if the House Veterans' Affairs Committee or the Government Accountability Office or even the VA had access to some of the data around wait times earlier. The pain caused to veterans and their families could have been avoided.  Imagine if the leaders of the Veterans Administration knew that newspapers were going to have access to that data, whether it be the Kitsap Sun in my district or The New York Times or whoever. Imagine that they were looking at that data, too.  It is time for government to move into the 21st century and start using the data it is collecting to improve the services it is providing.  Let me just speak briefly about what this bill does. This gets a little wonky, but I actually think it is pretty important. This legislation sets up a way for everyone to use the government's data. We spent a long time working to make sure that the terms used in the bill didn't trap government policy in this year or this decade. We hope that this legislation will act as a building block for future technologies and applications of Federal data.  We included some important pieces to ensure that data is not only available, but that it is easily used. Data has to be machine-readable. Many of us, I think, have gone on the internet and gotten a data set in PDF form that you can't really do anything with. It is so annoying. It is pretty obvious that in 2017 you should be able to use your computer to find what you are looking for.  Data has to be open format, and data should be malleable. Professionals inside and outside of government should be able to use that data in various ways. Government data should be provided under an open license. If the government owns the data, that means the people paid for it, and they should be able to use it for free.  Let me quickly talk about what this bill doesn't do.  The bill does not take away safeguards that protect personal privacy, national security, and intellectual property. The legislation would not affect existing contracts, so the government is not going to go to a contractor and say: Oh, by the way, your data is now free and available to the public.  Importantly, the bill does not alter the government's need to pay for private data rights in the future when it identifies private data that it may want to access and have ownership of. This bill only applies to data that is owned and controlled by the Federal It does not provide an advantage to one sector or technology over another.  Mr.Speaker, let me just say in closing, for the past 2 years, several of us have worked on this issue and with experts throughout the private and public sector to get this bill past the finish line. I am proud to stand here today in support of a bipartisan bill that can move our economy forward, that can improve efficiency in our government, and can help citizens get more involved in our democratic republic.

382,topic-id,314,"Mr.Speaker, there are certain phrases that we have learned to grow to accept with great suspicion: The check is in the mail. It is not you; it is me. Don't worry, I will respect you in the morning. I have had just a few drinks; I am fine with driving.  And now we have to add to that: Don't worry. Large tax cuts for the most wealthy will pay for themselves, and I am a fiscally conservative Republican who cares about debt and deficits.  The Joint Committee on Taxation has determined that, with interest payments, this bill will add over $2.3 trillion, with a T, to our national debt over th next 10 years. That is why last week, in committee, I was offering an amendment that would expand the endangered species list to include fiscally conservative Republicans because your vote on this bill will make you extinct.  And what is unfortunate is, unlike past tax cuts that weren't paid for, we have run out of time. We no longer have the luxury of time to recover from a huge fiscal mistake, not with 70 million baby boomers beginning their massive retirement--10,000 a day joining Social Security and Those programs and the solvency of Social Security and Medicare will be in jeopardy with another $2.3 trillion of debt over the next 10 years.  And what is unfortunate, it didn't have to be this way. There was bipartisan interest in simplifying the Code, making it more competitive, broadening the base, making it fair for working families and small businesses and family farmers, but doing it in a fiscally responsible way.  Asking 34 million Americans to accept a tax increase to pay for a 43 percent marginal rate reduction to the largest companies is hardly responsible, and it is hardly fair. I encourage my colleagues to let us take a different approach and reject this bill.

462,topic-id,515,"Mr.Speaker, I think my good friend and colleague from California is raising a very important point, and it is a point that all of us here this evening on the Ways and Means Committee, with the leadership of Mr.Neal from Massachusetts, have been raising for some time.  Doing tax reform right is tough. There are a lot of moving pieces to it, and there are a lot of traps and unintended consequences if you do it the wrong way. Not having one hearing, not having proper vetting, not taking the time to listen to people back home in our respective States and districts about the consequences of something that is going to affect every American life in this country is legislative malpractice, and that is what we are on the verge of committing leading up to tomorrow's vote.  My friend from California mentioned the $2.3 trillion in additional debt over the next 10 years by the time you add in the interest payments and how devastating that will be, and it is happening at the wrong time.  I mean, we might have gotten away with that with the 1981 tax cuts that weren't paid for back then because there was a little bit of time to recover[[Page H9368]]from a big fiscal mistake, and from 2001, 2003. We have run out of time as a nation, with 70 million baby boomers beginning their massive retirement, 10,000 a day joining Social Security and  But their entire theory is premised on the fact that over two-thirds of the tax cut will be going to large corporations under their bill of this illusory growth that is going to come from it. Part of that is based on this tax holiday, they call it deemed repatriation, where these multinational companies are going to be able to bring dollars back into America at a much lower rate and supposedly reinvesting here that is going to promote growth.  But there was a recent survey by Bank of America and Merrill Lynch of 300 executives of some of the largest U.multinational companies asking them what they would do with this deemed repatriated money coming back to the country. Their number one response was paying down debt. Reinvesting in their company, reinvesting in research and development, investing in more jobs and good-paying jobs barely registered in that survey.  But this should not come as a surprise. It is not like we haven't been down this road before. We tried a repatriation bill back in the early 2000s, where these companies were able to bring back a ton of money, and what they used it for was dividend give-outs and stock buybacks. Yet they are refusing to learn the lessons of the past and going on this theory of an illusory growth that none of the major economists see under this tax bill, and it is a huge fiscal gamble that I think i going to leave us in the same place as the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which was one of the worst decades when it came to job growth in our country.

I am especially concerned about the economic impact in the large rural congressional district that I represent where production agriculture is still an important part of our economy.  Some of the changes that they are making are going to be devastating to family farmers. They are taking away the 199 tax deduction, which is as important for our domestic manufacturers as it is for our family farmers.  If you want to grow things and invent things and create things, make things in America, the 199 has a proven track record of making it easier for our farmers and manufacturers to do it. Under their bill, that goes away.  That operating loss carryback, which is important for a lot of farmers in order to recoup some of the losses that they have experienced in their business, it goes away.  Like-kind exchanges for property and heavy machinery in farm country goes away. A lot of my farmers are operating on a margin right now. I am concerned about the impact this is going to have on the rural economy and our family farmers with what they are proposing.  You don't have to be from a city or from a rural district to understand that, again, the work wasn't put into this bill to understand the real consequences of what they are asking for. It is not too late. We can still regroup and work in the bipartisan fashion that tax reform was meant to occur and figure out a way to truly simplify, make us more competitive, but make it fair for working families, small businesses, and family farmers in all of our districts, rather than this rush to judgment just so they can score a political win before the end of the year.                              {time}  2030  So I think the points that my friend from Chicago raised are very valid, and it is something that I would hope all of us would heed before we reach our final decision tomorrow morning.

915,topic-id,502,"Mr.President, I would like to recognize the efforts of the many organizations that have agreed to come together to establish a single continuum of care for the State of Continuums of Care are supported by the U.Department of Housing and Urban Development to promote a communitywide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness. They are a vital partner in the works to quickly rehouse homeless individuals and families to minimize trauma and dislocation; promote access to and effective use of mainstream programs; and optimize self-sufficiency among individuals and families experiencing homelessness. Continuums of Care make important decisions about priorities for Federal funding of programs that provide significant services.  Prior to establishing this single continuum of care for Maine, there were three separate entities that existed: the City of Portland, Greater Penobscot, which was centered on Bangor, and everything else fell under the ``Balance of State'' While receiving funding to operate a continuum of care funding requires a competitive application process, these three groups have consistently worked closely together and coordinated their means. In 2012, the Greater Penobscot Continuum and ``Balance of State'' merged together to create the Maine Continuum of Then, in 2017, the Portland Continuum consolidated with the Maine Continuum--achieving a single continuum of care--an effort that greatly advanced the level of collaboration among the member agencies and has proven to be an important step in streamlining efforts and assuring available resources are meeting the needs of those who become homeless. The merger of the two continuums has resulted in more accurate collection and management of data about the extent and characteristics of homelessness in Maine.[[Page S7212]]  A single continuum of care has achieved efficiencies in administrating the responsibilities delegated by the Federal Government to meet the challenge of ending homelessness in As a unit, they identify the homeless service priorities and distribute resources accordingly. The organizations and agencies that participate in continuum of care include: Maine's network of 37 emergency shelters serving the entire State; MaineHousing and the Department of Health and Human Services; homeless youth providers; veterans groups; mental health and substance abuse service providers; supportive housing developers; local governments and public housing authorities; and homeless advocacy organizations. In addition to providing housing and services, the members of the Maine Continuum of Care play a major role in several other statewide initiatives, including participating in the data collection and entry for the annual homeless assessment report AHAR, and new system performance measure reports.  This significant merger was a collaborative endeavor involving Maine's homeless provider organizations, social service providers, and State and Federal agencies. I especially want to thank the leadership and guidance provided by MaineHousing, the State's housing authority, and the chairs of Maine's continuums throughout the merger process.

305,topic-id,5023,"Mr.President, last month, President Trump said that pharmaceutical companies are ``getting away with murder.'' Those were his words, not mine. It is not the first time he has said it, and there is some truth to it. So it is time to get specific and then question why he just announced that the person who will be running the health department for the United States of America has spent 10 years running a pharmaceutical company.  Look at what is happening. When a company hikes the price of a lifesaving drug by 5,000 percent overnight, he is right--that is getting away with murder. When the price of 4 of the top 10 bestselling drugs in this country goes up by 100 percent in the last few years--we are not talking about one specific drug, a rare drug; no, we are talking about 4 of the top 10 bestselling drugs going up 100 percent in just the last few years--that is getting away with murder. When Americans are forced to skip doses or split pills because they can't afford their prescription, that is getting away with murder. When the administration repeatedly delays penalties for drug companies that intentionally overcharge hospitals for prescription drugs, that is getting away with murder.  So what do we find out today? After the President has said that these companies are getting away with murder, we find out that he has nominated the former president of one of the country's biggest drug companies as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, someone who has been in that industry for 10 years running the biggest company. It is happening again. They are getting away with murder.  In the United States--the biggest economy in the world, the frontier for capitalism--drug prices are higher than any other developed nation. That is outrageous. So, yes, they are getting away with a lot.  So here is my question: Why are we letting them? Why are we literally putting former pharma executives in charge of healthcare policy for our country? Why can't we get anything done to actually lower drug prices in America?  I have often said that the pharmaceutical industry owns Now, with this announcement today, they will actually be running it.  Lowering prescription drug costs is my top priority. Healthcare is one-sixth of our economy, and prescription drug costs account for over 15 percent of all healthcare spending. This has a big impact on families, on communities, on our economy, and on our country.  For most Americans, this is deeply personal. Everyone has their own story. My daughter has a severe nut allergy. She keeps an EpiPen with her at all times. So when the price of that particular prescription drug went up and up and up, like parents across the country, I noticed. I took action. I spoke out, moms and dads all across the country spoke out, and we saw some reduction in those prices. But we shouldn't have to have a social media campaign, a write-in campaign, and Members of Congress giving speeches on the floor for every single drug to see a reduction in prices.  Abigail just graduated from college. I don't want her to have to think about this for the rest of her life when she is filling a prescription. But what about the thousands of others like her, young people just starting their careers who can't afford to pay these skyrocketing prices? I don't want parents to worry about how to afford the inhaler their kid relies on to get through the day. I don't want seniors to worry about how they will be able to put food on the[[Page S7180]]table and pay for the insulin they need. But that concern for so many--for too many--is constant. As prescription drugs keep rising, so does the worrying, so does the concern.  Over and over again, that is what I hear from my constituents. I don't think one of them would tell me that they think the solution is to do nothing legislatively and then put the head of one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in our country into the job of running healthcare policy. No, I don't think they would think that is going to fix everything. It is not fair, it is not right, and we need to do something about it.  Look at the numbers. Why is it happening? Last year alone, the drug companies spent $152 million lobbying Congress, and it is getting worse. They are doubling down on their bets by betting on an administration with big ties to pharma. There are more than 800 lobbyists working for the pharmaceutical industry, meaning that almost every Member of Congress is double-teamed by the lobbying force. Every Member of Congress now, when you look at the registrations, has two lobbyists assigned to them from pharma. Is it no surprise that now we are going to have the nominee as head of HHS, Health and Human Services, someone directly out of pharma? I don't think so.  In my first run for the Senate, in 2006, I talked about how Medicare should be able to negotiate drug prices on behalf of millions of seniors. It was such common sense. In each Congress since 2011, I have introduced bills to allow Medicare to do just that. Right now, Medicare is barred by law from negotiating directly with the drug companies. That seems pretty crazy to me. I think 41 million seniors would have a lot of power. They are good at getting bargains. They want to get some bargains on their prescription drugs. You harness that bargaining power and allow the U.Government to negotiate on their behalf with the pharmaceutical companies. By the way, that would not just bring drug prices down under Medicare for seniors; it would bring drug prices down for everyone because that is such a large chunk of the people who are using prescription drugs.  This bill has not passed year after year. Why? Is it because the people don't want it? A recent poll found that 92 percent of people want the Federal Government to negotiate drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. Ninety-two percent of the public supports the bill, and we have a growing number of sponsors. Right now, they are just on my side of the aisle, but we have over 30 sponsors on that bill. We want to bring that bill up for a vote.  My bill to allow Medicare to negotiate for prescription drugs, however, has never been brought up for a vote. I introduced these bills in 2011, 2013, 2015, and in 2017, and each time there was not a vote.  President Trump says he is a good negotiator. He says he is in favor of this negotiation. He said it not just once, not just twice on the campaign trail but many times. So I thought this is great. He is coming in, and we are immediately going to see support for my bill and support for negotiating prices under Medicare part No, we do not see that. We have seen no action at all. Instead, what do I find out? When I woke up this morning, I found out that he is putting the head of a big pharmaceutical company in charge of Health and Human  For those of us who have been doing this work for a long time now, it is unsettling, but it is not that surprising. It is not just the President literally nominating the head of a big drug company to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services--we see this kind of thing all the time--but since 2000, at least 56 officials from the DEA and the Justice Department have gone to work for the pharmaceutical industry. Basically, the industry buys the expertise they need to then gum up the works so we can't get anything done. Former lobbyists and execs are popping up all over this administration.  Joe Grogan works at the Office of Management and He led a working group on pharmaceuticals that this administration convened. He helped draft an Executive order on prescription drugs. The catch? Until March of this year, he was a lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry.  What does this mean? What this means is, you have this revolving door where this is going on. You have two lobbyists for every Member of Congress; just talk, talk about it. What does it really mean? Let me tell you what it really means.  Insulin--the price of insulin has tripled in the last decade. A form of insulin that was listed at $17 per vial in 1997 costs nearly $138 in 2016. That is a 700-percent increase. We have seen major companies jack up their prices in near harmony.  In November 2015, NovoLog increased to $236.70. Within 14 days, Humalog jumped to $237, and Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have raised their prices for both even higher within the last year. Of course, one of those companies is the company this HHS nominee ran in North  Healthy competition usually doesn't involve price increases in almost perfect sync among competitors. That is why I demanded an explanation from these companies. I demanded answers on behalf of people like Kim from Plymouth, She just retired. She has diabetes. She keeps the pen injectors after she uses them because they have small amounts of insulin left, and she says it is too precious to throw them out.  This is in America, in 2017. Older people are keeping their insulin injectors because there are a few drops in them--a drug that historically has been incredibly inexpensive and cheap. There are not new developments with this drug. It is insulin. There is no reason you would see this dramatic price increase, except that it is price gouging.  It doesn't have to be this way. Pharma often argues that these high prices are necessary for research and development. As I mentioned, insulin is an old drug. It is cheap to make. It has been around for years. In fact, when insulin was discovered in 1921, the original patent was sold to a university for just $3, for the whole patent. The researchers who worked hard to develop this life-sustaining drug wanted to make sure--are you ready for this--that no one else would turn its production into a profitable monopoly. So those researchers, knowing they had this incredible lifesaving drug, wanted to keep the prices down and sold the patent for $3.  So then what happened? Well, they jacked up the prices over and over again. As I mentioned, it was $17 per vial in 1997 to $138 in 2016--a 700-percent increase for insulin. They didn't need to jack up those prices to develop a new form of insulin. It is the same insulin. They did it to make money.  This isn't just a hit on consumers' pocketbooks. It is also becoming a threat to public safety. One drug company, Kaleo, increased the price of a two-pack of a device containing naloxone that treats life-threatening opioid overdoses.  We passed a bill last year, with strong bipartisan support, to be able to have a blueprint for this country to deal with opioid overdoses. The President just declared this a public health emergency, but what is going on with the one drug that we know saves people from overdoses? Guess what. The drug companies said: Well, here is something. More people are using this drug so let's jack up the prices.  This form of naloxone from Kaleo has gone from $690 to $4,500 during the last 3 years. This is what they did for these opioid addicts. The drug companies get people hooked to begin with. We all know those stories are coming out right now. Then, when people get hooked and they overdose, they increase the price of the drug you use to help them. What a racket.  All of us know the opioid epidemic is becoming a bigger and bigger public safety issue. In other words, there isn't a worse time to hike the price up on a drug that helps first responders deal with the national public health crisis. When I called the drug company out on this earlier this year, that company used the same old playbook. Sure as clockwork, they claimed that the prices you and I see might be high, but they have special programs to make sure people don't actually pay these absurdly high rates for lifesaving medicine.  You know what, I have heard from Minnesota law enforcement officials--sheriffs, police chiefs--who are shocked because the cost of naloxone increased by more than 60 percent in a single year. I have heard from doctors who have told me their patients recovering[[Page S7181]]from addiction can't afford the medication. So I can promise you that the special discount programs and rebates don't apply to everyone, despite what the drug companies say.  The role the drug companies are playing in the opioid epidemic doesn't end with naloxone. That is just the beginning. In just the last couple of weeks, we have seen report after report about how the greed of the pharmaceutical companies, as I mentioned, led to the rise of the epidemic to begin with. In Minnesota, 637 people died from opioid and other drug overdoses last year alone. That is more than homicides and car crashes combined. By the way, it is not just our States, it is States all over the country. Ninety-one people die from this overdose each day in our country. That is the reality of this crisis. Getting away with murder? Well, now it is actually true.  Two weeks ago, The New Yorker and Esquire pulled back the curtain on Purdue The Sackler family, the family behind Purdue, is well known for its generous donations to cancer research, medical schools, art museums, universities. What is less well known is the role that Purdue Pharma has played in the spread of OxyContin and opioid addiction.  OxyContin, the drug at the heart of the U.opioid epidemic, is regarded by many public health experts as one of the most dangerous products ever sold on a mass scale. If people have not read this article in The New Yorker, you can get it online. You can read it, and you better read it so you will understand why I am so mad while I am giving this speech today and why I am so angry that the administration has just put a pharma executive in charge of the It is not a pharma executive, from Purdue Pharma, but this whole culture where they have been allowed to do whatever they want and no one is holding them accountable is what has led to where we are today.  Purdue Pharma aggressively marketed OxyContin to physicians as a painkiller and claimed that the drug's delayed release mechanism would limit the risk of addiction. Instead, OxyContin led to many new addictions, and, as we all know, many addicted patients eventually turned to heroin.  Here is what is so stunning and what is so obvious in this well-researched article. The company knew OxyContin was addictive all along. It knew its marketing campaign was misleading people. Steven May started at Purdue Pharma as a sales rep in 1999, and years later went on to allege fraud against Purdue in a whistleblower lawsuit. He was trained to market the drug as one ``to start with and to stay with,'' despite knowledge of its addictive potential. The hits just keep coming--but that happened. When you read that article, you find out there were so many signs that this was addictive; that they were seeing it all over the country and they kept selling it. They kept telling people it was good for them, they should have no pain, and it would be fine if they took this drug, even if they were getting one wisdom tooth out, whatever it is.  That is what happened in our country. That is how people got addicted on opioids. Now we see lawsuits. That will hold them accountable, to a certain degree, but do we see any action from Congress at all to reduce the pharmaceutical prices or to do anything about this? Are there any votes in this Chamber? No, there are not.  CNN just released an investigation on how Endo Pharmaceuticals prioritizes profits over people's lives. One of their best selling drugs was an opioid called OPANA The drug was often abused. Addicts would crush it and snort the pills, which could increase the risk of an overdose, so Endo Pharmaceuticals had to pull the drug off the market, but that is not the whole story. Endo made a newer, more addictive version of the drug, which President Trump has called ``truly evil.'' The FDA got involved, for one of the first times ever, to force Endo to stop selling the new truly evil drug earlier this year.  What did Endo then do? The company then cut a deal with a generic drug company to split the profits on the sales of the original version of the drug--you know, the one with the history of abuse. It is unbelievable the company will now profit off a highly dangerous opioid it once pulled from the market for being unsafe.  The FDA has linked Endo drugs to serious public health problems, such as outbreaks of HIV and hepatitis C, in addition to addictions and overdoses, but the company doesn't think those risks are good enough reasons to stop selling these opioids.  I don't think there are better examples of how greed trumps everything else. That is what we are talking about here. There are good people who work in the pharmaceutical industry. We have always been proud to have innovation in Innovation is great, but greed unchecked is not. You can literally trace this opioid epidemic, where now four out of five of those people who originally got hooked on legal pharmaceuticals are now turning to heroin. You can literally trace it back to these very companies. That happened. Then, just when the epidemic gets bad and we figure out that at least you can stop drug overdoses with naloxone, those companies jack up those prices.  This is not a free market right now. This is a monopoly market that is getting people sucked into their products, either with advertising on TV or with addictions to drugs, like opioids, then getting them into their nets, and then charging them enormous amounts of money. That is what is happening right now.  The examples do not end.  The price of Daraprim, a drug that treats malaria and other infections, went up 5,000 percent overnight. The price for a multiple sclerosis drug went up 21 times in a decade. ARIAD Pharmaceuticals raised the price for a leukemia drug four times in 1 year alone. Now it costs nearly $199,000 a year. The only people who can afford that drug are the executives at the company.  It is no wonder that people like President Trump are starting to say a little bit more about the rising costs of prescription drugs. That is good. That is a start in talking about it, but we need action.  For years, the pharmaceutical lobby bought Washington's silence, but now, in being faced with a nationwide crisis brought on by that silence and in being confronted by constituents who all agree that this is a problem, many are feeling that they have to do more than just talk about it. Talking and tweeting are different from doing, and actions speak louder than words. There is a saying that you cannot just talk the talk; you need to walk the walk. Well, it is time to walk the walk.  By the way, putting someone who ran a pharmaceutical company for 10 years in charge of HHS, the Nation's healthcare Department for the entire United States of America, is not called walking that walk. There are actions we can take right here, right now, because the solutions are right here on the table.  Here we go.  First and foremost, let's finally take up that bill that would harness the negotiating power of 41 million seniors who are on Medicare and bring drug prices down. My bill would repeal the law that bans Medicare from using that market power to negotiate prices. Literally, Medicare is banned by law from negotiating prices. There are 33 Senators who have joined me on this bill. We could pass this if we could just get a vote.  Second, as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, I cannot stress enough that competition is the best way to ensure that prescription drugs are affordable. Where there is a lack of competition, price increases often follow.  A recent poll found that 87 percent of the public agrees that we need to increase competition. Senator Grassley and I, the Republican of Iowa, have a bill that, for years, we have tried to push ahead. It calls for a stop to this outrageous play called pay for delay, where big pharmaceutical companies actually pay off generic companies--their competitors--in order to keep their products off the market.  So the pharma companies go to a generic and say: Hey, I know that you are going to compete with me, but I will give you a little money so that you can keep that product off the market for a little while, and that will be better for both of us. We will give you more money than you will make off the product.  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, putting an[[Page S7182]]end to this ridiculous practice would save taxpayers $2.9 billion over 10 years. Guess what. That is just the government's piece of it. It would also save consumers because they are paying the copay money as well. Once again, I cannot imagine any of my colleagues voting against this legislation if it were to actually come to a vote on the Senate floor. So let's let it come for a vote and see how people vote.  I also have a bipartisan bill with Senators Grassley, Leahy, Feinstein, Lee, and several others called the CREATES It would put a stop to other pharmaceutical companies' tactics, like refusing to provide samples or to share important information about how to distribute a drug safely, which delay more affordable generic drugs from getting to the market.  The FDA has received over 100 complaints about these tactics, and according to the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation would save $3.6 billion. Even if the drug companies are not headline grabbers like Martin Shkreli, many pharmaceutical companies are using tactics to prevent competition. It is not just one bad guy who goes to jail. It is a common practice. In fact, it is legally allowed right now for them not to share those samples, for them to make payments to their competitors to keep the products off the market. We need to end those practices, and we do it by having a vote on these bills.  Finally, we should look beyond our borders. We should know that our friends right across the border in Canada often pay less--much less--for prescription drugs than we do.  For example, in the United States, a 90-day supply of an anti-inflammatory drug called Celebrex can cost more than $1,000. Canadian pharmacies sell it for only $220. That is just one example. I could spend all night giving examples of where the prices in the United States are more than double what they are in  Senator McCain and I have a bill to allow Americans to bring in safe--they have to be safe--and less expensive prescription drugs from Our neighbors to the north have similar quality and safety standards as those in the United Our bill has strong safety measures, too, so as to make sure that we protect American consumers from scammers or counterfeit drugs. Senator Sanders has also been a leader on this issue.  Why do we care about this, Senator McCain, Senator Sanders, and I, in our coming from such different perspectives? We know that we only allow importation from pharmacies that have existed for 5 years, so they are safe, and then have a brick-and-mortar store, not just some fly-by-night website.  Just like Medicare negotiation, the public is overwhelmingly on our side, with 72 percent of people who support allowing Americans to buy prescription drugs that are imported from Canada, including 66 percent of Democrats, 77 percent of Independents, and 75 percent of So why can't we get it passed? We need to.  Beyond Canada, Senator Lee and I have a bill, another bipartisan bill, that would allow for the temporary importation of safe drugs that have been on the market in another country for at least 10 years when there is not healthy competition for that drug in this country.  We have all heard the drug companies and others say that the FDA approval process can take a long time, and that results in a lack of options in the marketplace and higher prices. When it comes to drugs that have already been sold safely in other countries for years, why should we force American consumers to wait for the same options? It doesn't make sense. This bill would let patients access these safe, less expensive drugs at the same time that they are going through the full FDA approval process.  So the idea is to, one, allow negotiation for our biggest negotiating bloc--41 million seniors. That would bring prices down. The President said that he knows the art of the deal, that he is the negotiator. Well then, let's get that negotiation in place and get some big-time lobbying for this bill instead of putting pharmaceutical executives in charge of Health and Human  The second set of ideas is about bringing in more competition. You can do it with safe drugs from overseas. I think that if some of the drug companies that have a monopoly on our consumers' drugs knew that competition might come in, maybe they would want to bring those drug prices down. In fact, I know that they would because that is how capitalism works. A high school economics class could tell you that.  The other idea is more generics. Keep competition going by making it easier for generics to get their products out to market, and please stop the practice where the big pharma companies are paying their chief competitors, the generics--great for both of them--to keep their products off the market. Who are the losers? Americans are the losers.  The administration actually has the authority to take action now. Under current law, we could allow for the temporary importation of less expensive drugs from Canada tomorrow. What are we waiting for? I urge the administration to act now. If the administration will not act, Congress must. We need to have those Medicare negotiations. There is so much that we could do here if we could just get a vote. Yet we cannot stop with just passing legislation to lower pharmaceutical prices. We have to stop pharmaceutical companies from rigging the system in the first place or else we are just going to get back to where we started.  We have to give ethics watchdogs in Washington, like the Office of Government Ethics, real teeth. We need to overturn Citizens United and undo the outside influence of special interests on our elections. We have given them this carte blanche to come in and influence people, and look at what is happening. There is an opioid epidemic; the price of insulin has gone up multiple times; four of the top 10 best-selling drugs in America have gone up over 100 percent in the last 10 years.

484,topic-id,1399,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, for his leadership. He has never given up on this, and he will never give up. We have many important issues ahead, one of which I am going to address--climate change--about this nominee and the fact that every country in the world now, including Nicaragua and Syria, have pledged to be part of this international climate change agreement, which is so important for reducing greenhouse gases. I thank Senator Whitehouse for carrying the torch on this for so long.  I join him today in rising to speak about the nominee who the Senate is currently considering to lead the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Air and If confirmed, Mr.William Wehrum will be tasked with carrying out and managing critical Agency functions related to controlling airborne pollution, improving air quality, monitoring greenhouse gases, and overseeing energy efficiency standards.  By the way, I was always proud that the first bill I introduced to the U.Senate when I got here was a bill with Olympia Snowe, who is my Republican mentor. That bill required the Agency to start collecting data on greenhouse[[Page S7132]]gas emissions. I take this very personally. The Agency ended up deciding to do it itself, as Senator Whitehouse is aware. But it was my first bill, and I decided that was a good first bill. It was bipartisan, and it got to the core of this issue that our country needs to take responsibility, that we need to work with the rest of the world. But most importantly, this is a long-term issue, shared by my businesses in Minnesota, shared by everyone from hunters to snowmobilers, to ice skaters in our State--the concern of our changing climate and the effect it will have on our way of life.  There are two specific issues that Mr.Wehrum will be involved in directing from the EPA that I wish to discuss: first, the renewable fuel standards and, then, circle back to this issue of climate change.  Minnesota's agriculture is very important to me. We are the fifth biggest ag State in the country. It is why I sought a seat on the Senate Agriculture Committee and why I have consistently pushed for a strong renewable standard. I believe we should be working in this body to help the farmers and the workers of the Midwest, not the oil sheikhs of the Middle  Recently, I led a letter with Senator Chuck Grassley, which was signed by 38 Senators, calling on Administrator Pruitt to ensure that the final rule for 2018 and 2019 sets blending targets that promote growth in the biofuel sector and in our economy.  The final rule for 2017 followed congressional intent and required a record amount of biofuel to be mixed into our transportation fuel supply. The final rule this year should do the same. Reducing the blend targets of advanced biofuels could shortchange the growth of clean energy innovation and stifle the growth of the market for new biofuels.  So far the response from the administration in backing off these plans, thanks to Senator Grassley's leadership, has been encouraging, but the proof will be in the pudding when the rule is released before the end of the month. I appreciate the work of Senator Grassley, Senator Ernst, Senator Thune, and Senator Durbin--who is here with us right now in the Chamber--and others who have worked on this Renewable Fuel Standard, as well as my colleague Senator  Renewable fuels have become a homegrown economic generator for our country. They reduce the environmental impact of our transportation and energy sectors and cut our reliance on foreign oil. Every time a new study is released on this subject, I become more and more convinced that investments in renewable fuels are investments in our economy and in the health of rural  Last year, a study conducted by ABF Economics showed that the ethanol industry generated $7.37 billion in gross sales in 2015 for Minnesota businesses and $1.6 billion in income for Minnesota households. Here is a big one: The ethanol industry also supports over 18,000 full-time jobs in I see the Presiding Officer is from the State of Just as he knows that the oil industry is important in our State, the ethanol industry is important in the Midwest, and I believe they can both coexist.  Just last weekend, I visited the Green Plains ethanol plant in Minnesota to see one of the operations behind these impressive figures and meet firsthand with some of the 60 people who are employed there. One of the things I heard while in Fairmont was how policy instability and delays have chilled investment over the years. Delays in releasing the RFS rule in previous years has undercut the Green Plains' ability to acquire necessary investments and create new employment opportunities. The need for stable policy and the forward-looking administration of the RFS is key to providing certainty for producers, employees, and manufacturers, while unlocking billions of dollars of investment in the biofuel sector.  We have to continue to build on the progress we have made of expanding production capacity more than threefold since 2005 with biodiesel, cellulosic ethanol, recycled waste, and other advanced biofuels. This is no longer some kind of a niche industry. This is 10 percent of our fuel supply. That is why I am concerned with some of the statements that Mr.Wehrum has made and some of the clients he has represented in lawsuits against the EPA, many of whom sought to undermine and weaken the  He was the counsel of record in several challenges to the RFS, including the E15 waiver, which allows for blends of up to 15 percent of ethanol in gasoline, something Senator Thune and I have worked on. Yet most concerning was his role in a 2015 challenge to the requirement that diesel fuel sold in my State of Minnesota contain at least 10 percent of biodiesel, or  Let me say that this kind of principle and this policy were supported by Democratic, Republican, and Independent Governors in Minnesota--from Tim Pawlenty to Jesse Ventura to Mark My State has been a leader when it comes to the use of renewable fuels. We were the first State in the Nation to pass a biodiesel blending law and the first State in the Nation to require gasoline to be blended with 10 percent of ethanol. We continue to be a national leader in the use of  In 2008 the State legislature amended the Minnesota mandate--that is when Tim Pawlenty was Governor--to gradually step up the required biodiesel blend from 2 percent to 5 percent and eventually to 20 percent from 2012 to 2018. Now, according to the statute, the B10 mandate will double to B20 starting on May 1, 2018. With bipartisan support and individual State responsibility, it is something that our State did because we knew it could work.  Despite Mr.Wehrum's best efforts, the U.district court upheld Minnesota's mandate on renewable biodiesel, which has been in the best interest of rural economies and consumers. These advances are going to help ag producers and rural manufacturing plants do even more for the regional economy. The further ethanol and biodiesel take us the less dependent we will be on foreign oil and the less of an impact our transportation and energy sectors will have on the environment.  I have already discussed the climate change issue, and I see that Senator Durbin is here.  Again, I will just reiterate that I am a former prosecutor. I believe in evidence, and every week seems to bring fresh evidence of the damage that climate change is already causing. Minnesota may be miles away from the rising oceans, but the impacts are no less of a real threat to my I did not like Mr.Wehrum's answers that he gave to these questions during his hearing before the Environment and Public Works Committee, especially when I asked if he believed that human activities were the main driver of climate change and his response was: ``I believe that's an open question.''  I do not think this nominee should be running this part of the Agency, and we cannot sit back and ignore the evidence. We need to wake up, take action, and turn the corner on the devastating effects of climate change before it is too late.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan). The minority whip.

510,topic-id,1730,"Mr.President, I want to turn to two topics today.  First, the good news is that all of the members of the Senate Rules Committee have come together on a mandatory sexual harassment training resolution that has been submitted with broad support, including from the two leaders and every member of the Rules I thank Senator Grassley for his leadership, Senator Shelby for his leadership, as well as Senators Capito and Cortez Masto, who were a big help.  We are all too aware that sexual harassment continues in our workplaces. A recent study found that one in four women has been sexually harassed in the workplace and that three-quarters of individuals who have experienced sexual harassment at work have not reported the incidences. Civil service is actually among the top five industries with the highest sexual harassment incidences.  We know that it will not stop on its own, and we will not be complacent bystanders who expect workplace cultures to change on their own. That is why today, with a bipartisan group of 19 of our colleagues, we took a major step forward with this resolution. Once it is adopted by the full Senate, which we hope will be shortly, this resolution will simply require that all Senators and staff receive sexual harassment training, as well as on other forms of harassment, at least once every 2 years--in addition to that, 60 days after it passes.  What happens if Senators do not receive this training? The American people will know.  In one part of this bill--and I appreciate the broad support from Senator McConnell, who has long been someone who has taken leadership in this area for many years, and from Senator Schumer, who has also taken leadership in this area--all offices will have to certify to the Secretary of the Senate that they and their employees here in Washington, as well as those working in our home States, have, in fact, taken the training and complied with the resolution. These certifications will be posted online for the public to view.  I thank Senator Grassley, again, as well as Senator Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was the author of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. I want to thank as well Senators Cortez Masto and Capito and all the members of the Rules Committee for coming together, on both sides of the aisle, on this commonsense resolution.  I urge my colleagues to support the Senate Anti-Harassment Training Resolution of 2017. There is more work to be done with regard to the reporting process, and that is something we are going to be working on in the next few weeks through the Rules Committee, but I do want to thank them.[[Page S7148]]  Senator Gillibrand has also been working in this area, and I want to thank her. Overall, it is a good effort in which everyone came together and agreed on a plan for mandatory training.                              Veterans Day  Mr.President, I will now turn to a completely different subject, and that is the subject of Veterans  I rise to honor and thank our veterans, servicemembers, and their families as we celebrate our veterans on Veterans These brave men and women represent the best among us. Whether you served 50 years ago or still wear the uniform today, we thank our veterans for their service and sacrifice on behalf of this great  No matter when they served, all veterans have one thing in common: a deep love of our country and a patriotism that goes beyond simply feeling pride. All veterans were willing to lay down their lives in defense of this Nation, and many continue to live the spirit of service in their communities once their time in the military is over.  Last week, I attended the change of command ceremony, where we honored outgoing MG Richard Nash for his decades of service and saw him pass the leadership torch to MG Jon Jensen, who was sworn in as the new adjutant general of Minnesota's National  As General Nash said earlier this year, ``Our Minnesota National Guard and the entire state has contributed greatly in a period of history that will be looked back upon as a remarkably important time.''  He continued: ``We were always ready, always there.''  He was right. Our servicemembers are always there for us, and, in turn, we must honor their service.  At a time marked by the volatility of our politics, our commitment to our servicemembers and veterans remains steadfast. We stand united regardless of our politics. Our veterans fought for our freedom, and we need to be there for them.  When our servicemembers put their lives on the line to serve our country, there wasn't a waiting line. When they come home to the United States of America, when they need healthcare or they need a job or they need a house, there should never be a waiting line in the United States of  We still have a great deal of work ahead of us to honor this commitment. Here is an example. Amie Muller of Woodbury, MN, enlisted in the Air Force in 1998. After two deployments to Balad, Iraq, where she was stationed next to one of the war's most notorious toxic burn pits, she returned home. Shortly afterward, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at age 36, half the average age for this form of cancer.  When Amie passed earlier this year, she left three small children and her loving husband Brian behind. Since then, I have gotten to know and work with He has made one thing clear to me: We can't let these toxic burn pits become another Agent So as part of Amie's legacy, we are working to create a Center of Excellence within the Department of Veterans Affairs to deal with the mounting evidence that thousands of veterans have gotten sick after being exposed to toxic substances burned in the large pits in Iraq and This isn't a partisan issue, and I am very pleased to have as a cosponsor of my bill Republican colleague Senator Thom Tillis of North We have been working together to get this bill passed. We are very pleased it was in the National Defense Authorization Act that came out of the  While our National Guard and Reserve component members often serve with their Active-Duty counterparts on the exact same missions, they are not always ensured the same compensation and benefits for their service. When they return home, our National Guard and reservists are often denied the education and healthcare benefits they counted on during their deployments. We need to close that loophole and make sure that members deployed on the same missions who take the same risks receive the same benefits.  Just as we have made a commitment to serving our servicemembers, we have made a commitment to looking out for their families. Since September 11, 2001, the Minnesota National Guard soldiers and airmen have deployed more than 26,000 times. Actually the Red Bulls, one of our units, is one of the longest serving units in  That service can take a toll on families--especially kids. That is why it is important for students and teachers to know which students' parents are servicemembers so they can help make special accommodations like setting up Skype during the schoolday so a young girl can talk to her dad who is serving abroad. That is what happens for students whose parents are on Active Duty in the military but not for those whose parents are in the Guard or That makes no sense. Some say it was just an error--some say maybe not. Whatever it is, we need to fix it. I am leading bipartisan legislation to make sure our Guard and Reserve Forces and their families are treated equally.  When our veterans signed up to serve and defend our country, there wasn't a waiting line, as I noted. That is why, on this day tomorrow, we will be honoring them by telling them we believe they deserve the best.  I was reminded of that a number of years ago when I greeted one of the World War II Honor Flights that was coming back filled with veterans from Minnesota who saw, maybe for the first time or the last time, the World War II They had gotten up incredibly early in the morning, boarded a plane, spent the day, and flew back. There were hundreds and hundreds of family members waiting for them late at night in the airport terminal with balloons and signs with their names on them. They got off that flight on walkers and wheelchairs, and they came down to where the families were, tears running down their faces. It was an amazing sight to see.  In typical Minnesota tradition, a polka band was playing by the luggage carrousel, and one of the older veterans, who I later found out was in his late eighties, asked me to dance.  I said: Well, I would love to dance. Then the band stopped playing because it was at the end.  Then he said: Oh, that is  I said: I am sorry. I will have to take a rain check.  I don't know why I said that to someone his age, but that is what I said.  Then he said: That is I have a great voice.  He started singing that Frankie Valli song, ``You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you,'' and he danced me around and around that luggage carrousel.  As I danced with that man, I thought to myself, this is how our veterans should be treated every day. They should be greeted with balloons and signs at the airport, and they should be dancing with their Senators by the luggage carrousel.  That is the spirit we have to remember as we go forward into Veterans We are reminded of the exceptional commitment and extraordinary service our democracy demands of all the brave men and women who have stepped forward to protect it. That same democracy demands that we fight for our servicemembers as they fought for us. As General Nash said, they were ``always there'' for us, and we must be there for them too.

536,topic-id,699,"Mr.President, first of all, I would like to thank Senator Blunt for his leadership. We have worked side by side on these issues for so many years, and I am really pleased--as he noted--that there has been a lot of focus on this issue of the adoption tax credit and not only how it needs to be fixed in any tax bill and make sure it is maintained, but, in fact, it should be expanded on. I thank him. We have both been advocating for that.  One of the reasons I am so involved in this issue is, in my State of Minnesota, we have historically had a lot of adoptions. One is international adoptions. We have one of the highest rates of international adoptions in the country. We have families who have opened their hearts to kids from Vietnam to Guatemala, to Nepal, to  I have had the opportunity to witness the power of adoption firsthand when I served for 8 years as the Hennepin County attorney--which is the largest prosecutor's office in our We also have civil jurisdiction so one of the things I worked on was speeding up the amount of time it took for foster kids to get out and into permanent homes. I was able to see firsthand those loving parents who would do anything to bring these kids into their families. When you see it internationally, it just breaks your heart if it goes on for years and years and years.  Right now, domestically, over 425,000 children are living without permanent families in our foster care system. Over 110,000 of these kids are eligible for adoption. One of the reasons Senator Blunt and I came together today is to make people aware that, yes, there is international adoption--it is so important--but there are also kids right here in America who would love to be taken in by a family. That is part of the theme of our Adoption Month for the country.  We have tackled a number of issues over the last few years, along with former Senator Landrieu of One of them was the International Adoption Simplification Act, which was a big help in terms of making sure that older children weren't left behind when younger siblings were adopted. I worked on that bill with Senator Inhofe; then, Senators Blunt and Landrieu and I introduced the Accuracy for Adoptees Act, which helps greatly to ensure that families don't have to fight with foreign authorities to get their kids' documents changed.  We are also working on some of the international issues now because of the slowdown in international adoptions and the work that we can do there. We look forward to working with the State Department and other agencies on that.  One of the best parts of our job is helping a family in our home State with an adoption. Recently, I got to visit a family in the western suburbs of For years, they had been waiting to adopt two Ethiopian boys. We worked really hard on this, as the halt of adoptions out of Ethiopia affected more than 200 American families; one of them was David and Katie Because of the work that was done and the push that was made, a number of these kids came home to their families.  I got to swing on a tire swing with these two rather fun boys who, every day, like to put on their bicycle helmets just because they think that is cool, and they wear them around the backyard. We had a great time with them.  There are other children, and it makes you realize how close to home this is and how pleased we are to welcome these kids to American families. That is what National Adoption Month is all about. We want more kids to be able to swing on tire swings, so we will continue to work with the foster care system, as well as the international[[Page S7194]]adoption system, to make this a reality for more and more orphans across the world.

Mr.Speaker, for 56 years, this bill has been the primary way in which Congress executes its Article I constitutional duty to provide for the common defense. This year's bill finally begins to rebuild our military after a half decade of cuts which slashed nearly one-quarter of the defense budget. For 6 years, we have just been barely getting by: cutting resources as the world becomes more dangerous, asking more and more of those who serve, and putting off tough choices. We are at a key decision point.  This bill will continue to save billions of taxpayer dollars while cutting wasteful bureaucracy and streamlining acquisition, but it will also strengthen missile defense and, in many ways, make our military more focused on its core mission of preparing to fight and win wars.  There are so many good things in the bill, I can't go over all of them.

There are many places throughout the world, unfortunately, where such freedoms do not exist. Americans have the right, under our wonderful system of government, to respect and study the Bible, or any other system of belief, if they so choose, or even no belief at all. That is the beauty of the American way, and I believe it is founded and goes back to the  In 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared the week of Thanksgiving to be National Bible Every U.President since has followed this tradition by declaring this time of year to be National Bible The National Bible Association and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops have designated the specific days of November 12 through 18 of this year as National Bible  This is the week set aside to recognize the Bible as a foundational building block of Western civilization, the Judeo-Christian heritage, and the legacy that motivated and shaped the founding of the United In this hour, we will hear from Members of Congress from various faith traditions and denominations speak about what the Bible means to them and what it means to the country. We are here, in keeping with tradition, to recognize National Bible  Mr.Speaker, I am just going to speak for a couple of moments about my own personal experience and then turn it[[Page H9248]]over to some Members who want to share some thoughts that I think bear worth listening to.  When I was a freshman at the University of Kansas four decades ago, someone asked me if I knew what the Bible was about. I said, yes, I knew what it was all about. But I realized that my answer was actually pretty presumptuous because I had never actually read any of it.  Mr.Speaker, I wonder if this might be true for others who might be listening tonight. The only honest thing I could do at that point was to read the Bible for myself. I started by reading the Gospel of John in the New When I read it, I discovered that I hadn't known at all what the Bible was about.  In that Gospel, Jesus says: ``I am the way, the truth and the life; no one comes to the Father but through me.'' And I ended up discovering a personal relationship with Jesus Christ who became my Lord and  Mr.Speaker, this is what I know from personal experience. It is better to read the Bible for one's self and not just to take someone else's word for what is in it. For me, it made all of the difference in the world. My life has been totally different since then as a result.  As King David says in the Psalms: ``The unfolding of Your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.''  As we celebrate National Bible Week, we remember the importance of faith in both our private and public lives. We recognize the Bible's powerful message of hope. We cherish the wisdom of the Bible, and we thank God for providing this Holy Book that has truly been, in the words of the Scripture, ``a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path.''

652,topic-id,854,"Mr.Speaker, I am going to mention something about fulfilled prophesy. This is one of the reasons why we can believe in and trust the  People come here to Congress with all different kinds of backgrounds, including pastors. This diversity of background adds a valuable thread of experience and thought that helps us all.  One reason many people respect the Bible is that so many prophesies for telling future events have come true exactly as foretold. In the Old Testament, there are many predictions that were given to prove that, if a speaker were divinely inspired, those things that he predicted would come true; it would validate the words of that prophet.  The Book of Daniel, for instance, contains scores of detailed prophesies that were literally fulfilled. Skeptics have fallen back to the position that Daniel must have been written after the fact and is, therefore, not being honest.  In fact, the Book of Daniel is found in its entirety in the Greek's Septuagint and partially in the Dead Sea Scrolls, both of which we know predated the events that were prophesied. That means that the critics of the dating of the Book of Daniel are the ones who are not being honest.  The rise and fall of empires, the capture and destruction of cities, the destiny of kings all were prophesied in minute detail. Archeology and history have literally confirmed hundreds of such prophesies as having come true.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.LaMalfa).  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from Colorado (Mr.Lamborn) for leading this Special Order tonight on National Bible  Last night, several of us had the privilege to attend a preview of the national Museum of the It was very impressive. I would urge everybody watching tonight and who hears about it to tour it when you get the chance here in Washington, D. One of the things that struck me very early on in that tour was a banner hanging inside the museum that says: ``The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing to the soul. The decree of the Lord is trustworthy, giving wisdom to the simple''--Psalm 19:8.  That also applies to the Bible itself, the inherent and infallible Word of  Jesus himself used Scripture that was written before him. Jesus never belittled the Scripture, as some modern critics do, or set it aside, nor did he criticize it; although he criticized those who misused it or contradicted it, although he rejected many interpretations of it.  When we hear the Son of God's quotes to Scriptures, we need no further testimony. He believed every word of All the prophesies concerning Himself were fulfilled, as my colleague, Mr.Lamborn, said.  Time and time and time again, the timelines prove the Word of God's prophesy. Matthew 19:4 and 19:5 were one of those that Jesus spoke of, documented in the New Testament, accounts by those over there with Jesus at the time.  We know Moses wrote the Pentateuch, Jonah wrote Jonah, Daniel wrote Jesus attests to that. He believed the Old Testament was spoken by God, Himself, written by the Holy Spirit's inspiration, even though the pen was held by men. That is an important point for those who ask: How can the Bible be real, since it was written down by men?  The committed task of all writing of the Word of God, though they were fallible men, were guided by the infallible Holy That is a faith we have and hold.  It does take some faith, yes, just as it takes faith for me to get on that airliner and fly back East each week. But the faith in the Bible is much stronger. It has never been proven wrong. All the prophesies that were made that have occurred already have been proven true.  The Founders thought it was a key element in the founding of this Nation, obviously. Right in this room, behind the Speaker's dais, is the inscription: ``In God We Trust.'' Facing me right now is the only forward-facing image in here of Moses looking over this House of  Lastly, I would leave with this. As you watch the machinations of the Members of Congress, I think one of the most important guidelines we would have I find in Proverbs 4:25 through 4:27: we uphold the honor not only of this institution and our families, but those who walk with God, that walk with  In Proverbs, you see: ``Let your eyes look straight ahead. Fix your gaze directly before you. Keep straight the passage for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. Do not turn to the right or the left. Keep your feet from evil.''  That is what the Bible inspires. As I read it on the plane coming back and forth and read it at home or at my bedside, this is what true faith is all about, proven time and time again.  I urge everybody not just to have the Bible at your home. The statistics are that every home has 2.2 Bibles, on average. It isn't that there aren't enough It is that people don't open it often enough.

968,topic-id,188,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise, today, in strong opposition to this House Republican tax bill, which was developed in secret without a single public hearing.  Despite repeated calls for Republicans to engage in a bipartisan process with Democrats, this bill was written without Democratic input and with enormous giveaways to wealthy interests.  It makes you wonder, doesn't it, Mr.Speaker?  To pay for them, Republicans have eliminated critical tax provisions that are important to the middle class--such as deductions to medical expenses, for State and local taxes, for student loan interest, and other expenses--on which middle class families rely. What Republicans can't pay for, they add to the Nation's credit card to the tune of $1.7 trillion.  Mr.Speaker, we are out to support this plan, but most Americans are only given the crumbs of this tax reform pie.  Mr.Speaker, I cannot, in good conscience, vote for this bill. We need a fair and balanced tax reform package that helps everyday Rhode Islanders and that helps everyday Americans get ahead, not just the well-off and well-connected.

808,topic-id,1127,"Mr.President, our economy has been stuck between 1.4- and 1.9-percent growth over the last 10 years. Compare that to the 10-year cycles before that, over and over again, all the way back to the Great Every group in a 10-year block was at 3 percent or more growth. Literally, we have had half the growth in our economy over the last 10 years than we have had in any 10-year time period, going all the way back to the Great We have to be able to deal with that.  I hear people over and over again say that regulations are choking our businesses and are driving up the cost of products for consumers. Yet our Tax Code is full of loopholes, and it is full of confusion. It is complicated. When I go through to fill out my individual taxes, it seems as though there are deductions for everybody else but for me, and people want to get that fixed. Quite frankly, no one likes paying taxes, and everyone wants to make sure that whatever taxes they pay are spent efficiently and are the lowest possible. I cannot tell them that right now because the spending is not on track and is not efficient. I also cannot tell them that they are as low as possible. We need to fix that.  The tax reform that we are discussing in the Senate right now deals with some very basic things. It begins with more take-home pay for individuals. You can either be paid more by an employer or you can be taxed less by the government. Either one of those increases the take-home pay. This solves the ``tax less'' by the government so that individuals can have more take-home pay--around $100 a month. That is serious money for most Oklahomans to have going back to their families.  The way that happens is by starting with the standard deduction that doubles, which is $24,000. To say it flat, if you make between zero and $24,000 as a family, you wouldn't have any tax at all on that first $24,000. That is a great help. Your tax does not even begin at all until after $24,000. You would be in that zero percent bracket.  We double the Child Tax For families who are raising kids, it is exceptionally helpful for them to have a larger tax credit.  Then we take out the individual mandate in  We have already had folks who have asked: What does ObamaCare have to do with tax policy?  Let me tell you, very simply, that the individual mandate is a tax. That is what the Supreme Court labeled it as, and that is what individuals understand it to be. If you don't buy the type of insurance of which Washington, DC, approves--and you may sign up for different insurance--you will get an additional tax penalty on your taxes.  Who pays for that?  In Oklahoma, 81 percent of the people who pay the individual mandate tax penalty make $50,000 or less a year. It is a tax aimed directly at the middle class.  I think that this is unfair. We want to remove that tax penalty from the middle class and say that they do not have that penalty and that they are allowed to buy insurance they can actually afford.  What does this mean for jobs?  If small businesses have a better Tax Code and their passthroughs, then they are able to hire additional people. That means more jobs.  Based on where our economy is right now, the unemployment rate has continued to drop over the last several years. At the spot it is right now, that means that there is more competition; there is more hiring; and more people have to compete for those jobs. That means that employers have to pay a little bit more money to get the people to be able to do it. That raises wages for people all around the country and means additional people who are not working will actually get back to work. With more people working and actually paying taxes, it pays for itself.  Getting a growing economy going is essential to us. The way you do that is you take care of the Tax Code for small businesses, and you take care of the Tax Code for corporate businesses.  I have had folks who have asked me: If you drop the corporate rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, what does that really do?  Again, it allows those big companies, as well as the small companies, to hire more people, to engage in more investment, to build more factories, and to buy more machinery. That is what it allows them to be able to do to grow their businesses. Yet, on the international stage right now, our Tax Code is 35 percent. Compare that to those in other countries that are somewhere around 22, 23, 24 percent. Some of them are less than that.  Let me make this simple. If you are going online to buy a shirt and if you can see that shirt for $20 on one website or $35 on another website, where do you buy the shirt? It will probably be from the one that is selling it for $20. If you are starting a business or founding a business, and you can go to one spot where the tax rate is 20 percent or to another spot where it is 35 percent, guess where you will found the business. It will be where it is lower.  We are the higher rate right now. If we don't fix that, businesses are going to continue to move overseas. We can make fun of them in the news. We can yell at them and tell them that they are un-American, but they are going to continue to move where they pay less, exactly as every American does with his online shopping. That is fixable.  In the middle of all of this, we have to deal with the debt and deficit. We cannot ignore that reality. The things that I am still going through in the proposal that we are working through right now are the things that are unrealistic in the proposal because, at the end of the day, we have to get the economy growing again, but we have to deal with half a trillion dollars in overspending from this government right now. We can do both. We have to be able to do both.  I am encouraging this body to take seriously a proposal to be able to deal with how we get our economy going again. Let's figure out how to get it done, and then let's actually solve this for the American people.

170,topic-id,590,"Mr.President, as Republicans consider tax proposals to disproportionately benefit corporations and the wealthy, they simultaneously fail to address revenue-draining loopholes that compel hardworking taxpayers to subsidize corporate misconduct. Today, I am introducing commonsense legislation--the ``No Tax Write-Offs for Corporate Wrongdoers Act''--to prevent the worst corporate actors from writing off their wrongdoing as simply the cost of doing business. This idea is commonsense. This idea is straightforward. This idea should be bipartisan.  Today's tax code allows corporations to deduct the cost of court-ordered punitive damages as an ``ordinary'' business expense. Courts reserve punitive damages for only the most egregious and reckless misconduct--misconduct that usually causes great harm to peoples' lives. For victims who have suffered at the hands of the worst corporate bad actors, there is nothing ``ordinary'' about this loophole. Punitive damage awards are designed to punish wrongdoers for the reprehensible harm they cause--to provide a deterrence to misconduct. By giving corporations a deduction specifically for their wrongdoing, our tax code winks and nods at future wrongdoers who know that they can simply write off the damages they owe for the damage they cause.  This is not a theoretical problem. In 1994, when the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil in the Prince William Sound, devastating Alaska's southern coast, it was eventually slapped with punitive damages of $500 million. Exxon turned around and exploited this tax loophole to write off those punitive damages as an ``ordinary'' business expense--saving the company millions of dollars that could have--and should have--added to government revenues. In 2011, two Montana teenagers died in a car crash caused by a steering wheel defect in the Hyundai model they were driving--a defect that Hyundai knew about and recklessly ignored for over a decade. Although a judge eventually ordered Hyundai to pay $73 million in punitive damages, Hyundai can lawfully write those damages off as a business expense. This is just wrong.  The No Tax Write-Offs for Corporate Wrongdoing Act is simple and straightforward, and would end this offensive loophole once and for all. My bill would amend the tax code to prevent the deduction of any amount ``paid or incurred for punitive damages in connection with any judgment in, or settlement, any action between private parties.'' Aside from bringing our tax code in line with our most basic notions of justice and fair play, my bill would save American taxpayers a significant amount of money. In 2016, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that ending this punitive damages loophole would increase our government revenues by nearly $415 million over 10 years.  The Senate will be talking a lot about tax reform in the coming weeks. The Senate majority will bend over backwards--they already are--to argue how important it is that we dramatically lower tax rates to make our tax system more favorable to large corporations. Should we not also hold these same corporations accountable when they poison our environment and harm Americans? Legislation that leaves such an egregious loophole in place while giving companies massive tax cuts is not tax reform. It is a corporate tax giveaway.  It should shock the conscience to know that our law effectively compels hardworking taxpayers to subsidize the recklessness and bad behavior of the worst corporate actors. This bill would change this unacceptable status-quo. I thank Senators Blumenthal, Reed, Gillibrand, and Hassan for cosponsoring this legislation. I urge all Senators--of all political ideologies--to support the No Tax Write-Offs for Corporate Wrongdoing Protecting our constituents from corporate misconduct is not a political or partisan issue. It is our job.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7158.txt,1383,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2874, 21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM",2017,9,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
359,topic-id,1248,"Mr.President, I would like to take a moment to recognize the moving work of Ron Powers of Castleton, VT--a Pulitzer Prize-winning author who has written about everything from Mark Twain to the soldiers of Iwo Jima to broadcast news and sports.  Ron's latest book, ``No One Cares About Crazy People,'' concentrates on a topic that he promised himself he would never write about: the social history of mental illness in This story is poignantly told through his own deeply personal story of his two[[Page S7258]]sons' struggles with schizophrenia, which tragically claimed the life of one of them.  The book's informative yet intimate approach raises awareness about a subject that most are too uncomfortable to broach. When reading it, you can hardly hold back tears.  I cannot imagine the pain Ron and Honoree went through while working on this book. It is a truly personal journey and a triumph. I am proud of him for publishing this important work. He understands that mental illness is not an issue that will simply go away if pushed into the darkness of neglect and denial. One cannot lock it up in an institution and expect to be rid of the problem. Mental illness in America needs to be discussed openly, by those who suffer from it, the friends and families of those affected, medical experts, and those of us We must all follow the footsteps of Ron and continue to shine a light on this extremely sensitive issue.  I ask unanimous consent that the October 8, 2017, Vermont Digger article honoring Ron Powers and his family and recognizing his great work be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Vermont Digger, 8, 2017]            A Vermonter Questions the Nation's Mental Health                          (By Kevin O'Connor)       Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Powers' past works have      eagerly explored everything from the 1800s literary lion Mark      Twain to the flag-raising World War II soldiers at Iwo Jima      and the present-day pioneers of broadcast news and sports.       The Vermonter's current focus is different.       ``This is the book I promised myself I would never write,''      Powers begins its preface. ``I have kept that promise for a      decade--since our younger son, Kevin, hanged himself in our      basement, a week before his 21st birthday in July 2005, after      struggling for three years with schizophrenia.''       The author, born 75 years ago in Twain's hometown of      Hannibal, Missouri, can boast of a prolific career that has      seen him in a columnist's chair at the Chicago Sun-Times and      a commentator's seat on the CBS News program ``Sunday      Morning,'' as well as on the best-seller list for more than a      dozen books that include collaborating on the late U.     Edward Kennedy's memoir ``True Compass.''       But after the death of one of his two boys, the Castleton      resident could barely think about, let alone tackle, another      project. He and his wife, Honoree Fleming, were finally      starting to heal (``adaptation, really,'' he says) when they      saw their surviving son, experiencing a psychotic break one      Christmas, tell neighbors he was the messiah before police      took him to a hospital.       And so Powers began to research mental illness--not just      the schizophrenia his family has faced but also all the other      issues the World Health Organization estimates will affect      one-fourth of the world's people at some point in their      lives.       ``I realized that my 10 years of silence on the subject,''      he says, ``silence that I had justified as insulation against      an exercise in self-indulgence, was itself an exercise in      self-indulgence.''       And so Powers is talking up his new book, ``No One Cares      About Crazy People: The Chaos and Heartbreak of Mental Health      in America.'' The 384-page Hachette hardcover shares his      family's story alongside a historic and often horrific survey      of mental illness in larger society.       ``Studies by the National Institute of Mental Health show      that among Americans age 18 or older, more than 62 million      (26 percent of the population) require (but are not always      given) counseling and medical treatment,'' he writes.       Powers could cite too many reasons for not wanting to      tackle the topic: What about his family's privacy? The      appearance of exploitation? The fact he isn't an expert?       ``Book writing is hard work,'' he continues. ``And, really,      end of the day, who the hell wants to read about      schizophrenia anyway?''       Plenty of people, the author would discover. Nearly a      decade after their son's death, Powers and his wife accepted      an invitation to testify at a 2014 Vermont legislative      hearing on whether acutely mentally ill patients should be      medicated against their will.       ``At first glance, speedy `involuntary treatment' might      seem the least objectionable of measures, given that people      in psychosis are virtually never capable of making rational      decisions,'' he writes in his book. ``And yet opponents of      the process bring passionate counterarguments to the debate.      Among the most formidable is that `involuntary treatment' is      by definition a violation of one's civil liberties.''       Powers testified in support of shorter waits on decisions      about involuntary intervention, which the Legislature went on      to adopt as law. But the author was moved by opponents of the      measure.       ``They were there: the faces and souls of the mentally ill,      emerging from their prevailing invisibility to declare      themselves,'' he writes. ``The sheer presence of them, their      actualization in the room, had affected me in the gut, not      because I hadn't expected them, but because of the profound,      elemental humanity of them.''       Three weeks later, Powers read news of a Wisconsin      political aide who, responding to headlines of state mental      health mismanagement, emailed a colleague: ``No one cares      about crazy people.''       That's when the author started writing--for himself, his      household, other families, friends, neighbors and psychiatric      professionals.       ``My aim with this book is not to replace or argue with the      existing vast inventory of important books on mental      illness,'' he writes. ``Rather, I hope to reamplify a simple      and self-evident and morally insupportable truth: Too many of      the mentally ill in our country live under conditions of      atrocity.''       Powers has taken his message to National Public Radio's      ``Fresh Air'' program and is seeing it shared in publications      nationwide.       ``He writes with fierce hope and fierce purpose to persuade      the world to pay attention,'' fellow Pulitzer Prize-winning      journalist Ron Suskind wrote in a review for The New York      ``I'm not sure I've ever read anything that handles      the decline of one's children with such openness and searing,      stumbling honesty.''       Readers can learn for themselves when Powers speaks at the      Brattleboro Literary Festival on Saturday at 11 a.m. at the      downtown Centre Congregational If similar appearances      are any indication, he'll share a few of the book's humorous      family stories, too.       ``Why do I include these?'' he told an audience in      ``Because they make me smile and bring the two      boys to life. I wanted to avoid a kind of cliche--the      afflicted loved ones described only in the context of their      victimhood. It's hard to feel compassion for an abstract. My      sons were wonderful spirited boys before this affliction      struck.''       That said, Powers isn't seeking to entertain.       ``I hope you do not `enjoy' this book,'' he writes. ``I      hope you are wounded by it; wounded as I have been in writing      it. Wounded to act, to intervene.''       ``America must turn its immense resources and energy and      conciliatory goodwill to a final assault on mental illness,''      he concludes. ``My sons, and your afflicted children and      brothers and sisters and parents and friends, deserve nothing      less.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7257.txt,1383,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2874, 21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM",2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have a lot of stuff.''       ``And for me it was important to tell the story from both      sides,'' he said.       One fascinating document in the exhibit is a Viet Cong      propaganda poster that echoes, from the enemy's point of      view, the notorious U.obsession with numbers and body      counts.       The poster claims, among other things, that the Viet Cong      in 1962 and part of 1963 killed 28,108 South Vietnamese and      222 Americans--double the actual figures. ``So that inflated      body count was happening on both sides,'' said curator Alice      Kamps, who assembled ``Remembering Vietnam.''       The exhibit includes CIA models of what appear to be an      interrogation room and cell in the North Vietnamese prison      known as the Hanoi Hilton, which held many American       There are transcripts of once secret American helicopter      communications as Saigon, the chaotic capital of South      Vietnam, was evacuated by the Americans in 1975.       ``Bring ur personnel up thru th building,'' reads one      communication. ``Do not let them (the South Viets) follow too      closely. Use mace if necessary but do not fire on them.''       Although the exhibit covers the war from Ho Chi Minh's      appearance at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 to architect      Maya Lin's 1981 design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial,      Ferriero's war had a single goal.       ``We were all under the impression that the threat of      communism was the biggest challenge,'' he said. ``We were all      playing a part in protecting us against communism.''       Near the end of Ferriero's enlistment, he was shipped to      Vietnam as a corpsman in a psychiatric ward.       ``There were a lot of what we called at that point      'character disorders'--kids who were having trouble with      authority,'' he said. ``Then there were other folks who had      more serious psychotic kinds of things . . . awaiting      transfer back to the States.''       Eventually, he was transferred to the 700-bed hospital ship      USS Sanctuary, only to find the ``psych'' ward had been      closed because too many patients had been jumping overboard.       But Ferriero could type, and he became an administrative      clerk. After hours, though, he would help sort and treat the      wounded who were transported from the battlefield to a kind      of emergency room on the ship.       The helicopters came and went. Sometimes one would crash      into the ocean. ``In my time, no lives were lost,'' he said.       The ship would spend the day in the harbor at Da Nang, then      cruise off the coast at night. Ferriero, who still has his      dog tag on his key chain, said the injured included Americans      and Vietnamese, soldiers, Marines and civilians. One case      stood out. He was trying to start an intravenous line in an      injured patient and couldn't find a good vein. Each time he      failed, he discarded the needle and got a fresh one.       ``Kept throwing down these needles,'' he recalled. ``And at      one point he just screamed.'' ``I thought, 'Oh, Jesus, I'm      losing him,'' he said. ``This is it.''       ``It turned out that I had thrown one of those needles down      on the gurney and he had rolled over on it,'' he said.       Ferriero was embarrassed. His patient ``wasn't in that      great distress,'' he said, ``but I never followed up to see      what had happened to him.''       One day earlier this week, as Ferriero checked the exhibit,      he joked that there was one thing missing: a Zippo cigarette      lighter like those carried by many an American serving in            Later, in his office, he produced the one he kept for many      years. It was in pristine condition. ``USS Sanctuary'' was      etched in the side, and on the inside of its box was the      famous Zippo slogan:       ``It works or we fix it free.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7258.txt,1383,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2874, 21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM",2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
668,topic-id,1097,"Mr.President, today, I am introducing the Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2017. This legislation, if enacted, will help ensure that when Americans entrust corporations with their most sensitive personal information, these corporations take the right steps to keep this information secure, and do the right thing in the event of a data breach. In today's modern world, data security is no longer just about protecting our identities and our bank accounts; it is about protecting our privacy and even our National security.  The need for this legislation has long been clear, and never more so than in the wake of the recent, massive Equifax data breach. After media investigations and multiple Congressional hearings, we learned that the Equifax breach exposed the sensitive personal information of almost half the American population. We also learned that Equifax failed to take basic steps to secure its databases, and waited an unjustifiably long period before notifying consumers and regulators. Clearly, it is past time for all corporations that hold our personal information to maintain some common-sense, baseline cybersecurity standards.  Corporations make significant profits from our personal information, and they should be obligated to keep it safe. Yet too often, data breaches continue to plague American businesses[[Page S7216]]and compromise the privacy of millions of consumers. At the same time, the amount of information we share with corporations who are the target of these breaches is growing. Corporations collect and store our social security numbers, our bank account information, and our email addresses. They collect information about our private health and medical conditions. They know what routes we take to work and where we drop our kids off at school. They can replicate our fingerprints or even faceprints. We trust them with private photographs that we store in the cloud. This information is increasingly targeted by both criminal hackers and nation-states, including hostile foreign powers.  The Consumer Privacy Protection Act I am introducing today is based on legislation I first introduced in 2015, and builds and expands on data security legislation that I have introduced in Congress since 2005. It seeks to protect the vast amount of information that we now share with corporations each and every day. Americans want to know that the corporations who are profiting from their information are actually doing something to prevent the next data breach. Americans want to know when someone has had unauthorized access to their bank accounts and to their private family photographs, but they do not just want to be notified of yet another data breach. Consumers should not have to settle for mere notice of data breaches. American consumers deserve protection. This legislation would accomplish that.  The Consumer Privacy Protection Act requires that corporations meet certain baseline privacy and data security standards to keep information they store about their customers safe, and requires that corporations provide notice and protection to consumers in the event of a breach. This legislation protects broad categories of data, including, (1) social security numbers and other government-issued identification numbers; (2) financial account information, including credit card numbers and bank accounts; (3) online usernames and passwords, including email names and passwords; (4) unique biometric data, including fingerprints; (5) information about a person's physical and mental health; (6) information about geolocation; and (7) access to private digital photographs and videos.  It is true that not every breach can be prevented. Cyber criminals and nation-state actors are determined and constantly looking for new ways to pierce the most sophisticated security systems. But just as we expect a bank to put a lock on the front door and an alarm on the vault to protect its customers' money, we expect corporations to take reasonable measures to protect the personal information they collect from us. Unfortunately, many of the corporations that profit from the very information that we entrust them to protect, have woefully inadequate measures to secure this information. For others, security is simply not a priority. American consumers deserve better and our national security demands it.  This legislation creates civil penalties for corporations that fail to meet the required privacy and data security standards established in the bill or fail to provide notice and protection to consumers when a breach occurs. The Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and State attorneys general each have a role in enforcement. This legislation also requires corporations to inform Federal law enforcement of all large data breaches, as well as breaches that could impact the federal government. Such notification is necessary to help law enforcement bring these cyber criminals to justice and identify patterns that help protect against future attacks.  Many Americans understandably assume Federal law already protects this sensitive information--common sense tells us that it should. Unfortunately, the reality is that it does not. States provide a patchwork of protection, and while some laws are strong, others are not. For example, my home state of Vermont has a strong data breach notification law that that has been in effect since 2007. But there are many other States that have not passed data security laws designed to prevent data breaches.  This legislation sets a floor: a baseline standard that that protects Americans across the country, while also freeing individual States to provide even stronger protections to their residents. In crafting Federal law, we must be careful not to override strong State laws, but we also need to ensure that all Americans, regardless of where they live, have their privacy protected. To this end, the Consumer Privacy Protection Act preempts State law relating to data security and data breach notification only to the extent that the protections under those laws are weaker than those provided for in this bill. We must ensure that consumers do not lose privacy protections they currently enjoy. Since this bill is modeled after those States with the strongest consumer protections, I believe it will improve protections for consumers in nearly every  I am joined today by Senators Markey, Blumenthal, Wyden, Franken, and Baldwin in introducing this legislation. These Senators have long shared my commitment to protecting consumer privacy. This legislation also has the support of leading consumer privacy advocates, including: the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Consumer Federation of America, New America's Open Technology Institute, and Public  Millions of Americans who have had their personal information compromised or stolen as a result of a data breach consider this issue to be of critical importance and a priority for the Protecting privacy rights should be important to all of us, regardless of party or ideology. I hope all Senators will support this common-sense measure to better protect Americans' privacy.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgS7215.txt,1383,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2874, 21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM",2017,14,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
680,topic-id,1988,"Mr.President, for 25 years, Earl ``Rusty'' Powell has served as the director of the National Gallery of Art, making him the longest serving director in its history. Rusty will retire in early 2019, concluding a tenure that has marked growth and development at one of our Nation's great galleries.  Rusty's life of public service began with 3 years of service in the Navy, during which he served as a navigator in Upon his return, Rusty embarked on what would become a decades-long career as a curator, historian, and aficionado, earning a doctorate from Harvard before beginning his first assignment at the National Gallery of  His experience there led to a 12-year tenure as the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, after which he returned to the National Gallery for what would become the longest tenure of a director in its 75-year history. He has worked tirelessly at the National Gallery of Art to increase the accessibility of the arts by expanding the National Gallery's projects, exhibitions, and endowment.  Rusty's approach to expanding and enriching the National Gallery has been as collaborative as it has been visionary. Rather than govern with a singular vision, he included his staff and board in moving the museum forward. From the construction of the stunning sculpture garden, to the renovation of the gallery's west wing, no detail has been overlooked throughout his tenure. He has also overseen several other projects that received less attention but are of no lesser value to the current success of the gallery. All these improvements have enhanced the experience of the more than 5 million visitors that pass through the gallery every year.  Rusty's great passion for the mission of the National Gallery and his unwavering efforts to bring storied art collections to its millions of visitors each year are unparalleled. With his retirement next year, he will leave a legacy at the gallery that will never be forgotten.  Marcelle and I have treasured the evenings we have spent with Rusty and his wife, Nancy, at exhibits and events we will always remember.  I ask unanimous consent that the November 7, 2017, Washington Post article detailing Rusty's time and accomplishments at the National Gallery of Art be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:[[Page S7257]]                  [From the Washington Post, 7, 2017]     The Quiet, Productive Tenure of Rusty Powell To Come to an End                           (By Geoff Edgers)       National Gallery of Art Director Earl ``Rusty'' Powell,      whose tenure has been marked by the collection's growth, the      renovation of nearly every space and a startling lack of      controversy, will retire in early 2019 after more than 25      years in charge.       Powell, 74, planned to tell the National Gallery's staff      Tuesday during informal meetings. Next year, the trustees      will begin the process of finding a successor for the      longest-serving director in its 76-year history.       ``I think I have run a pretty good race here, and it seems      sort of a logical time,'' Powell said in explaining the      decision. ``I turn 75 next year. And this will be after that.      I still have some gas in the tank. I'm not particularly      interested in sitting on the porch looking at sunsets.''       What he'll do, he said, is not clear. But what he has      accomplished at the National Gallery is easy to chart. Over      Powell's tenure, the institution, with a $200 million      operating budget and 5 million visitors a year, has been      reshaped, from the addition of a sculpture garden in 1999 to      the dramatic renovation of the East Building, completed last      year to add stunning galleries devoted to Mark Rothko and to      Barnett Newman's ``Stations of the Cross.'' Powell has also      overseen projects less buzzworthy but just as essential.       Six years and $19.3 million were spent renovating more than      three acres of leaky skylights in the West Building, part of      a deferred maintenance disaster once considered so dire it      inspired a local TV news series titled ``Gallery of Shame.''       Powell's tenure has also been notable for something it      lacked: controversy.       ``He's had that balance between being able to make      decisions and yet not offend everybody,'' said John      Wilmerding, the former National Gallery deputy director who      later served as chairman of its board of trustees.       Powell would never use words such as ``consummate      leadership,'' as his supporters do, to describe himself. He      can be witty, have strong opinions, but these often come as      asides, spoken softly and without naming names. He is not one      to call out other museum directors, even though he does note      that he doesn't agree with everyone in the field. About what?      With whom? He won't say.       This is in contrast with Carter Brown, the blue-eyed      impresario he replaced in 1992. Brown loved blockbusters,      mingling with royals--he brought Prince Charles and Princess      Diana to the National Gallery in 1985--and tended to spend      less time on issues such as infrastructure. Wilmerding      remembered that when Powell started, he noticed a stiffness      when Powell had to speak in front of groups.       ``He relied too much on his notes,'' Wilmerding said. ``I      remember saying to him, `You've got the personality--do more.      Wing it. Tell jokes. Be yourself.' That awkwardness rapidly      began to change.''       Born in South Carolina, Powell was just 4 when his father      died of injuries sustained during World War The family      moved to Rhode Island, and his mother eventually remarried.      Powell went to Williams College, where he played linebacker      and, after struggling to conquer chemistry class, found      himself studying art history.       As a boy, he had fond memories of hanging around his      grandfather's lithography business. In college, he found      inspiration in Lane Faison Jr., a legendary professor who      would help train many members of the ``Williams mafia,'' a      group of graduates that included future museum directors      Glenn Lowry of the Museum of Modern Art; James Wood of the      Art Institute of Chicago; and Powell's onetime roommate, John      Lane, who led the Dallas Museum of Art and San Francisco      Museum of Modern Other Williams graduates to become      directors include Michael Govan of the Los Angeles County      Museum of Art and Joseph Thompson of the Massachusetts Museum      of Contemporary       Powell credits his next stop--three years in the Navy, from      1966 to 1969--with helping him develop the skills to become a      leader. Lane also went from Williams to the The time      served helped them step into directorships while only in      their mid-30s.       ``We had already had the happy burden of being responsible      for a huge piece of machinery and a lot of fellow      shipmates,'' Lane said. ``And in what were particularly      dangerous circumstances. You were well equipped to take on      responsibility.''       The service also, unexpectedly, led Powell to One      afternoon, Powell stopped by the art history department at      Harvard to ask for a course catalogue. Professor Seymour      Slive, a World War II veteran, noticed he was wearing his      Navy whites, struck up a conversation, and then urged him to      attend graduate school in This started a long list      of opportunities that opened up for Powell, who noted that      ``I've never had to apply for a job.''       In 1976, not long after Powell earned his PhD, Brown hired      him for his first stint at the National Gallery as a curator      and special assistant.       And in 1980, Powell took his first trip to California to      interview for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's top job.      At 36, he began a 12-year tenure marked by tremendous growth,      with the museum's budget jumping from $8.5 million to $31      million and attendance more than doubling to close to a      million visitors a year.       Comedian Steve Martin, who served on the Los Angeles County      Museum of Art's board of trustees, marveled at Powell's      ability to embrace a wide range of art, his cordial nature      and his ability to understand how to manage the many      perspectives on the board. What's more, Martin found it      notable that Powell's tenure was conflict-free.       ``I never heard anybody say an unkind word about him,''      said Martin, an art collector.       Powell, when asked about his leadership style, gives credit      to others--curators, other administrators, staff--for making      him feel comfortable delegating authority. He uses email but      says many of his meetings are informal, taking place as he      walks from his car to his office in the morning.       ``I've always believed in a collegial, organizational      structure,'' he said. ``I think communication is a really      important thing. I learned to look at the big things. Not get      bogged down with the little things. We make collective      decisions about most of the things we do here. Our      exhibitions program. It's not `Rusty says we'll do this,      we'll do that.' We talk about it. We meet and discuss things      rather than do things from the top of it.''       Powell can be so understated, it's hard to know when he's      asking for anything. Even millions. That's what longtime      board president Victoria Sant found when the National Gallery      was raising money for the renovation of the East       ``You sort of don't know when Rusty's put the touch on      you,'' she said. ``He's not an aggressive fundraiser. He      tries to bring things to people that they want, that was in      their interest area. And I think one of the things that Rusty      has stressed is that when you give a gift to the National      Gallery, you're really giving a gift to the nation.''       Sant and her husband, Roger, ultimately gave $10 million to      the East Building project, which added more than 12,000      square feet of gallery space and an outdoor sculpture terrace      overlooking Pennsylvania       That was just one of the most recent accomplishments during      Powell's tenure. The list of art acquisitions, exhibitions      and building projects that have taken place since 1992 runs      for pages, from the construction of Dutch cabinet galleries      in 1995 to the endowment campaign launched last year after a      $30 million matching grant from the Andrew Mellon            Powell's announcement means there will no longer be a      director who spent time with Paul Mellon, the late      philanthropist who stood next to President Franklin      Roosevelt when the family's money and art collection sparked      the National Gallery's opening in 1941.       It was in Powell's first week as director that Mellon      invited him for lunch. Later, the philanthropist shared his      passion for a proposed sculpture garden. Powell remembers      showing Mellon the plans.       ``How big are the trees?'' Mellon asked.       ``We're going to have them as big as we can get them,''      Powell said.       ``Good, because I don't have that much time left and I'd      really like to see this,'' Mellon said.       ``Mr.Mellon, we're not going to give you a starter kit for      the sculpture garden,'' Powell said.       The garden, in fact, opened in May 1999, four months after      Mellon's death at the age of 91.       Powell said he never considered leaving the National      Gallery, even when headhunting firms called to see whether he      might be interested in other jobs. (Powell's total      compensation was comparable to those at other major      institutions. He earned $1.17 million in the most recent      public filing available, compared with the $1.44 million      earned by then-Met Director Thomas Campbell.) He appreciated      not having to spend so much time trying to raise money, as is      the case when you're running the Metropolitan Museum of Art      or Boston's Museum of Fine Nearly three-quarters of the      National Gallery's $200 million annual operating budget comes      from the federal government.       He also feels a deep connection to the       ``If you do what I do, it's the best job in the field,'' he      said. ``The standards are very high. The collections are      exemplary. The programs are great. You're not out with a tin      cup raising money to keep the building open. The federal      funding obligations are to keep it maintained. It's got a      center for advanced study. I came out of the academic side,      and this is the most academic place that can exist. It's a      unique place in the context of American museums.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7256-2.txt,1383,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2874, 21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM",2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

777,topic-id,1265,"I thank the distinguished Acting President pro tempore.                          Russia Investigation  Madam President, over the past 10 months, the Attorney General has testified before the Senate on three occasions about his knowledge of and contacts with Russian operatives. He also answered written questions and provided additional supplemental testimony, but he still has not gotten his story straight. On numerous occasions, new disclosures of his communications involving Russia have raised serious doubts about his testimony, and not one of these disclosures has come from the Attorney General; all have come from the press or unsealed court records. That is a problem.  This started in At his nomination hearing, both Senator Franken and I asked him about contacts with Russian officials. I asked him in writing whether he had been in contact with anyone connected to the Russian Government about the 2016 election. It was not a tricky or surprising question. Other Trump officials' undisclosed contacts with Russians, like those of Michael Flynn or Jared Kushner, were major headlines at the time. Under oath, then-Senator Sessions answered with a single word, ``no.'' We soon learned that the answer was ``yes''--just the opposite.  In March, the Washington Post reported that Sessions met with Russian Ambassador Kislyak on two occasions during the height of the 2016 campaign. Days later, the Attorney General was forced to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. In June, the press reported on a third undisclosed contact. In July, despite the Attorney General's previous assertions that he never discussed the campaign with Russian officials, U.intelligence intercepts reportedly revealed that he had done just that--discussing the campaign and its positions on Russia-related issues with the Russian When I asked the Attorney General about this report in the Judiciary Committee last month, his testimony shifted yet again; he acknowledged that it was ``possible'' he had those conversations. That flatly contradicts his testimony to me in  The disclosures show no sign of stopping. Two weeks ago, unsealed court records revealed additional Russian connections that were discussed during a Trump campaign meeting in March 2016. Then-Senator Sessions reportedly admonished those in attendance to not discuss the issue again out of fear it[[Page S7172]]would leak to the press. Just last week, another foreign policy campaign aide testified that he informed Sessions of his planned trip to Russia in July 2016. Once again, the descriptions of these communications are impossible to reconcile with the Attorney General's testimony, in which he claimed under oath that he was not aware of any contact between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.  The notion that the Attorney General is just forgetful is simply not believable. Potential Russian involvement in our elections was a major story at the time. In July 2016, then-candidate Trump encouraged Russia to commit espionage against his political opponent, Hillary Clinton, by stealing her emails. That same week then-Senator Sessions told CNN that ``people come up to [him] all the time'' to talk about Russia hacking Hillary Clinton's emails. Exactly who were all these people talking to him about Russia hacking Hillary Clinton's emails? And should he have disclosed any of these conversations to the Judiciary Committee? We do not yet know. Senator Durbin recently asked him this in a written question, and we look forward to his response.  I want another point to be clear: I have never accused the Attorney General of colluding with Russia, and I am not doing so now. But it is clear that the Kremlin tested the waters with then-Senator Sessions, as it did with so many other Trump campaign officials. It is equally clear that the Attorney General concealed his own contacts with Russian officials, and he has failed to correct the record even when given multiple opportunities to do so. I agree with Senators Graham, Franken, and others that he needs to come back once again to testify before the Senate Judiciary It is time we hear the whole story.  An important part of that story is what the Attorney General did on May 9, the day President Trump fired FBI Director James To justify the dismissal, the President cited a Justice Department memorandum signed off by Attorney General The memo attempted to justify firing Director Comey because he treated Hillary Clinton unfairly during the email investigation. We later learned there was an earlier, unsent letter that pointed to President Trump's true motivation for firing Director Comey: the Russia investigation. The day before the dismissal, the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General were reportedly called into the White House to discuss the earlier letter. The next day, May 9, they delivered their own hastily drafted memo that provided the alternative justification for firing Director  Here is the problem: The May 9 memo was a facade. It was a pretext. The White House needed to point to anything other than Russia to justify dismissing Director Comey, and the Attorney General obliged, but the President could not keep the secret. The very next morning, he boasted to Russian officials visiting the Oval Office that firing Director Comey took great pressure off of him from the Russia investigation. Two days later, on national television, the President made clear what we all knew: He fired the lead Russia investigator due to concerns over how he was handling the Russia investigation.  Here is another problem: Firing an investigator in order to stymie a legitimate investigation is a crime--it is called obstruction of justice. Whether there is sufficient evidence to merit a charge of obstruction against the President will likely be revealed by Special Counsel If so, the Attorney General may have to admit the May 9 memo that he approved was nothing but a smokescreen--an attempt to mask an uncomfortable truth and excuse the inexcusable. Prosecutors do not look kindly upon those who aid others in covering up crimes.  For many years, I sat with Senator Sessions on the Judiciary We disagreed on many policy issues, but I never questioned his commitment to the rule of law. I do question this President's commitment to the rule of law. This month alone, President Trump repeatedly directed the Justice Department to target his political opponents and chase his conspiracy theories. This is a President who needs to be told ``no.'' May 9 was one of those moments. I am greatly disappointed that Attorney General Sessions was not up to the task. This is a solemn obligation that goes to the heart of what it means to be Attorney General: ensuring that no person, not even a President, is above the law. He is not a ``Secretary of Justice,'' serving the President blindly and covering his flaws. He is the Attorney General of the United States, serving the American people. I fear Attorney General Sessions has lost sight of this distinction.  We are in the midst of perhaps the most serious national security investigation of our time. A foreign adversary attacked our democracy and our elections. We know that Russia will be back. If we are serious about preventing the next attack, we must know what happened during the last. The American people deserve answers--no more obfuscation, no more falsehoods. This starts with the Attorney General returning to the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain, in person, under oath, why he has not provided truthful, complete answers to some of the most pressing questions facing our Nation today.

333,topic-id,1271,"Mr.President, I wish to speak for a few minutes about the Senate blue slip.  As my colleagues know, when the President nominates someone who will be processed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, home State Senators receive a letter informing them of the nomination and asking whether they approve of the nominee in question. The letter is printed on blue paper--thus the name. That is why we call it the blue slip.  The question on the table is, What should happen if one or both of the home State Senators do not approve the nomination?  In previous years, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has treated the blue slip as a de facto veto, but that is not how the blue slip originally functioned. Between 1917, when the blue slip was first used, and 1955, the blue slip was never treated as a veto. Instead, it gave the home State Senators a special ability to state their objections about a nominee during a hearing. The committee could then decide how to proceed.  When James Eastland, a Democrat from Mississippi, became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1955, he took a different approach. Why did Eastland implement this new policy? No one knows for sure, but one scholar has written that Eastland, an ardent segregationist, might have been trying in part to ``keep Mississippi's federal judicial bench free of sympathizers with Brown v. Board of Education.''  We are evaluating the strength of a custom. It is a custom of relatively recent vintage, and its origin story surely matters in how we evaluate its ongoing relevance to the Senate today.  Eastland kept that policy in place for the whopping 22 years he served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary When Senator Ted Kennedy took over from Eastland in 1979, he immediately changed the status and functioning of the blue slip procedure. As the Congressional Research Service reports, Kennedy determined that the blue slip ``did not have the same power to automatically stop committee action as before.'' Rather, Kennedy affirmed his right to move forward with a nomination regardless of the blue slip.  To make a long story short, since 1955, there have been eight chairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including By my count, two have treated the blue slip as a veto; the other six have either said the blue slip was not a veto or have at least not treated the blue slip as a veto.  What to make of this history? For one thing, we often hear that the blue slip is a 100-year-old tradition. In my view, it should be equally powerful to note that the blue slip originated 128 years after the first That is[[Page S7208]]part of the Senate's history, too, and that, too, shouldn't be ignored.  But there is an even more fundamental point, and that is that even in modern times, there isn't exactly an unbroken and lengthy practice of treating the blue slip procedure as if it were a veto. The practice is even sparser when you consider that the blue slip takes on a different function depending on whether the President's party is in control of a majority of the seats in the When the President's party does not control the Senate, the blue slip is an efficient way to negotiate with the opposition party, which, after all, can vote down the President's nominees.  When you look at the relevant circumstances, here is what you find: The blue slip has been treated as a veto for a grand total of 28 years when the President's party controlled the Fourteen of those years occurred under Senator Eastland, who was waging a personal vendetta against civil rights, including with respect to judicial nominees processed by the Judiciary  So if the Senate blue slip procedure is not a veto, what function should it play? As I have said, the blue slip is the chairman's prerogative. But if I were advising the chairman, here is what I would say: The blue slip should not be a veto of a nomination so long as the executive branch has sufficiently consulted with the home State Senators in advance of making this nomination. That rule is consistent with the appointments clause of the Constitution, which establishes joint shared responsibility for appointments to Federal office.  It is important to note that, contrary to what some of my colleagues have suggested, the appointments clause does not grant individual Senators the right to pick nominees, whether processed by the Judiciary Committee or otherwise.  That rule is also consistent with the best reading of Senate custom. It is roughly consistent with the practice that unfolded between 1917, when the blue slip was first adopted, and 1955, when Senator Eastland brought about some changes. It has at least as much support in modern practice.  What counts, then, as sufficient consultation? It is hard to come up with a precise rule, with a single mathematical definition, but in my view, the White House has an obligation to let the home State Senators know whom the White House might be considering for a vacancy. The home State Senators have the right to review the candidate's record and share any concerns they have about the candidate. Qualifications count. Character counts. Home State ties and ties to the community count. I don't think home State Senators have the right to demand someone who shares their particular approach to the law necessarily, but they do have the right to insist that the candidate believe in the law as something independent from politics, particularly where the candidate is being nominated to a life-tenured position in an article III court.  There is a final point to make. As we move forward, my colleagues across the aisle will charge us with hypocrisy just as predictably as our prediction that the Sun will come up in the east tomorrow. There are two things to say about this.  First, my approach to the blue slip has remained consistent since I took office. I have followed the approach that I have just described.  Second, until 2013, the blue slip was a lot less important because the minority party could filibuster. That is no longer an option because the Democrats changed the rules in 2013. When you change the rules--the actual written protections upon which we rely--when those are changed, then you are left reliant on customs. Customs can always be changed. In this case, the custom we are dealing with isn't even a particularly strong one. It is not even a particularly long-lasting one.  More broadly, in the Senate we are trying to figure out how to process the President's nominees. We have improved the pace of confirming nominees recently, but we are still significantly behind in modern historical terms from where we should be and from where other Senates have been during the first year of other Presidential administrations. We need to find a solution to improve the pace, including by remaining in session longer so that we can complete this important work.  It is essential that we understand the difference between, on the one hand, the Constitution and, on the other hand, the rules; and, on the one hand, the rules and, on the other hand, the custom. There is a significant difference here. In this case, the custom isn't even all that long, not nearly as long as some have suggested, and it certainly hasn't been consistent. We can do better, and do better we must.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill, H.1, which really is a tax scam. Republicans are really trying to pull a fast one on the American people.  This bill would steal from the hard-earned paychecks of millions of middle-income families to line the pockets of billionaires and corporations. In fact, 80 percent of the tax breaks would go to the top 1 percent. It also eliminates student loan deductions and eradicates medical expense deductions.  If this isn't cruel enough, this bill makes it easier for corporations to ship jobs overseas, so people will actually lose their jobs. This tax plan does nothing to create better jobs or better wages or a better future for the middle class. It does just the opposite.  In my home State of California, one in five middle-income families will see a tax hike next year. The State and local tax deduction would be particularly hard on my State, where 6.1 million households will see a tax increase.  Public sector jobs, like firefighters, will lose their jobs, not to mention the vital services our most vulnerable will need. These will be cut.  This bill really is a disgrace. Stealing from families who need help the most to give more to donors--millionaires and billionaires and corporations--this is really a new low.  Thirty-six million middle-income households, working families, will pay more in taxes.

The problem with this terrible process is there isn't time enough to challenge those who say something that is false. I just want to read again what the Speaker said relating to your point.  He said this: ``The focus is on middle class tax relief. The focus is on directing that tax relief to the people in the middle and the people who are trying to get there.''  This bill is the opposite. As we discussed with our ranking member at the markup, and we challenged it, the Joint Tax said to us: Well, I think--and we will show this to you--that there are going to be millions of people in the middle class who, in subsequent years, will have their taxes increased, not decreased.  When we asked about the passthrough--picking up on the gentleman's point about the middle class--he pointed to tables which showed that the vast majority of the moneys that are going to go through passthroughs, that are going to get some tax help, the vast majority are for very wealthy people. While we don't have the final figures, it is likely that 85 to 90 percent is going to go to the very wealthy.  I think so much of what they have said is so untrue.

474,topic-id,1170,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Neal, the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, for all his work.  I want to talk tonight from the perspective of Blue Dog  Now, clearly, we all know--and Mr.Welch very eloquently talked about the needs of the middle class and people who are struggling--it is far past time that we reform the Tax Code by making it simpler, closing loopholes, and lowering rates. However, this bill that we are going to be voting on tomorrow is certainly not the answer for the middle class.  Now, it didn't have to be this way. Throughout the year, I heard from Republican lawmakers and from the White House about the benefits of creating a bipartisan tax reform plan. As the policy co-chair of the Blue Dog Coalition representing modern Democrats, I coordinated the coalition's creation of key principles needed for a permanent, bipartisan tax reform bill. Our reform principles called for the following:  First, tax reform must be passed with an open, bipartisan process and through regular order.  Second, tax reform must be credibly revenue neutral and should not use unrealistic economic growth projections to offset the costs of tax reform or tax relief.  Third, American companies need a more competitive corporate tax rate and structure in order to maintain their ability to compete globally. Congress must also account for the needs of small businesses when it comes to setting tax rates.  Fourth, and most importantly, the middle class must be the priority in this tax bill.  Fifth, Congress should use tax reform to address the funding challenges for the highway trust fund.  Taken together, I think most people would say that this is a good, sound set of principles; but, disappointingly, H.1 fails to meet these criteria.  First, this bill is not bipartisan. The Blue Dogs met with the Treasury Secretary, the Director of the National Economic Council, as well as the chairman of the committee. We were told that they wanted this to be a bipartisan bill.  But the bill was passed in committee less than a week after it was introduced and less than a day--even less than that--after last-minute changes were made by the chairman. The committee voted down every Democratic amendment on a party-line vote, and 1 week later, this bill is being brought to the floor with no amendments allowed.  This is clearly not bipartisan, and it is tough to argue that this is an open process of regular order where Members get to participate in the process.  But what about the contents of the bill?  First, it is not revenue neutral. We were told that this bill would be revenue neutral using dynamic scoring, that is, when considering additional revenue that will be raised from increased economic growth because of[[Page H9371]]the tax cuts. Some dismiss dynamic scoring out of hand, but I believe that it can be legitimate. But as we were about to vote on the bill, even the idea of having an official dynamic score of this bill before voting on it seems to have completely disappeared.  What we do know is that the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation says it will add nearly $1.5 trillion plus interest to our debt, which is currently $20 trillion and growing. The one rough dynamic score that has been produced by the rightwing Tax Foundation shows that this bill, as originally introduced, would still add over $1 trillion to our debt.  The new debt is not even used to put the needs of middle class Americans first. The bulk of the benefits from the bill favor businesses and corporations rather than individual taxpayers.  The Tax Policy Center estimates that families would only get the benefit of about one-third of the tax cuts offered by the bill, with corporations and other businesses getting twice as much. This is because of the unbalanced way in which business tax rates are lowered with relatively few cuts to corporate deductions.  But as we have heard many of our speakers talk about all of the deductions, they are going to hurt middle class Americans as they try to deal with growing expenses for healthcare, education, and childcare.  Of course, true tax reform can alter some of these provisions in order to simplify the Tax But we must make sure that, at the end of the day, middle class families' pocketbooks are not harmed by the changes that we make.  While many tout that this bill doubles the standard deduction, it is important to understand that it also eliminates personal exemptions. This means that families with children or other dependents may be worse off.  There are other examples of deductions lost that will negatively impact middle class families. We have heard many of them, including the medical expense deduction. That means that families with very high expenses, such as long-term care for extraordinary illnesses, will pay higher tax bills.  The bill also makes student loan borrowers pay new taxes on the loan interest they pay.  The list goes on.  One particularly contentious part of this bill is that it severely curtails the deduction individual taxpayers take for State and local taxes paid. Supporters of this idea claim that this deduction is an unfair subsidy from the Federal Government to high-tax cities and States, but in my own State of Illinois where taxpayers will get hit hard by this, we already get only 79 cents back from the Federal Government for every dollar we contribute in taxes. Taking away the State and local tax deduction will only make this discrepancy worse.  Now, one particularly troubling aspect of this bill is that, while it adds some new incentives to make it easier to raise children and support families, these incentives expire after 5 years, even as provisions that primarily benefit high-income taxpayers and corporations are made permanent.  When analyzed as a whole, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center predicts that any tax relief some middle class families might receive from this bill will disappear over time. Yet families in the top of 1 percent and even the top one-tenth of 1 percent will not only see immediate relief, but even larger returns in the long run.  Finally, this bill does nothing to address a major tax issue that our Nation faces: the fact that the highway trust fund that pays for Federal roads and transit projects is taking more and more money every year out of general revenue. We need to fix the highway trust fund, and if we did that here, we could also start finally doing some of those trillion-dollar infrastructure projects that the President keeps talking about.  So, once again, in this bill, the House is choosing to pursue a needlessly partisan, closed process for major legislation with wide-ranging impacts and enormous price tags. I really urge my colleagues to change course. Pursue a truly bipartisan reform so that we do well by American families and businesses that need Congress to act on this critical issue.  Mr.Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Neal for all his work on this.

884,topic-id,161,"Mr.Speaker, my Republican colleagues tell me that this tax plan will grow the economy and make American workers more competitive, but, in reality, the plan would bankrupt our future. It threatens provisions that directly support our schools and our students. By eliminating the State and local tax deductions, it penalizes States and school districts that have chosen to invest in our young people.  In my home State of California, that threatens over $750 in State funding per public school student each and every year. For Americans with student loan debt, this plan eliminates the student loan interest deduction.  In my district, over 21,000 people claim this deduction each year. As a former college professor, I know the sacrifices that many of our students have to make to pursue an education. This tax plan asks them to pay even more.  These priorities are out of sync. This is not tax reform that puts middle class families first. We can do better.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9240.txt,2111,21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM ACT,2017,14,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
864,topic-id,419,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership on this issue. I also want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Emmer) for taking a lead on this important legislation.  As an elected official, I have the opportunity to interact with individuals across my district who strive to create new or expand existing small businesses. These are folks who work hard to provide for their families and serve as the backbones of their communities.  Unfortunately, for many entrepreneurs, overregulation has stifled their ability to innovate and grow. The National Federation of Independent Business published a recent study showing that 30 percent of small business respondents cited taxes, regulations, and red tape as their most significant business problem.  While certain sectors are reaping the benefits of a strong economy, the reality is that startups and small businesses are sitting on the sidelines with limited access to credit. It is something I hear about from businessmen and -women every single day, be they bankers, retailers, farmers, doctors, and every profession in between.  We also know that many startups and businesses have historically turned to local financial institutions for initial financing. In the years after passage of Dodd-Frank, small bank lending is down dramatically, leaving many commercial customers scrambling to find other forms of reasonably priced financing.  Across the board, we are enabling a burdensome system that penalizes entrepreneurship. We need to reverse course if we want to see a resurgence of small business creation and growth.  H.2201 is commonsense legislation that seeks to reverse one impediment to entrepreneurship. Mr.Emmer's bill offers a thoughtful approach to a problem that has hindered and, in some cases, prevented small offerings across the It will appropriately scale Federal rules and regulatory compliance and will allow small businesses to access the capital necessary for growth.  More specifically, this legislation will exempt certain nonpublic micro offerings from the SEC requirements. The bill features guardrails that allow for investor protection and subjects any and all exempted micro offerings to the full suite of Federal and State antifraud laws.  The result will be a less burdensome regulation that stifles innovation and increases access to capital for startups and small businesses that comply with the parameters included in the bill. This bill is about Main Street, about the small-business men and women in each of our districts.  Mr.Speaker, I want to again thank and applaud the gentleman from Minnesota for his hard work on this legislation, and I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of the legislation.

1223,topic-id,553,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the 21st Century Flood Reform  Chairman Hensarling and Chairman Duffy have crafted a great substitute amendment that will bring about meaningful reform of NFIP and protect taxpayers and policyholders alike.  The amendment includes H.2246, my Taxpayer Exposure Mitigation Act of 2017. Included in that bill is a requirement that the FEMA Administrator purchase reinsurance or a capital market alternative in an effort to guard taxpayers against losses.  I know of no major insurance company in the private sector that does not purchase coverage to protect itself against loss of this kind. These products function well. There is no reason that FEMA should not be following this best practice as well.  The amendment also grants States and local governments and our constituents the ability to play a more proactive role in the FEMA floodplain mapping process.[[Page H9228]]  I represent the Lake of the Ozarks with its 27,000 pieces of property along its shoreline, which has dealt with tremendous mapping issues over the past several years. Hundreds of letters of map amendments were granted to my constituents, and there were multiple attempts by the community to engage with FEMA to fix their mapping process, but my constituents never felt their concerns were taken seriously.  The Lake of the Ozarks is not unique. FEMA processes 25,000 LOMA letters each year at a cost of $13 million. This should tell all of us something about the mapping process. Under this bill, areas like the Lake of the Ozarks would be able to improve the accuracy of the maps themselves, no longer beholden to Washington, D. This amendment would also create an opt-out from the mandatory coverage required for commercial properties, allowing banks and businesses more flexibility to secure flood insurance coverage that meets an entity's unique risks and needs.                              {time}  1530  It is important to note that this legislation does not preclude any business from securing NFIP policy. Policies will remain available to all businesses.  Also, this provision should not be misconstrued as a caveat to avoid the purchase of flood insurance. Businesses operating in flood plains should have flood insurance, and I am confident that lenders will insist upon reasonable coverage. I believe this should be a business decision between the lender and the business customer.  Lastly, this amendment would require FEMA to use actual replacement cost in determining premium rates for NFIP policies--language originally included in my H.2565.  Pricing for private policies frequently takes into account the actual replacement cost of a structure. It makes sense. Any insurance policy should factor in the amount of money that would be needed to replace a structure.  FEMA doesn't adhere to this fundamental of insurance. Rather, the agency effectively uses a fixed national average for insured value and replacement costs when determining customer premiums.  The result of FEMA's current practice is that lower-income policyholders subsidize wealthier homeowners.  The substitute amendment we consider today gives FEMA the flexibility it needs to stop this practice and move toward a replacement cost pricing structure.  I also want to thank my colleague from Wisconsin for including this provision in his substitute amendment. I am confident this package will allow the private sector to flourish and take risk off the backs of taxpayers while protecting NFIP policyholders.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the measure.

996,topic-id,1154,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks that my colleague, Senator Pat Roberts, made at the groundbreaking ceremony of the Eisenhower Memorial on November 2, 2017, be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Remarks by Senator Roberts--Eisenhower Memorial Groundbreaking       Thank you, Greta, for that kind introduction. And thank you      so much for your longstanding support of this project. You      have been a true soldier in the Eisenhower memorial army in      helping to get us here today.       I know I speak for all gathered for this memorable event,      when I say it is great to be here today.       First, let us reflect for a moment about a few members of      the Greatest Generation who brought us to this place today.      Ted Stevens and Dan Inouye--two giants in the Senate, who      authored the legislation to create the Eisenhower memorial.       When Ted and Danny started us down this path, it was both      an honor and privilege for me, a new senator from Kansas, to      be asked to help memorialize our most famous Kansan, Dwight      David       Then there is our Chairman Emeritus, Rocco Siciliano,      another WWII veteran. For over a decade, Rocco led our      efforts. He did so with the qualities that made him      successful in government and the private sector: integrity      and inclusion.       When Rocco called me and said it was time to pass the      leadership torch--and would I agree to succeed him as      Chairman? I said, it would be an honor, but there was a      qualification:       I called another World War II vet, a great American who      fought for our country on the battlefield, in the House, in      the Senate, and on the campaign trail as our Republican      nominee for president, another really great Kansan, Bob Dole,      who also played a key role in making the World War II      Memorial a reality.       I said, ``Bob, I can't do this without you.'' And as he has      always done when his country called, he said, ``Pat, Ike is      my hero: I'm in.''       Ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure we would be standing      here today without the support of Bob Dole who stepped in as      Finance Chairman of the memorial. He called all the former      Presidents and Vice Presidents, and asked them to come on      board. And not one of them said, ``No.''       We were hoping Bob could join us today, he is watching on      C-Span, but please join me in thanking him for his lifelong      commitment and service to our nation and to this project.      Bob, thank you.       And I know we would not be standing here today without the      support and vision of the Eisenhower family. Their commitment      to making sure this memorial appropriately captured their      grandfather, as both General and President, has ensured      generations of Americans will know his legacy.       Being an Eisenhower fan is something of a tradition in the      Roberts family. In 1952, when I was just fifteen years old, I      was with my dad, Wes Roberts, at the Republican National      Convention in I watched Ike receive the nomination      on the first ballot to be our party's candidate for President      of the United       Later, during his inauguration, I met President      When he entered the room, whether you immediately saw him or      not, everyone knew it--with that ruddy face and great smile.      He had that special charisma.       And when I shook his hand that day, I never dreamed I would      be here this day leading the effort for his memorial on the      National       After all these years, Why do we ``Still Like Ike?'' If he      had done nothing else in life, his service as Supreme Allied      Commander, savior of western democracy, should earn him the      respect and admiration of every human being whose life, peace      and prosperity that victory made possible.       But it isn't just the magnitude of his service that we      revere. It is the manner in which he served. The quiet      humility. The strength and resolve. The man was so humble      that upon the surrender of the German Army, his message back      to Washington simply said, ``Mission Accomplished.''       Ike may not have coined the phrase, ``speak softly and      carry a big stick'' but he did embody it. It was not      necessary for him to raise his voice or wave his arms to      project strength. Those were the tactics of his adversaries.       He spoke quietly. He did not make idle threats. Yet, when      he did speak the force of his words was clear.       The story of Dwight David Eisenhower is the story of      His ascendency parallels America's. At the end of      the 19th century, Eisenhower was still a young man in[[Page S7155]]     Kansas, and America was a young democracy--isolated and      protected by two vast oceans.       Over the course of his career, America matured both      politically and culturally, like that young man who left      Abilene, Kansas, to go to West       By the time Eisenhower retired from public life, the United      States was the leader of the free world and at the summit of      historic prosperity and peace.       It has taken a long time for the historians to discover and      figure out Eisenhower's greatness. President Eisenhower      anticipated problems and averted them before they ever became      a crisis. His steady hand, his quiet strategy, didn't draw      attention like the administrations that followed him.       Now, six decades later, for that kind of unique leadership,      he is considered one of our greatest presidents, which is why      we are here today.       Like Lincoln, he came from very humble origins. He never      forgot the hometown that made him, and famously said, ``The      proudest thing I can claim is that I am from Abilene'' (June      22, 1945, Abilene, Kansas).       He saw the promise that America holds for everyone and the      reciprocal responsibility to serve the country that offered      him so much.       Ike's values were America's values--strength, humility,      discipline, integrity.       Now, we live in an era where it can seem those things no      longer matter.       But they do.       We wouldn't be where we are today without them.       We are here today to ensure Ike's place in American and      world history, for his achievements both as Supreme Allied      Commander Europe and as the 34th President of the United            When asked about his legacy, Eisenhower responded, ``The      United States never lost a soldier or a foot of ground in my      administration. We kept the peace. People asked how it      happened--by God, it didn't just happen, I'll tell you      that.''       We build this memorial today not only to honor a single      person, but as a symbol for all generations of the greatness      of America and what our values have made possible at home and      abroad.       Lest anyone forget what can be achieved in the land of the      free and the home of the brave, let them come here and      understand what Eisenhower, and America, have done. And what      they, in turn, can do for themselves and for our nation's      future.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7154.txt,1983,ZACHARY ADDINGTON POST OFFICE,2017,9,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

387,topic-id,418,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to take advantage of this historic opportunity that we have before us.  As I travel across my district, I hear from families that are struggling to get ahead. I hear from families that can't make ends meet most months. They don't have a whole lot left over. In fact, 63 percent of American families don't have $500 to handle an emergency. I hear from businesses that say they would love to be able to hire, expand, or buy that new piece of equipment, but they just don't have the cash to do it.  Our Tax Code is taking too many dollars from Pennsylvania and sending it to It is sending good-paying, middle class jobs overseas and it is holding our economy back, making it harder for so many to get ahead.  This is our chance to change the status quo. We have an opportunity to jump-start our economy and let more hardworking families keep what they earn.  We rewrite the Tax Code for American job creators, taking away the incentives to send jobs overseas and dollars offshore. Putting those dollars to[[Page H9350]]work will put more Americans to work as businesses expand and invest here at home--American tax cuts for American workers with American jobs.  We give these small businesses a break--the mom-and-pop shops that employ We give entrepreneurs, who have so much innovation and creativity, a wider cushion to take a risk. We are putting more money in the pockets of hardworking families. We are doubling the standard deduction, which means that 94 percent of taxpayers won't need to itemize at all. Let me say that again: 94 percent of taxpayers won't even need to itemize at all.  By expanding the child tax credit and creating a new $300 credit for parents and nondependent children, we put an additional $1,800 back in the pockets of every family of four. That is money that they can use as they see fit. We have streamlined the maze of education tax credits, and included in my bipartisan bill are apprenticeship programs that can now be made affordable.  The taxpayers I hear from say they want to pay less in taxes, not more. If limiting some deductions and lowering your rates means your tax bill is lower at the end of the year, that is a good deal for taxpayers.

289,topic-id,1317,"Mr.President, climate disruption is the seminal challenge of our generation. It affects everything from our farms to our forests, to our fisheries. We are seeing huge impacts around the world: disappearing ice in the Arctic, melting permafrost, dying coral, raging fires, more powerful storms. Everywhere you look it is having an impact, and it is certainly an impact we need to pay a great deal of attention to because it is hurting human civilization, and the impacts are just beginning. They are going to become worse over time.  In response, communities across the globe are transforming their energy economies. They are certainly making their energy economies more efficient, from increasing insulation in buildings to improving vehicle mileage, to greater efficiency in appliances and in replacing fossil fuel energy with clean renewable energy.  How much do you know about the changes underway, about the dramatic modifications of our energy economy and the impacts of climate disruption? Let's find out. Welcome to episode 8 of the Senate Climate Disruption Here we go.  First question. Researchers predict there will be an ice-free Arctic by the summer of what year?  Will it be the year 2020, 3 years from now; the year 2030, the year 2075, or will it be 2100, the end of the century?  Lock in your answers.  Here is the correct answer. That is B, the year 2030. Researchers say that as early as 2030, the Arctic Ocean could lose all of its ice during the year's warmest months.  We see here a map of what has been happening in the past. The red outlines, in addition to the white, represents where the ice was in 1980. In 1998, less area is covered; in 2012, even less area is covered; and in the last two summers, the Northwest Passage has been free of ice, and that has enabled a ship called the Crystal Serenity to move up and essentially take tourists through the Northwest Passage, where you can see it was ice-covered in 1980. So that is a big change.  If we have an effort to address the improvements made in Paris, then, yes, there would still be ice here in that year of 2030, in an area about the size of India, but you can see it is really shrinking quickly.  On to our second question. Over the next decade, the number of U.wind energy technicians is expected to decline by 10 percent; grow by over 100 percent, which is to double; remain about stable; or disappear entirely?  Lock in your answers.  The correct answer is B, grow by over 100 percent. In other words, it will double. These are good jobs. Last year, less[[Page S7268]]than 100,000 people were employed in some manner by the wind industry, and the median pay was about $51,000 a year--a good middle-class job. We are seeing the jobs grow as the demand for wind energy grows throughout the country. The American Wind Energy Association says that in just the first 3 months of 2017, 2,000 megawatts of wind power were added, which is almost a fourfold increase over what happened in the first 3 months of 2016. So big changes are happening quickly.  Question 3. President Trump's administration released a study in November, the National Climate Did President's Trump's study attribute the major cause of climate disruption to volcanic activity, or did his study say that the major cause was natural cycle, human activity, or solar activity?  Lock in your answers.  The answer is, on this study from President Trump's team, not volcanic activities, not solar activity, and not a natural cycle. It was, in fact, human activity.  This is a study from the Trump administration. They produced a chart that looked at the temperature increase and measured how much can be attributed to human-caused activity. You can see the chart here, how much was attributed to solar--very little impact--and how much can be attributed to volcanic activity, and that was actually negative. So the Trump administration has produced a huge statement that human activity is causing the increase of the temperature of our planet.  Question 4. Why did India shut down New Delhi's schools--that is 4,000 schools--why did they shut down New Delhi's schools for several days in November? Was it, A, lead in the water; B, religious tensions; C, record air pollution; or, D, population explosion?  Lock in your answers.  The correct answer is, in fact, record air pollution. This can be measured, but you can also see it. I will put up a picture of that pollution in New Now we can barely see these people from a short distance away riding a motorcycle. The father is clamping his hand over his son's face to help reduce the impact of the air pollution on the children.  This air pollution was considered to be equivalent to smoking 50 cigarettes a day. The doctors are saying kids coming in who should have pink lungs have dark lungs--gray, black lungs. So it is having a huge health impact.  The U.Embassy in New Delhi measures the air quality by a category that is known as particulate matter, PM2.5. It refers to miniscule particulate matter of diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less. These are the very tiny particles that can lodge deep in the lungs and cause all kinds of problems in the lungs as they are absorbed into the bloodstream.  The EPA standard--the Environmental Protection Agency standard--considers anything between 151 and 200 as unhealthy. What they registered on this day was 1,000. It topped the 1,000 mark. You can understand then how dangerous that is. This is from burning fossil fuels causing this pollution and specifically burning coal.  That brings us to our final question, Question 5. What percent of American voters support staying in the Paris Agreement? This, of course, is the international agreement in which every country in the world is now involved. Recently, there were two countries that had not signed up, and that was Nicaragua and Syria, but they now have both signed up. President Trump has said he plans to leave. Technically, we are still signed up because he can't leave under the agreement until November 2020. Still, because he said we are planning to leave, it has produced a lot of reaction by American citizens and those for and against.  What percent of American voters support staying in? Is it zero; 15 percent, a little more than one out of eight; or 45 percent, just shy of half; or 70 percent?  Lock in your answers.  Well, the Yale Program on Climate Communication did a poll which was released earlier this year, and the answer is that 70 percent, 7 out of 10 Americans, say stay in. Now this support for the Paris Agreement is more than half for every party, including the unaffiliated or independent voters. It is very high among Democrats, 86 percent; among Independents it is 61 percent; but 51 percent, more than one out of every two Republicans say, yes, stay in. They also took a look at self-identified voters for President Trump, and, there again, more than one out of two, a majority of them, said to stay in.  So there you have it, folks. Episode 8 of the Climate Disruption Quiz, issues ripped from the headlines on the most important issue facing the survival of humankind on this planet.  Carbon dioxide levels are accelerating and running through the roof. The temperature of our planet is accelerating. Our planet has caught a fever, and there is no doctor for the planet. We have to address it. We have to act. We are the first generation to experience the impacts and the last generation that can head off catastrophic consequences.  We are racing with the clock. There is no time to spare. So stay engaged, and in the future, I will bring you episode 9 of the Senate Climate Disruption  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7267-6.txt,1900,SR.

824,topic-id,908,"Mr.President, our Constitution starts with those three beautiful and powerful words: ``We the People.'' Our Founders envisioned a nation with a form of government that wouldn't result in a government by the powerful and the privileged but instead would really deliver for the American people a form of government that is the foundation for every American to thrive. What a contrast that is to many of the governments of Europe that they had seen function on behalf of the privileged and the powerful.  Well, we have an issue before us that certainly is about government of, by, and for the people. It is the issue of the Children's Health Insurance Program, often referred to as This program has been expired for 46 days--46 days--putting children's healthcare at risk throughout our country.  Why isn't this bill on the floor right now? Why isn't it being passed by unanimous consent right now, or at least being debated and amended and passed? We have five States--five States--that are running out of money in this quarter. Oregon, my home State, is one of them. We are going to be out of money next month. We have another 25 States that are going to be running out of money in the first 3 months of 2018, disrupting the continuity of essential services for our little ones.[[Page S7248]]  For 20 years, the Children's Health Insurance Program has ensured that no children fall through the cracks of our healthcare system. It has covered checkups, immunizations, dental visits, and doctors' visits, assisting our struggling and low-income families who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to be able to actually purchase health services or healthcare for their children. Every single State in America--50 States out of 50--has a program. Now, they tend to operate at different levels. Forty-six States cover children up to or above 200 percent of poverty. We have 24 States that cover families up to incomes of 215 percent of poverty. So 24 States go a little further. We have a handful of States that expand coverage up to 300 percent of coverage. In my home State of Oregon, 140,000 children rely on the Children's Health Insurance  It is just not acceptable that Members of this body come to this floor to talk about how to do trillions of dollars of tax benefits for the very wealthiest of Americans while we are failing to get a bill on the floor for health insurance for America's poor and struggling children. There is a lot I could say about that tax bill. It is really a bank heist. It is designed to deliver trillions of dollars to the richest 1 percent of Americans, while doing virtually nothing for the middle class and absolutely nothing for the bottom third of But doesn't there seem to be something wrong in a ``we the People'' democratic republic when we have a bill on the floor that is a bank heist on the Federal Treasury to deliver benefits--trillions of dollars--to the richest Americans and we can't have a debate on this floor on healthcare for the poorest children in America? Well, certainly, I think it is a perversion of the principle of a government that serves the people to put the privileged and powerful ahead in line.  We have seen, certainly, many renditions of this. We have seen a broader bill, a set of bills, including the TrumpCare, zombie healthcare bill that came to this floor. It was going to wipe out healthcare for 22 million Then it came back in a different form that was kind of the fake insurance form, and it was defeated again. Then it came back as the skinny bill, and it was defeated again. All of these bills wiped out healthcare for millions and millions of America's families.  Well, now we have a tax bill coming to the floor that, once again, has a provision put in it to wipe out healthcare for millions of American families. That is why we call it the zombie bill--the fact that we kill this thing, try to put a stake through its heart, knowing that we are supposed to be here serving the people--not the most privileged, the people. That is what is in our That is the vision of this Nation, but apparently it is not the vision for those who control the bills that come to this floor because this bill has been waiting for 46 days to be addressed.  There is a bipartisan bill ready and waiting to be brought to the floor right now. Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden have worked together. They passed this bill out of their committee. It would extend the Children's Health Insurance Program through 2022. We could take up that bill right now and pass it. It had the full support of the committee. The Republicans and the Democrats were on board. So why isn't it here? Why are we disrupting healthcare for America's children?  To my colleagues: Set aside your ambition of ripping off the Federal Government to deliver benefits to the top 1 percent of Americans and pay some attention to America's children. That is our responsibility. That should be our mission. That is the purpose of our Let's get it done. Nine million American children are waiting.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

615,topic-id,706,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.4174, the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2017.  I am pleased to see the bill's sponsors and the Speaker move forward with the reforms proposed by the Commission on Evidence-Based  H.4174 aims to create and use technology to assess and solve problems; in other words, to make sure tools exist to gauge whether programs work to best serve the American people. It is about utilizing the data we already have to find out what works, what doesn't work, and what could work for some changes.  The bill requires agencies to develop evidence-building plans, key outcomes and return investment for the money the taxpayers pay, and creates the position of a chief evaluation officer. Imagine that, we have to actually create a position to evaluate because we[[Page H9291]]aren't doing it effectively now. It establishes an advisory committee to study the Commission's recommendation that Congress create a National Secure Data It includes the OPEN Government Data Act, which ensures that government aggregate data is available to consumers in a usable format.  As my colleague said on the other side of the aisle, to make the data malleable, to make the data open format so that, in fact, people can assess not just in government agencies, but out in the public what the data is saying about the programs that they pay for that we fund.  Finally, the bill also creates procedures to share that data across Federal agencies and to require protection of individual data that makes up all that aggregate data.  All of these provisions are critical to setting our government on a path toward better serving the people in this country. Washington can no longer assess quality based on how much money we dump into programs, how many people we enroll--outcomes that don't tell us whether or not they are succeeding. This can only be done with quality, accessible data.  By allowing key data to be connected and reported, we can build evidence to determine what does and doesn't work. More importantly, the American people can see the evidence of what does and doesn't work rather than just bureaucrats in  I would also like to point out how the reforms are working here to lay the foundation for government and Congress to create new policies that apply this information in novel ways.  This act, in its call for transparent, efficient, and well-designed data systems, dovetails with other efforts in Congress for transparency and sharing data.  A bill I am working on, the College Transparency Act, would do just that for student data and outcomes data from colleges and universities to better enable students and families to make more informed decisions on one of the most important part of their lives: what postsecondary education they pursue and what the outcome will be.                              {time}  1500  This bill, and my bill, streamlines and updates higher education information. It is time to utilize and make meaning out of all the data we currently have and provide that to the taxpayers.  The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act and the College Transparency Act both share a few critical goals of the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking:  First is the protection of the privacy of individuals that may be reflected in the data. That is the first priority.  Second is the recommendation that information be more readily shared across agencies. Agencies actually will share what they already know about programs.  Third is that agencies develop a strategy to share this data with the public who pays for those programs.  These provisions are fundamental to responsibly and effectively utilizing the data that the taxpayers pay for. The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act sets in motion these commonsense policies that will increase the return on investment for the taxpayers and the outcomes of our programs.  The compartmentalization of data the government already collects and barriers that prevent the reasonable sharing of it represent a significant missed opportunity for the government to provide value to taxpayers.  It amazes me that we had to create a commission to tell us to share this data. Taxpayers have already paid for it. Why aren't we already using it?  Long term, these plans are essential. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

202,topic-id,541,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak on the National Defense Authorization I must say that I am so proud to be a member of a committee so known for its bipartisanship. I am particularly proud to serve on the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee with my colleague, Vicky Hartzler, from  I am concerned that this administration is failing to confront the threats our country faces, like Russia, so I am encouraged that this bill includes a package of measures to deter Russia, including U.training and support for our European allies; a plan for additional sanctions on Russia linked to treaty violations; as well as a requirement for the administration to develop a strategy to counter Russia over the long term.  The bill also forces the same type of accountability that I have been pushing for on Syria policy for a long time, requiring the President to submit a comprehensive Syria strategy, including diplomatic, military, and humanitarian assistance initiatives.  Too often, big bills like this forget the troops on the ground, but this bill raises military pay by 2.5 percent and takes action on specific concerns raised to me and my team by requiring a study on improving opioid prescription practices as well as additional mental healthcare for those transitioning out of Active  The bill includes a provision I supported for our critical allies in the fight against terror. The Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program affords Afghan interpreters who have risked their lives--not only for their country, but for ours--the ability to resettle in the U.due to threats that they and their families face on a daily basis because they work with U.troops.  Here at home, our military families selflessly support our men and women in harm's way and provide the backbone so important to military communities across our country. That is why I led an effort to include a requirement for the DOD to examine a new Military Family Service Corps to support volunteer efforts surrounding spousal career support, career transition assistance, community integration for military families, support for liaison programs with schools, as well as families with children of special needs. By building on these efforts, we can ensure our servicemembers and their families are supported to the fullest extent possible.  Despite the important provisions included in this bill, it does come at a time when we as a Congress have forced the Department of Defense to operate under yet another continuing resolution in the absence of a full-year budget; and we are authorizing an unprecedented $692 billion in defense spending, blowing past the budget cap set by the Budget Control Act, by over $80 billion.  All the while, Republicans are pushing one of the most aggressive tax cut packages in history, set to cost our country at least $1.7 trillion. Simply put, Republicans don't know how to balance a checkbook. Ultimately, it is our servicemembers and their families who will pay the price.  As Admiral Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in 2010 and again in 2016:       Our Nation's long-term debt is the single greatest threat      to our national security.

256,topic-id,1749,"Mr.President, my colleagues, cholera is a truly awful way to die. It is a manmade disease, a man-caused disease that this world could easily eradicate from existence. You become so dehydrated, you vomit so much liquid, your body dispenses so many nutrients, so much water through unending diarrhea, that your body is thrown into shock. You literally die from vomiting and diarrhea, sometimes over the course of hours, sometimes over the course of days, sometimes over the course of weeks.  Inside Yemen today, by the end of this year, there will be 1 million people diagnosed with cholera.  This picture I have in the Chamber is a hard image to see. I will replace it with this one.  One million people will be diagnosed with cholera. Thousands and thousands inside Yemen today are dying because of this disease. There is a humanitarian catastrophe inside this country--which very few people in this Nation can locate on a map--of absolutely epic proportions. This humanitarian catastrophe, this famine--one of four famines across the world today--is being caused in part by actions of the United States of America, and it is time that we do something about it as a body.  As we speak today, the Saudi-led coalition that has been engaged in an incessant 2-year bombing campaign in Yemen is blockading Yemen, not allowing any humanitarian relief, not allowing fuel or food or water to get into the country.  The coalition's blockade has grounded U.flights. It has prevented humanitarian workers from flying in and out of the country. It has barred ships from delivering lifesaving food, fuel, and medical supplies. A 25,000-metric-ton World Food Programme ship is currently, as we speak, being denied access to the port. As we speak today, hospitals and aid organizations inside Yemen are shutting down because they do not have enough fuel to continue operating. Vaccines will run out in the country by the end of the month. Prices for food and medicine are spiking such that they are unaffordable to the majority of Because of cholera alone, 2,000 people have died. Thousands of other civilians have died because of other humanitarian nightmares, including a lack of access to the medical system.  I mentioned that the blockade is being run by the Saudi-led coalition. The United States is a member of that coalition. For 2 years, the United States has been aiding the Government of Saudi Arabia in a bombing campaign of the Houthi-controlled areas of That bombing campaign caused this outbreak of cholera. Why is that? The bombing campaign deliberately targeted the electricity grid of Yemen in and around Sana'a, the capital controlled today by the The water treatment facility runs on the electricity from that grid.  As you can read in a lengthy story in the New York Times from 2 days ago, the country no longer has the ability to treat water that goes to its capital because the Saudi-led bombing campaign has knocked out electricity. The fuel that has helped temporarily run the water treatment facility is no longer available either because the Saudi-led bombing campaign has targeted the infrastructure that allows for fuel to be delivered. So today the water is undrinkable. It is toxic. Yet, because there aren't other supplies of water, millions of Yemenis are ingesting it. They are eating food that is also toxic because of the inability to treat water, because of the flow of sewage and feces throughout the capital city, and almost 1 million people have contracted cholera.  That bombing campaign that targeted the electricity infrastructure in Yemen could only happen with U.support. It is the United States that provides the targeting assistance for the Saudi planes. It is U.refueling planes flying in the sky around Yemen that restock the Saudi fighter jets with fuel, allowing them to drop more ordnance. It is U.S.-made and transferred ordnance that is carried on these planes and dropped on civilian and infrastructure targets inside  The United States is part of this coalition. The bombing campaign that has caused the cholera outbreak could not happen without us. The official position of the State Department with respect to the blockade--which was imposed by the Saudis about a week ago--is that they should end it, at least for the purposes of allowing humanitarian resources into the country. That has not happened.  As I mentioned, there is literally a World Food Programme ship right now with 25,000 metric tons of food waiting to get into the capital to help families like this. So although that may be the official position of the State Department, we clearly aren't articulating that position to the Saudis because the Saudi blockade--which happens with U.military support--continues. Maybe that is because the State Department and the White House are simply operating on two different planets.[[Page S7191]]  While on his trip to Asia, President Trump said that he has full confidence in the Saudi King, that he knows what he is doing. Let me tell you what he is doing. He is using starvation and disease as a weapon of war, which is in contravention of international human rights law. You cannot use starvation. You cannot intentionally cause this kind of disease in order to try to win a military conflict. So maybe the Saudis do know what they are doing, but what they are doing is a gross violation of human rights law.  It would be one thing if the United States were a mere observer, but we are a participant in this. This horror--I am sorry, it is hard to see--is caused in part by our decision to facilitate a bombing campaign that is murdering children and to endorse a Saudi strategy inside Yemen that is deliberately using disease and starvation and the withdrawal of humanitarian support as a tactic.  Last night, the House of Representatives passed a nonbinding resolution making clear that there is no legal authorization for U.participation in the Saudi-led campaign against the Yemeni people. Importantly, the resolution also made clear that there are multiple bad actors in Yemen today. The vast majority of cholera cases today--I think upwards of 80 percent--are in Houthi-controlled areas. But the Houthis do not have clean hands, and their patrons, the Iranians, do not have clean hands. There have been human rights abuses and attacks on civilian targets by the Houthi forces as well.  The Iranians should stand down immediately, as should the Saudis, as they continue to whip up this proxy war between regional powers that is killing civilians inside Yemen, but without U.leadership in the region, there is no hope for that stand-down to happen.  In the Obama administration, at least Secretary Kerry was actively, personally engaged in trying to bring some resolution to the civil war inside But since President Trump took office and Secretary Tillerson became Secretary of State, there is zero U.leadership on this question. We don't have an Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle We don't have any envoy for this crisis. All we have is a President who says that the Saudi Government knows what it is doing.  That kind of unconditional endorsement of intentional humanitarian pain is un-We have stood up time and time again for human rights all across the world. We have been the people who deliver humanitarian salvation to people who are at risk of disease and famine and death. And instead of rescuing the people of Yemen during this moment of blockade, we are contributing to the deterioration of the quality of life inside that country.  The Saudi blockade needs to end today. And a partial lifting of the blockade is not enough. This morning, the coalition did say they are going to allow some humanitarian access to the ports they control, but we need access to the ports near where the majority of the population actually lives--Hudaydah and Allowing access to the ports that the Saudis control--which are not the ports where the majority of humanitarian aid flows through--is not sufficient. It will not do the job. Medicine and vaccinations will continue to dry up. Price spikes will continue to go through the roof. The cholera epidemic will continue.  We have a responsibility as a nation to ensure that the coalition, of which we are a part, is not using starvation as a weapon of war. This will be a stain on the conscience of our Nation if we continue to remain silent. I hope the Senate takes the same action that the House did. I hope we make clear that there is no legal authorization for the United States to be part of a war inside Congress has not given the authorization for this President to engage in these military activities.  By the way, the civil war inside Yemen has aided the enemies we actually have declared war against. Al-Qaida is getting stronger inside Yemen because, as more and more of the country becomes ungovernable because of this war, al-Qaida is moving into that territory. ISIS--against which we have not declared war, but we are engaged in active military activity in the region--is getting stronger there too.  So even if you don't believe there is a humanitarian imperative attached to U.withdrawal from this coalition, there is a national security imperative because we are just strengthening the most lethal elements of the extremist movement worldwide.  I know many other Members of this body on both sides of the aisle feel as strongly about this as I do. We are not going to get leadership on this question from the administration. They have given a blank check to the They have turned a blind eye to this epidemic inside Yemen--an epidemic that is getting worse by the day since the Saudi blockade began. Leadership will have to come from this body.  We need to make clear to the administration that they do not have the authority to continue to participate in this military coalition. We need to press the administration to tell the Saudis to end this blockade. We need to start using our ability as appropriators and authorizers to send messages to the Saudis that this kind of conduct cannot continue. We have tools at our disposal to lead as a Congress on this question--the world's worst humanitarian catastrophe happening right now, as we speak, getting worse by the hour inside This Congress, this Senate, cannot remain silent.

332,topic-id,708,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to highlight yet another dangerous nominee who has been put forth by this administration.  During the campaign, President Trump made promise after promise to workers. He said he would put them first. He said he would bring back good-paying jobs to our struggling communities. While he made this promise to all workers, he specifically called out miners on more than one occasion, so it would stand to reason that President Trump would prioritize the Mine Safety and Health Administration and nominate a leader who is committed to the agency's core mission.  MSHA is critically important to ensuring that mining jobs are safe and that mining companies aren't unnecessarily endangering their workers' lives and safety. MSHA is responsible for inspecting mines and holding companies accountable when they violate safety and health standards. MSHA's top priorities are to eliminate fatal mining accidents, reduce the frequency and severity of accidents, and minimize health hazards for workers through inspection enforcement.  Unfortunately, we are already seeing MSHA safety standards lapse under the Trump administration. Earlier this year, MSHA was set to implement a rule that would require safety exams of mines prior to the start of a miner's shift. Ensuring mines are safe before miners are put at risk should not be controversial. Yet the Trump administration has delayed implementation of that rule and proposed changes to actually weaken it.  Given this concerning record so far, it is so critical--absolutely critical--that the MSHA Administrator is committed to standing up for our miners. But instead of nominating an advocate for workers' health and safety, President Trump nominated one of the industry's worst offenders.  David Zatezalo is a mining industry executive who has made it clear that he cares more about corporate profits than workers. When he was the CEO of Rhino Resources, one of the mines under Mr.Zatezalo's control received unprecedented safety penalties. A Rhino mine was the first in history to be cited twice for a pattern of violations, an action that is only taken when there is a clear and demonstrated disregard for workers' health and safety.  When the Obama administration issued commonsense rules to improve the pattern of violations process, the Ohio Coal Association, where Mr.Zatezalo sat on the board of directors, sued to block the rule.  Under Mr.Zatezalo's leadership, two separate mines owned by Rhino Resources had injury rates that far exceeded the national average.  As a mining executive, Mr.Zatezalo refused to play by the rules. His company violated the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act by giving advance notice of an MSHA inspection, meaning employees had the opportunity to cover up potential health and safety violations.  Rhino Resources was sued by the EEOC for creating an unlawful, hostile work environment by allowing an employee to be targeted based on his national origin. The EEOC said Zatezalo's company allowed discrimination to ``continue unchecked in the workplace'' and cited Rhino for retaliating against the employee instead of reprimanding those who were doing the harassing.  It is clear to me that Mr.Zatezalo is wholly unqualified to serve as the Mine Safety and Health Administrator, and I believe that if he is confirmed, he will put thousands of miners' lives and safety at risk.  I am very disappointed that President Trump and congressional Republicans are once again breaking promises to workers. I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for our miners across the country and vote against Mr.Zatezalo's nomination.  Once again, the contrast with Democrats' vision couldn't be starker. Under the leadership of Senator Casey, Democrats are advocating for stronger enforcement abilities for MSHA so we can hold operators who show a repeated disregard for miner safety accountable.  I really want my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us and pass these commonsense reforms that will help prevent further mining accidents and deaths. We will strengthen our economy if we start prioritizing workers' health, safety, and well-being over corporate profits. I believe that must begin with rejecting President Trump's extreme agenda and these nominees who appear all too willing to implement it without concern for the workers and families they are supposed to serve.

From our troops on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq to recent headlines about the tragic loss of four soldiers in Niger, there are constant reminders that we remain a nation at war. And with rising threats around the world, the operational tempo is not slowing down.  We owe our young men and women in uniform leadership that fits their service. I am confident that Esper will provide our Army with that leadership. His record of service in the Army, in the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill provides the foundation for the leadership our soldiers deserve. I am also confident that he will call upon his experience in the private sector to bring a reform mindset to the many challenges facing our Army, such as the readiness crisis and the urgent gaps in capabilities and modernization.  Esper began his career as an Infantry officer in the 101st Airborne Division, serving with distinction in the first Gulf war. He later served on active duty in Europe, and on the Army staff in Washington, DC, before transitioning to the National Guard and retiring after 21 years of service. He was an Airborne Ranger and recipient of the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, and Meritorious Service Medals, among other awards and qualifications.

561,topic-id,1761,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank[[Page H9244]]him for organizing this Special Order on this terrible Republican tax scam.  This scam is a desperate, disgraceful attempt to line the pockets of the wealthiest Americans and corporations at the expense of the middle class.  And for what?  We are told the corporate and upper income tax cuts will result in more investment, in greater economic growth, which will yield more jobs and more revenue for the country and higher wages for the middle class, but that is bull.  They have run this scam twice before. Ronald Reagan passed similar upper class tax cuts and told us they would generate such economic growth that they would pay for themselves. George Bush pulled the same scheme.  What happened?  President Reagan's cuts sent the national debt--the national debt accumulated from George Washington through Jimmy Carter, which was a little less than $800 billion in 1980--from $800 billion to $4.3 trillion 12 years later, quintupled.  President Bush's tax cuts turned the projected 10-year, $5.65 trillion surplus--remember at the end of the Clinton administration, we were having surpluses, and the projected surplus over 10 years was $5.65 trillion. His tax cuts turned that, in 8 years, into $10.63 trillion debt.                              {time}  1800  It turned a $5.6 trillion surplus into a $10.6 trillion debt. So the argument that these kinds of tax cuts for the upper-income people and for corporations generate greater economic growth to generate more tax revenues has been tried twice, not to mention in Kansas, recently. It doesn't work.  There is nothing in this bill to argue that this tax scam will have a different impact on the economy than Reagan's or Bush's. In fact, this scam is so skewed toward the rich and corporations, it could actually be worse.  The bill would eliminate the alternative minimum tax. To put it in perspective, in 2005, the only year for which we have at least the summary pages of Donald Trump's tax returns, in that year, Donald Trump paid $38 million in taxes. Of that, $31 million was the alternative minimum tax.  The Republicans want to eliminate the only tax that we actually know that Donald Trump has ever paid. His taxes would have been $5 million, not $38 million, if it weren't for the alternative minimum tax. Of course, he wants to eliminates it.  Republicans will repeal the estate tax, despite the fact that the estate tax is paid by only the wealthiest 5,000 estates in the country every year--two-thousandths of 1 percent.  Wealthy Americans would also see immediate personal benefits from cuts to corporate taxes. This bill immediately and permanently cuts the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. It also cuts the rates for pass-through corporations from 39 to 25 percent.  Once again, Republicans claim this will help small businesses, but it simply isn't true. These pass-through corporations are extremely wealthy partnerships and private companies. If you need a good example, I have a great one just outside my district; it is called the Trump Organization, which is organized as a pass-through corporation.  Now, they tell us that middle-income businessmen will profit by this, but middle-income businessmen are not paying more than 25 percent to start with, so this will only benefit the rich, again.  But while billionaires and corporations will enjoy all these benefits, the Republican bill hands working families ticking time bombs. Unlike the corporate tax changes, which are permanent and indexed to inflation, every benefit in the Republican tax scam for the middle class sunsets after 5 years or is indexed to a slower rate of inflation.  Speaker Ryan brags about a family earning $59,000 a year getting a $1,500 break in their tax burden next year. Well, even in his example, by 2023, that family is right back where they started; and by 2027, they will be paying $500 more than they were this year.  This bill wipes out nearly every deduction and credit that helps working families make ends meet--the deduction of State and local income taxes, which hundreds of thousands of middle-income New Yorkers rely on each year.  When the income tax was first enacted to finance the Civil War, and when it was re-imposed to finance World War I--and we have had it since then--we have always had a deduction for State and local taxes. Why? Because you shouldn't be taxed on a tax. You shouldn't be taxed doubly. It is unfair. But now we will be.  The medical expense deduction, which families use to pay for everything from fertility treatments to nursing home care, this deduction says: If you are a middle-income family, and your out-of-pocket expenses, beyond your insurance, if you have insurance, beyond your Medicare, if you are a senior citizen, total more than 10 percent of your total gross income, you can deduct your medical expenses to the extent it exceeds 10 percent of your total gross income.  So it has got to be large. If your income is $75,000 a year, you can only deduct the medical expenses that exceed $7,500, not the first $7,500. This will be gone, too.  Now, if you have got parents in nursing homes, you depend on this. If you have got a child with cerebral palsy--God forbid--if you have got a kid with cancer, you depend on this, but it is going to be gone.  The student loan interest deduction will be gone. So people go to school, they go to college, they come out with these terrible, huge debts. They have to repay the student loans. At least they can deduct the interest on the student loans. Not anymore.  The adoption tax credit, child care spending accounts, even deductions for teachers who buy school supplies for their classrooms, all gone. And why? To pay for tax breaks for billionaires and corporations.  But, as has been pointed out, under this scam, corporations keep these deductions for their income. They keep the State and local tax deduction, but individuals don't.  How can Republicans claim this bill helps the average American when families are denied the deductions that corporations get to keep?  If this bill is so blatantly harmful to working families, why are my Republican colleagues so crazy about it?  Does it create jobs or give the economy a boost? As I said, we have tried that twice before with disastrous results. Kansas, Brownbackistan as they call it, after Governor Brownback tried that, with disastrous results, so that the Republican legislature had to increase taxes earlier this year, over the Governor's veto, to start getting out from 4-day school weeks.  Under this plan, Republicans would tax companies less when they produce goods overseas than when they produce them here in the U.It is a giant incentive to large corporations to send jobs overseas.  And if you ever doubted the Republicans were doing this at the bidding of corporate donors, well, just last week, Chairman Brady, of the Ways and Means Committee, tweaked an excise tax multinational corporations opposed and gave those corporations back $100 billion in revenue. No such change was made for working families.  Now, we know--we know from experience--that a few years from now the Republicans will use the $1.7 trillion deficit this scam creates to say: Oh, my Look at this massive deficit. We have to make terrible cuts to Social Security, to Medicare, to education, to infrastructure, not that we want to. We love We love Social Security, but we have got to savage them in order to pay for these terrible deficits which we created.  That is what they are building in now. That is what this tax bill is designed to produce.  The Republicans are scamming They are offering a facade of lower taxes that most Americans will never see, in exchange for massive and permanent tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations, and guaranteed cuts down the road, in fact, some of them right away, to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education, infrastructure.  I do not accept that deal, and the American people shouldn't have to either. We can find bipartisan common ground that allows us to support working families, create jobs, and see every American pay their fair share.  American corporations, huge corporations, have $2.4 trillion stashed[[Page H9245]]abroad, which they don't pay taxes on until they bring it home. We don't have to allow that. We can make them pay taxes on it right away, whether they bring the money home or not.  Why should we encourage them to keep the money abroad, to create jobs abroad, by telling them they don't pay taxes if the money is abroad?  And the Republican bill just makes that worse. This Republican tax scam is not a fair plan. It is not a plan to increase the economy. It is not a plan for economic growth. It is not a plan for fairness to the middle class.  Let me just say one other thing. A number of years ago, while we were told--I have seen ads--we were told by the Republican leaders that the economic growth from this bill will produce huge gains for the average family. Never mind the tax cut that the average family will or won't get.  Because of the economic growth from this tax plan, wages will go up, and the average person will get $1,500 or $1,800 or $2,000, depending who you are listening to, in extra wages.  Well, a number of years ago, we were told the same thing about a bankruptcy bill. This bankruptcy bill that the big banks pushed and all the Republicans pushed, we were told that if we passed this bill, the banks would save so much money from certain deadbeats that the average American would save $400 a year in lower interest rates.  I offered an amendment to say: Fine, mandate that the interest rates be lowered. And, of course, the Republicans voted that down.  Well, we passed that bill. We passed that bill 12 years ago. Have you seen the interest rates go down? The interest rates are still sky high. The banks raked in the money, hand over foot. The lobbyists did very well. The Republicans collected the campaign contributions. The American people did not benefit.  Same thing here. There will be no increase in economic growth as a result of this bill. There will be no increase in benefits. There will simply be a huge sucking sound as the money is taken from the middle class and low-income people and given to the superrich.  This bill is disgusting. It ought to be rejected.

563,topic-id,230,"I do have one more point to make, and the gentleman reminded me of it.  In 2004, when we had the repatriation, we told the big corporations they could bring all the offshore money home and pay only a fractional tax on it; they were going to create jobs and so forth. And what happened? They didn't create jobs. They had buybacks. They enriched their executives. They didn't create jobs.  The fundamental problem with this analysis is not that corporations don't have enough money to invest, and, therefore, if you give them lower taxes they will have more money to invest; they have plenty of money to invest. They don't see the investment opportunities, and that is a different problem. There is plenty of money to invest. They are rolling in cash. There is not a dearth of investment opportunity. There is not a dearth of investment cash.  So if you give them more cash, they will pay their CEOs higher. They will put more money into stock buybacks. The shareholders may benefit, but they won't hire more workers. The economy won't benefit; and we will be taking money away from the middle class and lower-income people, and we will be taking money away from the governments, local governments, that have to spend the money on schools, housing, health, roads and bridges, and so forth to build up this country.

I guess we just leave out Speaker O'Neill and we just leave out Chairman Rostenkowski and we just leave out Senator Bradley or Congressman The reason that they are left out is because even though it was accomplished in 1986, it started in 1982 when Mr.Gephardt and Mr.Bradley introduced the first tax reform act.                              {time}  1700  What happened in those intervening years?

This is a missed opportunity. This is a bad deal for millions of Americans in the middle class. The legislation puts the wealthy, the well-connected, and the strong, once again, at the top. Thirty-six million Americans are going to receive a tax increase.  When they talk about tax simplification, take a look at the phase-ins and phase-outs of this measure. That is hardly simplification. It is greater complexity.  Oh, by the way, the corporate rate is made permanent. The individual issues phase out after 5 years.  Consider this: 13 million people will lose their health insurance based on what Republicans are doing in the United States They are going to lose their healthcare to pay for a tax cut for people at the very top.  Let me just walk you through some of these provisions because I think that they deserve our attention and the magnifying glass of critical analysis.  We are being asked tonight to borrow $2.3 trillion to pay for this tax cut. This is from people who regularly lecture the American electorate on the need for fiscal austerity and balanced budgets.  When Barack Obama was President, the budget should be balanced. When Bill Clinton was President, the budget should be balanced. But in the intervening period of time, apparently, we don't have to balance the budget.  Also, $2.3 trillion is being added to the debt and deficits. We are witnessing what they are attempting to do because they are going to scale back the tax benefit for buying a new home by lowering the cap on mortgage interest deduction to $500,000. That is going to lower home values.  H.1 repeals the new markets tax credit. The historic tax credit that has transformed American cities is being eliminated. They beat up on the municipal bond market.  As a former mayor, I have some knowledge of the municipal bond market.  They are getting rid of the private activity bonds. Years ago, I raised the cap so that we might do more intervention and innovation in terms of rebuilding our airports across the country. Private activity bonds are a key for financing affordable housing. It is going to go by the wayside if they have their way. It is going to have a profound impact on the housing market.  They eliminate several deductions and exclusions that help pay for college education, including a deduction for interest on student loans.  Pay attention to this number. Student debt in America is at $1.3 trillion, and they are taking away the ability of students to deduct that interest on those loans.  They also impose a new tax on universities and colleges.  They repeal the above-the-line deduction for teachers' out-of-pocket expenses. You know, those teachers who, in September, might be short some school supplies and they are good enough to pack the car up and bring it to school? We give them a $250 deduction. They are going to take it away.  They create a health tax, an Alzheimer's tax, by repealing the medical expense deduction. This change basically scraps a family's ability to receive financial relief when dealing with serious medical conditions.  Think of it this way: We celebrate annually the increases in life expectancy in America--80 for a male, 81 for a female. But if we are going to celebrate that, we also have to acknowledge something else: more dementia and more Alzheimer's as people grow older in So their decision is: Let's take away the ability of individuals to deduct those expenses.  They also want to write off a very important consideration for the middle class in their ability to deduct real property tax costs up to $10,000.  Contrast this with what these tax cuts do for the wealthy.  H.1 repeals the estate tax, which is paid by a small number of families in They are going to repeal it. I guess the slogan becomes: We are rich, and we are not going to take it anymore. That is not a tax on Conrad Hilton; it is a tax on Paris That is what we should be considering with the greater efforts on their side to further concentrate wealth.  By the way, there is an issue I have worked on for decades here, successfully, because 27 million middle class families no longer pay the alternative minimum tax. But guess what they are going to do? They are going to eliminate it for 4.5 million of the richest families in They are going to take away that payment.  This is a missed opportunity, Mr.This could have been done the way Chairman Brady indicated in 1986: hearings, markups, a genuine effort to find common ground on this.  On our side, I have waited all these years to do this. Tonight and tomorrow, what you are witnessing is that they need a victory. That is what this is about. It is a victory in search of a policy.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Madam Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member of the committee for his hard work on this. He has been a great voice.  Madam Speaker, this is a harmful and deceitful bill. It is strictly partisan. We have learned over the years, if you do something strictly on a partisan basis, it isn't going to work. It is going to fall apart. It will come back to you. I am telling you, learn from our mistakes. Work with us.  There hasn't been a single hearing on this bill.  Is the public out there confused? They should be because they haven't been informed about what this bill does.  It was rushed through in 1 week. It takes more than a week to name a post office around here.  What is the deal? What is going on here? No one really understands the consequences of this bill, but I can tell you what it does.  It will greatly reduce taxes for corporate It will reduce taxes for the wealthy.  So where do you think the money is going to come from to pay for Social Security? to pay for our roads and highways? to pay for our education? to pay for Medicare? If you haven't guessed, it is going to come from the middle class. There is no other way we can pay for this.  So I will be kind and say maybe they are being overoptimistic. Maybe they don't really understand what is going on there, but don't believe it. You are going to pay more taxes. It is going to come out of your hide.  And when I sit down, the Member from Nebraska is going to say that, in my district, you are going to get $1,200 more or $1,700 more. You are going to pay more. You are not going to get more money back.  In California, 6 million people will lose their tax deductions, the State income tax deduction. What does that mean? That means you are going to pay taxes twice on your earned income. In California, homeowners are going to get hit hard. I don't see how anyone from California can vote for this bill.  Education will be more expensive; student loans will not be deductible. This bill will hurt our Nation's ability to compete.  What does that mean? It means lower pay. It means layoffs.  This tax overhaul is a big lie. We should oppose this bill and start over and do it right.

449,topic-id,1408,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, 33 percent of Mr.Knight's constituents derive a $16,000 annual benefit from the State and local tax deduction.  In the case of the gentlewoman from California, 37 percent of her constituents enjoy an $18,200 State and local tax deduction benefit.  Madam Speaker, in closing, more than anything else, this is, as I opened with, a missed opportunity.  We all know what is wrong with this Tax We could have found areas of compromise emphasizing the middle class and middle-income earners. We understand that the Tax Code that American corporations use is not competitive now internationally, but we wanted some relief for middle-income people.  So here is where the investment could have taken place. We could have begun an investment in human capital. You have heard it tonight. We should all be alarmed by labor participation rates in We all should be alarmed by what has happened in the post-war period where, at one time, it was 63 percent, and now it is 63.8 percent.  It is about technology; it is about globalization, for sure; but it is also about skill set. Eighteen thousand precision manufacturing jobs in New England go unanswered, the smallest geographic region of the country. The Department of Labor reported this week that 6 million jobs in America go unanswered. It is part of a skill set issue.  You know what else we need to be concerned about?  Two million people in America are addicted to opioids. That is what we should be concerned about as well as getting them back into the workplace through the trampoline effect, where they hit it and bounce back up into the mainstream. But that is not what we did.  Without any hearings, without any chance for the minority to participate, in terms of substance, we moved forward.  I want to say to the last two speakers, they are sincere enough. We have heard now four different people come to the well of this House on the other side and say to the chairperson of our committee and a friend: Are you going to fix this after the bill leaves here?  Four different people asked for a fix. I want to tell you, based on long experience in this House, the path gets more narrow as it leaves this It doesn't grow more expansive. It will be harder to fix these things because of the budget score that was embraced.  In 2001, we were promised widespread economic growth when President Bush took the Clinton surplus and offered $1.3 trillion worth of tax cuts. When you look at the distribution tables, they were right about one thing: everybody did get a tax cut. But then you look at those tables and you say: Let me examine who got what.  In 2003, we came back and the President proposed $1 trillion worth of tax cuts based on the premise of economic growth, which didn't happen.[[Page H9360]]  By the way, in 2004, there was repatriation, which may be the granddaddy of them all. Well, we are going to repatriate those holdings offshore at 5\1/4\ percent o the premise of job growth. And there was none.  We had this opportunity to do this together, as I described with worker participation rates, understanding that most families now are not having large numbers of children any longer. This should have been about immigration reform attached to it as well. We all know skilled workers from overseas are going to be an important part of the American economy, and we should be embracing that, along with sensible tax policies based upon some relief for the middle class.  Instead, we are taking away the ability of American students to deduct interest on their loans to pay for a tax cut for people at the top?  We are taking away a medical expense deduction for people who have Alzheimer's disease to pay for the tax cut for people at the top?  We are assessing universities and colleges a new, special tax to pay for tax cuts for people at the top?  We could have had this conversation. We acknowledge what President Reagan and Speaker O'Neill did because it was based upon good will and commonality and not needing just a political victory. Day after day they plowed through with 450 witnesses in front of the Ways and Means  How many witnesses did we have in front of the Ways and Means Committee?   How many hearings did we have on this tax bill?   We saw the manager's amendment and were given 20 minutes to review it. I don't mean 25 minutes. I mean 20 minutes. Back to regular order. We should scrap this bill.  To those who are vulnerable on the other side, I would not be trusting of the idea that these issues are going to be fixed after you cast this vote tomorrow morning. There will be an opportunity to go back and redo this if the other side would say: Let's find a meaningful path to cooperation between the two parties.  That is all we are asking for on this side: include us in this discussion so we might invest in community colleges, vocational education, internship programs, skill set training, and answer the call of globalization.  We still have innovation and creativity that far surpasses the rest of the world. There is nothing we can't answer in America without those healthy investments that we need.  Instead, when you look at these distribution tables that are proposed as to who is going to get what; taking away the alternative minimum tax for the 4.5 million families that pay it; asking students to give up their student interest deduction; the estate tax, which we are repealing; and we are asking that loved ones who have Alzheimer's and being cared for at home to give up that medical deduction to pay for all of that, it makes no sense whatsoever. But there is an opportunity, Madam Speaker, to reverse course.  In my years here, I can tell you this: Anybody who thinks that the United States Senate is going to accommodate their wishes, when they see the goalpost and the goal line of a handful of Members of this House, they are making a miscalculation.  We have heard tonight they are going to do something about state and local tax deduction, they are going to do something about the historic tax credit, and they are going to revisit these issues.  Do you know how difficult that is going to be, Madam Speaker?  That is going to be nearly impossible.  On top of that, they are going to go back and try to appeal the Affordable Care Act again and take 13 million people away from their insurance so that we can have a tax cut that further concentrates wealth for a handful of people in America?  This is the House of Representatives, Madam Speaker, not the House of We don't serve here by peerage. We are not entitled to anything here. Most of us come from pretty modest backgrounds. That is the principle we should be honoring in this tax debate as we discuss who is about to pay what and what the rewards ought to be for the hardworking men and women.  This is last note I am going to express before I yield back my time. What about those 1 million veterans who have served us honorably in Iraq and Afghanistan?  New veterans, what about them?  Are we going to eventually cut their benefits with Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and put it all on the chopping block as we attempt to further concentrate wealth in America, particularly for unearned income, by the way?  That is where we are heading.  We should honor the skills of those men and women who get up every day and strive and work hard in this country with a sense of purpose and great patriotism. That is what we should be acknowledging in this debate.  I am looking forward to tomorrow morning, when we conclude this debate and spend the 2 hours discussing more of what we have witnessed here tonight. There will be more than enough enthusiasm on our side. They will be lined up to RFK Stadium to participate tomorrow morning in this debate. That is how important this is to the future of the American people.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

453,topic-id,479,"Mr.Speaker, tomorrow we are going to be asked to cast perhaps one of the most important votes that will take place in a career here in the House based on the tax plan that the Republicans have put forward.  I say history is important, because this vote is likely to have consequences for years and years and years to come.  As I noted earlier tonight, as we look at a million new veterans from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq who deserve our care, for those of us who represent soldiers' homes and hospitals for the VA, we know just how important this is.  We know what happens to Alzheimer's patients who are going to lose the deduction on healthcare. We know what is going to happen to those students who currently write off parts of their student loans through interest deductions. We know the assessed tax that is going to go on places like the University of Notre Dame and others. We also understand that the homeowner deduction, the mortgage interest deduction, which is a huge middle class benefit, is about to be taken away arbitrarily.  State and local taxes, in some cases sales taxes, are about to be abolished all based upon the premise of maybe there will be enough economic growth.  There is no evidence, based on the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 or the repatriation that took place in 2004, that any of this is accurate, but they continue to proceed.  The next part of the challenge is they have now substituted the old supply side economics theory--remember tax cuts pay for themselves--and they have come up with a new term, and the new term that they have come up with is ``dynamic scoring.''  So we have the challenge of technology, we have the challenge of globalization, and, yes, we have the challenge of skill set across America to move people into a direction of employment where they and their skills might be aligned with the jobs that are open, because the Department of Labor this week said there are 6 million jobs in America that go unanswered, 18,000 precision manufacturing jobs in New England that go unanswered, and 1 million tech jobs.                              {time}  2000  So we should be using this opportunity to invest in vocational education; we should be using it to invest in internship programs; and, yes, we should be using it to invest in community colleges. So part of this discussion should be based on, again, the historic vote of long-term investment.  Now, we also know that is unlikely to happen because, when people have a chance to look at these distribution tables on these tax cuts as to who gets what, they are going to be furious.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Napa, California (Mr.Thompson), and then the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.Larson) will be acknowledged right after that.

303,topic-id,872,"Mr.President, I rise to speak on the nomination of Steven Bradbury, but first I want to speak on a much lighter subject, the reason that I wore this orange tie. The University of Miami football team has a perfect record. This is hearkening back to the glory days, and I will tell you why I do this.  My neighbor and one of my best friends, Cortez Kennedy, who was originally from Arkansas, was the defensive player of the year for the national companionship team in 1989 at the University of Then, he spent 10[[Page S7179]]years with the Seattle Seahawks, and he was an NFL Pro Football Hall of  I am doing this for my friend, Cortez Kennedy, whom we lost 6 months ago to a heart attack, much too early, at the age of 48. What a Miami fan he was, and how proud he would be now of his cherished University of Miami football team and the perfect record they have thus far.  Mr.President, now I speak to Steven We have seen real trouble signs lately in the transportation safety area. Last year was the most deadly year on the highways in nearly a decade. Over 37,000 people were killed in highway accidents in 2016, an increase of 5.6 percent over the previous year. Many of those fatalities were preventable and were caused by people not wearing seatbelts or driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs or distracted drivers.  We need leaders in the Department of Transportation who are willing to speak up and take action to reduce these highway deaths. We also need leaders who embrace a safety culture and ensure that defects in automobiles are quickly addressed.  Let me talk about something that is one of the most egregious defects that we have heard about--the Takata airbag fiasco. It has caused 16 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide.  This came to my attention several years ago through the Orlando Police Department in what was thought to be a fender bender in the middle of a traffic intersection. By the time they got to the driver of the car, they thought it was a homicide: Her throat had been slit, and she had bled to death. But, indeed, a Takata airbag had exploded--a defective airbag--and all the metal surrounding the housing of the airbag. The defective material exploded with such force, it was as if a grenade exploded right in the face of the driver.  There have been 16 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide. It was a fender bender for the lady in the middle of the intersection, but the airbag exploded and sent metal shards into her neck and cut her jugular.  A big, strapping, very muscular firefighter had a Takata airbag explode in his face, and he doesn't have a left eye anymore. He can't be a firefighter anymore.  These are just two that happened in my hometown of  Many of the deaths we have seen in the Takata airbags are due to pure neglect, but it is also true that Takata covered up critical defect information. Information has come to light that engineers at Takata kept it from becoming public--these defective Takata airbags--when, in fact, they knew they were defective. On top of that, the regulator--the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration--did not react quickly enough.  This brings us to the fact that we need people in the Department of Transportation who will take a strong stand for safety, and that brings me to the nomination of Steven Bradbury, who is up for general counsel. Indeed, he has had a lengthy legal career, but far too much of his legal career involved working against the interests of safety.  For almost 2 years, Mr.Bradbury represented Takata in its response to our Senate Commerce Committee and in the NHTSA investigations. Naturally, when he came in front of our committee, I asked him if he would recuse himself from all matters involving Takata if confirmed to this position because he had represented Takata as their lawyer for 2 years. But listen to what he said. He said that while he will recuse himself from Takata airbag matters, he has not agreed to recuse himself from all Takata matters, such as their pending bankruptcy. Wait a minute. Are you going to recuse yourself from the client you used to represent or not? He in essence said he is not.  In Mr.Bradbury's legal career, he has also represented several airlines in antitrust and consumer proceedings--and I emphasize consumer proceedings. It is hard for me to see how he will put that past representation aside and work for airline consumer protections. For example, if you check a bag and it gets to you late, you at least ought to get your bag fee refunded. In the Commerce Committee, we were able to get that into last year's FAA reauthorization bill, but it is another potential conflict.  Drivers and consumers need champions at the Department of Unfortunately, I believe Mr.Bradbury has not demonstrated the ability to put consumers first; therefore, I will oppose his nomination.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

943,topic-id,492,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee, my friend, for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this rule as well as the underlying legislation, H.1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs  This legislation demonstrates a commitment to my constituents and all of the American people to provide relief.  Our current Tax Code contains over 70,000 pages of rules and provisions. Within these pages are hundreds of loopholes and carve-outs that only special interests can fully understand and access.  At the very core of this legislation is a matter of fairness. By passing this rule and supporting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we will be making a profound reform of our Tax Code toward a system that is simpler, flatter, and fairer to American families across the country.  According to analysis by the Tax Foundation, which is an independent, nonpartisan tax policy nonprofit, this legislation would stimulate GDP growth up to 4 percent and provide more than 3 percent of a wage increase.  In my home State of Washington, it is projected that almost 22,000 new jobs will be created and a middle class family in my State is projected to gain over $3,000 in after-tax income, should this bill be signed into law.  This means real and significant economic growth, with tens of thousands of new jobs in my State alone, and more money staying in the pocket of central  Mr.Speaker, I have been disappointed in the dialogue surrounding this legislation from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. The accusations that this will be a massive tax hike on the middle class are patently false.  Unfortunately, these claims are being made by Federal officials right here in Washington, D.C., all the way to my State capital in Washington  In my congressional district, over 80 percent of the people file their taxes using the standard deduction. This bill actually doubles the standard deduction for middle class families and for all This allows families I represent in Moses Lake, Omak, and Tri-Cities to save more money on their tax bill without having to jump through complicated loopholes and pore over their tax preparations for hours. However, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to acknowledge that fact.  This bill lowers individual tax rates for low- and middle-income Americans and continues to maintain the highest rate of 39.6 percent for the wealthiest of It eliminates special interest deductions, expands the child tax credit, establishes a new family credit for families taking care of a loved one, and it preserves the adoption tax credit.  It allows a small business in Othello or a farmer in Yakima to immediately write off the full cost of new equipment. It repeals the unfair estate tax, which hurts family farms and small businesses.  Mr.Speaker, the American people need relief, the people of central Washington need relief, and this bill provides it. I proudly rise in support of the bill.

392,topic-id,572,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise in support of H.1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  We have worked hours--literally hundreds of hours--on this legislation, and I commend Chairman Brady and the staff of the Ways and Means Committee for all of their hard work.  Mr.Speaker, we have gone through this bill line by line. I have personally fought for policies and ideas in this bill to make sure that it works for families, to make sure that it increases wages, and creates more opportunity for folks all across  My goal in this was two-fold. Number one, I wanted to strengthen families. Number two, I wanted to create a stronger future for This tax reform package puts us well on our way to achieving these goals and achieving some remarkable wins for the American people.  I say this because this plan simplifies the Tax It simplifies it to the point that most people can file their taxes on a form the size of a postcard. It also gives significantly lower rates. It dramatically expands the child tax credit. It keeps the child care credit. It protects flexible spending benefits.  These provisions for working families are important to me. My home State of South Dakota has the highest rate of working families in the The moms and dads in my State aren't working just for fun. They are working to pay the bills to provide for their families. They need money to put food on the table and to put a roof over their kids' heads. These provisions are going to help them pay their bills, take care of their kids, go to work, and maybe, just maybe, get a little extra money that they can take their kids off for a weekend and do something fun together. That is important.  When these kids grow up, I want them to be able to find good, high-paying jobs. So I fought hard to make sure that our farmers, our ranchers, and our small businesses could thrive under this new Tax We got some pretty big wins for those folks.  In this bill, we fully and permanently repeal the death tax--that un-American, unfair double tax. W give people better expensing tools and we drive down the rate for small businesses. If we are going to make sure that our kids can thrive, we need to create opportunities for them to make sure that they can do it right here in America, and this tax reform package lets hardworking job creators do that better.  Mr.Speaker, I understand that no tax reform plan is going to be perfect in everybody's eyes, but this proposal is a strong step forward. It reflects real, sustainable policy changes that are going to let people keep more money in their pockets.  I have heard from many throughout this debate, who have spoken up against these tax cuts and these reforms--people who trust the government with this money more than they trust the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I fundamentally disagree. The American people deserve more control over their paychecks.[[Page H9351]]They have worked hard to earn that money. They have taken time away from their families to earn that money. They ought to be the ones deciding how, where, and when to spend it.  So for the purposes of strengthening families and offering folks a stronger future here in America, I urge my colleagues to support H.1.

645,topic-id,959,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 76th celebration of National Bible As I reflected on what I would share with everyone tonight, I couldn't get away from my background and my family heritage of being raised by Christian parents, who were raised by Christian grandparents, who worked hard and believed that the instruction book for life was the Word of  Bryon and I have chosen to raise our children in much that same way. In fact, when I was telling my family--we have a group text that we text in all the time with my kids, my husband and I was telling them that it was National Bible I said to them: Do you kids remember what the Junior Bible Quiz answer is? For the very first question in the Junior Bible Quiz book is: What is the Bible?  And my middle daughter, Kennedy, who is 20 years old, immediately texted back, and she said: The Bible is the inspired Word of God and is His revelation to all people of Himself and His plan for salvation. I said: Good job,  You see, because we--my grandparents grew up going to church and became very frustrated that it was religious; that it wasn't a personal relationship with the In fact, so much so, that they decided that they would plant their own church. It is the church that I go to today, that our entire family goes to today. But for a year, they held Bible studies in homes seeking God's will for their lives and what it meant to have a personal relationship with Him and to spread it to their community.  They were very poor, but they knew that everything in their life, their success, and their family's hope and future relied on the Lord's will and them being obedient to it.  Mr.Speaker, I grew up as a young girl coming downstairs in the middle of the night for a drink of water to find my dad on his knees reading his Bible in the middle of the living room. He had a bad back. He worked hard. He was always in pain, and whenever he had a difficult time on the farm or couldn't sleep because of the pain that was in his body, the first thing he would do would be to read his  Oftentimes, we didn't realize how much time he really did spend worshipping God, and reading His words to find comfort and release through some of the difficult times that he had gone through.  I remember being 13 years old and being very insecure. In fact, my mom said she worried about me. She wondered if I was going to be a young girl who would grow up proud. I didn't have many friends. I didn't think I was attractive. I didn't think I had any gifts. She sat me down at the kitchen table, and she read to me Scriptures out of the Bible that told me how God saw me; that God saw me above and not beneath; that He saw me as someone who had plans for me from the time I was in the womb. And you know what? I bought it. I completely changed my attitude and my perspective of myself that day because of God's Word that was spoken over me by my mother.  So we as a family, from the time I was little, went to church Sunday mornings. We went Sunday nights. We went Wednesday evenings.                              {time}  1845  We knew that if the doors were open on church, we were to be there, and we were to be meditating on God's Words in our lives. That is how Bryon and I have chosen to raise our kids as well. We put them in Junior Bible Quiz because we wanted God's Word hidden in their heart. I am thankful that today they still have God's Word hidden in their heart.  Mr.Speaker, Jesus tells us in Matthew 7: ``Anyone who listens to My teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock. Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won't collapse because it was built on bedrock.''  How often does it feel like we are stuck in that storm, as though the[[Page H9249]]floodwaters are rising around us and around people of faith, as though the winds are beating on our door?  It is during these times that we must lean on our foundation, the Bible, our instruction book.  It is in that Bible that God reveals how He would like to use us as instruments of faith and as defenders of freedom that show Christ's love and compassion to our community, Nation, and world. Allowing Him to guide us through His Word is the surest way to navigate any storm.  But so many times, people try to navigate our policy debates in this Chamber by fighting to change one another's minds. Mr.Speaker, I am convinced what we ought to be doing is seeking God to change their hearts, gearing their hearts toward I recognize that that takes trust, and it takes faith, but that is what we are directed to do.  It is written in Proverbs: ``Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.''  Mr.Speaker, I pray that we are being servants for God's good, that we allow Him to light our path, and that we humble ourselves enough to build our house on His firm Biblical foundation.

Congress never approved a declaration of war in Nothing could be more clear in the Constitution of the United States as to who has responsibility for declaring wars. It is not the It is the Congress of the United States of Right now, we are still financially supporting a Saudi air war and blockade in Yemen--both, acts of war. It is time to put a stop to that.  Second, we are supporting this Saudi-led blockade that is causing horrific starvation, disease, and death in This blockade has forced more than 7 million people in Yemen to the brink of starvation. It has sparked the world's largest cholera crisis in recorded history, and more than 8,000 people in Yemen have been killed and nearly 50,000 injured in airstrikes and fighting on the ground. It is unconscionable for us to continue support for this war.  And, finally, I can't say enough, America is already involved in too many endless wars of choice in the Middle The President of the United States acknowledged that we have spent $6 trillion just on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they have acknowledged that we have $2 trillion in expenses going forward taking care of the heroes who served our Nation--lost arms and legs and irreparable damage. That is $8 trillion.  Think about it. For one of those trillion--just one of them--we could have eliminated student debt in  Think about it.

These endless wars of choice, where we have inadvertently been on virtually every side of the conflicts one time or another, are so costly in blood and in treasury. It is time to put a stop to spending these trillions on these wars and start reinvesting in America, reinvesting in the American people.

I am a real estate developer. We build houses. We build commercial projects. All that stops unless reform is made in the Flood Insurance This bill proposes major reforms to one of the Federal Government's most broken programs, the National Flood Insurance  The Government Accountability Office has labeled the NFIP a high-risk program mainly because policyholders often pay premiums well below the actual risk of flooding on their properties.  H.2874 requires FEMA to conduct an annual actuarial review of the status of the NFIP that will allow FEMA to adjust rates appropriately and help maintain the program's financial stability.  Currently, there are 4.92 million NFIP policies providing $1.23 trillion in coverage to Many of these properties are what this bill defines as multiple loss properties, where NFIP claims have been filed repeatedly.  This bill requires FEMA to raise premiums on multiple loss properties by 15 percent annually if the premiums do not reflect the full risk. This is just another step toward FEMA improving the financial stability of the  Often, with the Federal Government, there are changes and agreements made behind closed doors with little or no public comment. H.2874 requires FEMA to publish an explanation and to hold public hearings in regards to any changes to premiums on policies.

Lastly, the 21st Century Flood Reform Act requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study on how we can simplify the With our country being battered by hurricanes and heavy rainfall, we need to ensure that the NFIP is placed in sound financial footing for future generations.

874,topic-id,323,"Mr.Speaker, as I listen to my liberal colleagues, the answer to every business is more government, more regulations. The American people are rejecting that.  As a small-business owner, I can tell you the stifling effects of overregulation. That is what this bill takes away. That is what this bill accomplishes.  So I strongly support H.2201, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor This bill is a critical step to reduce unnecessary burdens on economic growth and ensure that small businesses have access to the capital they need. I applaud Representative Emmer for championing this legislation.  As a member of the House Small Business Committee and a businessman myself, I understand the need of the number of challenges faced by small businesses, especially if that business wants to grow through tapping into the capital markets. Due to onerous SEC regulations, the cost of registration is expensive and out of reach for so many of the businesses wanting to expand.  We all know that the SEC provides an important function, which is to prevent securities fraud and protect the integrity of the market. However, we must be wary of a regulatory regime that fails to provide sufficient flexibility for businesses to raise capital while not providing any additional protection for investors.  The central purpose of H.2201 is to strike the proper balance between protection and investment. The bill achieves this objective through empowering businesses to sell a limited number of securities to a limited numbers of investors without needing to comply with a number of SEC registration requirements.  Also, it is important to note that this narrowly tailored exemption only applies to investors that have substantive preexisting relationships with businesses.  Finally, nothing in this bill undermines existing investor protections. Fraud is still illegal and the SEC and the Department of Justice has the authority to prosecute bad actors.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to implement a commonsense solution and stimulate small business growth.

If the House bill passes, in 2018, taxes will probably go down, taxes for individuals; and that is the blue line. Income taxes will probably go down. So far so good.  But follow the blue line for average U.taxpayers after 2019 and you will see income taxes from 2020 to 2027, the end of the time frame for this bill, go up.

As it affects the District of Columbia, this bill provides an update to indeed reflect the law regarding the District of Columbia as it is now as opposed to how it was at the time the Former Presidents Act was originally passed in 1958.

It didn't have any member of this body to draw this matter to the attention of the Instead, the D.government was run by three Presidentially appointed commissioners, and all locally raised D.funds were deposited in the U.Treasury--locally raised, but put right there in the Treasury--and the Federal Government paid the employer contribution of the pensions of D.government employees.

Thanks to the Home Rule Act and the work of this Congress, this bill would treat employment of former Presidents and the widows of former Presidents in the District government in the same manner as employment in other local and State governments.  The Former Presidents Act was intended to prevent former Presidents and widows of former Presidents from double-dipping in the Treasury by collecting a Federal pension during any period they were employed by the Federal Government or the D.government, just in case that happened. However, the Former Presidents Act became outdated with respect to the D.government after Congress passed the Home Rule Act of 1973, and it needs to be updated.  The Home Rule Act granted the District of Columbia a locally elected government.

We need a long-term NFIP reauthorization that focuses on increasing affordability, investing in mitigation, capping the profits of flood insurance companies, and comprehensively restructuring the claims process--and this bill fails these tests.  H.3823 would undermine the NFIP by allowing the development of a private flood insurance market, opening the door to allowing insurance companies to cherry-pick low-risk properties while leaving high-risk ones in the This bill does not do enough to address affordability issues and actually increases rates for some policyholders. It will allow commercial properties to opt out of mandatory coverage even if they are in a high-risk zone, which will further decrease the pool and weaken the program.  Finally, this bill simply does not do enough to improve transparency and reform the claims process. Enactment of this legislation would make flood insurance more expensive and less available, while not actually addressing the program's many problems.  I have actually introduced legislation to tackle NFIP's issues head-on. The bill is the bipartisan SAFE NFIP Reauthorization Act, which would reauthorize the program, cap premium rate increases, authorize funding for more accurate flood mapping, reform the appeals process, and cap the compensation of flood insurance companies.  I also offered amendments to the Rules Committee that would improve this bill, including a 10 percent cap on premium increases, increasing the increased cost of compliance from $30,000 to $100,000, capping the profits of flood insurance companies, and other pro-policyholder provisions, but none of these amendments were accepted by the Rules  I hear my Republican colleagues talk about transparency. In fact, this is the 50th closed rule of the year, an all-time record for closed rules. They blocked both Democratic and Republican amendments. The Rules Committee says in its report this is a closed rule. If it is a closed rule, then how can they talk about transparency or process?  Some of my Republican colleagues who offered amendments that were denied were Mr.Donovan of New York, affected by Sandy; Mr.Graves of Louisiana, affected by Katrina; and Mr.Pascrell and I, who went through Superstorm  It is incredible to me that we had a number of Democrats and Republicans who really wanted to reform the flood insurance program in an effective way based on their experiences--not some ideology--based on their experiences in the superstorms that we saw that impacted our districts, and the Rules Committee denied every one of those amendments.

That is why I was disappointed to learn that the National Defense Authorization Act conference report included a policy supported by the Senate that would have given the Secretary of Defense authority to authorize emergency access to unapproved medical products, an authority that solely rests within the Food and Drug Administration today.  This provision was not the subject of hearing and debate, did not receive the congressional oversight it should have, and I believe decisions of such consequence should go through regular order, providing Members and stakeholders with the opportunity to learn fully of the risks and benefits associated with transferring regulatory oversight of medical products to an agency that is not equipped with the expertise and medical product knowledge of the  While I am not pleased with the process and how it has unfolded, I do support H.4374 because I believe it will maintain emergency use authority with the agency that has the resources and scientific expertise needed to make decisions about access to unproven medical products. It is solely the FDA that has been charged with weighing the risks and benefits of medical products and making determinations as to their safety and effectiveness, and this legislation maintains the FDA's important role in that process.  Mr.Speaker, H.4374 not only addresses the Department of Defense's concerns about access to medical products in instances of military emergencies, but it also goes further by providing them with additional support, in this instance, to expedite the development and review of medical products that are of priority to the It also commits FDA to regularly meeting with the Department of Defense to discuss their priorities and product pipelines.  So I just want to thank FDA Commissioner Gottlieb, Chairman Walden, Senate Health Committee Chairman Alexander, and Ranking Member Murray for working to find a compromise that will maintain proper regulatory oversight over emergency uses of unproved medical products, while also ensuring that our Nation's military has access to the products that they need in a military emergency situation.  I do urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

1251,topic-id,698,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to the committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  Mr.Speaker, this amendment would require the FEMA Administrator and the DHS inspector general to certify that all claims for victims of Superstorm Sandy are addressed before this bill takes effect.  Many in this Chamber should recall 5 years ago Superstorm Sandy caused widespread destruction throughout New Jersey and many States in the Superstorm Sandy barreled up the East Coast, bringing death and destruction. Over 200 people in the United States and the Caribbean died, and the storm caused more than $71 billion in damage. Sandy swamped coastline communities. It knocked out power for millions of people and businesses, flooded public transit systems, and set neighborhoods ablaze.  Many Sandy victims have begun down the long road of recovery, but 5 years later, many victims and communities are still waiting for relief. They are still struggling to rebuild their homes and their businesses. It took years for the hardest hit communities in my district, Little Ferry and Moonachie, to receive the relief to build key pieces of public infrastructure.  In New Jersey, over 1,200 property owners are still moving through the recovery programs. Approximately 900 are still not back in their homes. Of all Sandy victims, there are over 2,000 people still awaiting final review of their flood insurance claims.  After victims faced delay after delay to start the claims process with FEMA, they then struggled with insurance companies which were and continue to be a major source of strife for Sandy victims.  Many of the residents of New York and New Jersey saw insurers intentionally paying out too little on their claims, which in many cases was not enough to cover the cost of repairing the damage. We heard stories of insurance adjusters making significant errors on reports because they misunderstood technical definitions, underestimated the extent of the damage done, or intentionally misrepresented the cause of the damage.  This is all documented.  The problems were so significant, we had to force FEMA to reopen the claims process for thousands of homeowners. Some ended up getting additional money. I have heard from many who say that it is still not enough to cover their recovery costs.  Mr.Speaker, on the heels of Hurricanes Harvey and Maria, we are now tasked with reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance To ensure these victims do not face the same troubles as those in my State, we need to apply the lessons we learned from Superstorm Sandy in this reauthorization. Tragically, this bill does not.  We should not allow companies who profited off Superstorm Sandy victims while committing widespread fraud and failing to meet their basic obligations under the National Flood Insurance Program to sell their own flood insurance.  We should not reauthorize the program without reforming the claims process to ensure technical definitions of ``earth movement,'' ``basement,'' and ``mold damage'' do not cause delay for victims receiving their fair share.  This bill should ensure that victims have the time they need to file an appeal and require FEMA to respond so victims are able to move the claims process forward.  I submitted several amendments to the Rules Committee with my colleague Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey to address these issues and the lessons we learned from We were denied a vote.  At the very least, Mr.Speaker, we must ensure that FEMA certifies that all victims from Superstorm Sandy have had action taken on their case before we make more changes to the National Flood Insurance That is what a vote in favor of this recommit would do. Simply put, it would delay the implementation of the bill until the FEMA Administrator and the DHS inspector general certified that all claims for Superstorm Sandy have been addressed.  In order to support Superstorm Sandy victims, I encourage my colleagues to vote in support of this recommit, because a ``no'' vote is a vote against the victims of Superstorm Sandy, no doubt about it, who, for 5 years have still not been made whole.

380,topic-id,490,"Mr.Speaker, for the first time in a generation, middle-income and hardworking Americans are closer to a Tax Code that works for them rather than against them.  It has been 31 long years since we last reformed our broken tax system, and, in that time, our Tax Code has become one of the most complicated, unfair, and uncompetitive in the world. It has led to a stagnant economy and sluggish growth. American businesses of all sizes have some of the highest tax rates in the world, sending our jobs, our manufacturing, our research, and our headquarters overseas.  And you know, the economic recovery hasn't been all that great since the Great Recession--not that great for a lot of Half the population is living paycheck to paycheck. Many either have or are at risk of having a lower standard of living than their parents. Young people, like my daughter's generation, will go backwards if this country is not fundamentally more competitive. And then seniors and those baby boomers preparing for retirement, who have a lifetime of savings, are now at risk without a growing economy.  The reforms in this bill today will help real people with tax cuts aimed to help middle-income families that want to save for the future and improve their own standard of living. The bill focuses on helping small businesses, Main Street Minnesota businesses with a simpler, clearer, and fairer Tax Code that is critical for job creation. It lowers small business rates to 25 percent and even provides a 9 percent rate for the smallest Main Street startups.  Modernizing the Tax Code is essential to allowing American businesses of all sizes to compete around the world and bring those jobs home. We need to be able to sell where the customers are, and 95 percent of the world's customers are outside the United The international reforms in this bill will incentivize businesses to bring their money home to invest in our communities.  And importantly, this bill includes bipartisan legislation that I authored, the Empowering Employees through Stock Ownership Act, which helps those entrepreneurs and startups attract and retain talent. Hardworking taxpayers, Mr.Speaker, deserve a Tax Code that is simpler, flatter, and fairer so that every American family and employer can file their taxes without having to hire an Army of lawyers and accountants.  Mr.Speaker, we have a choice. The choice is We can either truly grow the economy and put ourselves back on the path to real prosperity, or we can continue the actual trend we have right now of weak economic growth, which only benefits the few and the privileged and will do nothing for regular folks when the next economic downturn hits.  Tax reform for me is about one thing and one thing only. It is about restoring hope for a prosperous future for[[Page H9349]]ourselves, our parents, and, most importantly, our children.

Mr.Speaker, we are here, as the gentleman from Texas has stated, to discuss many different issues that face the American people.  H.1, which is interesting that it holds that number, because based on what we see, that tax cut will only work for the top 1 percent, so we feel that it is appropriate that it was designated H.1.  Mr.Speaker, this tax bill, cut tax scam will devastate over a period of time the working class, people trying to move into the middle class, and middle class families. Eventually, some people might see a bit of a cut, but for most people, there will be an increase.  I do not understand why we continue to think that trickle-down economics is going to work in this country. It has failed time and time again. To give breaks to the most wealthy, somehow we feel that that is going to overflow and trickle and drip down to the middle class. Sometimes a drip is very slow. We continue to wait for this economic equation to work one time in the country's history because, up to this point, it has not worked.  Why would we not allow families to continue to deduct their interest on student loans? Why?  Most of these families are fighting to get their children into college and have to take out loans.  What is it about the country that we need to tax those people?  Tell me why it is that they cannot deduct this interest.  Two of my sisters are teachers, both in education--one in alternative high school work and one a kindergarten teacher for 25 or 30 years. In kindergarten, you are looking to help a youngster become creative, find their gift. On many occasions, with the school not being able to supply things, they would go to the educational stores and buy flashcards and buy other items to enhance the children's education, out of their pockets, out of their personal moneys.  Now you are going to say that they cannot deduct those expenses that they are using to educate our children, our next leaders? Why?  Yet, if you go from a 75-foot yacht to a 100-foot yacht, you are allowed to deduct the difference. Why?  It absolutely makes no sense what we are doing with H.1. It is a billionaire's tax scam, and we need to make sure the American people understand that.  Secretary Mnuchin was on the talk shows on He said: Well, we can't promise everybody is going to get a tax break.  So they are even, finally, being honest about it.  Mr.Speaker, everybody might not benefit from this tax cut, but all of the people that they are interested in will benefit from this tax cut.  We need to be honest with the American people. We need true tax reform. My colleagues on this side of the aisle are ready to do that, but the majority continues to stifle any bipartisanship that we can have on this issue.  We need to move forward in a positive way for the American people. We need to come together in this body to help the American people. We do not need another tax cut for the rich.  In New Jersey--a State that only gets 77 cents back on the money that it pays to the Federal Government--for every dollar, we get 77 cents back in services. So we are subsidizing other                              {time}  1945  I heard today that West Virginia, for every dollar it sends, gets over $4 back.  Not to allow New Jersey's citizens and other subsidizing States--Connecticut, Maryland, New York--to have the tax break on State and local exemptions is almost like double taxing people.  I just am here to say that this is an issue that is very important to the American people. They do need relief and they do need help, but we need to do it in a bipartisan manner that makes sense for the entire country--not just the top 1 percent, but the entire  Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Veasey for his leadership on these Special Order hours.

802,topic-id,1539,"Mr.President, I wish to thank my colleague from I will not tell him what I was doing in 1986, the last time we adjusted the tax rate, but I just want to remind our colleagues today that we are in a moment of crisis in the United  Today we have a national debt crisis. I have been to this floor many times, and many of my colleagues have as well, to talk about this debt crisis. It affects our ability to do the things that we know are right to do--to deal with the victims of hurricanes, with national security, and with our healthcare situation.  Folks, we are losing the right to do the right thing.  To solve this national debt crisis, we have to do many things. But one of the ways we can deal with this debt crisis--and one of the first things we have to do--is to grow our economy. The way to grow the economy is to roll back regulations, unleash our energy potential, and, yes, finally, once and for all, fix this archaic tax system, which keeps us from being competitive with the rest of the world.  In 1986, we had the third lowest corporate tax rate in history, in the world, and over the next 15 years we benefited from that. But at the same time, the more our economy grew, the lower the tax rates were taken in the rest of the world. Today, American businesses are taxed at one of the highest rates in the developed world: 35 percent. Meanwhile, for example, Japan's statutory corporate rate is just 23 percent; Germany is at 16 percent; Mexico is at 30 percent; the U.reduced theirs in 2009 from 30 percent to 19 percent, and they are about to go to 17 percent as we speak. As a matter of fact, the average rate in Europe is just 18 percent, while in Asia the average corporate tax rate is 20 percent.  Why is the corporate tax rate so important to an American worker? The corporate tax rate we have in America is the greatest burden the American worker has today. Why? Because it makes that American corporation less competitive with the rest of the world. It also makes that American corporation vulnerable to foreign acquisitions of U.companies and then the moving of those headquarters and factories and jobs offshore.  The 1 thing we can do for the American worker is to become competitive from a tax standpoint with the rest of the world. I have lived this. I have lived in Asia; I have lived in I have worked here most of my career, and I know when this gets out of balance, and it is out of balance today. We are penalizing the American worker because of it.  It is no secret, a lower corporate tax rate would make us more competitive globally. Our tax plan fixes this. We are one of the last countries that still has a tax on unrepatriated earnings. In other words, if we have a U.company that makes money overseas, it pays taxes over there; when they bring it over here, they have to pay tax here. We are the last country in the world that really has double taxation. We need to end that repatriation tax so[[Page S7236]]that we can free up almost $3 trillion of U.profits overseas and bring them back and invest in training, in plants, in facilities, and in research and development. Our plan makes that happen.  We have an individual tax code that is 2.4 million words in length. Let me say that again: 2.4 million words in length. Wasn't that the tax simplification law of 1986? I think it was. It is 2.4 million words in length. That is ridiculous, and it is entirely too complex. We all know that. Our plan will fix this.  It is also estimated that, if we can get it enacted, this tax plan will create over 1 million new jobs because of the changes that we are enveloping into this Tax Code right now.  In addition, it is estimated that the GDP growth will be more like 3.7 percent, instead of the 1.9 percent we have become used to over the last 8 years. Frankly, I believe there is no reason it can't be significantly more.  We are getting closer to getting this done, but I realize there is a lot more to do. It is more important now than ever that we don't get bogged down in this Washington dysfunction and gridlock.  Last week, I mentioned that many Democrats supported the changes we are talking about in the Tax Code, right up until President Trump took office. In fact, over the last several years--in fact, over the last several decades--many Democrats on the other side of the aisle and people in their place before agreed.  This is not a partisan issue. This is about national security, if you want to get right down to it. It is about making America competitive again. Who would be against that? There are decades of quotes from Democrats and Republicans about this issue. This should be a bipartisan issue.  In 1963, a very famous American made this quote:       A tax cut means higher family income and higher business      profits and a balanced federal budget.       Every taxpayer and his family will have more money left      over after taxes. . . . Every businessman can keep a higher      percentage of his [or her] profits in his [or her] cash      register or to put it to work expanding or improving his      business, and as the national income grows, the Federal      Government will ultimately end up with more revenues.  That noted American was President John Kennedy, in 1963. If he were here today, I think he would admonish all of us to put our partisan bickering aside and get something like this done for the American people.  Another quote:       I think [the corporate rate] should be lowered. We should      try to get it as close to the international average as we      can, so we'll [once and for all] be competitive.  That was Bill Clinton last year, 2016.  Another quote:       Get rid of the loopholes. Level the playing field. And use      the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first      time in 25 years.  That was President Barack Obama in 2011, believe it or not. This is not a partisan issue.  There are more minority party leaders in the House and the Senate who have also come out and spoken on this point:       Today, 28 OECD countries and every other G-7 country has      adopted some form of territorial tax system--and all these      countries have lower corporate tax rates than the United      This means that no matter what jurisdiction a U.     multinational company is competing in, they are competing at      a disadvantage.  That was the current Senate minority leader in 2015. This is not a partisan issue.  Another quote: ``It is long past time for tax reform that would lower the corporate tax rate.''  That was House Minority Leader Pelosi last year. This is not a partisan issue.  This tax bill is being done under regular order, including a committee markup this week, with plenty of amendments, and it will go to the floor as soon as we can get it there for debate and more amendments.  I urge all my colleagues: Let's put partisan politics aside once and for all and collaborate through the amendment process to do something historic, something that American workers deserve, and that is to become competitive with the rest of the world again. Renew your support for the same tax changes your party has supported for years.  I want to close with another quote from an individual I have long admired, President John Kennedy, in 1962.       I repeat: our practical choice is not between a tax-cut      deficit and a budget surplus. It is between two kinds of      deficits: a chronic deficit of inertia, as the unwanted      result of inadequate revenues and a restricted economy, or a      temporary deficit of transition, resulting from a tax cut      designed to boost the economy, increase tax revenues, and      achieve, I believe--and I believe this can be done--a budget      surplus. The first type of deficit is a sign of waste and      weakness; the second reflects an investment in the future.  Again, these are words from President John Kennedy, while he was President, in 1962. This is not a partisan issue.  Our tax plan is an investment in our future, just as John Kennedy said. It is an investment that will help all  I know there is a lot of disinformation going on: This is only a tax break for the wealthy, and so forth. When the facts come out--and they have already come out; four Pinocchios have been given to those comments. Our tax plan will prove that when we get into the details.  Equally important, getting this tax plan done to help all Americans is a critical part of developing a long-term plan to solve the national debt crisis.  I am proud to serve here with my colleague from North Carolina, Senator I think, in North Carolina, they actually did this, and they had the results we are talking about here.

508,topic-id,687,"Mr.President, next to our people, the Great Lakes are unquestionably Michigan's greatest resource. They are more than an economic engine. They are more than a source of drinking water for 40 million people. They are more than a destination for tourists, boaters, and anglers from across the globe. While the Great Lakes are certainly all of those things, in Michigan, they are also a way of life. They are, quite simply, home. You cannot sit on the edge of one of our massive inland seas without feeling a sense of awe and gratitude.  Next to me is a photo of the Straits of Mackinac, a 5-mile stretch of water where Lake Michigan meets Lake Huron and where Michigan's Upper and Lower Peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac  Unfortunately, today I cannot look out at these straits without feeling a grave concern. The Straits of Mackinac are home to powerful currents. Water, at times, flows through at a volume greater than 10 times that of Niagara The currents are also unpredictable, as they can flow in any direction and can change not only by the season or even by the day, but they can actually change by the hour.  The straits are also home to twin underwater oil pipelines that are operated by Enbridge, known as Line 5, that are now 64 years old and getting older by the day. A recent study by the University of Michigan found that the Straits of Mackinac are the absolute worst possible place for an oilspill anywhere in the entire Great Lakes  Without question, there is no way that this pipeline would have been built today, but it is there, and we need the toughest protections and strictest accountability possible. To put these in place, I worked to pass bipartisan legislation to designate the Great Lakes as an unusually sensitive area, which requires the highest possible operating standards under Federal law.  Rigorous Federal oversight is critical, but pipeline owners and operators must do their part as well by being transparent and forthcoming.  While Enbridge assured us repeatedly that Line 5 is ``as good as new,'' we found out in August that there are bandaid-sized gaps where protective coatings had worn completely away and exposed the bare metal underneath to the harsh underwater environment in the straits. Last month, we learned of six additional locations with damage to the protective coatings, leaving areas as big as 1 square foot of exposed bare metal at each location. Then, on October 27, 2017, just 2 weeks ago, Enbridge disclosed that its pipeline integrity department knew of the damage that it had caused to the pipeline while conducting maintenance in 2014--3 years ago.  I share the concerns that have been expressed by thousands of Michiganders who dread the worst case oilspill scenario, and I share their frustration and their anger at being misled. It is unacceptable that damage to a pipeline running through the Great Lakes could go unreported for 3 weeks, let alone 3 years.  Simply put, Enbridge does not deserve our trust, and we deserve some answers. This is why, earlier this week, I called on the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to exercise its oversight role and conduct a thorough investigation--examine any potential safety or reporting violations--and assure all Michiganders of the safety and integrity of Line 5, if at all possible. I also joined Senator Stabenow in demanding answers from Enbridge's CEO to three very critical questions:  One, what are you doing to fix your broken reporting procedures?  Two, is there any other unreported damage to Line 5?  Three, how can we be certain that regulators are being fully informed by your company?  We need these answers, and we must get them.  I will never stop fighting to hold pipeline operators accountable and to keep our Great Lakes safe and clean. The Great Lakes are home, and I will do everything that I can to protect them for generations to come.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

949,topic-id,369,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill. When I was growing up, I am sure, like most of us here in this body, I was fortunate to be surrounded by hardworking, dedicated teachers who cared about me, challenged me, and helped me succeed.  Throughout our public schools in any State and across the country, there are teachers who are giving everything they have to help students thrive.  Carolyn, a teacher from Louisville, is a great example. Carolyn shared with me how she spends her own personal money on school supplies for students who can't afford to buy their own. To help mitigate this cost, there is a Federal tax deduction that allows teachers to get back up to $250 of their personal money they put towards supplies in their classroom, but the bill before us denies Carolyn and all of the other teachers that deduction and eliminates the tax benefits in the name of cutting taxes for wealthy international corporations.  This bill also rolls back a critical education tax benefit that allows employers to provide up to $5,250 of tuition assistance, pretax.  In practice, it encourages workforce training and apprenticeship programs. In fact, this very week is National Apprenticeship Week, and yet the Republican tax bill pulls the rug out from under businesses and workers, actually discouraging apprenticeships by stopping this tax benefit.  Mr.Speaker, I was privileged to serve, before I came here, as the chairman of our State Board of Education and school superintendent. I wanted to be the ranking member of the Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education I have really seen how important these tax benefits are to teachers and students.  I offered amendments last night in Rules to simply restore these important tax credits for children. Unfortunately, in a party-line vote, my amendments were denied.  These damaging provisions are just a small part of the overall harmful, misguided attempt at tax reform. Let us reset and let us begin a bipartisan discussion about tax reform that values education, educators, and kids. For this reason and so many others, I oppose the rule and the underlying bill, and I suggest a ``no'' vote.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

503,topic-id,1737,"Mr.President, I really enjoyed listening to my colleague from Pennsylvania talking about this new tax reform plan that has just been unveiled by the Finance He is right; this is really exciting because it is an opportunity, after a lot of talk over a lot of years, to finally fix our Tax  Our Tax Code is broken. It is broken in a lot of different respects, but one that he pointed out so well is the fact that we actually have jobs and investment going overseas because of our Tax It is the responsibility of the people who are in this body and in the House and in the Presidency to actually fix that. No one else can do it. Workers in America, including in my home State of Ohio, are competing with one hand tied behind their back because we have a tax code that encourages other companies from foreign countries to come in and buy our companies, to take our business, to take our market share, to make it harder for U.workers to be able to compete and win. So I think it is way past time, frankly, for us to fix that.  People say: Well, we haven't reformed the Tax Code in 31 years and it is about time, and I agree with that. If we go back to the international part of our Tax Code that created a lot of these problems, we have to go back to John Kennedy, who last reformed it. That means that part of our Tax Code should qualify for AARP benefits; that is how old it is. So it is time for us to fix it, and it is really exciting to finally have the opportunity.  There are three parts of this tax reform proposal, all three of which are really important. The first is a tax cut for the middle class. Why is that important? Because right now, even with the economy that is starting to grow a little bit, what is happening? Wages are flat, so expenses are up across the board.  The biggest expense, by the way, is the one the Presiding Officer has been involved with, which is healthcare. People have seen their healthcare costs go up, as well as their premiums and their deductibles and their copays; yet their wages aren't going up, and that creates a middle-class squeeze. But it is more than healthcare. It is food. It is every day purchases. It is tuition, if you are trying to send your kid to school. Those have skyrocketed. So let's do something to actually give the family budget a little help; that is, the middle-class tax cuts that are in this proposal.  You probably saw today that the middle-class tax cut alone provides, on average, $1,458 for every family. That is the median income family.  One of the reporters here in the hall asked me: Gosh, $1,500 a family--why does that matter?  I said: It matters a lot if you are living paycheck to paycheck. Maybe you[[Page S7144]]are not, but a lot of people whom I represent are, and that $1,500 will help them to be able to make ends meet and maybe begin to save a little bit for vacation or retirement or for the ability to make that car payment. So I think this is really important.  I would say, though, beyond just that important middle-class tax cut, there is something else that ought to be considered, which is, if we do this right--the way this has been laid out by the Finance Committee--what is going to happen is we are going to help to create more jobs and higher wages.  My colleague from Pennsylvania talked about this. With a relatively tight labor market, as we have more investment into these businesses, what is going to happen? Everyone says we are going to see wages go up. The Congressional Budget Office, which is a nonpartisan group, and the Joint Committee on Taxation, also a nonpartisan group, have looked at all of this. They say: Yes, there is actually going to be a benefit to workers if we do these business tax cuts, to be able to get the business rate down below the average of the other industrialized countries, rather than having the highest business rate in the entire industrialized world, which it is now, because that is going to attract more jobs and investment here and we will stop losing jobs and investment.  There are some economists who have looked at this, as well, and they agree that this is going to benefit workers. In fact, there are a couple of economic studies that show that families will get an additional $4,000, on average, per family. Again, we are talking about middle-class families who will get the benefits that are going to come from more investment and more jobs and higher earnings that are going to happen in the business world.  So it is not just about the middle-class tax cuts, as important as they are; this is also tax reform that is going right to the bottom line. You will be able to figure it out. Go online, use the tax calculator, and figure out what it means to you. But also remember that these other reforms, in an outdated Tax Code that is just crying out for reform, are going to result in additional benefits flowing to you and your family, as well, if we do this right, and we have to do it right.  There is a study that came out recently from a firm called Ernst & The study looked at what has been happening in America over the past decade or so. It said that over the last 13 years, there are 4,700 American companies that have become foreign companies because of our Tax Code that would still be American companies today if we put in place the kind of tax reform we are talking about--20 percent rate--below that average of the other industrialized countries and this international system that allows you to be more competitive--4,700 companies. Think about that.  There is other data out there that says twice as many foreigners are buying U.companies than U.companies are buying foreign companies. Why? Because of our Tax It is just true.  This is something that has been happening in this country, not just in the last couple of years but really over the last couple of decades. It is time for us to catch up. America needs to get back in a leadership position, and if we do that, we are going to see more jobs and more investment coming here to this country rather than going overseas.  Finally, the third thing this does that is so important is it levels the playing field internationally. Right now we have between $2.5 trillion and $3 trillion of earnings--money--from American companies that are trapped overseas. Those companies aren't bringing it back. Why? Because of our Tax This tax reform proposal actually says to those companies: We want that money back here. We want you to invest in We want you to create jobs here and expand plants and equipment; bring your intellectual property, your patents back here, and then send that export out from That will create jobs here, including good jobs in research and development.  That is what this proposal does as well. It levels that playing field internationally to tell the foreign companies and the foreign nations that are taking advantage of our current Tax Code: You know what, that is not going to happen anymore. That is done. We now are going to have a competitive tax code where we are encouraging money to come here to this country, and that money coming back here, invested in this country, will also raise the economic condition for the entire country. Economic growth will go up, and, again, that filters down to all of us, including every family I represent.  That is why I am excited about this. I think it is overdue. I wish we could have done this earlier, not just last year but 10 years ago or 20 years ago.  Senator Hatch is on the floor tonight, and he has been talking about this for a few decades. He has been saying that we have to fix this. He is now chairman of the Finance He can do it.  Senator McConnell is going to speak in a minute. He has talked about this for a long time. We have had commissions on it. We have had bipartisan working groups--five of them--a year and a half ago on reform, and those bipartisan working groups looked at this issue. I cochaired one of those working groups on the international side. Guess what. On a bipartisan basis, we said: We have to have this lower tax rate; we have to go to this more competitive international system. Do my colleagues know who the cochair of that working group was? There was one Republican, one Democrat on all of these working groups. It was Chuck Schumer from New York who is now a Democratic leader. So this has not been a partisan issue in the past, on the international side at least.  Let's figure out how we can come together and get Republican and Democratic support to be able to tell the workers of America: You are no longer going to have to compete with one hand tied behind your back. We are going to give you the tools to be able to be successful for you and your family so that you can achieve the American dream.  I am excited about this. Let's move forward. I look forward to the Finance Committee next week bringing it to the floor, and I hope we can have support on both sides of the aisle to get this done.  I yield the floor.

278,topic-id,562,"Mr.Speaker, last week, the President visited Asia for the first time as Commander in Chief, and took the opportunity, while on foreign soil, to reiterate his America First doctrine.  I rise today because an America First doctrine mentality will not lead to success for the United States or the world. This way of thinking is an outdated, obsolete, and dangerous form of isolationism. It will not keep us safe. It will not make us stronger economically.  Ironically, this phrase paints a picture that is blatantly un-America First sends a signal to the global community that the United States no longer wants to carry the torch of freedom and democracy which shines brighter through inclusion and collaboration.  On the national security front, the United States has the strongest military the world has known. For decades, allies have counted on the U.to step up to the plate to work with them to protect the shared values we hold dear.  As we face numerous international challenges, both old and new, we need to put more faith and investment into our international and diplomatic institutions, not weaken them. The United States did not earn its reputation as leader of the free world by standing back and allowing darker forces to prevail.  As oppressive regimes like Russia seek to undermine democracies, including our own, America's commitment to democracy must be stronger than ever.  The President's threats to NATO and the U.have caused our trusted allies to question our commitment to collective defense. We know that when countries work in concert, the chance of conflict decreases.                              {time}  1015  Despite its challenges, globalization has led to one of the most peaceful and productive times in world history. Adopting protectionist policies would stifle this progress, and certainly won't put America first.  Our efforts to address difficult domestic and international challenges are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they can and should happen simultaneously. We defeated communism, in part, by showing the world that a commitment to democracy and expanding[[Page H9183]]economic opportunity makes peoples' lives better and nations more secure. Meeting our commitments overseas also makes us stronger and safer here at home.  Standing up against the isolationist tide sweeping the globe is critical to preserving our leadership role. Take the President's decision to pull out from the Paris climate agreement as another example. By abandoning our partnership with every other country in the world, the President has put our credibility and our Earth at risk. We are now the only nation not participating in this historic climate pact.  To reassert our integrity for global leadership, we must lead by example. This includes recalling lessons learned from earlier periods of isolationism. Relinquishing ground in this area creates a vacuum which less friendly, less democratic actors are prepared and capable to fill.  Abdicating global leadership, praising authoritarian regimes, and belittling allies has been a hallmark of this This does not put America or our interests first. Our U.and NATO partnership should not just be honored and preserved, but strengthened. We are serious about taking on terrorism, cybersecurity treats, and other dangers that jeopardize the peace of our planet. Instead of distinguishing between winners and losers and sowing division where it need not exist, we must acknowledge our shared goals and values with our allies around the world, because our commitment to democracy and diplomacy is what has always made our Nation great.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgH9182-2.txt,1967,21ST CENTURY FLOOD REFORM ACT,2017,14,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,topic-id,484,"Mr.Speaker, what is unfolding in Yemen today is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. The war in Yemen has already claimed more than 10,000 civilian lives, according to the U. With this gruesome death toll as a backdrop, the UN is now warning that Yemen is facing the largest famine that the world has seen in many decades. According to Matthew Nims, the acting director of USAID's Food for Peace Program, who testified before Congress, famine is on the agenda now because the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen is ``using hunger as a weapon of war.''  Using hunger as a weapon of war, as a way to assault and destroy the civilian population, is completely in disregard of the laws of war. That weapon is proving to be brutally effective. More than 7 million Yemenis are food insecure tonight, which is a polite way of saying that they are on the brink of starving to death. As we speak, more than two out of three Yemenis have no idea where their next meal will come from.  Meanwhile, the Saudi-imposed military blockade against Yemen and the deliberate targeting in Yemen of water and sewage systems, along with hospitals and schools, have engendered, in that country, the largest civilian cholera crisis in recorded human history. More than 900,000 people are suffering from a massive outbreak of cholera, a bacterial disease that causes severe and painful diarrhea and dehydration, and which has already killed more than 2,000 women, men, and children.  The U.must act to save the people of We are implicated because we have been refueling Saudi and UAE bombers and offering weapons, intelligence, and logistical support to the Saudi military campaign, despite the fact that Congress has never declared war or authorized military operations there. We must do everything in our power to end the blockade on humanitarian assistance and to reopen the pipeline of critical supplies, food, water, and medicine to the Yemeni population.  Congress has never authorized U.involvement in the Saudi-led war. I could understand that happening in Saudi Arabia itself, where there is no constitution and where the oil monarchy governs according to Sharia law and promotes Wahhabist extremism all over the world, but this is America, and we have been enabling a brutal war which has driven millions of people to the point of starvation without any declaration of war or explicit legal authorization.  The U.Humanitarian Coordinator now says this is the greatest humanitarian crisis since 1945, and hundreds of thousands or millions of people may die if the blockade is not lifted. While we celebrate Thanksgiving, mass starvation may have overtaken Yemen, yet the blockade is still very much in force.  We must do everything in our power to speed humanitarian assistance to the civilian population, to work towards a diplomatic solution in Yemen, to stop the atrocities on all sides, and to bring real peace to the region.

I am happy to come to the gentleman's district and debate it, too, because the American people should be able to be part of this decision.  When the majority voted to throw 30 million Americans off of their health insurance plans, they went over to the White House where they celebrated like it was Mardi Gras, the Super Bowl, and Herbert Hoover's birthday all put together. When millions of middle class Americans rebelled and defeated that monstrosity of a bill, Donald Trump pointed at them and said that they had all voted for a mean bill; and he was right.  Now like lambs to the slaughter, they are about to vote for another mean bill, a tax scam written by corporate lobbyists in the dark of night[[Page H9358]]now moving through Congress at the speed of light.  While our poor colleagues grimly walk the plank for the billionaires, Wall Street tycoons, and the Trump Cabinet, who are getting ready to laugh all the way to the bank when middle class Americans rebel again this week, next week, and the week after that, and this tax scam bites the dust, President Trump can turn around again and call this monstrosity not only mean, but greedy.  This mean and greedy tax scam puts $1.5 trillion on America's credit card so the sons and daughters of the middle class can pay the rest of their lives for a gigantic corporate tax cut in a period of record corporate profits.  One-third of the windfall raining down on corporate investors will go abroad because more than one-third of corporate wealth is owned by foreign investors. That is more than $500 billion that goes not even to our own rich people but to Saudi Arabia, China, and other foreign investor havens, and it will not go to Medicare or Medicaid or other public purposes at home.  Then they move to the so-called territorial tax system so that corporate profits moved abroad will escape our normal system, giving incentive to record job flight. Somebody tell Donald Trump about this because this tax scam puts foreign jobs first.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

Mr.Speaker, we have a Tax Code that is going to, for once in 31 years, put our corporations on the multinational level across the world in a competitive position by lowering the rates and getting to a 21st century taxing program on a territorial basis.

Esper is a proud graduate of the U.Military Following his graduation from West Point, Esper served as a rifle platoon leader and subsequently deployed with the 101st Airborne Division during the 1991 Gulf war. He went on to command an airborne rifle company that supported a NATO rapid reaction force. As such, Esper has learned the trade of a soldier from the very basics, leading other young Americans in combat. To me, that is probably the best training one could have to be a Secretary of any service.  Following Esper's active duty service, he transferred to the Virginia National He ultimately retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel.  In addition to Esper's military career, he also has a wealth of public policy service, having worked on Capitol Hill as Majority Leader Bill Frist's national security adviser, as well as serving in the Department of Defense during President George Bush's administration.  Finally, for the past 7 years, Esper has worked at Raytheon, where he rose to the senior echelons of the company to serve as the vice president for Government  The U.Army is one of our greatest institutions, and if Esper is confirmed today, he will be leading an organization at a time in which it is facing many challenges. Most urgently, the Army must continue to improve full spectrum readiness while, at the same time, deploy soldiers around the world.  The Army also continues to grapple with modernizing the force, to include how best to make targeted investments in programs and canceling those efforts that are underperforming or are cost prohibitive.[[Page S7230]]  Based on Esper's qualifications and experience, as well as his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will vote in favor of his nomination to be the next Secretary of the  Esper's unique perspective will enable him to tackle many challenges facing the Army head-on, and I trust that as the next Secretary of the Army, he will do his best to lead the men and women, and their families, who serve this Nation so ably and courageously.

1158,topic-id,841,"Madam President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Steven Bradbury to be General Counsel of the Department of  Typically, the Department of Transportation has been a bastion of bipartisan cooperation. As former Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta said: ``There are no Democratic or Republican highways, no such thing as Democratic or Republican traffic congestion.'' Similarly, it has been the overwhelming position of the U.Senate that torture is disqualifying for high office. Mr.Bradbury's nomination threatens both of these traditions.  Based on his role in the approval of enhanced interrogation techniques during the Bush administration, I believe Mr.Bradbury has failed to demonstrate the judgment that would merit the Senate to advise and consent on his nomination to any post. In addition, I am deeply troubled by his failure to commit to recuse himself from all matters related to his former client, the now-bankrupt airbag manufacturer, Takata, whose products are responsible for at least 16 deaths and 180 injuries.  From 2005 to 2009, Mr.Bradbury was the acting head of the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel and was responsible for coauthoring numerous legal memos that authorize torture. During that period, enhanced interrogation techniques approved by the Office of Legal Counsel included techniques that constituted torture or cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment. We would not accept such techniques being used on our servicemen and women held in captivity by our enemies. Yet Mr.Bradbury approved those techniques and, in doing so, endangered our men and women in uniform, and that danger still exists today.  Mr.Bradbury authored four separate memos authorizing the harshest form of detainee abuse, including waterboarding and other forms of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Not only did these legal memos authorize techniques that have been deemed abusive, they provided a green light for those willing to abuse enemy combatants in U.custody.  Following the revelations of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib, the Senate, led by Senator John McCain, passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 by a vote of 90 to 9. That law prohibited detainee abuse by the military and other agencies.  However, legal opinions by Mr.Bradbury sought to provide a legal cover for the continued use of techniques that ran counter to the intent of that law. Our most respected military leaders have spoken out against the use of these unlawful interrogation techniques. A letter signed by 176 retired senior military leaders opposed the kind of torture techniques approved by Mr.Bradbury's Office of Legal  Having had the privilege to serve in the Army of the United States, I believe they did this because they understood if we did it, our enemies would do it with even more gusto to our men and women, and it would be unconscionable to give them even a shred of credibility to point to and say: We are simply doing what you did to others.  Retired Marine Charles Krulak wrote in opposition to the Bradbury nomination, saying that the use of techniques approved by Mr.Bradbury ``not only violated well-established law and military doctrine, but also endangered U.troops and personnel, hindered the war effort, and betrayed the country's values, damaging the United States' stature around the world as a beacon of human rights and the rule of law.''  That is the voice of one marine, speaking from years of experience in combat, not simply to defend our ideals but to defend those men and women who serve today in uniform.  Secretary of Defense Mattis has expressed his full support for the Army Field Manual as the single standard for all U.military interrogations and has advised President Trump that such enhanced interrogation techniques are not needed to keep our country safe.  Under Mr.Bradbury's direction, DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel approved opinions on enhanced interrogation techniques that appear intended to meet the political inclinations of the White House rather than the intent of U.laws against such cruelty. Someone who has justified the use of torture, in spite of an act of Congress, should not be allowed to hold a position of responsibility in the U.Indeed, it is for that reason that this body refused to approve Mr.Bradbury as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel in 2008.  If approved as the General Counsel of the Department of Transportation, Mr.Bradbury would again be called upon to render legal opinions that require sound and independent judgment. Even forgetting for a moment his history of bending to the political desires of a strong-willed White House, his refusal to completely recuse himself from matters relating to his former client, Takata, means he would enter this office with a cloud of potential conflicts around him.  Public service is not an entitlement but a privilege. For Mr.Bradbury, the revolving door should swing shut. His lack of judgment at a critical time in the Nation's history has disqualified him from the privilege of holding high office in the current or any future administration.  Surely the American people deserve someone who reflects our national values and has demonstrated much better judgment than Mr. With that, I yield the floor.

She didn't come to the urban areas, although she passed through, but she went to the rural areas, talked to middle-income families to figure out how flood insurance reform would hurt them.[[Page H9233]]  What she found out is that it was going to cause more families to just turn in the keys to their house and give their homes back to the mortgage company or declare bankruptcy so that they can just get by.

254,topic-id,766,"Mr.President, thank you. I rise to speak about the tax reform issue and the tax reform effort that is front and center for this Congress and for all Particularly, I want to point out the fact that Congress has not undertaken this difficult task for over 30 years, and for anyone who has been involved in this, they now realize how difficult it really is.  In the years since the last major overhaul, Congress has, by patchwork, added numerous carve-outs and special interests, passed short-term tax extenders, which have made planning for families and businesses very difficult, and has generally contributed to a tax code that today is extremely complex, burdensome, and unpredictable.  My colleague from Idaho Senator Crapo has stated that we couldn't have done worse if we had set out intentionally to do worse. Many of my colleagues and I have heard story after story from our constituents who have said the same thing. The Tax Code makes it hard for families and businesses, especially small businesses, to comply and plan ahead, let alone grow and prosper. This conversation hasn't gone away, so clearly the system, as it stands, is not serving the American people as it should.  It is imperative for the continued growth of the American economy that[[Page S7190]]we simplify the system, reduce complexity, and create certainty. Tax reform will bring relief to American families. Under the plan released by the Senate Finance Committee, middle-class Americans will see a benefit in the form of a lower tax bill, which means more money for households to bring home. In addition to keeping more money in the pockets of hard-working Americans, the Senate plan nearly doubles the standard deduction, increases the child tax credit to help families with the very real costs associated with raising a family, and preserves an existing tax credit to help care for elderly family members. This tax plan would also make it easier for individuals and families to avoid a time-consuming and expensive tax-filing nightmare by simplifying the Tax Code and eliminating deductions.  The aim of this entire exercise is to make the Tax Code simpler, fairer, and easier to comply with, reducing the burden on taxpayers and creating an environment that enables families and businesses to thrive.  Tax reform will help grow small businesses. As chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, I have focused on highlighting small business issues in this tax reform process. The ranking member, Senator Shaheen, and I held a bipartisan hearing in June to talk about tax policies that would most benefit small businesses across the country. As a result, we sent a bipartisan letter to the Senate Finance Committee, which was drawing this bill, to outline the policies we determined were most important. The topline issue was the need to address the individual Tax Code along with the corporate Tax Most of the Nation's small businesses are organized in a way that they pay taxes through the individual code. It is amazing they managed to create the majority of new jobs in America, despite facing this higher tax rate, with the added burden of spending time and money away from businesses to comply with this complex Tax Thankfully, Ranking Member Shaheen and I are not the only ones who heard this message, and lower rates for small businesses is part of this conversation.  Small businesses have identified tax policies that work for them, along with changes that could be made to help more of them across the country. Two of the examples are the cash method of accounting and section 179 expensing. Cash method accounting is a simpler way for small businesses to keep their books, and section 179 expensing allows small businesses to immediately deduct the cost of investing in their business up to a certain amount. Both of these commonsense policies will reach more business owners in tax reform.  I am encouraged by the plan the Senate Finance Committee released last week and the process they are undertaking this week to move this bill forward. With tax reform, we have a real opportunity to make changes that will have a tangible, positive impact on the American people and create an environment for our Nation's job creators to prosper. I am excited to see the kind of job creation that will result from the changes we are considering, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to make this a reality.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1268,topic-id,568,"Mr.President, today I wish to take the opportunity to highlight the innovation and the creative spirit that small businesses in my home State of Idaho are known for. The small business that I am honoring today goes above and beyond when it comes to embodying that spirit. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my pleasure to recognize Krehbiel's Sales & Service as the Senate Small Business of the Month for November 2017. Known for their passion, friendliness, and dedication to providing unparalleled service, Krehbiel's is the definition of what it means to be a family-owned small business in  Clint Krehbiel and his son Terry Krehbiel opened the doors to their vehicle dealership in Aberdeen, ID, in 1972 while Terry was still in high school. They have been proudly serving southeast Idaho for the past 45 years. The Krehbiel family specializes in off-road recreational and utility vehicles, along with various brands of lawn care equipment. In addition to these products, they have expanded into several other businesses, ranging from swimming pools to satellite sales and installation.  Terry and his wife, Valerie, bought Clint's share of the business when he retired in 1996 and have made it their life's work to carry out the principles of honest and ethical business that Clint passed down over the years. For the past four-and-a-half decades, the family's commitment to their mission has been unwavering, and their loyalty to their customers is second to none. Perhaps the most incredible display of their dedication can be seen in the expansion of their business to serve customers hundreds of miles away while still maintaining a high level of customer service and a close-knit team of employees. At any time, you can walk in and see Karalee Krehbiel-Bonzon, Terry and Valerie's daughter, providing the exceptional customer service that she has been known for ever since she started working at her family's business in 2007. You will also see Valerie doing the bookkeeping by hand, as she has done every day since 1980. Another long-time employee is mechanic Charlie Charlie was hired in 1987 and is still with the business to this day. He has been an integral part of building and maintaining good relationships with customers and in training other mechanics like the team's newest member, Tyler  Customer service is not the only thing that Krehbiel's is known for. With over 60 years of combined experience, their factory-trained technicians have built a reputation for high-quality, dependable repairs for all manner of recreational and utility vehicles. The company's reputation in this area brings in customers from miles around who have never bought a vehicle from the Krehbiels but who have built a bond of trust with their well-qualified mechanics.  Aberdeen is considered to be ``off the beaten path'' by most people. Many say you need to have a reason to go there. Terry and Valerie, along with their employees, have given many people a reason to do just that. A continuous entrepreneurial spirit, quality customer service, and strong relationships with long-time employees are all principles possessed by the I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations to Terry and Valerie Krehbiel and all of the employees of Krehbiel's Sales & Service for being selected as the November 2017 Small Business of the You make our great State proud, and I look forward to watching your continued growth and success.[[Page S7213]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgS7212-2.txt,1896,PAYING TRIBUTE TO AMINA OKUYEVA,2017,14,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1183,topic-id,476,"Mr.Speaker, on his recent trip to Asia, President Trump reminded us and our international trading partners that our commercial agreements must be honest, fair, and reciprocal. With this admonition, he called on our Asian friends to build automobile plants that would employ American workers. Three cheers for him for doing that.  The United States already has experienced the benefits and the liabilities of foreign-controlled multinational automobile companies manufacturing in our country. These companies have provided good jobs for America's working people, but having these foreign companies here hasn't always worked.  A few years ago, we discovered that one of the world's preeminent car manufacturers, Volkswagen Group of America, had engaged in an illegal and clandestine strategy to circumvent U.emissions laws.  Volkswagen has a longstanding relationship with the American people. Like so many young people in my generation, my first car was a Volkswagen Beetle, so Volkswagen enjoyed an enormous goodwill in our country. Despite that, Volkswagen Group of America intentionally did us wrong. Volkswagen intentionally violated our emissions regulations and, by many accounts, they even engineered their systems to falsely indicate that they were complying with the emissions standards.  This was nothing more than pure arrogance and a hostile intent and an egregious violation of our best legislative efforts to regulate our way to clean air. Unfortunately, this issue with Volkswagen has not been totally dealt with and put behind us.  The deal with the German Government that got them off the hook remains cloaked in mystery and left many questions unanswered. We do not know yet, for example, whether Volkswagen will compensate Americans in a full and just manner. Those uncompensated Americans may include the owners of the bogusly engineered cars, as well as auto importers, as well as, perhaps, service stations who officially were authorized to repair  Mr.Speaker, the VW deal between the Obama administration and the Merkel government needs to be revisited with a full airing of the details. We need to know if Volkswagen has complied fully and if the settlement was demonstrably fair to Americans who relied on their good faith.  Wolfgang Porsche, the family who owns 52 percent of Volkswagen, he was the chairman during this time of the emissions scandal; as well as Matthias Mueller, the CEO of Volkswagen Group, they need to be put on the record about what the details of this subterfuge of American law was all about.  We need to send a message also. By putting them on the record, we need to send a message to all the multinational corporation executives who, when they do business in the United States of America, have to play by our rules.  I applaud the President for trying to encourage people to invest in building factories here, but that means all of us must make sure that that works out for the best for the American people.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9257-4.txt,979,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
370,topic-id,438,"Mr.Speaker, my friend from Massachusetts said this is a missed opportunity. This is no missed opportunity. What we are witnessing is the seizing of an opportunity.  During the debate, our friends on the other side of the aisle, in 25 hours of markup last week, offered amendment after amendment after amendment. I think it was about 25 amendments.  Do you know what every one of the amendments did, Mr.Speaker? It restored the status quo. It put something back in, put another thing back in, defended something else, and so forth. There was no comprehensive offer of an amendment in the nature of a substitute that would have been transformational.  There is no exclusion here. We debated. We are now here, and for the first time since 1986, we are on the cusp of seizing an opportunity and having a transformational moment.  Here is the transformation:[[Page H9347]]  When the Tax Code was last amended 30 years ago--think about it--the internet didn't exist as a commercial enterprise. Yes, it has fully developed, and we have got a Tax Code that was built for yesterday.  The global nature of supply chains were nowhere nearly as intricately interlinked, yet we have got a Tax Code that was built for yesterday.  The shared economy--Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, all of those things--didn't exist, yet we have got a Tax Code that was built for yesterday.  Who does the status quo benefit, Mr.Speaker? It benefits the few. It benefits the privileged. It benefits the folks at the top of the economic scale of things.  So what this is doing is proposing a very different approach. It says we are going to make the United States the most competitive jurisdiction in the world by giving business tax relief and welcoming back commercial enterprise and growth and prosperity and ingenuity and investment--that does what? It creates paychecks and it expands opportunities.  Kids graduated from college shouldn't have to grub around piecing together two jobs and living in their parents' basement. How absurd. We can do much better. We are the biggest, best economy in the world, and it is time we acted like it.  This is transformational. To lean back and away from this and say, oh, this Tax Code is a natural disaster; it is too big and too overwhelming and we can't deal with it is nonsense. We fundamentally reject that.  We are going to be measured in the future, Mr.Speaker, by this moment. I thank Chairman Brady for his leadership in creating this crescendo, because now is the time to act. Let's not defend the status quo. Let's move forward, and let's transform this economy.

751,topic-id,602,"Mr.Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill, H.2874.  Homeowners deserve choice; they deserve competition; and, above all, they need to know the true risk their homes face from floods, the most costly of all natural disasters.  I believe the underlying bill allows the freedom to insure against obvious danger that imperils people's homes and their wallets. I am particularly enthusiastic about the inclusion of my bipartisan legislation to facilitate the development of a robust private flood insurance marketplace.  After months and even years of negotiations, we have produced legislation that appropriately balances the need for affordable flood insurance with our responsibility to act as faithful stewards of taxpayer dollars.  Everyone knows that the National Flood Insurance Program is broken. We should act accordingly. We need to fix it. But before we do that, we must agree to proceed.  Less than a month ago, many of us voted to bail out this floundering program, forgiving $16 billion of its debt. But we knew that it would be irresponsible to merely kick the can down the road. This is the opportunity to make things right.  I believe we need to proceed with the debate because we need to have a reasonable and responsible conversation about fixing this problem before it gets worse. Americans deserve better than a Big Government insurance monopoly that is unable to pay for the risk it insures.  The 21st Century Flood Reform Act will usher in a new era of consumer choice, competition, and affordability by empowering policyholders to purchase the insurance products that best meet their needs.  We are getting rid of the top-down, single-payer approach to insurance where we pretend there is no danger until there is a tragedy.  Giving consumers choice in a competitive marketplace will not only drive down costs, but will also help reduce the unacceptable number of homes that are not protected by flood insurance.  The NFIP can be an important tool for mitigating flood risks and helping families recover from disasters after they strike, but it cannot be the only tool. A Federal program that conceals actual risk through artificially low rates is neither compassionate nor responsible.  People deserve to know when they are in danger. When the Federal Government provides them with information that suggests otherwise, we do more harm than good.  We cannot expect to have educated, thoughtful consumers if we deprive them of the market information that is needed to make the smart decisions. By putting policyholders on a slow path to sound premium rates, we are stepping towards a future where the threats of major floods are confronted before they are realized.  I think we all agree that more needs to be done to mitigate flood risks and incentivize investments in resiliency. We can take the first steps by eliminating the false security that inoculates our society to the dangers of flooding.  Let's remove the blindfold we have placed over the public's eyes. Let's gradually walk back the subsidies that conceal a homeowners risk. It is time for this Nation to confront this threat with clear eyes and a vision for the future. This bill is the first step in the right direction.  In closing, I want to thank Chairman Hensarling and Housing and Insurance Subcommittee Chairman Duffy for their tenacity and commitment to paving the way for a safer and more affordable system for managing flood risks in this country. Flood insurance is one of those rare issues that transcends political boundaries.  I once again urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and also on the underlying bill.

1225,topic-id,577,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, which would give communities in the Tampa Bay area and all of our constituents a National Flood Insurance Program that serves as a lifeboat when disaster strikes.  Right now, the NFIP is more like an anchor tied around our neck, dragging this country deeper and deeper into debt as the waters rise.  With a $1.4 billion annual deficit and debt that continues to grow, this program desperately needs reform, and H.2874 is our opportunity.  We should all recognize that the NFIP is not a relief program. It is an insurance program. It is supposed to insure against losses, which entails far more than simply paying for damages.  Insurance is not about relief. It is about responsibly managing risk. Insurance means mitigating risks before disaster strikes, making investments in resiliency measures, telling people when the risk they face is simply too great, and providing service that makes people thankful for choosing your product.  No one knows this better than the professionals in the insurance industry who work day in and day out to help Americans protect their lives, their loved ones, and their belongings against all types of threats--car crashes, earthquakes, and wildfires.  Regrettably, Federal policy has made it extremely difficult for private insurers to write policies that cover flood risk. We have created a virtual monopoly for the NFIP at the expense of policyholders and taxpayers alike, yet we are still $30 billion in debt.  H.2874, which includes my bipartisan Private Flood Insurance Market Development Act, will allow the private sector to compete to help homeowners manage thei exposure to floods.  Competition can lower costs, provide more affordable options for consumers, and reduce the unacceptable number of uninsured homes by helping people understand their risk.  As it stands now, the NFIP is the worst of all worlds: It is too big to fail. It is also bound to fail.  With this legislation, we can make substantial progress in turning around a program that has found itself on the GAO's high-risk list for the last decade.  Under this bill, consumers will finally have an opportunity to select among a menu of options a plan that would fit their needs. As a result, they will be more likely to buy insurance than ever before.  That is not the case today with the Our constituents are severely limited. $250,000 maximum coverage on an NFIP policy. If you own a business, you are not going to get business interruption coverage.  What good is the insurance, then?  Thankfully, the private sector is capable of offering more robust policies that also provide more incentives for property owners to invest in mitigation and resiliency. Ultimately, this increased emphasis on mitigation will benefit homeowners and taxpayers alike.  This legislation will help us end the absurd practice of paying to rebuild a home that has been destroyed by flooding on more than three occasions.  Further, it strengthens the NFIP by directing FEMA to spread the NFIP's risk onto the global marketplace.[[Page H9229]]  This bill also contains more funding for mitigation and recovery than has ever been authorized by Over $1 billion will be made available by this bill to help manage our constituents' exposure to floods and improve the safety of a home after a catastrophe.  Mr.Speaker, let's support the freedom to insure against obvious danger that imperils people's homes and their wallets. Let's support informed decisionmaking.

I especially want to highlight the current situation in Afghanistan, which needs drastic improvement. Shoring up Afghani security forces is only part of a short-term solution. We need a long-term strategy that brings stability to Afghanistan as well as the entire region. The NDAA directs Secretary Mattis to develop such a 5-year strategy.

866,topic-id,414,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.  Jobs, jobs, jobs. That is why, Mr.Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the Micro Offering Safe Harbor  Whose side am I on? The tens of millions of folks who don't have jobs out there who want job opportunities. We know from some studies that, over the last 8 years of wrong regulation, 650,000 small businesses have not been created. That means 6\1/2\ million jobs, 6\1/2\ million people who are not paying Medicare tax, and 6\1/2\ million people who are not paying Social Security tax. We need these people in the game, Mr.Speaker, and this act can help them get into the game.  This is an important piece of pro-jobs legislation, and I thank my colleague, Mr.Emmer, for introducing it.  We all want our economy to become vibrant once again so it can generate opportunity and prosperity for all Unfortunately, regulatory burdens--both new and preexisting--often get in the way of raising capital and building a business.  At hearing after hearing at the Financial Services Committee, we have heard from financial institutions that are unable to lend to small businesses or are afraid to do so. We have also heard from businesses that cannot find the capital they need to expand or to retool. All of this has an impact on jobs and wages as well as on our overall economy.  The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act is a targeted, commonsense bill that will make it easier for small businesses to access capital that they need to grow.  Specifically, H.2201 will permit businesses to issue a limited number of securities to individuals with whom principals have a preexisting relationship. This would include family and friends who are often early investors in startups.  Businesses will only be able to issue a small amount of securities--$500,000 a year--but that is a step in the right direction toward helping businesses that need funding.  This is good policy that will make it easier for small businesses to get off the ground, grow, and add jobs.  At the same time, this bill ensures that our regulators can continue to police fraud and abuse, and to do so aggressively. On that point, there is no ambiguity. Fraud is illegal, and it will not be tolerated or excused.  Again, I strongly support the Micro Offering Safe Harbor It is good for the economy and good for hardworking It is good for jobs, jobs, jobs.

970,topic-id,411,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the underlying legislation.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we are considering today is the culmination of years of work, years of listening to the concerns of hardworking taxpayers at home, and several elections where the people spoke out for relief from a broken, special-interest laden Tax  Here are the questions we need to be asking today:  Are you tired of the status quo?  Do you think we can do better than the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression?  Do you want a healthier economy that creates the opportunities that offer you a real chance to get ahead, puts more money in your pocket, and helps you fulfill your American Dream?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, then the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is for you.  As I travel across my district, I hear story after story from families with nothing left over at the end of the month, who are struggling to save for retirement, pay off loans, or simply make ends meet.  It doesn't have to be this way. There is a better way.  We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix this. We can act now to put more money back into the hardworking taxpayers' pockets, make American business more competitive, and create a much healthier economy.  Americans have toiled under a broken Tax Code filled with loopholes and special interest carve-outs for far too long. This legislation--the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act--is a giant step for everyday Americans looking to get ahead.  This is for the family of four, making $59,000 a year, who can save $1,182 a year in taxes. This is for the single mom, making $30,000 working night and day to support her two children, who will also save more than $1,000 a year in taxes.  Our legislation doubles the standard deduction, so people won't have to itemize their tax returns. It expands the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600 and provides a $300 credit for adult dependents living at home. It will create more jobs in Pennsylvania and raise Pennsylvania's families' incomes.  It will bring dollars back to America to be invested in American companies with American workers. It will empower the people of America who want to get ahead, and it will lessen the power of Washington, D. Vote for freedom, vote for prosperity, vote for this rule and this bill.

1228,topic-id,346,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the 21st Century Flood Reform  I commend my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee for their hard work on this important bill, and I urge all Members to support its passage.  As we all know, this hurricane season brought flooding and devastation to many parts of the country. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria added even more debt to the National Flood Insurance Program, leading to a taxpayer bailout of $16 billion. That is $16 billion taken from the pockets of hardworking Unless Congress passes the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, we will, once again, have to bail out this program.  The NFIP, as it currently operates, is structurally unsound. This bill will help to prevent future bailouts by authorizing the NFIP to build up its reserves. It will also prioritize mitigation efforts and encourage the NFIP to engage in actuarially sound practices.  Of course, this effort is not solely focused on taxpayer protection. Homeowners, too, will benefit from the 21st Century Flood Reform  This bill crucially fosters the development of a private market for flood insurance. This will provide consumers with better options and more competitive prices.  My own State's former insurance commissioner testified in front of our committee last year in support of this idea after seeing benefits of private sector involvement. Commissioner Miller said:  ``In Pennsylvania, competition is proving to be good for consumers. . . .''  ``We are finding in many cases that private carriers are willing to offer comparable coverage at substantially lower cost than the NFIP.''  Mr.Speaker, this is good for the people of western Pennsylvania and it is the right policy for homeowners across the country.  I also want to thank Chairman Duffy for incorporating my amendment concerning Amish communities into the final bill. The Amish and similar religious communities have a tradition, informed by their religious obligations, of paying for community losses through mutual aid societies. My amendment to this bill accommodates those communities.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

815,topic-id,598,"Mr.President, I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the Senator from Iowa for her remarks. Once again, we call this midwestern common sense.  Let me finish this colloquy today with a few thoughts.  First of all, we want tax reform, but what we want first is a healthier economy. That is what the people of the United States want. They want the ability to compete. Over the last 10 years, there have been 4,700 businesses that have left our shores and moved overseas. The reason is that they can survive better by leaving our country and going someplace else because of the tax consequences of doing so.  When we talk about the direction in which we want to go in this country, we want the people of America to understand that our goal with this entire package is to make things better for the American public. That means a healthier economy for them. It also means, by doing so, that they will see the bottom line in their own pockets--more money that they can spend that otherwise would go to the Federal  At the same time, businesses that may have left and taken their jobs and the opportunities to invest their dollars--we want them back in the United States again, hiring more people and paying better wages. We think that over the last 10 years, the American public hasn't seen those higher wages because the competition for jobs has moved offshore into other parts of the world where there is a more competitive tax climate.  There is something else we have to point out. We recognize at the Federal level that we have a deficit and that we have not been able to break that deficit.  Today we have a deficit that is in excess of $500 billion. Out of the $4.1 trillion in total payments that are out there, that we spend on an annual basis, our omnibus bill, as we call it--that is for the defense and nondefense discretionary side of the formula--we vote on $1.1 trillion of the $4 trillion. There is about $3 trillion that is automatic, that is on auto pilot--Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, interest on the debt.  If we want to close that gap, then we have to see an economy which is growing, an economy which can support the programs that we believe are necessary, the safety nets that we in America have decided are very appropriate for those who have no place else to go. If we want to close the deficit, we need to have more revenues coming in. The only way we can pick up more revenues is by having an economy that is strong enough to support that.  By actually reducing taxes, we bring in more businesses, and those businesses will make more profits. We are able to lower the rate of tax on profits, and that is returned to the American people in a number of ways--a lower tax burden through lower personal income taxes and through subchapter C and S corporations, through lower business taxes.  Finally and just as importantly, in terms of how we support the operations of government, we support that because with a growing economy, the revenue coming from that growing economy can be utilized to eliminate the debt, which is a threat to our national defense.

656,topic-id,412,"Mr.Speaker, I greatly appreciate my colleague from Colorado for leading this Special Order on the Bible, its importance to each of us, and its influence on our constitutional  Our Founding Fathers understood that Biblical values were the basis for our Republic and that this country would be slowly destroyed if the people's knowledge and adherence to those values were ever lost.  In reference to this danger, John Adams wrote: ``Democracy will soon degenerate into an anarchy, such an anarchy that every man will do what is right in his own eyes, and no man's life or property or reputation or liberty will be secure, and every one of these would soon mold itself into a system of subordination of all the moral virtues and intellectual abilities, all the powers of wealth, beauty, wit, and science, to the wanton pleasures, the capricious will, and abominable cruelty of one or a very few.''  In a simpler language, that means ``tyranny.''  When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the United States early in the 19th century, he wrote in ``Democracy in America'' that our Nation's ``religious atmosphere was the first thing that struck me on arrival in the United States.'' He believed that adherence to the virtuous standards was indispensable for the preservation of liberty.  Mr.Speaker, he was correct in this assessment. This brings me to one of my own favorite passages in the Bible: the Apostle Paul writing to Timothy, in 2 Timothy 3:16 through 2 Timothy 4:5. And I might add that I find this passage to be more and more relevant to our times with each and every passing day.  It reads: ``All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  ``I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: preach the Word, be ready in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.  ``For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires and will turn away their ears and will turn aside to myths.  ``But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of the evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.''

The fact is I do want to simplify our Tax Code and I do want tax reform, a tax reform that relieves the burden on our middle class, our seniors, our veterans, and our students. But let's just see how this bill fares with the middle class, seniors, veterans, and students.  My middle class constituents in California will be double-taxed on their income, but big corporations will get tax relief.  Veterans in my district will find it harder to find work or a home because this bill eliminates tax credits for hiring veterans and harms efforts to end veterans' homelessness.  Middle class homeowners across California will see the value of their homes decrease by as much as 10 percent.  Students will get hit with the largest relative tax increase in this bill.  Seniors will see a Medicare cut by $25 billion a year. That is over $100 billion of Medicare cuts over the next 4 years.  And 38 million middle class families will see their taxes increase.

372,topic-id,275,"Mr.Speaker, everyone knows that the Republican tax scam gives massive tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires and corporations, and they do it, in part, by increasing healthcare costs for millions of Over 36 million middle class households will see a tax hike under this bill.  Families with big medical bills will take the hardest hit. That is because Americans will no longer be able to deduct major medical expenses such as cancer treatment or Alzheimer's from their Federal income taxes.  This is a middle class tax hike. Seven in ten households using the medical expense deduction make under $75,000 a year. Repealing the deduction would especially hurt seniors who use it for long-term care expenses.  The bill takes a second swipe at American seniors and people with disabilities. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by not paying for tax cuts for the wealthy, Republicans would trigger automatic cuts to Medicare, slashing $25 billion from Medicare in 2018 alone.  But the $25 billion cut to Medicare is just the beginning. The same Republican budget that cleared the way for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for the superwealthy proposed cutting Medicare and Medicaid by, no coincidence, $1.5 trillion.  Now, Senate Republicans want to pay for additional tax cuts by repealing a key part of the Affordable Care This change would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million and increase premiums by 10 percent.

375,topic-id,330,"Mr.Speaker, we absolutely must reform our outdated and overly complex Tax Code, but the current bill this House is considering is not the way to do it. I have heard from constituents and local elected officials about how this plan will hurt them and their communities.  Rather than lifting our economy and making our local communities stronger, this bill before us is an unfair and fiscally reckless step backwards. My constituents are deeply concerned with the restrictions placed on the State and local tax, or SALT, deduction. This puts a real burden on the residents of States like  One in three Illinois taxpayers uses the SALT deduction. Let's be clear. The SALT deduction is not a tax break for the very wealthy. It is used by the hardworking families we need to be helping with tax reform, not hurting.  I am also profoundly concerned about what this reform means for our growing debt. An additional $2.3 trillion in debt is irresponsible in the extreme, burdening our children and our grandchildren with the consequences.  Now, with the most recent Senate version, the GOP is taking aim at the Affordable Care Act, repealing the individual mandate without a workable replacement to further reduce enrollment in the individual health insurance markets, making coverage more expensive for millions of Americans and their families.

Furthermore, the idea that we will grow our way out of that $2 trillion hole is fantasy. Let's look at the growth rate after the last big tax cut at the end of 2015.

252,topic-id,2583,"Mr.President, first, let me thank my dear friend and colleague from As I have always maintained, he is one of the most articulate and eloquent Members of this Senate, on either side of the aisle, and it is a joy to listen to him--not the subject but the way he articulates it, the subject we are interested in but not happy about, which is the tax bill.                          Republican Tax Bill  Now, Mr.President, Senator McConnell always comes down and says: I hope the Democrats will join us in the tax reform bill. Mr.Leader, Mr.Republican leader, we want to join you, but that doesn't mean you write a bill behind closed doors and then say support it.  The way we have done tax reform successfully in the past--I was there in 1986--is Democrats and Republicans sat down together and came up with a bill that maybe a few in each party wouldn't support, but the mainstreams of both parties would. It avoids the secrecy. It also avoids one or two Members saying: Unless I get this, I am not going to be for the bill--which pulls the bill in many different directions.  So, Mr.Leader, yes, Democrats do want to join this, but it is totally disingenuous, not honest of you, to say that without letting us sit at the table, without letting us see the bill. So let's knock it off. You want to do a bill with just Republicans, fine. You tried it with healthcare. You are trying it with tax reform. It is a lose-lose. You will either not pass the bill or you will pass the bill that was enshrouded in secrecy that will have so many problems every Republican who votes for it will regret it.  Yesterday's markup in the Finance Committee indicated the same thing. The markup of the Republican tax bill wasn't the actual bill. It was ``a preliminary draft.'' How do we know it wasn't the real bill? Well, today the Finance Committee has notified us that instead of continuing the markup as usual, the committee will recess after a morning session because the Republicans are not ready with their replacement bill--the real one.  This is crazy. The President, who doesn't know what is in the bill--we all know that--has set an arbitrary deadline, and to meet that deadline, our Republican colleagues are sacrificing the integrity of the process and the quality of the bill.  We are 2 days into a markup, halfway, and Democrats haven't even seen a real bill yet. In their desperate rush to get this bill through Congress, Republicans started by marking up a bill that is not even the one they intended to pass. It is a bait and switch. It is the perfect example of the problem with rushing a bill of this magnitude through  Republicans can't keep up with their own reckless, breakneck pace, and they are going to have to delay the markup. This same problem is going to repeat itself over and over again on issues of greater complexity and consequence.  What happens when Republicans realize their new international tax regime encourages scores of new tax savings and avoidance schemes? What happens if the independent analysts say their new loophole for passthrough businesses doesn't have enough guardrails? What happens if the House and Senate are unable to reconcile their disparate approaches to slashing State and local deductions?  In the New York Times this morning--I commend all my Republican colleagues to read it--they identified new potential problems in this Republican tax bill, problems the writers hadn't thought about, but corporate lawyers by the dozens, by the scores, by the hundreds will find a way to walk through these loopholes, even though our Republican colleagues didn't intend those loopholes to exist. You can be sure that for every 1 of these loopholes, these misadventures, the Times identified, there are 5 or 10 more lurking in the print, in the fine print. The only question is whether our Republican colleagues find them now or find them out later when it is too late after the bill passes.  Instead of rushing through a bill of such enormous complexity, sunlight is the great fermenter of this type of legislation. If it lies out there for a little while, people come in and say: This is wrong or that is wrong. Those will be individuals, those will be pundits, those will be the companies our Republican friends are trying to help. They will say: Wait a minute; this doesn't quite work because no one has had a chance to really see it, examine it, and let it stew.  Now we are asked for other significant changes. What happens if, as we have seen, every few days President Trump tweets, asking the Republicans to change their bill, and this time they repeal the individual mandate and drop the top rate, as he asked them to do yesterday? Each of these decisions has enormous, drastic consequences for American families and American industries.  President Trump's crazy idea to repeal the individual mandate as a part of this bill, according to CBO, would boot 13 million people from the health insurance rolls and cause premiums to skyrocket, all to pay for a bigger tax cut at the top bracket--the wealthiest people in What a toxic idea. Are any Republicans going to go home and campaign on that? We are going to get rid of the individual mandate, kick 13 million people off healthcare, and raise premiums so we can lower the top rate when no one--no one but the hard right--is clamoring for it?  Income distribution is a problem in We all admit that we have different solutions for it. So be it. But I haven't heard, as I did in the 1980s, 1990s, or even the early 2000s, a clamoring to lower the top rate, even among those who pay it. They know they are doing well. Wealth has gone way up in America, and it has gone to the top. That is not what we need. It is a toxic idea. Yet Republicans may have to consider adding it to the bill to placate a restless and uninformed President, who, we all know, knows very little of what is in this bill. He just tweets. Somehow our Republican colleagues, instead of ignoring the tweets, pay attention to too many of them.  Yesterday, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said that they would not be able to properly analyze the effects of the Republican tax bill in the time they have planned for it. So we are not even having the JCT--nonpartisan, respected for decades--analyze the bill before we are going to vote on it in the committee and maybe on the floor.  Again, the Republican leadership in the House and Senate will ask their Members to vote on a major bill without knowing the consequences. In no world is this proper legislative procedure. No party has ever done this before--Democrats, Republicans, Whigs, Anti-Federalists, Democratic-Republicans, We have never seen this before. It is so wrong.  We see so many things that ail this country, and I have to say a lot of them stem from the top--from the Yet our Republican colleagues are still fearful of ignoring him, of not listening to ideas they know are ludicrous.  The rush is because my Republican friends, fearful of the President and his self-imposed deadline, are trying to hide a bill that would transfer even more wealth to the superwealthy while raising taxes on millions of middle-class  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, of all taxpayers making less than $200,000 a year, 13 million would see a tax hike in 2019, and 20 million would see a tax hike by 2027. Both Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan said that they would not raise middle-class taxes. They had to back off. For working Americans who do get a tax cut, the average is so small compared to what folks at the top are getting. Americans making $40,000 to $50,000 a year get an average cut of $480, while folks making over $1 million will get a tax cut of $50,000--100 times more than what working families get. They can say: Well, that is because the wealthy are richer. But that is not what we need in America right now. The wealthy are getting wealthier. They are doing fine, even under the present[[Page S7189]]tax regime. Middle-class people's median income has been going down over the last decade. It is harder for middle-class people to average--it shouldn't be OK for them to get $500 and the wealthy to get $50,000. We ought to be directing the tax cuts at the middle class.  Republicans--Trump's organization--had an ad on They said that wealthy people's tax rates remain the same, while the middle class gets a cut. That is false advertising because, when we compare apples to apples, the wealthy get a much larger cut than the middle-class people.  We have known for weeks that the longer this bill is in effect, the worse it gets for the middle class. To stay within deficit numbers, the JCT confirmed that under the revised House bill, entire middle-income groups will see a tax hike, on average, just a few years down the road. Speaker Ryan and other Republicans say that those tax hikes will not happen because future Congresses will extend certain tax breaks in perpetuity. If that is true, all the deficit hawks ought to pay attention. There is a gigantic hidden cost to the bill if we are going to make these tax cuts temporary in this bill and then make them permanent.  The scores this week will say that these bills blow a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit over the next decade. That is bad enough. But if a bunch of breaks, deductions, and expansions that are now temporary are made permanent, as the Speaker says they will be, the real cost will be hundreds of billions, if not trillions, more. All of my Republican friends who care about the deficit should be wary of this gain.  We do need permanence. We need corporate America in particular to be relying on a permanent change. But you can't do a permanent change without blowing a hole in the deficit, so you do a temporary change. There is a simple solution, which, if Democrats and Republicans work together, we could do: Close corporate loopholes, lower the top rate, keep the corporate reduction deficit-neutral and permanent. My guess is most corporate leaders would prefer that. They would prefer less of a tax decrease and more permanence because you can't build a factory or make a major investment if you know that the decrease is going to vanish.  We shouldn't be rushing through such an ill-conceived, backward bill--breaking the fine traditions of this body, busting the deficit, breaking the backs of millions of middle-class families, making the funding of defense far more difficult when there is so much agreement between our two parties on tax reform. On healthcare, it is hard to agree; the visions are diametrically opposed. But on tax reform, that is not true. Our Republican friends are just bollixing this up. Somehow they had in their heads that they had to do it through reconciliation. They had to do it without Democrats, and the result is a very poor product that most Americans already don't like and even more will not like as they learn more about it.  We all want to reduce the burden on small businesses. We all want to encourage companies to locate jobs here. We could put together a bill that does those things. This bill doesn't.  If Republicans turn their backs on this deeply flawed approach, my commitment to so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--who I know are squirming about this bill--is that we will come together and put a good bill together that a majority of both parties can support--both parties. That is how it ought to be done.                        President's Trip to Asia  As President Trump returns from his week-long trip to several Asian nations, it is worth asking: What did America get out of his trip?  Did he forcefully confront the Chinese leaders about our imbalanced and unfair trade system, where we play by the rules and the Chinese do not? He said that China's behavior was not their fault and blamed American leaders instead for China's trade abuses.  Even if he believes that, what is the point of saying it? He is encouraging China to keep doing what they have been doing all along if he thinks they are not to blame--letting them off the hook. Why? Because Xi gave him a red carpet?  I have never been so ashamed of a foreign trip in my years. It is just inside out. We attack our friends, and the people who have given us the most trouble--China and Russia--we mollycoddle. That is so bad for the future of this country.  Did President Trump engage the various regional powers in a project of great importance, curtailing and containing the rogue North Korean regime? He settled for a sophomoric exchange of insults on Twitter, far below the dignity of the office. Then he came back and bragged about the great ceremony and how well he was treated. Xi played the He played the Every American should be embarrassed.  I heard one commentator say this morning that this trip cemented China as the leading power of the world, not because they have more economic power, not because they have greater intellectual ideas, not because they are better people but because Xi is dominating and smart, and the President so susceptible to flattery. It is demeaning to the United States and its role in the world.  Then, to add insult to injury, he seems to have a love for dictators. In the Philippines, where a strongman leader is engaged in a vicious campaign of extrajudicial killings, did Trump admonish him? Did Trump uphold the beacon of the United States as the noblest power in the world? He lectured and unsettled our allies while emboldening our adversaries, like China and Russia, by treating them with kid gloves and making it clear that all they have to do is say a few flattering words and the United States will drop the interests that our people are so dependent on.  All in all, President Trump's trip was a colossal flop and embarrassment. He seemed far more interested in pomp and circumstances, red carpets, fancy meals, and the flattery of foreign leaders than in advancing vital American interests in a region that is increasingly looking to China for leadership. After the President's performance, those countries are going to turn more to At least they have strength and direction, even though China will take advantage of them, for sure, as they have taken advantage of us.  It is a sad state of affairs when the simplest of strategies--flattery--can derail an entire foreign trip and undercut American influence in the world. President Trump was played for a fool by China's leaders, and he enthusiastically accepted the role.  The President of the United States--this great, grand country we love--is supposed to be the single strongest voice and advocate for our national interests.

479,topic-id,1452,"Mr.President, later today the Senate Republicans will release their version of the tax bill. The bill will not include a single idea of Democrats in the Not a single Democrat has had any input into this bill. It was constructed entirely behind closed doors by the majority party, who have no intention of negotiating with Democrats because they locked themselves into a partisan process that only requires a majority vote.  They are trying to rush it through this Chamber with reckless speed. Why? Because my friends on the other side know that the longer their bill is out there for the public to see, the less the public likes it. Their only hopes of passing it are to rush it through before anyone can grapple with the stunning hypocrisy at the center of their plan.  The Republican majority has repeatedly promised a middle-class tax bill, but instead, they have concocted a bill grounded in tax cuts for big corporations and the very rich. They actually hurt middle-class people because they need to give those big breaks for the wealthiest.  While promising that their plan gives ``everyone a tax cut''--that is what Speaker Ryan said again today--multiple independent analyses conclude that the House Republican tax plan would increase taxes on millions of middle-class families, contrary to what Republicans promised and what Donald Trump has promised. They said: No middle-class people will get an increase. This is aimed at helping the middle class.  But the vast majority of the help goes to the wealthiest and biggest corporations. A New York Times analysis found that next year the House Republican plan would cause taxes to go up on one-third of all middle-class families. By 2026 taxes will go up on nearly half of all middle-class families.  So even if you come from a State with a lower tax rate--a red State--it is probably a good bet that a quarter of the middle-class families will get a tax increase. I think the lowest I saw was 17 percent for West  So this hurts middle-class people, and it hurts certain middle-class people much more than others--people who have student loans, people who have high medical expenses, people who come from States where there are large property taxes, people who have big mortgages. These are middle-class people. They should not get a tax increase.  Mark Mazer, director of the independent Tax Policy Center, said:       You could create a plan that just cuts taxes for middle-     class people. That's not what this is.  That is him, not me. It is what Republicans promised people.  Now, we will see what the Senate comes up with today. But several Republican Senators have already confirmed that the Senate bill has the same structure as the House bill, and, in at least one way, we know it is worse for middle-class families than the House bill because the House bill will reduce the value of State and local deductions by 70 percent, while the Senate bill eliminates it entirely. My friend from Ohio, Senator Portman, confirmed that a few days ago on FOX  This should be a three-alarm fire for every House Republican in California, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Washington, Illinois, Colorado, and Senate Republicans are telling House Republicans there will be no compromise on State and local deductibility. It is full repeal or bust because Senate Republicans need the revenue raised by ending this popular middle-class deduction.  There are several deficit hawks in the We have stricter budget rules for reconciliation. If the Senate tax plan includes cuts to the corporate rate, the pass-through rate, and on upper tax brackets--which dramatically increase the deficit--they will need the revenue from the full repeal of State and local to make the numbers work.  So I say to every one of my Republican colleagues in the House who comes from a suburban district: This bill could be your political doom. Don't let the special interests, don't let the party leadership push you into doing something that is bad for so many of your constituents. You will pay a price.  House Republicans should kill the bill now if they want to have any hope of stopping the full repeal of the State and local deduction. They can't hide behind the so-called compromise in the House bill. It is nothing more than a temporary fig leaf for full and permanent repeal.  As I said, if House Republicans don't kill it now, it will come back to haunt them. The overwhelming Democratic turnout in suburban districts in Virginia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania should send shivers down the spine of House Republicans who represent those districts. Voting to repeal the State and local deduction--walloping the middle-class and upper middle-class suburbs--would be political suicide, all this to bow down to the special big interests of large corporations.  Even with the compromise, the House numbers are devastating. Representative MacArthur said he was shown information that shows the compromise is good for his district, and he went from a no to a ``leans'' yes, according to  Representative MacArthur, go look at the real numbers.[[Page S7127]]  Forty-three percent of taxpayers in Representative MacArthur's district take the State and local deduction, for an average of $11,987 per deduction. Over half of the value of these deductions is not the property tax at all. It is State and local income taxes, which will be taken away under the plan.  Then, according to IRS data, there are a good number for whom the property taxes are over $10,000, meaning the compromise still wouldn't help them. So I would not, if I were Representative MacArthur, listen to the numbers the Republican leadership is giving him. I would do my own independent analysis because I believe he would find them to be a lot worse than what the leadership is telling him.  I say to my other Republican colleagues: Don't fall for those quick numbers. Go do your own looking at this. It is a lot worse than your leadership is telling you.  One final point here on taxes, for some reason the conventional wisdom on the Republican side is that because of the stunning depth of their losses in the recent elections, there is even a greater need to pass the tax plan. We have to do this or we will fall apart, they said. It makes no sense. They are misreading the public.  Ed Gillespie, for all of his divisive ads, also ran a traditional establishment campaign. The linchpin of his campaign was the $1,000 tax cut for everybody. It got him nowhere. Exit polls from the Virginia election showed that the 1 issue on voters' minds was healthcare, and they voted overwhelmingly Yet, amazingly, Republicans may repeal the individual mandate as part of their tax bill. How do they think that is going to fly?  Despite the spin from Republican leaders, passing this plan will not help Republicans climb out of the hole they are in. It will bury them deeper. Maybe if they pass the bill, they will not say they are in disarray for the moment, but already this bill has had a miserable rollout. You know that when a party rolls out their 1 legislative plan, there should be trumpets and bands, but the public knows already that the bill favors the wealthy. The public knows that middle-class people get a tax increase.  So at best, the rollout of this bill has been mixed. I would say it has been negative, and the American people agree because many more people are against this bill than are for it, according to all of the polls. Passing a partisan tax plan that favors the wealthy and raises taxes on millions of middle-class and upper middle-class families in the suburbs is no political cure. It is political poison.  The real way to win back the esteem of the American people would be to put partisanship aside, put a giant tax cut for the wealthy on the shelf, and come work with Democrats on real bipartisan reform.  Mr.President, I would also like to just announce my strong opposition to Mr.Wehrum to the EPA's Office of Air and  While working in senior roles at the Office during the Bush administration, Mr.Wehrum led the efforts to weaken clean air protections. During his tenure, courts ruled that the Agency violated the Clean Air Act 30 times. Mr.Wehrum represented industry clients against the EPA 31 times since 2008.  He does not deserve to be in this position. Anyone who cares about the lungs of their children should not want Mr.Wehrum in that position. I hope we will get some bipartisan support to reject this really awful nomination.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

518,topic-id,1750,"Mr.President, the Republican tax plan, even before yesterday, would exacerbate income inequality at a time when it is already spiraling out of control, helping the rich get richer and big corporations get bigger while the middle class is left stuck in neutral. Many millions of middle-class families would wind up paying higher taxes at the end of the day--13 million in 2019 and 20 million in 2027--under the Senate plan.  That is the wrong approach for our economy. It betrays the American worker and the American family, who deserve tax relief, because it concentrates more of our country's wealth at the very top--just what the American people don't want, but so many of those who fund the Republican Party do. For most of my colleagues and most of the American people, that is reason enough to oppose the bill, and the American people do, by large numbers.  But yesterday Republicans made two last-minute changes to their bill that make it even worse. First, Republicans decided to throw the mother of all monkey wrenches into the bill: repealing the individual mandate. My friend the majority leader called this provision ``helpful'' to the bill because it raises revenue. I would remind him and all of my Republican colleagues that[[Page S7228]]the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said it would lead to 13 million fewer Americans with health insurance. So we are taking 13 million people off of health insurance to give tax cuts to the wealthy.  Also, according to CBO, it would lead to a 10-percent increase in premiums. Each year, they would be 10 percent higher than they otherwise would be. So the Republican bill says: Raise the premiums on average Americans' healthcare by 10 percent so we can give the wealthy a tax cut.  This is the same thing they did in the healthcare bill until the public outrage forced them to back off, and, of course, it lost. Now they are doing it again because the Republican belief is to reduce the healthcare safety net for middle-class Americans so they can give more tax cuts to the wealthiest and most powerful amongst us.  If Republicans had their way, younger, healthier people would flee the market, making the risk pool older and sicker. If you are 50 to 64, this is very bad news for you. That is why the AARP is against this bill and yesterday denounced the new change.  I would remind my Republican colleagues that the provision raises $400 billion in revenues because it throws Americans off insurance, and $179 billion alone is saved because people wouldn't sign up for So the Republican bill takes $400 billion out of help for healthcare and gives it to the wealthy and the powerful for even more tax breaks. Does any American support that? A handful maybe, but it seems a lot of people in this Chamber might.  So when the Republicans say this provision in their bill is helpful, they don't mean it is helpful to It may help Republicans in the Senate give a larger tax break to the rich, but it hurts millions of Americans seeking affordable health insurance. Many will lose insurance. Many more will pay an increase in their premiums, while our colleagues have always promised to make premiums lower.  One other point. I have heard some on the other side say they would be willing to pass the bipartisan Alexander-Murray health compromise as sort of a salve after they repeal the individual mandate. I am here to tell my colleagues that won't work. You don't attempt to blow up the healthcare system and then say: We are going to make a few tweaks to make it better. We are not falling for that, and my Republicans friends shouldn't, either. They are completely contradictory ideas. Alexander-Murray is meant to stabilize markets and lower premiums; the Republican plan destabilizes markets and raises premiums in a way that Alexander-Murray could never repair.  Furthermore, Alexander-Murray would not survive under the rules of reconciliation. Too many of its provisions are under the HELP Committee, not the Finance Committee, so anyone who thinks they can justify the changes the majority leader has said he will put in the bill by saying: We will then pass Murray-Alexander, is wrong on the substance and wrong on the politics because it will not pass.  When Alexander-Murray was negotiated, it was in good faith by the chairman and ranking member of the HELP Committee as a compromised healthcare bill. Republicans cannot expect to pass their own separate ideological healthcare provision and then turn around and ask Democrats to vote to pass Murray-Again, you can't create major injury to the healthcare system and hurt millions, and then say: Please give us a bandaid. That is not what is going to happen. That is not the right thing to do.  Any Republican Senator who thinks they can pass the individual mandate and then turn around and get Murray-Alexander passed is dead wrong. It is clear the dark tradeoff at the center of the Republican policy agenda is back--cutting healthcare in order to fund tax giveaways to the very wealthy and very powerful. Democrats will not go for it. So that is one reason this provision is a bad one.  The second change the Republicans made to their tax bill was to have many of their tax provisions for individuals expire while corporate tax breaks remained permanent. With this new proposal, Republicans have put themselves between a rock and a hard place. The provisions that help individuals--and not enough middle-class folks were helped--expire by 2025. The corporate tax cuts to the wealthiest of corporations above all are permanent.  Why did our colleagues do this? For one, they favor the big corporate, powerful interests over the middle class, but the second is, they had a huge deficit problem. They had to figure out where to reduce the deficit, and so they took it out on the crumbs they gave to the middle class in the earlier years in this bill.  One of two things will happen. Some of our Republican colleagues are saying, ``Don't worry. We will extend the middle-class tax cuts after 2025,'' but that will create a huge deficit. So I say to my colleagues--particularly the deficit hawks--you can't have it both ways. You cannot say we are going to protect the middle class after 2025, and we are going to reduce the deficit. This bill is a deficit budget buster. We all know what will happen. We all know the deficit will skyrocket after 2025. We can't allow the sort of tricks that are put into this bill to dissuade us from the fact that this bill dramatically will increase the deficit.  There are two problems with this tax bill. One is inside the confines of the bill, and one is with the public after the bill passes--should it pass, which I think it will not. Inside the bill, as I mentioned, Republicans are stuck between raising taxes on millions of middle-class families or busting the deficit. There is no choice. You can't have it both ways. The bill is a dramatic exposition of being between a rock and a hard place. There are two choices the bill gives people: raise taxes on the middle class or dramatically increase the deficit.  Outside the bill, with the public, Republicans have a dilemma as well. If they don't pass the bill, they look feckless and unable to govern--and that is what is motivating most of my colleagues--but if they pass the bill, there is going to be public outrage, and they are going to pay a real price in 2018. They know it.  Outside the bill, the Republicans have two bad choices too. Outside the confines of the bill, in broad-brush strokes, our Republican colleagues can fail to pass the bill and look unable to govern or they can pass the bill--dramatically unpopular--and pay a price at the polls. These are not enviable choices. They are a Gordian knot that my Republican friends will not be able to slip out of. If they pull on one part of the knot, they tighten another part of it.  The reason my colleagues are caught in this lose-lose situation is, they have elected time and time again to eschew bipartisanship. Passing legislation of this magnitude with the votes of one party is divisive and demanding. A small number--say the Freedom Caucus--can demand almost all the tax breaks go to the very wealthy or they will not vote for the bill. That gives the rest of the Republicans a difficult choice: hurt the middle class or blow a hole in the deficit.  On the other hand, if our Republican colleagues had worked with us, that Freedom Caucus would have no say. They wouldn't have the votes to kill the bill because there would be lots of Democratic support.  Passing legislation of this magnitude, with votes of only one party is divisive and demanding. It has meant Republicans have produced legislation that appeals to only a small number of Americans, and, probably in their heart of hearts, even a minority of We are a fiercely divided country. Legislation that is crafted to appease the extremes of only one political party is never going to be broadly popular with the American people and, frankly, will not work.  That is why we should pursue bipartisan legislation, both parties accepting the credit of success and the blame of failure. The American people are clamoring for us to work together in such a fashion, and working together doesn't mean a bill crafted behind closed doors under reconciliation, which basically says to Democrats: Take a hike. We don't need you.  I say to my Republican friends, there is a way out of this mess, and it is simple: reject your Faustian bargains and come to work with Democrats on a real bipartisan reform bill. You will not have to choose between blowing up the deficit and hurting the middle class. You will not have to choose between unpopular legislation and legislative[[Page S7229]]failure. Just like Alexander-Murray proved, we can produce legislation on the thorniest of issues that will receive bipartisan support and improve the conditions of working and middle-class  Why don't we give this a try on tax reform as well--because the choices you are giving yourself now, you will regret.

775,topic-id,1516,"Madam President, I am going to spend the bulk of my time this afternoon focusing on the tax plan, but first I must address President Trump's trip to  Without exaggeration, the President's trip to Asia has been one of the most embarrassing foreign trips a President has taken in my memory. It shows when it comes to foreign policy, President Trump is not ready for prime time.  After a campaign in which he routinely criticized China--rightly, in my opinion--for rapacious trading practices that have stolen American jobs and depressed American wages, President Trump went to China and gave them a get-out-of-jail-free card. Instead of speaking sternly and truthfully to the Chinese leaders about the realities of our unbalanced and unfair trade system--where we play by the rules, and they do not; we lose jobs, they gain them--President Trump tried to appease the Chinese and their leader.  Instead of demanding concessions on trade, instead of demanding the same equal access to markets we provide Chinese firms, instead of addressing the sordid history of intellectual property theft and extortion, President Trump was eager to let China off the hook, saying it was ``not their fault'' but rather the failure of American Imagine blaming America for the Chinese trade imbalance and letting China get off scot-free. Is that putting America first?  President Xi flattered President Trump, and he fell for it hook, line, and sinker. From each of his interactions with President Xi, President Trump has only gotten flattery, pomp, and circumstance but nothing for the American worker--nothing.  If he keeps this approach up with a growing economic power like China, President Trump will be the author of a new international reality: America second.  Concerning the situation on the Korean Peninsula, instead of working toward a new meaningful understanding of how to best deal with North Korea, President Trump traded petty barbs with the President of North Korea on Close your eyes for a moment and imagine if this was the way Roosevelt behaved toward Stalin or Eisenhower toward Khrushchev or Kennedy toward This is below the dignity of the Office of President of the United States, and it erodes America's power in the world.  Worst of all, again, President Trump seemed to instinctively accept the word of President Putin against 17 U.intelligence agencies about whether Russia interfered in our election. We know that Russia interfered with our elections. Our entire intelligence community--17 agencies--has concluded it. Why does President Trump continue to give President Putin the benefit of the doubt while discrediting and demeaning American intelligence officers? It is shameful, unpatriotic--deeply unpatriotic--and he only halfheartedly walked back his comment after the fact. Every American should wonder why President Trump goes to such great lengths to avoid criticizing President  After 8 years of Republicans questioning President Obama's toughness with foreign leaders--an attack that I give no credence to by repeating--it seems that President Trump, not President Obama, is the one who is afraid to take on America's adversaries. He forgives China and cozies up to President  For the steelworker in Ohio or in Upstate New York whose job is on the line[[Page S7171]]because China is dumping cheap steel and aluminum into our markets, that is not good enough. For every American concerned about the sanctity of our elections, that is not good enough. When it comes to standing up for the needs of the American worker, for American firms, and for American consumers, when it comes to standing up for American democracy, this President needs to wake up and toughen up.                          Republican Tax Plan  Madam President, now on taxes. Today the Finance Committee will begin to mark up the Senate Republican tax plan. The bill put forward by the chairman will not contain the ideas of a single Democrat in the It is the result of not a single negotiation between our two parties. It has been discussed in exactly zero hearings, its merits weighed by exactly zero expert witnesses.  Rather, the tax bill is one party's backroom deliberations, and though it will affect nearly every person and industry in the country, it is being rushed through committee and may come to the floor of the Senate in a matter of weeks.  The Republican leadership is making a mockery of the legislative process, a mockery of regular order, and the reason for such reckless haste is all too obvious. The product is a wretched one.  If Republicans had crafted a popular bill that could get bipartisan support, they would have announced it with great fanfare and fanned out all over the country to champion it. Instead, it is being rushed through with hardly any consideration because my Republican friends know from their experience with healthcare that the longer an unpopular idea is left out in the open, the more it would fester in the public's mind.  That is what will happen with this tax bill because of one simple reason: It is focused on the wealthy to the exclusion of the middle class. While big corporations and wealthy individuals get lower rates and new permanent loopholes, the middle class gets benefits that expire. Corporations will be able to continue to deduct their State and local taxes while individual taxpayers will not. Wealthy estates worth over $5 million are ensured a massive tax break while millions of middle-class families lose their popular deductions like the personal exemption.  That is why, according to an analysis by the New York Times, under the House Republican bill, nearly one-third of all middle-class taxpayers will see a tax hike next year. Let me repeat that. Under the House Republican bill, nearly one-third of all middle-class taxpayers will see a tax hike next year, and almost half of middle-class taxpayers will see a hike in 10 years.  According to a JCT analysis of the Senate Republican bill, of all the taxpayers making less than $200,000 a year, 13 million will see a tax hike next year in 2019, and nearly 20 million Americans will see a tax hike by 2027. Another 64 million Americans making under $200,000 a year will see no change in their taxes. Meanwhile, everyone at the very top, the top 1 percent, will see tax cuts of tens of thousands of dollars. One hundred times more money would go to a family earning $1 million a year as a family making between $40,000 and $50,000.  Now, let me ask you, who needs the tax break more, the family making $50,000 or the family making $1 million? God bless the wealthy. So many of them worked hard to achieve great wealth. Good, but they don't need a tax break; middle-class people do.  Now President Trump is suggesting Republicans tip the scales even more in favor of the rich by repealing the individual mandate to pay for more tax cuts for the rich.  Here is what he tweeted. I find this hard to believe. How out of touch can the President be with the American people?       How about ending the unfair and highly unpopular      Indiv[idual] Mandate . . . & reducing taxes even further? Cut      top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle [class]      income cuts.  What does the proposal do? It sends premiums, healthcare premiums, for millions of middle-class Americans skyrocketing, all so that the wealthy--the top bracket--can get even bigger tax breaks than they get under the original Republican plan. The middle class only gets the leftovers, if there are any at all.  Sooner or later, even President Trump's core supporters will realize that he is selling them out. That is why most polls show that less than one-third of Americans support the Republican tax plan, and a majority actually oppose it. That is an astounding fact.  Tax cuts are historically popular. Somehow Republicans have managed to make a tax cut bill politically unpopular, again, for a straightforward reason. On balance, the tax cut is for big corporations and a tiny group of wealthy Americans while millions in the middle class pay more to help finance it. To make tax cuts unpopular is quite a feat. I would urge my Republican colleagues not to fall for the bait.  There is broad agreement on the goals of tax reform between our two parties. We all want to lower middle-class taxes. We all want to reduce the burden on small businesses and encourage companies to locate jobs here in the United States instead of shipping them overseas. We could put a tax bill together that does those things. This bill doesn't.  I know many of my Republican colleagues are concerned about the deficit. They are worried about the one-party legislative ramrodding that is eroding the grand traditions of this body, and they are afraid of passing a tax bill that raises taxes on millions of working Americans in their  So I say to my Republican friends: Hit the brakes on this bill. Come back to the table. We can work on a real bipartisan tax reform bill that delivers middle-class tax relief but only--only--if you defeat this bill first.  I yield the floor.

780,topic-id,245,"Madam President, I rise today to highlight the importance of the Gateway Project and express my continued frustration with the administration's approach to infrastructure and this critical project. The current Hudson River tunnels were built in 1908 and are rapidly deteriorating, a problem that was made far worse by Hurricane Time is running out, and we must quickly build new tunnels under the Hudson River before the current tunnels have to be closed for repairs.  The closing of either tunnel without a new tunnel in place would be devastating because it would essentially shut down the Northeast Corridor, the transit route from Boston to Washington that produces over $3 trillion in economic output, a full 20 percent of the national gross domestic product. The importance of this project cannot be overstated.  Unfortunately, despite repeated campaign promises to focus on infrastructure investment, President Trump has proposed severe cuts to infrastructure programs, including the Capital Investment Grant That cut is significant because it was the likely source of funding for the Gateway groject. In addition to proposing to cut the funding needed for the Gateway Project, the Department of Transportation has been unresponsive to a number of important interim actions that are necessary to advance this critical project.  Given the lack of focus on infrastructure investment by the current administration and the continued roadblocks the administration has erected in front of the Gateway Project, I must oppose the nomination of Mr.Derek Kan to be Under Secretary of  ",CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgS7170-4.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,13,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

417,topic-id,484,"Madam Speaker, this is one of those moments where--and forgive me, but I sometimes feel like I live and work in a math-free zone, because you can't intellectually have it both ways, where you are talking about the great difficulties coming, and then when you bring in the actual data and you actually start to look at the charts that we all see, it isn't in the future, it is right on the cusp of us, and that is the debt and entitlement crisis.  If we do not start to get some economic growth, we are in so much trouble. If you really care about Medicare, Medicaid, the children, this education program, this health research, where is the money coming from?  It is on the cusp. This is less than a decade away. In just a few years, we cross 100 percent of GDP, and that is publicly held, and then the ability to sell the bonds if we do not get economic growth.  But if you look at the last 30 years in the charts and the data--and I am sorry, I know this is small and I know it is math, so it is uncomfortable for a lot of people in this body. If you actually look across here and you see, this is entitlements to GDP, when we have been in times of economic expansion, all of a sudden our ability to finance, to maintain the promises we have made as a society, if the math works. And this is a commonality we both understand, economic growth is our only path. Because if it is not, are you on your side ready to do fairly draconian cuts?  If we actually look at some of the data that has come from the Tax Foundation, the Tax Foundation's modeling says $1 trillion of additional taxes, but almost $300 billion in additional payroll taxes over the 10 years.  I have already heard a couple people get behind the microphone here and use the term that the trillion and a half is dynamically scored. That is a static score. All dynamic scoring is--so we all have a commonality--you calculate back in the size of the economy. You loop back in the size of the economy, and you can't have it both ways. You either support dynamic scoring or you oppose it for global warming. You oppose it for immigration. You oppose it for the stimulus, because we actually, as a body, every March, when CBO brings us the numbers, they give us a number that has been dynamically scored.  I know we all want what is best for this Nation, but as I dig through the math, if we get the economic growth that I believe this tax model, so many of the very difficult decisions we as a body have to make over the next decade get much easier.

451,topic-id,3440,"Mr.Speaker, I want to do actually two or three things specifically tonight. One is walk through a bunch of data on why the tax reform proposal is actually just sort of crucial to our society and where we are going and, number two, actually walk through some impressions of being one of the new members on Ways and  I have been here in the U.House; now I am in my seventh year here. I have only been on the Ways and Means Committee now for a year. It has been one of the most fascinating experiences of my life because of the number of meetings, the diving into data, the ability to sort of make things mesh together and make the math work, with an understanding of how serious this is.  The problem is, in the somewhat toxic partisan environment we are in right now, I know there are some of my friends on the other side who are really uncomfortable with the idea of Republicans having a win.                              {time}  2100  I know there are others who are constantly looking for what the partisan wedge is. I am going to ask, at least for just a couple of moments, that we sort of think through something altogether.  We are going to walk through some of these boards. If you see this one right here, this is with the borrowing from all the trust funds. But our country is already 105 percent of debt. If you add up the publicly held debt and that from borrowing from the trust funds, it is over 105 percent of debt to  Lots and lots of economists get really nervous when you start to say: Hey, in just a few years, the amount of debt issued by this government will be the size of the entire economy. This is issue, not borrowing from trust funds.  Understand that the curve is steepening because the trust fund balances are falling. We are finally hitting that inflection period where demographics are moving our numbers. Remember, the peak of the baby boom is 60 years old today.  We have obligations that we as a society have made to our brothers and sisters who are getting older. We have a real problem. You are going to see in a number of these slides that if we continue to stay as a society, as a country, that is only growing. Remember, the projection right now is 1.8 percent growth over the next 20 years. You mathematically cannot meet your obligations. It is called a debt crisis. It is called an entitlement crisis.[[Page H9372]]  One of the key solutions to being able to meet our obligations, to meet our promises, is we need a society, an economy that is growing. If you love people, if you care about them, if you want them to be able to save and have opportunity and a future, you need a society that is economically expanding.  I accept that this body is often about our next reelection. This is an observation that I learned this year. There are some things that are in the Tax Code that are brilliant politics. They get you reelected. They give you something warm and fuzzy to go talk about at home. They are really bad economics.  It is hard to stand in front of a group and say: Hey, we get to deduct State and local taxes.  Then you look at the economic expansion modeling of it and there is almost no economic growth for a huge amount of spending.  I know it is a sensitive issue with a lot of my brothers and sisters here on both the right and left who are from high-tax jurisdictions, but understand one of the reasons it has been looked at is that it is a tremendous amount of spending in the Tax Code and there is almost no economic expansion from that spending.  Whereas, if that same spending in the Tax Code is in things that grow businesses, grow job opportunities, grow the ability to save, you can actually see the modeling where the economy gets bigger, where all of us have job opportunities, and over the coming years, you get paid more because the economy is growing.  This is great politics. This is good economics. I don't think those of us on the Republican side know it--and I know so often we get behind these microphones and we all sound like accountants on steroids--but the math is important.  How many times has this body made public policy that felt good, that was good politics, and really crappy economics?  That is how you wake up one day and your society is $20 trillion in debt and the curve is about to blow off the charts.  Remember, a lot of outside groups on the right and left have been doing modeling, saying there will be a debt crisis in about a decade and a half. It is coming, and it is coming very, very fast at us.  To have an understanding of just how difficult these numbers are, on this chart I have up here, do you see the red area?  This is for 2027. But you figure we just finished the 2018 appropriations and budgets, so we are already starting to plan the 2019.  Well, 8 functionally budget years from now, only 11 percent of this Federal Government's spending will be for things that people think of as government. Everything else--defense and entitlements, mandatory spending, both earned entitlements and unearned entitlements--will be everything other than 11 percent of the spending.  Public lands, the FBI, the Justice Department, the Park Service, health research, education, all the things you think of as government will be only 11 percent of our spending. Everything else will be either military--the military will also be only 11 percent--and everything else after that is mandatory. It continues to grow that way.  If you are someone who cares about education, who cares about the environment, who cares about these things, understand that if you do not start to get some dramatic economic growth, you are going to be squeezed out.  The dollars spent on your priorities are disappearing. It is math. We do not have the revenues. It is going to get crushed. It is coming very, very fast. This isn't Republican math or Democrat math. It is math.  What if I came to you right now and asked: What is one of the most powerful things we can do as a society to keep our promises?  My brothers and sisters on the left often talk about our promises to retirees. They are absolutely right. The fact of the matter is, I believe that for someone who retires in the next couple of years, they will have put in about $190,000 for their They are going to receive over $600,000. That is in, like, dollars.  Multiply that by 76 million baby boomers in that 18-year period. In just that differential, understand that one of the root causes is demographics. We still made a promise. The way you are able to cover that promise is economic growth.  When you look at this chart, it is fairly new from a Stanford economist. I found this in a book about 2 months ago. Do you see that red line on the left-hand side? Do you see where it lays fairly flat?  That is actually a line that says: ``Entitlement spending to GDP.''  The size of the economy, the entitlement spending in the 1990s, in the late 1980s didn't go down. It was still going up. The difference was the economy got bigger.  So when you hear us talk about debt-to-GDP ratios, start thinking about that denominator.  How do you grow the economy so that if we keep our promises, it doesn't crash the economy and functionally almost bring the world down?  We have some charts that make it very clear that when we have been in times of economic expansion, we have even been able to spend more money on these entitlement programs; yet we bent the debt curve and the amount of that consumption to the size of the economy.  I know this gets a little geeky, but at some point the math is important. I know we just spent a couple of hours talking about peoples' feelings on a 400- or 500-page tax bill, but let's get some of the math correct.  Understand that the chart next to me is sort of the CBO projections. The math is worse than even the CBO projections. If you can look--and I know this is small--but the CBO missed the 2017 number by over $100 billion. The fiscal year we just finished, the 2017 fiscal year, we borrowed $666 billion. This is one of the good years.  So, remember, you have heard people talking about in a static score over the next decade--10 years--this tax bill costs a $1.5 trillion. But we borrowed $666 billion last year, with no tax relief and a government policy that functionally gave us a 1.8 percent  Take a look at this year. It was supposed to get much better, but now that we know we have the spending for the hurricanes and disasters, we know we are going to blow through that.  If you can see it in about 4 budget years, because of that 1.8 percent economic expansion, we are going to start borrowing $1 trillion a year.  Yes, building a tax bill with $1.5 trillion borrowing over 10 years is something you have to really think about. You need to design it so we get the economic expansion so that the size of the economy gets bigger so there are opportunities to take in new revenues.  But do understand that if you are part of the side that you are just hearing supporting the status quo, the status quo is already a disaster and is just on the cusp of time. The disaster is already here. The disaster is status quo and doing more of the same.  In 4 budget years, you are borrowing $1 trillion a year, and it goes up from that. So doing nothing, continuing the status quo, is the entitlement crisis, is the fiscal cliff, is the debt crisis. We don't have a choice. We must get together and do what is necessary to get this economy growing.  We heard one of the previous speakers--who is one of the people I really like; he is a good guy; a Democrat of Illinois--talk about the Tax I sort of forgot this part. This is a quote from the Tax Foundation study. It is $1 trillion in new revenues.  Our static score that we are doing--and the Tax Foundation score is higher in spending--but our model says it is $1.5 trillion of spending in the Tax Code static. That means no economic growth. We are going to talk about what dynamic growth is. They say a new, additional trillion dollars of revenue. That is what we call dynamic scoring.  What is dynamic scoring, you may ask. Dynamic scoring is nothing more than asking: How does this policy affect the size of the economy? And then you loop it back and look for the feedback effects.  If you are a Democrat and you are saying, ``I don't believe in dynamic scoring,'' you really need to think about that position because you believe in dynamic scoring when the left introduced an immigration bill. It was dynamically scored.  Global warming. If you actually look at the scoring, it has feedback effects. Go back to the stimulus.[[Page H9373]]  We all use dynamic scoring around here. We just seem to only want to embrace it when it supports our own political views. Every March, the Congressional Budget Office gives us an update that has economic feedback effect in it. That is called dynamic scoring.  For both my friends on the right and the left, you can't just pretend that public policy has no effect in the size of the economy when it is contrary to your certain political pitch that you are making right now.  Just understand, the Tax Foundation says $1 trillion in new revenues. But the other things that are really important--and this actually starts to give you an understanding of some of the effects--is we have close to $300 billion in new payroll taxes.  Understanding that Social Security and Medicare are pay-as-you-go programs, today's taxpayers are functionally paying today's recipients. That is why I have been behind this microphone over the last year talking about things like demographics and birth rates and the really dangerous effects these low birth rates are having in the society, but that is other stuff.  We will have almost $300 billion in new payroll taxes. So I have $1 trillion in new income taxes and close to $300 billion in new payroll taxes for what we model is a trillion-and-a-half-dollar static score.  You may not like the numbers, but the Tax Foundation is really good at this. They have some of the most advanced models that exist anywhere in this country and it is worth going to and reading their information.  Right now, when you hear us talking, we are giving you just static scores. It is important to know that the freaky smart people are out there modeling, saying what we are doing is expanding the size of the economy as you go into the future.  Why is this so critical?  If you see this chart, this is what is being projected for our future. This is the CBO's estimates over the next, I believe it is, three decades.                              {time}  2115  Functionally, a 1.8 percent GDP growth. This is their projection. This is what they see our future looking like.  But if you go back to the 1950s--to 1973, yeah, we had a demographic bubble that was young and moving into the workforce. If you look at the late 1970s, 1990s, we were actually doing an average of 3.3 percent GDP a year.  If you actually are someone like I am where you just are fascinated--GDPNow, which is the Atlanta Fed's calculator, right now, has our GDP, as of today, at 3.2 percent That is amazing. The model we have been given says we should be at 1.8. We are substantially above that right now in anticipation of tax reform.  Apparently, a lot of the economy out there is already anticipating a better regulatory market and a better tax regime, and, with that, they are spending, they are investing, and we are already seeing it in the baseline numbers. This is something we can't screw up. It is incredibly important.  So let's try to understand, once again, if you care and love people and want them to have an economic future, why that growth is so incredibly important. If you actually sort of look at the difference--and this is sort of a difficult chart to understand. But if we are sitting here somewhere between this 1\1/2\ and 2 percent GDP growth, and you wanted to double the size of the economy, you are looking at having to wait over 35 years.  What happens if we were in the very tail end? And look, from my own math, I don't think we get there. We might have some years that touch it. But what would happen if you were at 4 percent GDP growth? You go from over 35 years to a little over 17 years to double the size of the economy. Well, how about if we could beat 3\1/2\ percent GDP? You go from over 35 years to 22 years.  Just understand the size of the economy has almost everything to do with what you are paid, your ability to have a pay raise, your ability to have enough cash flow in your life so you can save for your retirement. I know this seems like an academic lecture, but it is not. These things affect our lives. They also affect our ability to pay our promises. It also affects our ability to protect our It is not a game.  So another way to sort of look at the same numbers--and I just happen to like this chart, so that is one of the reasons we are putting it up. You can see sort of the bubbles. What would it take to sort of double that GDP per person? You know, okay, so instead of the entire economy, how about you, as an American citizen, the size of the economy as you--because as a participant in the economy, this has something to do with what you are paid, your ability on your lifestyle, the things you can own, the things you can do for your family.  The difference between the 2 percent--and let's just jump up to 4 percent, and the number of years, you start to realize the difference between 17 years or 35 years. This is about every one of us as an individual in this country that if we can adopt tax policy, that is good for families, good for the middle class, but also makes us competitive in the world again, and we start to grow, good things happen. Do you do a Tax Code that is great politics or really good economics?  Some of the math is hard. We live in a society right now where if you can look at the very far left side of this chart, the top 20 percent of our society, of our income earners--the top 20 percent of income earners are paying 88 percent of the Federal income taxes.  You start to understand. If I came to you right now, just as a simple math problem, and said, ``Hey, I have got 20 percent of very high income earners who are paying 88 percent of all the Federal income taxes, but I really want to make sure that the quartiles of our hardworking middle-income earners are getting a lot of this benefit,'' you can understand why there were such great math problems in making these things work, because 88 percent of all your Federal revenue is sitting out here with 20 percent of the population.  That is actually why we have had to do a lot of the things we have done. And where certain deductions, certain things phase out, it is just a math problem. But remember, you see that red line, and you see where it crosses the blue line? That is where publicly held debt will exceed the size of our economy.  This government will have issued debt to foreign buyers, to your retirement account, to pension funds that will exceed the size of this economy, and it is only a few years away, and that is what the status quo is. That is where we are going.  I will make you the argument, we don't have a choice. We must make a simpler, a fairer, but a dramatic and more progrowth tax system as part of this country's culture.  In being blessed to now be on the Ways and Means Committee, which I am incredibly appreciative--they are some of the smartest people I have ever worked with, are really smart calculators and people--there is something called Joint If you ever want to know where all the freaky smart people or president of your high school math class are, there is 50 of them in there. I think like more than half may have Ph.D.'s in math and statistics and accounting. They tell us, the testimony to the committee is, 94 percent of the tax paying population will now do their taxes on this. Only 6 percent of taxpayers in the country will need to itemize.  There is actually some really interesting math that also starts to happen when you have made a tax system fairer, simpler, and progrowth. But the simplicity of it makes compliance, makes the ability to pay, makes the ability to participate so much easier and so much more elegant.  I have been proud to be part of the team that has helped build this tax plan. It is not perfect, and it is still going to go through a couple of more changes. That is the way it works. We will get the Senate product; we will sit in conference committee; we will work out the math; but understand the status quo is disastrous for every American, and I actually believe it is disastrous for the world. The tax reform gives us an opportunity to grow and have an incredibly bright future if we do it the right way.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.[[Page H9374]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9371.txt,1994,TAX REFORM,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
498,topic-id,499,"Mr.President, today is a good day. We have both the House and the Senate working on tax reform that will have a positive impact for everyday, hard-working This is truly a good day.  So often when you hear us talk about tax reform, it sounds like a lot of numbers. I am not sure how excited or enamored people get with numbers, but I am the kind of guy who believes tax reform is not about numbers. Tax reform is about everyday Americans being able to keep more of their hard-earned money.  Tax reform is about families like the one I grew up in--single-parent households, working paycheck to paycheck, year in and year out, praying and hoping for something good to happen. Today is good news for those single moms and single dads out there.  It is also good news for the working-class families--dual income--making around $75,000 a year, working every day, trying to make sure they have a little left over for dinner out.  We want to say to those folks who haven't really had a raise in a decade: We hear you. We feel your pain. We want to deliver to your American family the opportunity to see more money in each paycheck. This is good.  And for folks who are looking to start businesses, we have a Christmas surprise for you too.  We have lowered taxes on the average family about $1,500 a year--$100 or so a month. Here is what that means. For a family where you are in a single-parent household, you bring home about $450 a paycheck. That could easily become an extra 10 percent per paycheck. That is a lot of money to a single-parent household.  We have also expanded the child tax credit to make sure that those folks in the middle-income brackets are able to keep more of that hard-earned money. If there is a focus on our tax reform package, it is to make sure that middle America--hard-working income earners--have a chance to see more money materialize in their paychecks.  We have also simplified the Tax People say: Well, how did you do that? There are seven brackets. I understand. It is simple. Simplification means you do not have to itemize. Said differently, 9 out of 10 taxpayers will be able to use the expanded standard deduction to figure out their tax burden, as opposed to going item by item by item and understanding whether you can withdraw it or subtract it from your income.  I had the great pleasure to be a small business owner before entering Many small business owners represent the backbone of our economy. Most jobs created in the future will be created by a small business owner.

Mr.Speaker, what a delight it is for me to stand up and say that, the work we are going to do today, the President of the United States will sign. He is encouraging what we are doing today.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from the National Federation of Independent Business--that is ``The Voice of Small Business'' in America--and also what is called a Statement of Administration Policy from the Executive Office of the President of the United                                            National Federation of                                         Independent Business,                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Federation      of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small      business advocacy organization, I am writing in support of      H.1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs This legislation will      provide much needed tax relief to America's job-creating      small businesses. H.1 will be considered an NFIB Key Vote      for the 115th       Small business is the engine of the economy, and tax reform      should provide substantial relief to all small businesses so      they can reinvest their money, grow, and create jobs. Ninety-     nine percent of all American businesses are small businesses;      the average NFIB member has just 10 employees. Taken in sum,      however, small businesses create half of all private-sector      jobs in the U.and contribute half the nation's gross      domestic product.       Three-quarters of small employers are structured as pass-     through entities, meaning their owners are taxed at the      individual rate as opposed to the corporate rate. Crucially,      H.1 reduces the tax rate on the smallest pass-through      businesses to 9 percent over five years, without industry      exclusions or restrictions.       NFIB supports passage of H.1 and will consider it an      NFIB Key Vote for the 115th       Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to      working with you to protect small business.           Sincerely,                                            Juanita Duggan,                                            President & CEO,                   Statement of Administration Policy   H.1--Tax Cuts and Jobs Act--Brady, R-TX, and 24 cosponsors       The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.     1, the Tax Cuts and[[Page H9274]]     Jobs Passing the bill is an important first step in      achieving comprehensive tax reform that cuts taxes for hard-     working families and puts the Nation's economy on a path of      higher economic growth. The President's priorities for tax      reform have been consistent from day one: (1) cut taxes for      middle-income families; (2) simplify the Nation's complicated      tax system; and (3) reduce business taxes so that American      employers can create jobs, raise wages for their workers, and      better compete with foreign businesses.       H.1 would deliver meaningful tax cuts for middle-income      families by nearly doubling the standard deduction, lowering      tax rates, increasing the child tax credit, and creating a      new Family Flexibility credit. It would simplify tax filing      so that the large majority of Americans could file their      taxes on a single page. The bill would also cut the corporate      tax rate to 20 percent--below the average tax rate in the      Organisation for Economic Co-operation and      Finally, H.1 would lower taxes for millions of S      corporations, sole proprietors, and partnerships that pay      taxes at individual rates.       Based on a review of more than 100 academic papers, the      White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) estimates that      the corporate provisions in H.1 would grow the economy by      between 3 and 5 percent over the next 10 years, which if      applied to 2027 Gross Domestic Product projections, would      result in an additional $700 billion to $1.2 trillion in      economic output per year. CEA also found that the same      provisions would increase average household income by at      least $4,000 annually.       If H.1 were presented to the President, his advisors      would recommend that he sign the bill into law.

980,topic-id,730,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Florida, Judge Hastings, for his exemplary work and the work of his colleagues on the Rules Committee and my colleagues also on the Republican side.  Mr.Speaker, our previous speaker, the gentleman from Butler, Pennsylvania, Mike Kelly, had it best when he said: `` . . . an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance our budget, just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. Only full employment can balance the budget, and tax reduction can pave the way to that employment.''  What he did not say is--that will be in the record--is that John Kennedy said this on December 14, 1962, 55 years ago, in an address to the Economic Club of New  Mr.Speaker, in fact, there have been a lot of people here who have given testimony, I think testimony that they intended to sway the voters and those listening in this country that the Tax Code that we have works just fine, but then they spoke about the frailties of that and they talked about jobs going offshore, they talked about jobs and economic activity going somewhere else.  I, being from Dallas, Texas, hear stories every day about people who are coming to Texas, coming to north Texas, coming because of the economic climate that will allow them and their companies to have a better shot at not only being competitive, but, as Mike Kelly said, to be winners in this economy, at the very top of the heap rather than at the bottom of the heap.  What this common denominator is, is that my State of Texas does do the things that this bill does also. It keeps taxes low, it creates opportunity.  By the way, how many poor people create jobs?  I don't know.  How many of those who really have incentive and entrepreneurship create jobs?  A ton of them.  We are going to grow entrepreneurs out of today. We are going to grow young people getting out of college, veterans leaving the military coming back and seeing where they can make a go of it. Instead of it being a 95 percent failure rate of new business--which is what it is, it is a heavy bar because of rules, regulations, and taxes--we are going to make it easier.  The White House Council of Economic Advisers based their review, as they provided the economic outlook to us, on more than 100 academic papers, estimates that corporate provisions in this tax bill alone will grow our economy, not leave us in 23rd place, as Mike Kelly said.  Who wants to be in 23rd place?  If you want to be in the top 25 and you are comfortable, sorry.  We want to be at the top. We want to Make America Great We want to be able to say that businesses all over the United States stand a chance, and that is what this does.  The Council of Economic Advisers says that this will grow the economy between 3 and 5 percent.  They got comfortable with 1.2 over 8 years. I am not comfortable and the American people aren't comfortable either.  We are going to add some $700 billion to the economy this next 10 years. That is the guess, that is what Republicans want to do, but it is based on a lot of factors, it is based on hard work.  America has the best, most innovative workers in the world. We want to put this together with an opportunity, because we have a great place to be: the United States of America, any of our We have the best energy policies in the world and we have the best price. We have the best workers. We have tool kits with our universities. Our industry will grow back and reinvest in themselves.  We are going to take our Tax Code and take what is $5.6 trillion worth of tax areas and move that where it will boost our economy. We will become pro growth again. Yes, we heard that it was John Kennedy, it was Ronald Reagan, and it is going to be making America great again.

153,topic-id,457,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to commend the sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.Davidson). It was a pleasure working with him, and I am pleased that he and I introduced this legislation.  This legislation deals with a broader issue of cybersecurity. From Equifax to Moscow, worldwide, people are concerned with cybersecurity. One particular part of cybersecurity that is important is the SEC's accumulation of very sensitive data, whether it be about individuals and their trading, or about the overall market.  In September, the SEC disclosed that hackers had breached the SEC EDGAR database, which is the home to millions of public and nonpublic filings, and that that breach had occurred in 2016. The breach, which was not discovered until August of this year, may have led to some illicit trading activities.  This bill requires the SEC to develop and implement cybersecurity risk controls to ensure that market data is protected. This will help protect our markets from harmful disruptions and manipulative trading.  In addition, this bill requires that FINRA--the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority--and the operator of the new consolidated audit trail develop and implement risk controls to protect the data they store. The new consolidated audit trail system will not accept data until they have the cybersecurity risk controls necessary to protect it.  Once the CAT, or consolidated audit trail, is operational, it will serve an important purpose in assisting the SEC in identifying issues that deserve investigation. But it will also store a large amount of data, and it is important that this data be secure. We must ensure that there are proper controls in place.  Now, this bill passed our committee by a vote of 59-1 in its present form. There was an effort after the bill passed committee to try to broaden the bill, and it may very well be that other related issues need to be dealt with by this But I think we made the right decision in bringing to the floor today the bill that passed our committee 59-1.  We should then have hearings and perhaps work on additional legislation that will add to our ability to provide for cybersecurity in this area. I look forward to working with the chairman of the subcommittee, and Mr.Davidson, and so many others, on additional legislation designed to ensure our cybersecurity is as good as it can be, and to make sure that we are not putting information into systems unless we are sure that everything has been done so the systems can protect that information.  Mr.Speaker, I call upon all of our colleagues to support this legislation that had 59-1 support in our committee, and I reserve the balance of my time.

389,topic-id,443,"Mr.Speaker, by 2027, roughly one-third of middle class families will be paying more in taxes, and that average family will be paying $1,300 more.  The personal exemption, worth $4,150 per person in a family, that is $21,000 for a family of five, and they take it away.  The moving expense deduction, if you have to move to keep your job, you don't get to deduct that. But if you move a factory to China, you get to deduct all of the moving expenses.  The student loan debt, they won't let you deduct it.  As for the effect on simplicity, my CPA and tax law homeboys are going to be rolling in big dollars. Just from the provisions that define the difference between personal service income, passive income, active business income, the litigation and planning opportunities--talk about complexity--it is all there, and my homeboys love it.  We currently deduct extraordinary medical expenses. That is important to those with disabilities and families with children with special needs. They wipe it out.  The extraordinary casualty loss deduction, they wipe out. That is very important to people who face floods and fires.  They change the rules so that we don't have adequate indexing for inflation, so everybody is pushed into a higher tax bracket by inflation, except those at the very top; they are protected.

Your grandchildren will be paying taxes on this debt.  Look at the chart. We had the policies of Ronald Reagan from 1988--when his 1986 law became effective--through 1993, and we had 2.67 percent growth. In 1994, we got Clinton tax policies and we exploded to over 4 percent annual growth. Then with George Bush, we dropped to 1.7 percent growth. Then when we adopted Obama tax policies, which are in force today, we are back up to 2.2 percent economic growth.  Which policies give you economic growth?  Let's look internationally.

919,topic-id,4994,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the Speaker for recognizing me and indicating that I can speak for an hour. We get caught up in so many issues here that we sometimes don't explore them in depth, and with 1 hour, I plan to look in depth first at the President's trade policy toward China, and then toward the Republican tax bill.  The President is meeting again with President Xi from They will put out a beautiful joint statement, they will pose for photographs, and there will even be a business deal or two to announce.[[Page H8691]]  These are the two largest economies in the world. They involve tens of trillions of dollars. So every month, a few big things happen that are bad, and one or two big things happen that are good. There is always a particular business deal that you can package and wrap as a photo op.  But the fact is that we have to look at the overall trading relationship. The trading relationship is this: we run hundreds of billions of dollars of trade deficit, and every billion dollars of trade deficit cost us 10,000 jobs.  So let's look at what has happened while President Trump has been in office. We look each month at our trade and goods with the People's Republic of China, and we start with a deficit of just a bit over $22 billion, and for the most recent statistics available, August of this year, we are up to almost $35 billion.  What is interesting about this chart is that every month Trump has been in office, our trade deficit with China has grown. Now, he can say that he doesn't have the power to do anything about that; he just wants to be a pretend President, a pretense President, a posing He can pose for a picture, but he doesn't have the authority to do anything.  That is completely wrong. Look at section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and you will see that the President acting alone could eliminate this deficit by imposing tariffs on Chinese goods now. But he won't do that because his plan--and what he has done over the last 2 years is he campaigns like he is Bernie Sanders at least on these issues, and he governs like he is from Goldman Sachs which, of course, many of his advisers actually are.  Even after the campaign was over in November of last year, the campaign continues, and he continues to pretend to be in favor of the trade policies associated with Bernie Sanders and others, and he continues to govern in the interests of Goldman  Now, this chart does not reflect services because services trade between the United States and China is not available on a monthly basis, but the trend would be exactly the same: huge growth in the deficit month after month after month after month--February, March, April, May, June, July, and August of this year--and likely to continue for the other months that the President continues to serve and the statistics become available.  Now, we are told perhaps that it is okay to give away all these American jobs because we would need Chinese help to deal with North Let's see how that is working out. The President, prior to this trip, had met with President Xi twice, and now we have a third meeting.  After those first two meetings, North Korea explodes a hydrogen bomb and tests a missile capable of reaching major cities in the mainland of the United States all with the acquiescence of the Chinese So whether you are concerned with our national security or whether you are concerned with jobs and trade policy, we can no longer have a President who poses and pretends and ignores the statutory authority that he has on laws that have been on the books since the 1930s.  Now let's talk about the Republican tax bill. This is a bill which will raise taxes on millions of middle class families. Now, it gets worse in a few years. There is a bit of a bait-and-switch. They will want to tell you: Just look at how this bill will affect your tax return in 2019.  If you plan to still be alive in 2027, take a look at the effect it is going to have then.  Let's look at middle class families--not the poorest 20 percent in our country, not the richest 20 percent--that middle 60 percent. Roughly 30 percent of those families in the middle class are going to see a tax increase on their 2027 tax return, and that tax increase is calculated at an average of $1,300 per family.  Let's look at the individual provisions to see how fair they are to middle class families. First, right off the bat, they take away the personal exemption which, on next year's tax return, the first year that this new bill would be effective, is worth $4,150 per person in your family. That is nearly $21,000 for a family like mine of five.  They take away $21,000 of deductions even from the poorest families in America and from every middle class family as well. Now, they say they are going to replace that with a child tax credit. But if your children are over age 16, that credit is limited to a few hundred dollars next year, and then they make it zero 5 years from now. So if your kids are going to turn age 17 sometime in the next 5 years, they have got your name on this bill.  They also do increase the standard deduction. But tens of millions of Americans don't even take the standard deduction. They choose to itemize their deduction.  So one replacement is inapplicable in a few years to kids of a few years old, and the other is inapplicable to the millions of families that don't itemize their deductions. But even if it is applicable to you, you are losing for a family of five $2,100 roughly. What about a family of six, a family of seven, a family of eight? Another $4,150 per child, and they replace it with an increase in the standard deduction of $1,200 and a per-child credit of $600 or $300 or absolutely zero if your kids are over age 16 and it is a few years from now.  Next, let's talk about moving expenses. The current code says that if you are working at a factory, it closes down, and it is moving 100 miles, 300 miles away, and you have to move your home, if you have to find a new home to live in, you get to deduct your moving expense. They take that away. But what do they leave? If you own a factory, you shut it down, and you move it to China, then all of the moving expenses are tax deductible.                              {time}  1330  Don't let them tell you they are taking away the moving expense deduction. Sure, they are taking it away from individuals and employees, but they are leaving the moving tax deduction for those who are moving their factories to  Of course, they take away the student loan debt interest deduction. If you are investing in yourself, in a family member, or in education, the interest deduction is wiped off your tax return. But if you are investing in a Chinese factory, the deductions are there for you. They are not anti-investment. They are just anti-investment in the skills and capacity of American workers.  Next is the medical deduction. There is a deduction for medical expenses. It is available only to a few families with particularly large medical needs. You don't get the medical deduction unless your un-reimbursed medical expenses--thanks to the Affordable Care Act, most people have at least decent insurance. You still have some medical expenses that are out-of-pocket, but if your out-of-pocket medical expenses exceed 10 percent of your income, then to the extent of that excess, you can take a deduction.  If your out-of-pocket, uncovered medical expenses are 13 percent of your income, you can deduct the 3 percent. That is not overly generous. It is not even applicable to most families.  Who needs it?  People with disabilities, families with children with special needs, and people with cancer and other severe diagnoses. That is who they target.  They say: Well, if you make some money, and then you have to spend it dealing with medical services, dealing with therapies for special needs children, for disabled, for people with cancer. Well, just because you don't have the money because you had to spend it on medical services doesn't mean we can't tax you on the money. And they do.  Well, there is another group of people who are unlucky enough to have extraordinary expenses, and that is casualty losses. If you have a small fire or some small casualty, you are not going to get a deduction. The deduction applies only when your casualty losses exceed 10 percent of your income, and then only to the extent that they exceed 10 percent of your income.  We have had the wildfires in my State of California, not to mention the hurricanes in the Caribbean, and there are people who are going to say: Well, thank God that if the disaster had to hit our community, it hit us in 2017, because our casualty losses are deductible.  But what about the next disaster?  People with uninsured, out-of-pocket losses exceeding 10 percent of their income will not get a deduction.  Here is the Republican response: Look, if it is an enormous disaster that happens to take your house and the[[Page H8692]]CNN cameras are there, then your congressional delegation can come beg for a special tax rule for those affected by that disaster.  Well, first, what if your home burns down and CNN isn't there? It is not part of an enormous disaster? It is just something that hits you and a couple of neighborhoods?  You will never get a special tax provision. We are not going to write one for three or four people, or 30 or 40 people, or 80 or 90 people affected by a small brush fire.  But what if you are part of the next enormous catastrophe?  Your congressional delegation will be here, having to decide whether to bargain to give you a chance to take the same deduction that has been in the Tax Code since the 1950s, or whether to bargain to try to get disaster relief to rebuild the infrastructure and the public assets in your community.  Your congressional delegation probably doesn't have enough clout to do both. So which are they going to do?  It is clearly wrong and unfair to tax people on that portion of their income that they have to use to deal with a truly extraordinary casualty loss.  But there is another provision. This one hasn't been talked about much. That is the way in which they index Tax Code provisions for inflation.  There are some of the provisions they don't index at all. So they say that you can take your property tax deduction and itemize it--only the portion up to $10,000. Well, $10,000 sounds like a lot of money, but they don't index it.  So what about 10 years from now? What about 20 years from now?  You say: Well, I won't be in my house 20 years from now.  Yes, but the person you sell your house to will be there. If they say, ``My God, all the prices are higher, all the wages are higher, all the taxes are higher,'' that $10,000 limit on property taxes means, ``I can't deduct but half my property tax bill.'' That will be factored into the price of your house.  As to the things affecting home ownership, no indexing. Everything that looks big now gets smaller and smaller every year as a result of inflation. Oh, by the way, this tax bill is going to cause more inflation.  There are other provisions where they say they are keeping the indexing, but they change from CPI indexing to chained CPI indexing.  What does that mean?  It is a system for indexing the brackets less than what would be if just look at the Consumer Price  You say: I am only going to be in the 25 percent bracket under this bill. As I get raises to just compensate me for inflation, I will still just be in the 25 percent.  No, you won't. If you are fortunate, your employer will adjust your wages for real inflation, but the brackets are only going to increase for chained  We take away the State and local tax deduction. First, this is a departure, as other provisions are, from the concept that we should tax people based on their ability to pay. If you make a certain salary an 10 percent of it is taken out and used by your local and State governments, then your ability to pay is the 90 percent of your salary you get to keep.  But they don't want to tax you on what you keep after State and local taxes. They want to tax you on the money that has already been spent on taxes.  The effect of this is not just on the middle class families who are going to lose a tax deduction on their return and be taxed unfairly. If you read what is put out by the rightwing think tanks, they say: We know why we are pushing this State and local tax elimination. Because that will create a political atmosphere where States like California and New York and New Jersey will slash the amount of money that they spend on things like public safety and education.  We won't just be affecting the people who are not taking the tax deduction. We will be turning to poorer families and lower middle class families who depend upon public schools, and it will just cause a political situation where less money is spent on local education.  So this doesn't just affect those who it affects on their tax return. This affects everyone who lives in the community.  As I have alluded to before, they take away a big chunk of the home mortgage deduction, particularly to the person you would sell your house to later. If you sell your house--and God knows what the inflation rate may be. It may be significant. It may be $500,000, which doesn't sound like a whole lot of money then, even though it does sound like a big chunk of money now. I remember when $50,000 for a home was thought to be a very high price. Anyway, the home mortgage deduction is limited for that buyer to $500,000 of mortgage. The property tax is limited to $10,000 of property tax.  What effect is this going to have on the ability to sell your home, which, in many parts of the country, is your whole nest egg?  People pay a big mortgage payment every month and they have equity in their home. Maybe they can retire because they have got 20, 25 percent equity in their home.  Well, yesterday, before the Financial Services Committee, we had Mark Zandi testify, who is one of the leading economists in this country, the head of the economics operation at Moody's He said that in major metropolitan areas, like the one I represent, we are going to see a double-digit decline in home values as a result of this bill. A lot of that is the limit on home mortgage deduction and the property tax. There are other elements of this bill that also adversely affect home prices. A double-digit decline.  Then what does that do to the community?  You may say: I don't own a home. I just work at a restaurant. I live in an apartment.  Who is going to come to that restaurant and how big are they going to tip if they have just gone to Zillow and seen the value of their home and they have seen a double-digit decline?  The whole community.  This affects people from the New York metro area, the Philly metro area, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Orange County in  You are sucking money out of the local economy and giving it to the Federal Government by taking away the State and local property tax deduction. You are then slashing the value of homes with a double-digit decline.  What money is going to be in circulation to buy goods and services to support the entire regional economy?  This is going to hit like a hurricane in areas of the country that did not experience one.  My party is so focused on the great unfairness of this bill and the fact that it provides the bulk of its benefits to the top 5 percent and even the top 1 percent. That fact is hidden by the anomaly that most of the economic projections of this bill don't even look at the repeal of the estate tax. They only look at the income tax provisions. You can't just exclude a whole chunk of this tax bill in analyzing it.  We, as a party, are so focused on the huge unfairness that we almost don't want to talk about the effect it will have on the overall national economy. This isn't just an unfair bill. That isn't just a bill that enriches the rich. This is a deficit-exploding, outsource-promoting, job-killing, growth-reducing disaster for our Nation's economy.  You want to know the effect of huge tax cuts on an economy?  Look at They slashed their taxes and now a Republican legislature is reversing it because of what that has done to tax receipts and to the Kansas economy.  Let's take a look and see what effect this is likely to have at the national level. I turn to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, where they say that this tax cut is an ineffective way to spur economic growth and is likely to harm the economy if it adds to the deficit.  Well, what is the plan in the budget Republicans all voted for?  To deliberately use this tax cut to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. But the Congressional Budget Office, under the Republican administration of this House and of this Congress, says it is going to do $1.7 trillion. They say: Well, let's look at it more dynamically.  If you look more dynamically, it is going to increase the deficit by $2 trillion or $2.5 trillion, because it raises interest rates; it encourages offshore initial investment, stripping economic growth out of the United States, and for a host of reasons I will get to.  The more you look at the tax cut, the more apparent it is that it will cut[[Page H8693]]economic growth and increase the deficit by even more than the $1.7 trillion that the Congressional Budget Office, during Republican control of Congress, is currently estimating.  Why is this?  Well, first, because incentives to invest in the Tax Code have little or no effect on privatization, according to a Congressional Research Service report. The empirical evidence in numerous report shows that the 2003 tax cuts had little impact on investment or employment.                              {time}  1345  Now, I speak with a little bit of experience here because I lived 20 years of my life in the tax world, most of it right at the intersection of investment and tax law.  I sat with families and charged them a large amount per hour to describe what the latest tax law said and what effect it would have on different investments. And my experience as a CPA and tax attorney and certified tax law specialist by my State bar was identical to that of Warren Buffett, who said:       I have worked with investors for 60 years, and I have yet      to see anyone, not even when capital gains rates were 39.9      percent or when they were 15 percent, as they are now, I have      never seen anyone shy away from a sensible investment because      of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make      money, and potential taxes have never scared them off.  Now, that is why, when you look at the effect of this bill, you come to the conclusion, as the Congressional Budget Office did in looking at the Bush tax cuts and whether to extend them or allow them to expire, that, if you have taxes and you use that money to pay the deficit, that does more to help the economy. It is more important to fight the deficit than it is to tell various families, often at the very high end, that they get a tax cut.  Well, let's look at American economic history. I designed this chart here, and I focused it only after the 1986 tax cut for which Ronald Reagan is famous. There were many things about our economy back in the early 1980s, in the 1970s, and in the 1960s that aren't relevant today. We didn't have the trade policies back in the 1970s that we have today.  So we look at the Ronald Reagan 1986 tax policy as slightly adjusted by George H.We look at the policies that we had--I know the 1986 tax law. You think, well, that must have affected 1986. No, it really became effective in 1988. So you look at 1988 to 1993 and you see that we have economic growth of 2.67 percent.  Then, in 1994, you see the effect of the Clinton tax policies adopted in 1993, and we see economic growth of well over 4 percent. And these figures here are real economic growth per year adjusted for inflation, 4.4 percent.  So then George Bush gets elected, and starting in 2001, his tax policies are adopted by this Congress and enacted into law, and we see that economic growth is only 1.7 percent.  Now, those Bush tax policies continued in force until 2013 because Democrats allowed them to stay in force until we finally adopted Obama tax policies, effective in 2013. Those policies continue to be in force right up to today.  The most recent statistics we have are up through September 30 of this year. The economic growth under those policies has been 2.22 percent.  So what we have seen here is that, when we adopt Republican economic policies and they become effective, we have substantially lower economic growth than when we adopt Democratic tax policies and when Democrats actually pass those policies and have the guts to pass those policies and put them into law.  So you have got to admire the Republican They are able to get Member after Member after Member to say, without any proof, that trickle-down economics works, that if you just cut taxes, you somehow help the economy.  It doesn't matter if you can line up 100 Members to say the same falsehood at the same lectern in the same congressional Hall on the same House floor. What matters is the real history. And the real history is that the higher rates imposed under Democratic administrations have not just led to higher tax revenues, they have led to higher rates of economic growth.  Well, why is this?  Well, first, and perhaps most important, is having money available for business investment. There is a pool of savings capital available in our markets and in our economy, and the Republican proposal would come in and scoop $1.2 trillion of that--take it out of the markets, take it out of the banks where it could be lent to small businesses, take it out of the bond markets where it can be used for expansions by big business--and just use it to pay for the tax cuts.  No wonder tax cuts that increase deficits hurt business investment and hurt the economy.  But there is more. We then add to our national debt, and the national debt is forever. Not only do we have the increase in the debt of $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion, but that debt will be here not just 10 years from now; it is there forever. Your great-grandchildren are going to be paying interest on that debt.  Then we have the international impact. You see, their proposal provides for a zero percent U.tax on any money made by any factory as long as you move that factory abroad. If the wage rates are too high in China, you can put it in  Now, in addition to saying you move your factory abroad, you pay zero tax on all the manufacturing profits because that manufacturing is being done abroad, we encourage moving the factory abroad. The work is being done abroad. We don't tax it.  But in addition, what is an area of economic activity where Americans excel? It is the creation of intellectual property.  Well, manufacturing might be done abroad; the design, the patents, the copyrights, the trade names, the marketing plans, the trade secrets, the intellectual property is created here. Under this bill, not only the profit you make on the foreign factory, but the profit you make from all that intellectual property can pay almost a zero percent American tax if you just take that patent and put it in a file in the Cayman  Now, I don't want to say that our current system for taxing international transactions is anything that we can be proud of. The present system, if you make money in a U.factory, there is a tax of 35 percent; you make it in a foreign factory, we also have a tax of 35 percent, but you can defer it. So, right now, if you are just trying to decide where to put the factory, you have got a tax in the United States that you actually have to pay and a tax on a factory abroad that you will pay eventually.  Well, what do they do? That take that 35 percent ``eventually'' tax and turn it into a zero percent ``forever'' tax. How much more incentive could they provide to move American factories overseas?  Now, the present system also has a problem in that you can defer tax only on the money you keep offshore. So their solution is to say, well, bring it onshore. We will provide a little tiny tax on it, and then all the money you made overseas the last 10 or 20 years, no U.tax, and at least the money gets repatriated.  Democrats are anxious to work with Republicans on repatriation. They could probably get a more Republican plan adopted than one that I would endorse in this speech, but why not tax the unrepatriated money? That way we would be saying, bring that money back or don't bring it back, you pay the same tax, so you might as well bring it back.  What we can also do is move to worldwide unitary apportionment: eliminate all the tax gains, and most of them are international; eliminate all the reasons to move factories abroad and generate another $1 trillion every 10 years for our That is the system that we ought to be moving to.  I am not here to say our present system is wonderful. I am here to say that we should not adopt a Republican system because it moves us even further away from what would be a fair system that would not encourage offshoring.  Another way in which we are affected internationally is that this tax bill would change currency values, change the exchange rate between the euro, the yen, the Chinese currency, and other currencies around the world in a way that will encourage Americans to import and discourage those abroad from buying our products--just another economic harm.[[Page H8694]]  Another economic harm is touted by the conservative supporters of this policy. They say that by cutting taxes, we will get the Federal Government and State and local governments to spend less money on infrastructure and education. Well, if you want to ask what is it that makes a country wealthier than others, it is, first and foremost, the education of its workers, and then, second, the infrastructure that is available to productive activity.  In addition, as I mentioned before, they are going to cut the value of homes nationwide, most pronounced in the major metropolitan areas. What does that do to middle class spending, which drives our economy? It drives that middle class spending down. Who is going to go out to a restaurant if you have just been told that you have had a double-digit decline in the value of your home?  This bill will also cause higher interest rates because the Federal Government is going to be borrowing another $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion.  Now, so there is a difference between me and my party leadership. They say that the main reason to vote against this bill is that it is unfair by giving huge tax breaks to the top 1 percent and increasing taxes for millions of American families. I say you should vote against this bill because it is a deficit-exploding, outsourcing-promoting, job-killing, economic growth-depressing bill. But I think we will agree, whether you vote against this bill because it is unfair or you vote against this bill because it is bad for our economy, you will be performing an important service to our country.  Let me not neglect the fact that if you vote--that the bill isn't totally without being useful to somebody. It will reduce taxes for the Donald Trump family by over $1 billion in estate tax and tens of millions of dollars in income tax.  Maybe that is not enough for you. Look at what it will do for the Koch brothers--far more than it will do for the Trump family. So if that is important to you, if that is the result you want to achieve, then vote for the bill.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgH8690.txt,1526,1215,2017,9,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1044,topic-id,385,"Mr.Speaker, it is great to be on the floor today.  It was an awesome opportunity to be a conferee on the National Defense Authorization bill. As a veteran, 5 years active Army Infantry, 23 in the Reserves, I don't get a chance to do that very often because I am on the best committee in Congress, which is Energy and But to be able to be in that process, I am very appreciative to you and to the other conferees.

Even after a conference, it wasn't just right, so the legislative leaders went to work to fix this.  The changes have been identified by both the ranking member and the chairman, but the bottom line is the FDA needs to have the opportunity to look and expedite the drug.

727,topic-id,752,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, H.2810, the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, takes important steps towards strengthening our national security and supporting our troops.  The conference report authorizes a total of $692 billion in discretionary budget authority, $26 billion more than the administration requested.  I am pleased that it raises military pay by 2.4 percent, an increase from the President's request of 2.1 percent.                              {time}  1230  It also strengthens our efforts to counter Russia's campaign to undermine our democracy by fully funding cybersecurity and cyberspace operations at $8 billion and it drops harmful restrictions on funding the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty extension between the United States and This treaty continues a bipartisan tradition that began under President Reagan, verifiably reducing both countries' nuclear arsenals.  Mr.Speaker, there is one glaring problem with this measure, and that is that the Budget Control Act imposes a $549 billion cap on defense spending for fiscal year 2018. This bill blows past that by more than $143 billion. Unless the Senate, the House, and the President come to an agreement on lifting or modifying the budget caps, there is no way that these spending levels can become law. So far, that agreement is not in the offing and it is past time for a bipartisan compromise on realistic spending levels for defense and nondefense spending alike.  While I am glad to see this pay increase for our troops, this legislation does not exist in a vacuum. Later this week, the Republicans plan to bring to the floor a disastrous tax bill that would force military families and veterans to finance tax cuts for corporations and the superwealthy. The bill repeals tax credits that help veterans find employment. It makes education more expensive for veterans and undermines the GI It makes it more expensive for military families to sell their homes. It eliminates tax relief for veterans suffering from chronic illnesses.  Veterans Day was just a few days ago, Mr.Speaker, and it is no way for the majority to thank them for their service.  Also before us today is H.2874, which is known as the 21st Century Flood Reform Now, everybody in this Chamber recognizes the National Flood Insurance Program is badly in debt, to the tune of $25 billion. The hurricanes this year, together with the flooding across Louisiana last year, have stretched the program beyond its breaking point.  Unfortunately, this package will cause more harm than good for the communities already struggling to rebuild. It will make flood insurance more expensive for families by increasing premiums.  It also exempts businesses from the requirement to purchase flood insurance even though the vast majority of policyholders with this insurance only purchase it because they are required to by law. This change would take effect beginning in January 2019.  The Independent Community Bankers and a number of other groups oppose this provision. As businesses pull out of the insurance market and the number of participating dwindles, responsible businesses that stay in the market will be forced to bear the burden of greatly increased premiums. I think these are shortsighted changes that will be felt all across the insurance market.  Additionally, the legislation doesn't do enough to update the often out-of-date flood insurance rate maps being used in communities across the country and in my district. Accurate flood insurance maps prepared with the most recent mapping technologies would help constituents in all of our districts better prepare and protect themselves against flooding. Some current maps are so outdated that the maps don't reflect changing landscapes and critical flood mitigation improvements. This bill simply falls short in helping homeowners who want to do the right thing based off the best available information.  We are in the wake of some of the worst hurricanes our Nation has ever experienced, and more of them. We are seeing how vital, affordable, and readily available flood insurance is to so many communities. It is unconscionable that the majority is moving forward with this partisan package of bills, unlikely to ever pass the Senate, because this will only further delay the extension of the program with 1 month left before it expires.  As the majority lurches from crisis to crisis and fritters away precious legislative time with this partisan approach, we will likely find ourselves right back here doing this over again in  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

752,topic-id,445,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, the National Defense Authorization Act isn't perfect. Most notably, it blows past the caps implemented under the Budget Control But there are areas of common ground in this bill, including a pay raise for our military and investments to fill the genuine readiness gaps in our Armed  I want to point out that they are the result of something that is all too often nonexistent under the majority, and that is regular order. I agree with what my colleague said, to see a bill under regular order is a downright joy. I hope we do more of it.  A hearing and a markup were held for this bill and colleagues from both sides of the aisle were consulted. That is how the Chamber was designed to function, but, today, it hardly functions like that at all.  It is a shame that we don't also see the majority put this model to use for other major legislation like healthcare and tax reform, which we will be rushing through to get to tomorrow.  This is a process that we didn't see for the other measure before us today, which is H.2874. No hearing was ever held on the package in its entirety. It was changed right up until it was considered by the Rules Committee earlier this week in an effort not to get Democrat support, but to get enough support from Members of the majority so that it could pass on a party-line vote.  That is what we see under this leadership: no hearings and rarely any markups.  Legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would impact one-sixth of our economy, was passed without so much as a score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office outlining its impacts and its costs.  This Congress has broken the record for the use of closed rules, which prevents any amendments from being offered by either side on the House floor. It is now the most closed Congress ever.  In fact, one of the rules before us right now is closed. We are even likely to consider the majority's bipartisan tax plan this week--actually, tomorrow--which would increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion, yet under another closed rule and without scoring.  The United States Congress has been called the greatest deliberative body in the world. I think it is time the majority change course and actually allow the great debates about the issues that we face. The legislation we consider would certainly be better for it.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, the rule, and the bill; and I yield back the balance of my time.

204,topic-id,325,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.[[Page H9206]]I strongly believe that this bipartisan bill puts us on a course towards readiness recovery, ensuring that our military is fully equipped, trained, and supported.  As the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I am especially proud of our contributions to ensure proper resourcing and authorities for cyber warfare, safeguarding our technological superiority and defense innovation, enabling Special Operations Forces to counter terrorism and irregular warfare threats around the world, and energizing programs and activities that counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction.  I would specifically like to highlight what our subcommittee has achieved this year in the areas of cyber warfare and cyber operations. Our emphasis on cyber has carried three broad themes:  First, we increase congressional oversight of cyber operations by including H.2807, a bill introduced by myself, Ranking Member Langevin, Chairman Thornberry, and Ranking Member Smith, which will ensure Congress is kept fully informed of sensitive military cyber operations. We also require a cyber posture review to clarify U.cyber deterrence policy and strategy.  Second, we bolster international partnerships for cyber warfare to counter aggressive adversaries such as Russia, China, and North This includes support for our NATO partners and those within the Asia-Pacific region to enhance partnered cyber capabilities and information sharing, and to counter and mitigate adversarial propaganda efforts and information warfare campaigns.  Third, the bill continues to build and enhance our U.cyber warfare capabilities and activities--principally within U.Cyber Command, but also across our government--with the services and within the intelligence community. This includes resiliency of Department of Defense networks, weapons systems, and supply chains.  Furthermore, Mr.Speaker, this bill reinforces counterterrorism and unconventional warfare capabilities by fully resourcing U.Special Operations Command's programs and activities, including ongoing efforts in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Eastern  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

512,topic-id,2197,"Mr.President, as you know, I have been coming to the Senate floor pretty much every week for month after month to highlight someone in my State whom we call the Alaskan of the It is someone who does something important, either for their community or the State or the country, and oftentimes they don't get a lot of recognition. The purpose of this is to say: Look at what these people are doing for Alaska, for America, for their community.  My State is known for many things: its physical beauty, incredible hunting and fishing, adventuresome spirit, size--you don't want me going there. I have difficult conversations with my colleagues from Texas on occasion about the different sizes of our respective States, but I will not go into detail[[Page S7149]]here. These are all things we have in Alaskan space, but the thing that really makes us a great place to live is our people--strong, resilient, kind people all across our State who look out for each other, often in harsh weather conditions.  We are a patriotic I know everybody here claims that, and that is great. We all are.  Nowhere is the spirit of sacrifice and patriotism more apparent than in our veterans across the In Alaska, in Missouri--the Presiding Officer's State--we are all celebrating that, and we are going to celebrate that this weekend, going home for Veterans  In Alaska, we like to talk about our veterans. We also like to talk about the fact that we have more veterans per capita than any other State in the country. So it is a very patriotic place--full of service.  In every city, village, and every community across Alaska, you will find proud veterans, many of them working tirelessly together to make sure they get the help and support that our veterans need. A lot of times that happens with the older vets--Vietnam-era vets. They come to make sure the new vets get the help they need.  To all of them: I salute your service and your sacrifice. Thank you so much for all you have done and continue to do for our country. Happy Veterans Day to all of Alaska's veterans. I can't wait to get home to celebrate in Fairbanks and Anchorage this weekend.  It is not just Veterans Day that is approaching in This month we are also celebrating Alaska Native Heritage Month, where there is much to celebrate. Almost 20 percent of the population of our great State is Alaska This is a group of people who, generation after generation, have what I call a special patriotism.  What do I mean by that? Well, Alaska Natives serve at higher rates in the military--just like the lower 48. Native Americans have higher rates in the military than any other ethnic group in the country. This has been going on for generations--World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Cold War, Iraq, and When you think about it, it is special.  Let's face it. In the forties, fifties, sixties, and seventies, even sometimes, unfortunately, today, the Federal Government has not always treated Alaska Natives well. Yet, generation after generation, they go off to the front to fight for this country. It is truly a special kind of patriotism and a unique tribute to the Alaska Native heritage we are supporting and celebrating this month.  I thought it was fitting today to name as our Alaskan of the Week--to make it a collective tribute for all Alaska Natives who have served their country in the military, and it is thousands, to make them collectively the Alaskans of the Week as we look to celebrate Veterans  Mr.President, here is a little bit of history. I know you know this, but a lot of Americans don't. During World War II, Alaska was the only State in the Union to be invaded and occupied by the Japanese, so we had big military battles in the Aleutian Island chain of Alaska to throw off the invaders of our American territory. Thousands of Alaska Natives volunteered to protect their homeland and to defend their country overseas. Across the State, whether they were in the Alaska Territorial Guard, warriors overseas, code talkers who served with the Marines and others--they were as old as 80 and as young as 12.  This is a great story. It shows the warrior ethic. Alaska Native women, after the outbreak of World War II, originally enrolled in the Alaska Territorial Guard before they realized that women weren't allowed to enroll. In fact, the best sharpshooter in Alaska's Territorial Guard was a woman named Laura Beltz Wright of Haycock,  Here is how the late, great Jerome Trigg--an Alaska Native and a marine--put it in 1968, at the height of the Vietnam war, when he was testifying in front of the U.Congress on a very important piece of legislation called the Alaska Native Claims Settlement He was the president of the Arctic Native Brotherhood and, as I mentioned, a proud marine.  In front of a bunch of Senators, he stated as follows:       We have showed our patriotism as proudly as any Americans      on earth. We have answered the call of duty with pride in      serving [our country]. We answered the call in [World War] II      100 percent. Every man in every village--old and young--     volunteered with the Alaska National  Remember, this was in 1968 that he was testifying. Then he said:       I have never heard of an Alaska Native burning the draft      card or burning our nation's flag.  We are patriots. That service, as I mentioned, didn't end after World War Alaska Natives have served in every conflict--the Korean war and in droves during the Vietnam war.  I was honored to be in Southeast Alaska this past summer in a Native village called It is a beautiful place. There was a documentary I saw recently. It documented the classes in 1968 and 1969 in that small Native village in a film called ``Hunting and Wartime.'' It was about how almost every single male high school student in Hoonah--every one--went to go fight in That is incredible. It is special patriotism.  Let me tell you a quick, more up-to-date story. We had the Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke--a combat vet, a Navy SEAL, a heroic man himself--come to Alaska this summer. I asked him to meet with a bunch of Alaska Native veterans, particularly our Vietnam veterans, who had an issue that the Department of Interior has been working on for years. I wanted him to hear about it firsthand.  It was a very touching meeting. Some in the room talked about what it was like to be in their villages--places they had never left--when they were 17 and 18 and 19. Then, a few days later, they were in a steamy jungle, thousands and thousands of miles away, in Some talked about what it was like coming back and not feeling that they had the support of their country, others talked about the difficulty of readjusting to life back in Alaska after their service in Vietnam and some of the discrimination they received when they came back home, but even though they went through this hardship, even though they went through some of these very difficult times in the late sixties and early seventies, not one of them said they had made a mistake in serving their country. They were proud, patriotic warriors, and to this day that is what they are.  Secretary Zinke said, after he left that meeting, he began it as their Secretary of Interior, and he left as a brother in arms.  I am so honored to be able to serve these great Alaskans and to celebrate them as our Alaskans of the Week, just like I know everybody in America is going to be proud to go home and celebrate with their veterans.  Once again, for our Alaska Native veterans, thank you for all you have done for our country, and thank you for being our Alaskans of the                                 Energy  Mr.President, I just want to come down to the floor and say a few words about a debate that has been going on in the Congress right now, and that involves the importance of more energy for the United  We had a hearing last week on the possibility of opening a very small portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge called the 1002 area--you see it here in the picture--which would be a win-win-win for the United It would help create jobs, it would grow the economy, it would increase energy security, and it would also help protect the global environment and strengthen our Nation's national security. These are the two issues I want to touch on this afternoon.  We have the highest environmental standards regarding responsible resource development anyplace in the world. I was actually in charge of these standards as Alaska's commissioner of the Department of Natural I could tell you, whether it was no impact exploration--what we call that in Alaska--or specific requirements relating to our incredible species, like polar bear or caribou or mandating the best available technology, we have an over 50-year record of responsible resource development in our  Let me just give you one example, what we call no impact exploration. On the North Slope of Alaska, we only allow for exploration activities during the winter months. So what does that mean? Companies actually create ice roads and ice pads, where they drive along the tundra with equipment and[[Page S7150]]with drill rigs to go explore all on ice. They do that for about 4 months during the winter, then they leave. When the spring comes, there is literally zero impact on the tundra--zero impact.  Yet some of my colleagues, particularly my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, have been coming down here for weeks talking about issues with regard to Alaska and the environment and energy. With all due respect, they are using talking points that are about 40 years old.  When we had the hearing recently, the ranking member of the ENR Committee said nothing has changed. Well, everything has changed--the technology, the high standards. The only thing that has not changed are some of the talking points the other side has been using for the last 40 years.  Let me just give you one example. On the bill the Energy and Natural Resources Committee recently put up with regard to exploration in the 1002 area--this is all of ANWR, I believe about the size of This is the wilderness area of This is the 1002 area, the coastal area of ANWR that was set aside by Congress to look at the possibility of exploring a very resource-rich area of the country. This red dot--you can barely see it--is a surface area of 2,000 acres--2,000 acres. That is what the bill would say. It would limit development of this area to 2,000 acres.  For a little perspective, Dulles airport is 12,000 acres. This would be about 10 percent of Dulles airport. That is it. That is the surface footprint. Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been coming out and talking about millions and millions of acres, so it is important that we push back.  Here is the big issue for those in Congress who want to continually shut down resource development in Alaska that they never acknowledge: When you disallow investment in Alaska, which has the highest standards in the world on the environment, you don't end up protecting the environment. You just drive capital investment, exploration, and development activities to jurisdictions in the world with little to no environmental protection--countries like Nigeria, Venezuela, Iran, Russia, many of which are our geopolitical foes.  In conclusion, what we are looking to do on the Senate floor with regard to producing more energy for this country is going to help with regard to jobs, it is going to help with regard to energy security, it is going to help with regard to national security, and, yes, it is going to help with regard to protecting the global environment because we have the highest standards in the world, and we do it right in  If we are not doing it here, there will be activities in other countries, other jurisdictions where they don't care about the environment the way we do. So we need to move forward on this important element of the energy and natural resource bill that was introduced today in the committee. I encourage all of my colleagues to support that bill.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The majority leader.  Mr.Mr.President, I was listening carefully to the remarks of my friend from Alaska, and I am very much supportive of the effort to open up this small footprint in the Alaskan wilderness. It struck me that my friend from Alaska is right on point when he said the only talking points that haven't changed are the ones on the other side from 40 years ago. The advances in technology are truly impressive, and the opportunity not only for Alaska but for America to realize these natural resources is something very important to the country. I thank my friend for pointing that out.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-09-pt1-PgS7138-2.txt,2290,COMMEMORATING VETERANS OF THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS AND THROUGHOUT THE,2017,9,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
812,topic-id,882,"Mr.President, I thank Senator Rounds, and I appreciate all my colleagues coming down to the floor. A lot of my colleagues are from the class of 2014.  Mr.President, there has been a theme in this colloquy. We have been talking about economic growth and about this challenge of what I have been referring to as a lost decade of economic growth. When talking about tax reform, we have to go back through the history and see what is meant by a lost decade.  I have been coming down to the floor for a couple of years now with this chart. This chart says a lot. This chart looks at the history of the United States and where we have been with regard to economic growth. It is bipartisan--Democratic and Republican administrations--showing decade after decade, starting with Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and what this chart states is that right now, something is wrong.  When we talk about GDP growth, GDP growth is a proxy for the health of the economy. Unfortunately, we have had a sick economy. GDP growth is a proxy for the American dream, and unfortunately I think that a lot of people over the last 10 years started to worry about whether it was something that can be obtained.  Let's look at the chart. Every administration, Democratic or Republican, shows strong levels of growth. My colleagues were talking about at least 3 percent or higher since the Great Some of these years, during Kennedy and Johnson, right here, the red line is at 3 percent, which is not great, but it is pretty good. Looking at Reagan and Carter, there were years in which we were growing at 4, 5, 6, and 7 percent.  The pages are looking at this chart, and they don't even know what that means. They don't know what that means because of what has happened over the last 12 years. Look at this. Everything is under 3 percent for the entire Obama administration years. It never hit 3 percent GDP growth--not once.  We want to talk about what makes America great. If we want to see what makes America great, look at these years of growth. It doesn't matter whether it was Democratic or Republican--3, 4, 5, 8 percent during the Johnson administration. Now look--3 percent.  What is surprising to me is that nobody talks about this issue. Nobody talks about this issue of a lost decade of growth. Certainly, unfortunately, my colleagues--I have been here 3 years. I don't think I have heard my colleagues once come down to the Senate floor and say: Holy cow, we have to fix this lost decade of growth, this sick economy. The proxy for the American dream is going away, and nobody talks about it.  Former Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently wrote a book titled ``What Happened.'' Well, I think what happened is that there has been no growth for over 10 years, and nobody was talking about it. I think a lot of people in this country said: I am not going to throw away the American dream.  I believe in the American dream. The American dream means we have to start growing at traditional levels of U.economic growth, at least above this depicted red line of 3 percent. I am optimistic because right now, for the first time in a long time, this body is very focused on this issue with policies that will hopefully get us there, including tax reform, regulatory reform, taking advantage of our huge energy opportunities, and many other measures. That is why this discussion and this debate we are having now with regard to tax reform is so critical--tax relief for middle-class families, tax relief for small businesses. And this bill, as we have heard, has many provisions that we think are going to help jump-start this economy and get us back to at least 3 percent growth, at least this number where the red line is that we haven't seen in well over a decade.  The kinds of policies that we are pursuing now, that the White House is focused on--tax reform, energy, permitting reform--I would think and hope that every Member of this body views this as probably the most important thing we can do--growing the U.economy with policies that have widespread support across the country. They certainly have support in my State of  I am also optimistic because the Trump administration is off to a good start. This chart goes to the end of the Obama administration, and we can see that we never came even close to 3 percent. But the last two quarters of 2017,[[Page S7241]]we actually hit 3 percent--3.1 percent and 3 percent. We are off to a decent start.  But this body must do much more, and I am hopeful that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will come down and talk about how important this is because every American agrees with this. Growing the economy again and tax reform are going to be critical components of getting us there.  I say to Senator Rounds, I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words on this important topic. We will be down here again, but growth, growth, growth has to be what we are focused on.

552,topic-id,687,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Garamendi for bringing this Special Order to the floor today.  Mr.Speaker, I am here to point out the unfairness of the Republican-led bill for tax reform, as they claim, that would be devastating to New York's middle class families.  I want the people at home to know that the U.Conference of Catholic Bishops have said:  ``This proposal appears to be the first Federal income tax modification in American history that will raise income taxes on the working poor while simultaneously providing a large tax cut to the wealthy.''[[Page H9242]]  Mr.Speaker, this bill is flawed and unfair on many levels. One thing I have learned since taking office back in January, here in this Congress, is how very different the regions of this country are. It is different from State to State and it is different from place to place. The amount of money that people make in different regions is different. Their cost of living is different, their property tax bills are different, and their State income taxes are as different as night and day.  There are now 105 million full-time jobs in the United States of Fifty-nine million of those jobs pay less than $50,000 a year. Eighty-six million of those 105 million full-time jobs pay less than $75,000 per year. In my district, the average salary is actually higher than that, but so are their property taxes, so are their income taxes, and so is there cost of living.  While this bill could be a net positive for some Americans in many regions--in my region and in many other regions, and in my State and my district specifically--this bill is a huge net negative for middle class families.  One particularly devastating element of this proposal is the elimination of the State and local tax deduction that would be patently unfair to the over 250,000 hardworking families in my district that rely on that important deduction. New Yorkers claim the State tax deduction more than just about any other In my district, we have more people in the State than any other place that claim the State and local tax deduction. It is the top 10 of the  Let's look at the some of the specifics of what actually happens in my district:  People making between $50,000 and $75,000 in my hometown of Glen Cove will see a 39 percent tax increase. In my hometown of Glen Cove, a family that makes between $100,000 and $200,000 will pay, roughly, $2,100 more in taxes under this plan.  In Huntington, every single family making over $50,000 a year will see a tax increase. Every family in Huntington making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year will see--get this--a 135 percent increase on what they currently pay. Every family making between $100,000 and $200,000 a year will see a $3,000 tax increase.  In Whitestone, every individual tax filer making $50,000 or more will see a tax increase, regardless of their income.  Mr.Speaker, the evidence is crystal clear for people in my district and in many places throughout this country.  This tax reform plan, as it is called, is a punch in the gut to middle class taxpayers. These are hardworking people who deserve to be lifted up, not slapped down, by draconian tax increases that offset tax cuts going to the superrich.  How could anyone support a bill that targets our middle class in such a way is unfathomable. When I was elected to Congress, I came here ready and willing to work--and I still stand ready and willing to work--across party lines to get things done, even tax reform. I want to see tax reform in this country, but I can't compromise my values. I can't let down the families in my district who are going to be hurt by this plan.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try to do what is right: protect the hardworking Americans--the hardworking New Yorkers--who play by the rules and ask for very little in return by voting against this ill-conceived legislation, and protect the State and local tax deduction for our middle class.

1027,topic-id,172,"Mr.Speaker, most Americans would be outraged to learn that hundreds, if not thousands, of veterans have been deported after serving honorably in the United States military, but this is the shocking truth about our broken immigration system.  These unjust deportations of veterans are still occurring. Let me cite the case of Chong Hwan Kim, a South Korean immigrant who has lived in this country since he was 5 years old. In 2009, he was deployed to Iraq and was honorably discharged a year later. Legal permanent residents qualify for citizenship if they serve just one day on Active Duty during a time of war.  Suffering from PTSD and facing the same challenges that many veterans face reintegrating into society, Kim broke the law, and because he never completed the process of becoming a citizen, he currently awaits deportation.  Veterans like Chong Hwan Kim deserve better. They deserve the dignity and respect that we afford to all who serve, and they deserve to enjoy the rights they risked their lives to protect.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9268.txt,2110,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally, I want to express my appreciation for the opportunity to work with Mr.Smith and with our colleagues in the Senate, Senator McCain and Senator  We do not always agree among the four of us; in fact, we disagree sometimes energetically, but I have no doubt that each of them is committed to doing the right thing for our troops and the right thing for our country. Each of them is a patriot whom I admire.  Mr.Speaker, I know that I speak for all Members when we wish Senator McCain the best in dealing with his current health challenges.  Members and the public were given a summary of this conference report last week, so I will simply say that I believe the priorities in this bill are, number one, our people; number two, the readiness; number three, missile defense; and number four, reform to see that we are more capable of meeting the security challenges our country faces in the future and today.  In that regard, I especially want to commend the work of Mr.Rogers and Mr.Cooper and the Strategic Forces Subcommittee on space. They initiated deep, far-reaching reforms based on a real sense of urgency, and they are in this bill. Their work exemplifies the work of our committee: bipartisan, really nonpartisan, on the national security challenges the U.faces today.  Mr.Speaker, unfortunately, as the world grew more dangerous, we cut our defense budget and we added to the burden borne by the men and women who serve us.  We will not rebuild and fix our problems in 1 year or one bill, even when it is matched by an appropriations bill, which this will need to be, but we can head in the right direction. That is what this conference report does, and I hope Members will support it.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

227,topic-id,1204,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, I, again, want to thank all the Members who have participated in this debate, and even more importantly, all the Members who have contributed to this product, especially the members of the Armed Services Truthfully, Members from both sides of the aisle throughout the House have contributed to it.  We have spent several moments here talking about a lot of the details that are in this bill. Mr.Speaker, it is a rather large bill. It covers everything from how much we pay our troops to how many ships and tanks and planes and bullets we buy, as well as what we research and various policies of the Department of So there is a lot in here.  Let me take a moment just to step back and remind everybody what this is all about. Our Constitution says one of the reasons we have a Federal Government is to provide for the common defense. As a matter of fact, I think that is the first job of the Federal Government: to defend the country, to defend our lives, and to defend our freedoms.  As a matter of fact, Article I, section 8 of the Constitution says specifically it is this Congress' responsibility to build and support, provide and maintain the military forces of the United States of That is our job.  By passing this bill, that is how we fulfill that job. But as we have talked about, what has happened in recent years is the world has grown more dangerous. Yet we have cut the defense budget.  As a matter of fact, we are spending 18 percent less now on defense than was spent in 2010, if you measure it in real terms, apples to apples. I cannot think of another significant Federal program that has been cut nearly 20 percent over the last 7 years, yet that is what has happened in defense.[[Page H9209]]  What has happened as a result of that?  Our troops have borne the burden. We are 2,000 pilots short in the Air Force today. Sixty percent of the F-18s in the Navy and Marine Corps cannot fly today.  As Mr.Wilson said, we have just seen tragic accidents in the Pacific, where 17 soldiers have lost their lives. We have had other accidents where others have lost their lives and other accidents where they have not.  The point I am trying to make is that part of the responsibility for all of that happening rests here with the Congress of the United States not fulfilling adequately, in my view, its job under the  I would say one more thing, Mr.I agree with virtually all of what the ranking member said about the importance of having a strategy and then resourcing that strategy. It is true.  We have not had--and there is some responsibility with administrations of both parties--a coherent strategy that holds together and resources that flow from that. We should.  The fundamental issue is that it is morally wrong to send men and women out on missions with our military for which they are not fully supported, fully trained, and equipped with the best equipment our country can provide. It is wrong for us to do it, and that is exactly what has been happening.  As I mentioned at the beginning, we are not going to turn this around in a single bill or a single year, but we can make a start. This bill makes a start.  I will absolutely agree with the gentleman from Washington and others that we can't really start to turn this around without an appropriations bill that follows it, that matches it, and that really does repair our ships and planes, increases our end-strength, and provides the training that I believe we deserve to give to the men and women who serve.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, I would just remind everyone that there are really two reasons we do this bill. One is that we owe it to the people who risk their lives to defend us. Secondly, for the national security of the United  The challenges to our Nation's security have grown more ominous in recent years, certainly more complex than at any time in our lifetimes. This is, I believe, a real opportunity on a bipartisan basis to show the troops that we support them and to show adversaries and allies alike that the United States is going to stand up and defend ourselves by passing this piece of legislation and by following it up with a budget agreement and an appropriations bill that follows.  That is what I think the Constitution requires of us. I hope my colleagues will agree and support this conference report.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I am outraged that for the third consecutive year, an amendment to create a service medal for our Atomic Veterans has been dropped from the NDAA Conference I find this particularly shocking as this amendment, which I offered with my Republican colleague, Congressman Tom Emmer, was approved by the House unanimously by a vote of 424-0.  It is unclear to me why our colleagues in the Senate are determined to deprive our Atomic Veterans this most basic recognition of their honorable service.  Between 1945 and 1962, about 225,000 members of our Armed Forces participated in hundreds of nuclear weapons tests. These GIs were placed in extremely dangerous areas and were constantly exposed to potentially dangerous levels of radiation in performance of their duties. They were sworn to secrecy, unable to even talk to their doctors about their past exposure to radiation.  Thankfully, Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.Bush recognized the Atomic Veterans' valiant service, and acted to provide specialized care and compensation for their harrowing duty.  In 2007, our allies Great Britain, New Zealand and Australia enacted their versions of this amendment by authorizing a medal to honor their Atomic Veterans who served with the United  Regrettably, the Pentagon remains silent on honoring the service of our Atomic Veterans, arguing that to do so would diminish the service of other military personnel who are tasked with dangerous missions. Mr.Speaker, this is a pitiful excuse.  Tragically, more than 75 percent of Atomic Veterans have already passed away, never having received this recognition. They served honorably and kept a code of silence that most certainly led to many of these veterans passing away prematurely.  Past Administrations and Congresses have dealt with the thornier issues of legality and compensation. What remains is recognizing these veterans' duty, honor and faithful service to our nation. And time is running out.  I thank my colleagues here in the House for supporting this amendment. With their continued support, I hope we can convince the Senate or the Pentagon to finally do the right thing, before it's too late. We owe it to our veterans to honor them for their selfless service to our nation.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Duncan of Tennessee). All time for debate has expired.  Pursuant to House Resolution 616, the previous question is ordered on the conference report.  The question is on the conference report.

259,topic-id,1102,"Mr.President, I have sought recognition to note last night's strong bipartisan vote of 90 to 7 to confirm Derek Kan's nomination. I am very happy that Mr.Kan is now able to take up the duties of Under Secretary for Transportation Policy at the Department of Transportation after a long, entirely unnecessary delay. As I stated on the floor last week, it is truly unfortunate that it took 4 months and the engagement of the cloture process to confirm this well-qualified nominee, who obviously has strong bipartisan support.  I hope that last night's vote will signal to those who are holding other well-qualified nominees to the Department--including the nomination of Ronald Batory to be Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration and the nomination of Adam Sullivan to be Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Legislative Affairs--over funding for the multibillion dollar Gateway Project in New York and New Jersey that their strategy is misplaced and depriving the Department of the very expertise needed to make progress on Gateway and a host of other critical issues.  Mr.President, I have also sought recognition to voice my strong support for the nomination of Steven Bradbury to be general counsel at the U.Department of Mr.Bradbury has had an extraordinary legal career in both the private and public sector, and he is well prepared to address the many challenging legal questions that will come before the  Mr.Bradbury is currently a litigation partner at the Dechert law firm here in Washington, DC, and his practice focuses on regulatory enforcement and investigations, rulemakings, and judicial review of agency actions, as well as appellate cases and antitrust matters.  From 2005 to 2009, Mr.Bradbury headed the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice, the office that provides essential legal advice to the President and the heads of executive departments and agencies.  In that role, he received the Edmund Randolph Award and the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service, among other awards. Before serving in the Justice Department, he worked in private practice for 10 years and clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas on the U.Supreme Court and for Judge James Buckley on the D. On June 28, 2017, the Commerce Committee held a hearing on his nomination, and we reported his nomination favorably on August 2. Last night, the Senate invoked cloture on his nomination.  At his nomination hearing, a number of our Democrat colleagues raised concerns over Mr.Bradbury's suitability for this position, mostly focusing on a number of opinions he wrote regarding interrogation policies while at the Justice  I do not doubt the sincerity of those who question the Bush administration's approach to detainee treatment in the wake of the horrific attacks of 9/11. I know that these concerns are not limited to a single party.  Nevertheless, I would suggest that Mr.Bradbury has demonstrated a willingness to reexamine the difficult decisions made at that time in a manner that underscores the thoughtfulness he would bring to the position to which he has been nominated.  For example, after he became the head of the Office of Legal Counsel in 2004, he participated in decisions to withdraw and supersede previous legal opinions addressing interrogation policies that had been issued by his predecessors.  In response to questions for the record from some of my committee colleagues, Mr.Bradbury elaborated on this topic. Specifically, he said:       I support the McCain-Feinstein Amendment, enacted by      Congress in 2015, which mandates that all agencies of the      U.government are limited to use of the Army Field Manual      in the interrogation of detainees and which prohibits the use      of physical coercion. I believe the McCain-Feinstein      Amendment represents a historic policy decision and a moral      judgment for the United States, and it reaffirms America's      leadership on interrogation policy and practice. The clear      mandate of the McCain-Feinstein Amendment appropriately      elevates and vindicates the compelling principle of      reciprocity in the treatment of captured U.service men and      women.  Mr.Bradbury went on to say:       Twelve years ago, when I was called upon to advise on the      legality of proposed interrogation policies for use by      intelligence officers, the McCain-Feinstein Amendment had not      been enacted, and it was understood at that time that      intelligence agencies operated under a different, less well      defined, legal regime from the U.Armed I did my      best to pull back previous OLC opinions that were overly      broad or otherwise flawed; to limit OLC's advice to the      narrowest grounds necessary and avoid reliance on expansive      interpretations of presidential power; to spell out very      clearly the specific factual assumptions on which the advice      depended, including the particular conditions, limitations,      and safeguards that were required as part of the policies;      and to describe in detail the specifics of those policies so      that the senior decision makers on the Principals Committee      of the National Security Council would be fully apprised of      precisely what they were being asked to approve.       The OLC opinions I prepared on these issues are no longer      operative, and the law has changed. I welcome the statutory      changes enacted by  In sum, I believe that Mr.Bradbury has fully addressed these concerns.  It is also worth noting that Mr.Bradbury's nomination has received the endorsement of many bipartisan leaders. During his confirmation process, the committee received letters of support signed by more than 50 former government officials, including former Transportation Secretaries Rodney Slater and Norm Mineta; former Attorneys General Ed Meese, William Barr, and Michael Mukasey; former counsel to the President Fred Fielding; former National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley; former Solicitors General Ted Olson, Paul Clement, Greg Garre; and many others. He also received the support of nearly 20 State attorneys general from across the country.  Finally, I would also like to address the concerns raised about Mr.Bradbury's representation of the U.subsidiary of Takata in connection with the airbag inflator ruptures before the National Highway Traffic Safety  Mr.Bradbury has agreed to go beyond the requirements of his ethics agreement to recuse himself from all aspects of the Takata airbag inflator recalls for the duration of Mr.Bradbury's tenure as general counsel at the Department of  Because Mr.Bradbury has agreed to go well beyond what is required by federal ethics laws and regulations, and well beyond the ethics agreement he signed with the Office of Government Ethics with respect to the Takata airbag inflator recall, I am satisfied that he has more than adequately dealt with conflict of interest concerns and recusals.  Moreover, as I have noted, Mr.Bradbury has received bipartisan support for his nomination, including from former Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and former Transportation Secretary Norm  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Steven Bradbury to be general counsel for the Department of  ",CREC-2017-11-14-pt1-PgS7186-4.txt,1534,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1, TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT, AND",2017,14,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
500,topic-id,626,"Mr.President, it is a good day here in the Senate because today we released our tax reform legislation, and soon we hope to have a final bill on the President's desk.  When you first think about coming to Washington to serve, you dream about fixing big problems and making a real difference in people's lives. Well, today we get to make a big difference.  When I look at the Chamber, I hearken back to 1986, which was the last time tax reform was actually passed through the Senate and signed into law by the Senator Hatch, the chairman of our committee, was a Member of the Senate at that time; Senator McConnell, the Republican leader; Senator Grassley, whom you just heard from--they were all here to vote on that. I was here as a young staffer. At that time, I didn't have kids of my own, and today I am a grandfather. So a lot of time has passed, and tax reform is long overdue.  The whole point of this exercise is to give hope to future generations of Americans, to give them a better opportunity at a better life, to improve their standard of living and their quality of life. In order for that to happen, we need to be taking the steps here and putting policies in place that will create the conditions that are favorable to economic growth and to the creation of better paying jobs and higher wages.  Today we get to bring relief to the parents who are wondering if they will be able to afford a new car that they need to fit their growing family. Today we get to bring relief to the single mom who is wondering how she is going to pay the rent next month. As our colleague from South Carolina talked about, those parents and families who are literally living paycheck to paycheck. Today, we get to bring relief to the middle-aged couple worrying about a secure retirement, to the small business owner who doesn't know how he will meet his tax bill and still make his mortgage payment, to the family farmer who is worried that he will not be able to pass down his farm to his daughter.  The comprehensive tax reform legislation we have introduced today will provide immediate, direct relief to hard-working It will immediately increase their take-home pay. It will immediately simplify the Tax Code so that it is easier for Americans to figure out what benefits they qualify for so they don't have to spend a lot of time and money filing their taxes.  That is really just the beginning. Our bill is also going to reform the business side of the Tax Code to give Americans access to the jobs, the wages, and the opportunities that will set them up for a secure future. We are going to make it easier for small businesses to raise wages and to hire new workers. We are going to end the outdated tax framework that is driving American companies to keep jobs and profits overseas, and we are going to make it easier for companies to invest in American jobs and American workers.  It has been a rough few years for our economy and for the American people. A lot of Americans haven't had a pay raise literally in almost a decade. But with this tax reform legislation, we can ensure that it doesn't stay that way.  The American people deserve a tax code that works for them and not against them, that grows their paychecks instead of shrinking them, that expands their opportunities instead of eliminating them, and that is exactly what we are going to give them starting today.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

516,topic-id,1488,"Thank you, Mr.                              Tax Reform  Mr.President, on Sunday, Politico offered this headline: ``Middle class biggest winners in Senate tax plan, study says.''  The article goes on to say: ``Moderate-income people would consistently see the largest percentage declines in their tax bills, according to an analysis released late Saturday by the official, nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.''  It goes on to say: ``In 2019, people in the middle spectrum, earning between $50,000 and $70,000, would see their taxes fall by 7.1 percent. Those earning between $20,000 and $30,000 would see a 10.4 percent decline.''  This is what we set out to achieve with the Senate tax bill that we released last week--real relief for American families, and that is what our bill delivers.  I don't need to tell anyone that the American people have had a rough few years. Stagnant wages and a lack of opportunities have left many American families stretched thin. A recent survey found that 50 percent--50 percent--of people out there consider themselves to be living paycheck to paycheck. About one-third of those same people say that they are literally just $400 away from a financial crisis. Well, real help is on the way.  Last night, Chairman Hatch released a revised bill that provides even more relief for middle-class families. I applaud Chairman Hatch for his work on this revised bill that includes Republican and Democratic amendments and reflects feedback we have received from the whole Republican conference.  Our bill provides immediate, direct relief to hard-working Our bill doubles the standard deduction. That means, beginning in January, a family making $24,000 a year or less per year will not be paying any taxes, and families making more than $24,000 per year will be paying significantly less than what they are paying today.  Our bill also doubles the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child. We all know that raising children is expensive, and this provision provides a significant tax cut for families across the country.[[Page S7227]]  I wish to thank Senators Scott, Heller, Rubio, and Lee for their leadership on this issue. Their advocacy for expanding the child tax credit will result in substantial tax relief for working families, but that is just the beginning of what this tax bill is going to do for American families.  We are not just going to ensure that Americans can keep more of their hard-earned money; we are also going to ensure that they can make more of it. Our bill is not just going to cut Americans' taxes, as important as that priority is to all of us; it is also going to give Americans access to the kinds of jobs, wages, and opportunities that will set them up for a secure future.  So how does that work? Well, in order for individual Americans to thrive economically, we need American businesses to thrive. Thriving businesses create jobs. They provide opportunities, and they increase wages and invest in their workers. But our current Tax Code is not helping businesses thrive. It is doing the opposite. It is strangling both large and small businesses with high tax rates.  Small businesses are incredibly important for new job creation, especially in places like my State of South But right now the high tax rates that small businesses face can make it difficult for these businesses to even survive, much less thrive and expand their operations. Our bill will fix this.  To start with, our bill implements a new deduction for businesses that will allow them to keep more of their money, which will allow them to reinvest in their operations, increase wages, and hire new workers. Our bill also reforms a number of current provisions in the Tax Code that frequently leave small businesses with very little cash on hand. Under our legislation, small businesses will be able to recover the capital that they have invested in things like inventory and machinery much more quickly--and in certain cases, immediately--which will free up capital they can use to expand and create jobs. Our legislation also includes provisions I helped develop that will simplify accounting rules for small businesses, which will also help reduce their tax burden, leaving more of their earnings to reinvest in their businesses and in their workers.  In addition to cutting rates for small businesses, our bill also reduces our corporate tax rate. Our Nation's corporate tax rate is currently the highest in the industrialized world, which puts U.businesses at a major disadvantage next to their international competitors. By reducing the corporate tax rate, our bill will enable U.businesses to compete on a more level playing field with their competitors, which will in turn free up money that U.businesses could use to create jobs and increase wages.  The White House Counsel of Economic Advisers estimates that reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent will increase average household income by $4,000 annually.  Our bill also ends the outdated tax framework that is driving American companies to keep jobs and profits overseas. Our Nation currently operates under a so-called worldwide tax system, which means that American companies pay U.taxes on the profit they make here at home, as well as on part of the profit they make abroad once they bring that money back to the United The problem with this is that American companies are already paying taxes to foreign governments on the money they make abroad. Then, when they bring that money back home, they can end up having to pay taxes again on part of those profits--and at the highest tax rate in the industrialized world. So it is no surprise that this discourages businesses from bringing their profits back to the United States to invest in their domestic operations, in new jobs, and in increased wages.  Between 1983 and 2003, when the U.tax rate was much more competitive with those of other countries, there were 29 corporate inversions where U.companies moved abroad. Between 2003 and 2014, when other countries were dropping their corporate tax rates and shifting to territorial tax systems, there were 47 such inversions. Well, our bill addresses this drag on our economy by moving from our outdated worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system.  By shifting to a territorial tax system--a move I should note that has been supported by Members of both parties--we eliminate the double taxation that encourages companies to send their investments and their operations overseas. Combine that with the reduction in our high corporate tax rate, and our bill provides a strong incentive for U.companies to invest their profits at home in American jobs and in American workers instead of abroad. All in all, the Tax Foundation estimates that in addition to increasing wages, our bill will create nearly 1 million new jobs for American workers.  The legislation we unveiled last week is the product of years of work here in the Senate--work, frankly, by Members of both political parties. I hope, in the end, my Democratic colleagues will advance this bill, which is partly the result of their labors.  This is the kind of chance we all dreamed of when we came to Washington--a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of ordinary Americans, to substantially improve their lives today and give them access to a brighter, more secure, and more prosperous future.  I look forward to debating this bill over the next few weeks. We are going to a markup today, tomorrow, and Friday in the Senate Finance Committee, where amendments will be offered. They will be debated, they will be voted on, and then, of course, the bill will come to the floor of the U.Senate where there will be an open amendment process, where individual Senators will have opportunities to offer amendments, to debate those amendments, and to vote on those amendments. But when all of that is said and done, I hope we can send a bill to the President's desk that will bring much needed relief to those Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck--to those Americans who are struggling to make ends meet, to raise their children, and to provide for a more secure retirement--by allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned dollars in their pockets, by making their paychecks bigger, and by creating access to better jobs, higher paying jobs, and higher wages. That improves all Americans' standard of living, all Americans' quality of life. That is what this bill will do.  We need to get it across the finish line. There is a lot of work ahead of us, but I am looking forward to the day when we can get this signed into law and give the American people access to a brighter and a more prosperous future for them and their families.

Let's start with some of the fiction.  I was just presiding before I came off the dais about 30 minutes ago, and I heard a 30-minute speech from someone who said that they haven't seen the bill, said that it had been passed in the dark of night, that it is not being discussed in committee. But then they went on to have a 30-minute description of why the bill is bad  How could you not have seen something and have such a definitive position on the provisions of the bill? To me, it is just curious.  Here is something that is even more curious. There are so many Members--many of them friends--on the other side of the aisle who are simply making a false claim that we are somehow going to raise taxes on working families, the middle class. Why would that make sense? What on Earth would the voters of the United States and my voters in North Carolina do to me next year if I came out and declared victory because I raised taxes on middle-income and working families? It doesn't make sense, and it has been proven to be false.  The Washington Post has a rating system they use. They call it the Pinocchio system. One Pinocchio means you are probably stretching the truth a little bit; four Pinocchios means there is not a shred of truth in what you are saying. These claims about raising taxes on working families and middle-income families earned four Pinocchios; they are fiction.  What we are trying to do is provide a tax break to the people who need it the most--to the people who are trying to pay their bills, struggling to go to school, actually struggling just to pay the rent. That is what this tax bill is about. This tax cut is about getting the economy back on track so that we can also drive up wages.  Not only do we want to provide you with more money in your pocketbook and in your wallet at the end of the month by reducing your tax burden, but we also want to make it more likely that you are going to make more money, you are going to get a better job, and you are going to have more income at the end of this process. I firmly believe that it will work.  Let's talk about the facts of this plan. The facts are that we have to have tax relief. We have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. There is no way the greatest economy that has ever existed should[[Page S7237]]be one of the least welcoming and least hospitable to job growth. That is why we have to reduce the corporate tax rate.  We also have to reduce the tax rate on small businesses. Eighty percent of all jobs created in North Carolina are created by small businesses. The people whom the gentleman from Colorado referred to as ``the rich people'' are small business owners who actually file their taxes through their individual income. So perhaps they have a fair amount of revenue, but a lot of it has to go to pay for the business, and a little bit is left behind for them and their families and their employees. We have to reduce the tax burden on small businesses so that they can create more jobs and, hopefully, some day, become very large businesses--hopefully, corporations--creating more and more jobs and more opportunities for more workers.  At the end of the day, the middle-income tax break is going to be somewhere between $1,500 and $2,000 a year. It will vary a little bit from State to State, but that is a lot of money in these very difficult times. More important than that are the opportunities that will be created through economic growth. That is what I will leave you with. I have seen this happen.  First, I have seen the false claims before. They were waged against me when I was the speaker of the house in North Carolina, and we had the courage in the middle of a fiscal crisis to cut taxes and grow jobs. We had all the liberal media, and we had some of my good friends on the other side of the aisle whom I agreed with on many other issues but who disagreed with us on tax reform. But in North Carolina, no one is complaining about the tax reform results. In fact, we have one of the fastest growing State economies in the United States today, after being in the fourth quartile just 5 or 6 years ago. We have seen our median incomes go up, and we have seen a number of people lifted out of poverty at high levels. I know it works.  It is not easy, but it is a promise we made to the American people last year, and it is a promise we are going to keep--this Congress is going to keep--in the coming weeks. When we do this, then we can start working on an economy that can pay down the debt and make sure that these young people who are pages here and the young people here in the gallery right now--you may not know this, but you owe about $70,000, on average, to the Federal That is your share of the national debt. I don't want you to have to pay it back.  I want an economy that is growing, that can ultimately resolve our debt problem. But you can do it only by producing growth, you can do it only by becoming economically competitive, and you can do it only by lifting the tax burden on businesses and working families so that money can flow back through the private economy and out of the coffers in  I thank my colleagues for their hard work on this bill. I look forward to voting for the bill. I know it is going to produce a result because I have seen it produce a result in my experience as speaker of the house. It will work for It will be one of the great things we are going to do in this  At this point, again, I thank my colleagues.

868,topic-id,320,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in support of the gentleman from Minnesota's legislation, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor  As I have traveled through my district back in Colorado, I have often been dismayed by the ever-increasing number of storefronts, once thriving businesses, which now have ``for sale'' and ``for lease'' signs out front.  Small businesses are essential to job creation and job innovation, but they have been so hamstrung by the burden of compliance with regulations intended for large public companies that their ability to be able to create jobs and innovate has been stifled.  The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act will exempt certain micro offerings from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, thereby removing obstacles to obtaining funding in capital markets for Main Street businesses. It is hard for capitalism to work, Mr.Speaker, without capital.  This legislation tackles that problem and creates opportunities for hardworking small businesses to be able to go public to raise that initial capital in the early stage and to be able to develop that seed capital that is needed. Growth is often contingent on capital. Without investment, it is easy for small businesses to falter.  By defining the ``nonpublic offering'' exemption under the Securities Act, this legislation will provide small businesses with much-needed clarity and a renewed confidence in what the proper procedure is for a nonpublic offering that does not violate the law and helps to be able to grow businesses.  Removing this confusion will provide small businesses with much-needed certainty and allow them to be able to focus their resources on growth, rather than on compliance.  For this reason, I support the measure that is before us today, and I would encourage my colleagues to do the same. I commend Mr.Emmer for introducing this legislation to alleviate the burdensome compliance environment that is imposed on small businesses. Again, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.

1094,topic-id,214,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Republican's tax scam that has been jammed through this Chamber without normal order, without public debate, and without consideration for our Nation's future.  I represent the heart of Las Vegas, a city that was one of the hardest hit during the financial crisis. Many of my constituents are just beginning to recover from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and this tax bill will greatly hinder their progress.  Some 20 percent of my constituents itemize their deductions, the vast majority of whom earn under $75,000 per year. These families will all see a tax hike if this bill becomes law because the deductions for student loans, medical expenses, sales tax, and some mortgages will all disappear.  The sad reality is, they won't just feel the hit on April 15, tax day. They will feel it every single day. The deficit that this bill will create will lead to State and local governments missing out on needed Federal funding, and they will either have to slash vital programs or raise taxes at that level.

565,topic-id,1119,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative Garamendi for leading us in this Special It is so important that the public understand what is happening here with this issue.                              {time}  1815  The first response ought to be: Here we go again.  Trickle-down has not worked in the past--the far past, the recent past. It is not going to work again.  When does trickle-down become trickle-up?  Well, to suggest that this is a tax reform act is really pulling a trick on the public. This is about a tax cut, and a tax cut for corporations, a tax cut for the wealthiest amongst us.  This trickle-down theory becomes trickle-up because you are taking and raising the taxes on some 36 million families, those that would be classified as middle class families, those who work day in and day out and don't even earn a minimum wage, but they are working. The poorest amongst us, the lowest bracket, gets an increase in its rates.  How is this fair? How is this economic or social justice?  Both measurements prove that it is false. It is not economically sound. It is not socially just. What we are doing here is playing a game with the economy, and we are putting the economy, the American economy, at great risk.  We have seen major efforts made since January of 2009 to grow the economy, and now we have this scam, this trickery, to go and do a trickle-up: take from the working families, deny their purchasing power, weaken their purchasing power, and give it to corporations, give it to the upper income strata in this country. That is a formula for disaster, and we are going to pay wickedly for this effort.  We have always heard about deficit situations. When President Clinton was in office, when President Obama was in office, the Republicans would talk about a deficit situation. There seems[[Page H9246]]to be no concern about deficit here, a deaf ear to the deficit.  Borrowing to spend. Borrowing to spend. Borrowing $1.5 trillion, which probably amasses to $2.1 trillion to $2.3 trillion with the cost of borrowing, and using that borrowing to spend on the wealthiest amongst us, be they families, individuals, or corporations.  How does that make economic sense? How does that help the economy?  When we look at this situation, we are going to impact your average family in any of our districts, those who are working to maintain a household, to perhaps put aside some savings for improvements of that household or to assist their children in their pursuits of a career, be it apprenticeship programs or college programs. We are going to hurt these families.  Students will realize that their tuition deduction is eliminated--eliminated. Students will realize, former students, that their loan interest deductions will be eliminated.  I heard a lot about this, Mr.Speaker, when I was home over the last two weekends. We have always deducted exorbitant medical expenses when we did our taxes. We prepared that for our accountant because we had exorbitant medical fees, medical expenditures, be they for families who are walking through life with Alzheimer's or who are fighting cancer or who have chronic illnesses. They deserve to have that deduction.  I am told, on average, it is $9,000. Seventy-three percent of people who make that deduction are earning less than $75,000. This is a brutal response to America's working families. It is a harshness tossed against this economy that has finally started to churn over the last several years. Now we step up and want to wreck all of that.  We have all sorts of efforts that deny various professions, teachers, for one, who will not be able to deduct for classroom expenses where they will, out of their own pocket, provide greater resources for the children who are in their classes that they teach. They are facilitating this discovery, self-discovery, within children. They are digging into their pockets to make that experience all the more real, all the more magical, all the more important, and here we are going to deny teachers to deduct those expenses, but we won't do that for the businesses that want to reach into their own pocket and spend.  We look at this situation, and we understand who gets a fair shake in this deal, in this scam, and it is regrettable.  Now the talk of a Senate version bringing in the individual mandate? Dollars that are made available for families to realize healthcare coverage, and we are going to penalize them and use that to help pay for this borrowing? This is a disaster.  America needs to see this with its eyes wide open and to call your individual Representatives and ask them to tell you how you are going to benefit from this package.  Somebody today told me it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for tax reform--tax reform. Is there reform in this mess? There are the same old loopholes. We grow more loopholes, and they are getting a tax break in addition. What are we doing to our economy here? This is a terrible bill.  When it comes to the SALT deduction, the State and local tax deduction, you will destroy States by requiring double taxation on the investments they make in their own programs in their That will severely impact upon people in my home State of New  I think it is a disaster that this House, this majority, the entire majority, would allow this bill to come to the floor.  Before you tell me how you are going to vote on this bill, tell me how you tried to stop it from coming to the floor because it hurts so many Thirty-six million families will be impacted. They will see a tax increase. That is not my word. It is not Representative Garamendi's word. It is coming from the Tax Policy  People are putting this one under the microscope, and they are detailing what is in here and what is not in here, and this is a scam. It is bringing down an economy. It is taking it in the wrong direction. It gives tax breaks to corporations that want to grow their prosperity offshore and making it more productive for them to take jobs overseas.  How can we tolerate this? No wonder they are trying to rush the bill now. Get it done in a day or two before America finds out what is in it. This is a tax disaster, not a tax reform. It is a tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of the working families and those who work below minimum wage in this country, people who make it their goal to be self-sufficient, and now this is how they are rewarded.

573,topic-id,280,"Mr.Speaker, I just would love to point out, I would encourage middle class America to raise its voice. Raise your voices, because when we look at the repeal of the individual mandate that is being suggested here, you are going to rip away healthcare from some 13 million Americans, and that alongside the 36 million families in this country that are going to see a tax increase.  Before that hits home, stand up and speak out. And if you are not going to get a tax increase, if you might get crumbs off the table because, remember, if you weren't at the table, and this was done in veiled secrecy, if you are not at the table, you are probably on the menu.  Here you are going to have these families, 36 million that will get a tax increase, but if you are going to get maybe a crumb off the table, that sunsets, and the other benefits are going to go forever.  This is a monumental change in a tax cut policy. It is not reform. It is tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations at the expense of working families.  Finally, I would just make mention that there would be an immediate $25 billion cut in The efforts that were made under the last administration to bring more stability to Medicare, to make certain that it had a longer life out there, are now going to be wiped away.

It is a big step forward on our path to restoring the economic growth that we have been waiting for all this time. I am very excited about this step forward and the remainder of the process to get this done, to get this bill signed into law.  Why do we need this? We have just lived through the weakest recovery in American history--feeble growth, stagnant wages, and a widening gap between the wealthy and the poor. That is what has been happening for years.  Some people say: Well, that is just the way it is. You just need to get used to it. That is the new normal. That is what America is about now.  That is complete nonsense. There is nothing inevitable about the American economy being weak and denying opportunity for the people we represent. It is a direct result of bad policy, failed policy that prevented us from having the recovery we would normally have after a recession.  What was that policy? Well, we saw it. It is very clear. It is not a matter of opinion, it is a matter of fact that productivity growth in America collapsed. It is a matter of fact that investment in the kinds of new plants and equipment that allow for productivity to grow collapsed. It is a fact that new business startups just dried up. People weren't able and willing to do it.  There is no mystery about why our economy was so weak for so many years. We had imposed conditions that made it impossible to have the kind of growth that is normal. Meanwhile, what was happening in the rest of the world? The rest of the world was systematically making their tax codes more competitive. The countries that we compete with around the world, in Europe and Asia, were lowering the rates they apply to business income, they were simplifying their codes, and they were moving to international systems that made it more conducive for them to generate investment into their countries, while we did nothing except let our Tax Code ossify. That is what has been happening these last many years.  What I am excited about is that this bill fixes exactly what is broken. This bill goes to exactly where the problem is and begins to turn this around. How do we do that? One of the things we do--a hallmark of this bill--is we are going to lower the cost of investing in the new plants and equipment that will allow American workers to become more productive. More productive workers get paid more in wages; that is just a fact. That is what is going to happen as a result of this bill.  Another thing we do in this bill is we get away from this terrible policy we have that is resulting in foreign companies buying up American companies. The way we treat income earned overseas is a disaster, and we are the only country in the world that does it.  I think you could make a case that today the United States has what might very well be the least attractive tax regime in the modern world, in the industrialized world. What is really exciting about this is that we are going to move from this system to what just might be the best tax system in the industrialized world. Think about the result that is going to have. I think the result is going to be breathtaking--new investment, new businesses being launched, existing businesses growing.  Take foreign direct investment alone. If you think about it, we have a global economy. Capital can move around the world with literally the click of a mouse, and people make investment decisions based on the climate of the place in which they are thinking about investing. When we have the worst tax regime in the world, who really wants to invest here? When we have the best, how are we not going to attract investment from all around the world, including very much in the United States?  So the changes we are making are exactly the right changes for this moment. That is true in another respect, and that is, if you think about where we are in this cycle, it has taken way too long to get here, but the unemployment rate is quite low now. We are getting close to full employment. So what happens when we create the incentives for businesses to grow, to invest, for new businesses to launch, for people to invest in America--what happens when that occurs in an environment where the unemployment rate is very low? It sets up a bidding war for workers. There is no other choice. As they grow, these businesses need new employees to get the job done. They have to pay ever more because they are competing with another business down the road that also wants to grow and also wants to invest in new plants and equipment.  What we are going to do is create a bidding war for workers. That means wages are going up. When wages go up, families have more take-home pay. When they have more take-home pay, they have a higher standard of living. This is exactly how people have a chance to live the American dream, when the economy is thriving and growing at the rate that America used to take for granted. I am here to say that those days are coming back.  We have some work to do. We are not done yet by any means, but I am confident we are going to get this done and, when we do, our constituents are going to live a better life as a result.  I yield the floor.

162,topic-id,168,"Mr.Speaker, tomorrow the House will vote on H.1, the so-called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Republicans say will support America's middle class. Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Middle-income Americans will receive, at best, one-fifth of the promised benefit of these tax cuts.  According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, H.1 will raise taxes on 36 million hardworking middle class American households.  It scraps benefits our families depend on, like the student loan interest and medical expense deductions. Imagine, in a time when access to higher education is critical to a family's economic well-being, making it even more expensive.  This legislation was written behind closed doors, in secret, without Democratic input and without any hearings.  Mr.Speaker, a bill to overhaul the Tax Code, the results of which will affect every American for decades to come, deserves open and transparent consideration. I urge my colleagues to work together to instead craft a tax reform bill that truly lifts up the middle class and invests in our future.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9267.txt,1884,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr.Speaker, the fiscal year 2018 NDAA takes significant steps to support and protect military members and their families.

They are being put forward at the same time that we are considering a tax reform bill that will significantly cut revenues and, by the latest estimate, add $1.7 trillion to the Federal deficit.

I understand the necessity of many of the programs that are funded each year in this bill and believe its passage is needed to maintain American military superiority against a variety of threats while supporting our men and women in uniform.

I strongly support this bill, and I want to personally thank our chairman, Mac Thornberry, for his work in trying to get a higher top line for defense. This bill comes in higher than the President's budget request, but it is in line with both the appropriations and the budget document that came out of the  This bill authorizes $634.2 billion in the base budget, a much-needed increase over the original budget request, and fully supports many of the unfunded requirements identified by the Department that totaled more than $30 billion. The $634.2 billion authorization is essential. Anything less dramatically handicaps our ability to restore military readiness over nearly a decade of neglect.  This increased base budget funding for fiscal year 2018 begins the long process to rebuild our military's full spectrum readiness from years of deferred modernization brought on by the failed assumptions from the previous administrations's Budget Control Act and sequestration.  Within the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee's jurisdiction, this bill authorizes over $12 billion in additional funds to address unfunded modernization requirements and critical capabilities gaps.  If we do not begin, with this budget, to set favorable conditions to start to reverse the high-risk defense posture we currently have, we will significantly jeopardize our military's advantage that we have taken for granted in past conflicts and steady-state operations.  As such, the bill recognizes the importance of land forces in current and future operations and authorizes over $2 billion to accelerate armored brigade combat team modernization, to include additional Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting  The bill authorizes strike fighter capability and capacity shortfalls and authorizes over $3 billion in additional funding to procure new fifth-generation aircraft and modernize our fourth-generation fleet.

After speaking to both Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Committee member Tom Reed, I believe that an unintended consequence of this bill would hinder middle class Americans pursuing a higher education degree in an attempt to better their lives. These consequences will affect the education of employees of universities, graduate students, and employees receiving employer-provided education benefits.  Madam Speaker, under current law, higher education institutions can provide tax-free tuition waivers or reimbursement to employees, spouses, and dependents.  Secondly, many universities provide graduate students, including Ph.candidates, with tuition relief and stipends, which they can utilize while pursuing their degree.

1266,topic-id,198,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today on behalf of veterans of the United States Armed Forces who have been unceremoniously deported.  In the 1990s, the immigration law changes eliminated judicial discretion and reclassified many low-level, nonviolent offenses as aggravated felonies mandating deportation. As a result, the United States has banished an unknown number of veterans. In many cases, these were minor offenses committed by veterans who succumbed to the difficulties of readjusting to civilian life.  Many are combat veterans who sustained physical wounds and emotional trauma in conflicts going back to the war in This banishment effectively denies these men access to often critically needed medical care.  Regardless of immigration status, all U.military veterans are entitled to treatment at the Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities, yet very few of these deported veterans are granted the necessary waivers to access the care either in the States or abroad.  In fact, most of these veterans, the only way they are going to return is in a box, dead, because they do have the right to be buried in a veterans' cemetery.

77,topic-id,2073,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for laying out those concerns about the tax plan, and he did so very eloquently. I always appreciate the gentleman's participation.  Kind of building on what the gentleman talked about, I just want to give the American public out there and the constituents that we represent in the Congressional Black Caucus just a quick outline of who exactly this plan will hurt.  I am very concerned about this terrible tax plan because it is going to cut rates for the highest 1 percent of earners and corporations, while increasing the tax burden on lower and middle class families, while the Republicans are falsely going around claiming that they are going to be helping these individuals and these families. That is just not the case. That is not the case at all.  For example, let me give you one area that has been touched upon that I am concerned about, and that is State and local taxes. You won't be eligible any longer for the deduction, which means many individuals end up paying twice the amount of taxes on the same income.  The elimination of deductions for student loan payments: we have talked extensively on this House floor, on the Democratic side, about what students loans are doing to this country and the costs of a higher education. We know that a lot of people seek out higher education just because of the benefits that it can yield incomewise, and everybody is, again, always trying to see[[Page H9165]]how they are going to live that American They want to be able to pay their taxes, pay their car payment, pay their house note, whatever it may happened to be. When you look at the fact that people won't be able to write off their student loans to help pay for their education anymore, that is really going to hurt and probably convince a lot of young people that they just shouldn't seek out higher education.                              {time}  2015  We want young people to seek out a higher education. I mean, even the blue-collar jobs out there we know are becoming harder and harder to keep and maintain, and they require some form of education. Even going to community college for a couple years after they graduate from high school almost seems to be something that they have to do.  The Center for American Progress found that 78 percent of Black students, in comparison to 57 percent of White students, took out Federal loans for their undergraduate studies. And again, just not being able to write those off means that dream that everyone has, regardless of race, being able to buy their first home, the American Dream, they are going to have to put that off because they can no longer pay off these very costly student loan interest payments. These tax deduction eliminations are going to be very troubling for so many people in the community in light of the fight just to build generational wealth.  Again, these trickle-down tactics, we have been talking about trickle-down economics now for a very long time, but some of these trickle-down tactics are proving not to work, and it is disheartening to see the finish line just being moved again and again, just over and over again. Every time people seem like they are doing better, just to see that finish line moved once again and making it just hard on these families that I talked about earlier that fall in those lower middle class, working class, middle class tax brackets.  You are talking about, when you look at this really closely, the restructuring of these tax brackets under the Republican plan would make it so that the lowest income earners' tax rates are going to increase from 10 to 12 percent, the lowest earners out there. Some of the poorest amongst us will have their tax burden increased, and it will make it so much more difficult for them to climb that economic ladder of opportunity. It is already hard to climb that ladder of opportunity.  Just think about it for just a minute, if you have two kids and you have a 10 percent tax burden, and you are making a small amount of money a year but you are out there working hard every day. You are trying to get overtime. You are punching the clock as much as you possibly can. You are having Grandma watch the kids just so you can pull that extra shift to get those hours in, but you are a single mom and you are just really out there just busting it each and every day, week after week, and you still don't have any money in the bank. You are still having a hard time making ends meet. You are still getting rent notices put on the door once a month. It is just so tough, and just to know that we are not really going to be doing anything at all in this body. The Republicans aren't going to be doing anything to help these individuals be able to climb out of that hole and just be able to see the light. Just knowing that that mom and those kids are going to probably struggle under this tax plan until the kids leave the house, it is just really disheartening.  In addition to that, even the tax provisions that are aimed at helping working families are actually reserved, again, for just the wealthiest few in the community.  White House Republicans highlight their expansion of the child tax credit. Many of the lowest income parents who are in need of assistance will only be eligible to receive a partial amount of the tax credit, if any of the expansion at all.  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the GOP child tax credit keeps the lowest income workers from benefiting from the expansion of the credit, despite numerous studies finding that the child tax credits benefit children by improving school performance, higher college enrollment, and increasing earnings in adulthood.  Further, this tax plan refuses to take the interests of African-American communities as a whole into consideration, ensuring those who are striving to reach the American Dream will simply fall short.  Again, there is just so much in this bill that is going to be tough.  You are talking about repealing the estate tax. There are so many people whom I have heard--Rockefellers, Buffetts, Bill Gates, and others--who are saying that they are fine paying that, that they are absolutely okay with paying that. You think about what we are going to take away from people so they don't have to pay that estate tax. I mean, it is just amazing.  You have heard so many of my colleagues talk about it earlier here, but when you start talking about the local and State tax deductions, when you start talking about the student loan deductions that people really count on, when you start talking about child tax credits, when you start talking about new market tax credits, so many programs and so many things out there that are really helping individuals, helping our economy, and we want to give it back so a few wealthy people don't have to pay estate taxes? I mean, it is just really sad, Mr.Speaker, when you think about that.  One of the things that I think that we ought to do, instead of giving ultrarich people a pass on paying a billion dollars that they can pass down to heirs, is that we ought to start thinking about doing something to help grandparents who are raising grandchildren.  I will never forget, when I was in the State legislature, I had a principal come up to me on the house floor, and I was showing the kids--I believe it was on the senate floor. We had walked to the other side. And there is a picture of the Battle of San Jacinto that hangs there in Austin at the capitol, and I was showing the schoolchildren, and the principal pulled me aside and she said: I want to thank you for talking about grandparents who are raising grandchildren.  She said: Over 50 percent of the kids at the elementary school where I am principal are raised by someone other than their parent, and 99 percent of the time it is the grandparent.  Instead of giving superrich people, ultrarich people a pass on paying the inheritance tax, why don't we give grandparents who serve as primary caregivers for their grandchildren out there a $500 refundable tax credit? That would help out so much, because you have to think about what these grandparents are facing.  They didn't think that their Social Security check or their pension check was going to have to be used to help pay for school supplies, help pay for school clothes, help pay for backpacks, help pay for school uniforms, help pay for kids' haircuts, prom dresses. The grandparents of America out there are really balancing a lot now, more than any other generation of grandparents have.  We could take the money that we are going to give away to the Bill Gateses and the Warren Buffetts and the Rockefellers and other folks like that, and we could give it to these grandparents, grandparents who represent people from every congressional district in this country.  Oftentimes, you start talking about grandparents who are raising grandchildren, there has been some kind of issue with drugs or alcohol in the kids' parents' life or some other reason why the parents can't take care of the kids. We know that that is true, particularly with the issues that we have had with the opioid crisis. We know that this is an area that is growing in all congressional districts, all races, all backgrounds.  Again, why not give our grandparents out there that are buying backpacks with their Social Security check, why not give them a $500 refundable tax credit to help them make ends meet? If we were to do that, these grandparents would be able to have a little bit more money to buy healthier foods instead of buying processed foods. They could buy fruits, vegetables, other things like that that could really go a long way in just helping them maintain their household.  That is what I am eager to do. I want to sit down with colleagues and come up with something that is fair. I think[[Page H9166]]that everybody here that I have talked to has said that they want to work in a bipartisan manner to be able to pass a tax reform bill that is fair, that is done under regular order, that is done with transparency and done in the light, but the way that this is happening, it is just not right.  We know, again, that these trickle-down economics just simply do not work, and we need to start all over. We need to head back to the drawing board and sit down as Democrats and Republicans like they did back in the eighties when Reagan was President and Tip O'Neill was Speaker and work out some of these issues that the American public has.  We know that people are very anxious about some of the things that they have been hearing about this tax reform bill, people from all congressional districts and, again, all backgrounds. We in the Congressional Black Caucus, we are concerned about the impact that this is going to have in the African-American communities around this country--and all of the communities, quite frankly, Mr. Again, let's just sit down at the drawing board, talk about some of these things, and come up with something that is fair that the American public can feel good about, knowing that Members of Congress, that they are not trying to gain advantage over one another, that we are trying to come up with a fair way how to reform our Tax Code, keep our businesses here, and keep a little bit more money in people's pockets at the end of the week or the end of the month, whenever they get paid, so they can take care of their families and buy a home, take care of their grandkids, do whatever it is they need to do in order to make ends meet.  Mr.Speaker, thank you very much for this evening, and I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-13-pt1-PgH9160.txt,2166,"CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2810, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR",2017,13,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1226,topic-id,238,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.2874.  This bill makes flood insurance more expensive, less available, and less fair for millions of working families.  This bill all but abandons Hurricane Sandy victims.  Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New York and New Jersey 5 years ago, causing approximately $60 billion in damage. More than 50 people lost their lives.  Today--half a decade later--more than 1,000 homeowners still have not obtained proper resolution of their flood insurance claim.  That is why I have worked for almost 1\1/2\ years on legislation to improve FEMA's claims processing system and to bring proper oversight and management to the write-your-own program. While some of my recommended changes were included in this bill, language was also included that blows a direct hole in these reforms. This bill requires policyholders to exhaust all administrative remedies on any disputed claim before having their day in court.  However, we have already seen that FEMA's administrative system is broken--and this bill will enable dishonest insurance providers to continue hiding behind an unreachable threshold--meaning policyholders will never be made whole.  After more than 5 years, with more than 1,000 families still awaiting resolution of their Hurricane Sandy claim, we must seek to meaningfully reform the claims process, not make it harder for families to return to their home.

648,topic-id,639,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague from Colorado for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I appreciate so much tonight the opportunity to speak here during Special We could talk about the principles of charity from the We could talk from the Scriptures on principles of science. We could talk on principles of education. We could even talk about the principles of taxation and be very up to date as we deal with that here.  But tonight, as we discuss the issues of the Bible in this National Bible Week, I want to go back to my earliest days in my childhood home. I thank God that I had a mother and a father who would speak to me about God's Word, from God's Word, and impart God's Word in my life even when I didn't want it or didn't understand it.  I remember from my earliest days being taught to memorize Psalm 119:11, where it says: ``Thy Word I have treasured in my heart. That I might not sin against Thee.''  As a young man, the thoughts of sin in some cases were enticing, but I am glad that I had the opportunity to put the Scriptures in my life because ultimately, through the course of time, it truly did change my life.  It brought me to the Book of Romans, where in Romans, the third chapter verse 23 said: ``For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.''  With that verse in the Psalm, my mother would say: Tim, this book will keep you from sin, or sin will keep you from this book.  I found the truth in both of those statements. What I found there in Romans 3:23, that we have all sinned, I identified with that. But it didn't end there because I went over a few pages to Romans 5:8, where it said: ``But God demonstrated His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.''  Those are words of The Bible impacted my life. As a young man, ultimately, I had to ask: Is that true?[[Page H9250]]  I am so thankful that ultimately I admitted the truth, and I came to Romans again, chapter 10:13, where it says: ``For whosoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.''  My good friend from Colorado indicated how that changed his life. It changed my life as well, admitting personally that I was a sinner in need of a savior. The Bible said so. It changed my life.  Now, some might reject this. That is okay. But most who seek the truth of the Bible are not disappointed. It truly changes lives. Admittedly, I am not perfect--and my colleagues could identify with that--but I am forgiven. I am forgiven, and every day I have a purpose beyond myself to live in a way that makes a difference because of not who I am, but who this book and my savior has made me be.  So I will end with this, Mr.Speaker, in my namesake, 2 Timothy 2:15, it says to me specifically: Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that doesn't need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.  At the end of each day, Mr.Speaker, because of this passage, I ask, first of all: Is God pleased?  Secondly, has the work been done well?  Thirdly, has the word--the truth--been used well in my life?  If I can answer in the affirmative to each of those based upon the Bible, I know for whatever reason my God has been served well, and I have done the work well.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for leading this Special Order tonight talking about something so significant as the Bible, and I pray that it imparts wisdom to all we do here.

FDA shares your goal of      protecting our Nation's military service men and women by      advancing safe and effective medical products, strengthening      our partnerships with the DoD on behalf of our Nation's      warfighters, and ensuring that this critical work is      prioritized by the       Our Nation's troops face unique risks on the battlefield,      and my colleagues and I at the Agency are committed to      implementing a lasting framework that not only considers      these unique risks, but prioritizes the warfighters' needs by      expediting the development and review of medical      countermeasures needed in the face of emerging threats. The      bipartisan bill that will be considered alongside the      National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 would codify these      commitments to ensure that the warfighters' needs for safe      and effective medical countermeasures are met on a priority      basis and in strong partnerships with       For instance, I believe this new authority and enhanced      collaborations with DoD will help enable FDA to approve      freeze dried plasma as soon as 2018, addressing a key medical      priority. Further, it will put in place a permanent process      for strong engagement between FDA and DoD on any future      medical products DoD determines are necessary to address      military emergencies. Additionally, under these provisions,      FDA would be able to recognize military threats in advance      and provide an emergency use authorization for a fuller range      of medical products that could help save lives on the      battlefield.       Thank you again for your dedication to our Nation's service      members and for working with FDA on this meaningful framework      to better serve and protect our warfighters. Please be      assured that I am personally committed to this effort.

1041,topic-id,528,"Mr.Speaker, our men and women in uniform have put their lives on the line for this country, and they deserve to have the earliest possible access to medical products that could save their lives on the battlefield.  H.4374 will establish important new authorities for the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, and the Department of Defense, DOD, to ensure that our warfighters have the benefits of new treatments and new devices.  Mr.Speaker, currently the FDA has the authority to authorize the emergency use of an unapproved medical product for a specific set of military emergencies. They have that authority. This emergency use authority requires two things, though. First, the Secretary of Defense must make a determination that there is a risk of attack on military forces with a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent. Next, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must make a declaration that there is, in fact, an emergency or threat justifying the emergency use authorization of a product.  To ensure there are no unnecessary delays in this process, this legislation, H.4374, establishes a deadline for the Secretary of Health and Human Once the Secretary of Defense[[Page H9299]]makes a declaration of an imminent risk of attack, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has 45 days--that is the maximum--to make a declaration that such a risk exists.  Limiting the threat under which an emergency use can be authorized to chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agents, frankly, has been too narrow to incorporate all the serious threats of harm to our troops.  To address this problem, H.4374 establishes a new category under which the emergency use authorization process can be triggered. H.4374 expands this authority to include situations where the Secretary of Defense makes a determination that there is risk of attack with any agent that may cause an imminently life-threatening and specific risk to the United States military forces.  In addition to creating new pathways for emergency access to unapproved medical devices, H.4374 also creates a new breakthrough designation to expedite actual FDA approval of medical products for military emergencies.  Currently, the breakthrough pathway exists only for products intended to treat serious, life-threatening conditions where the Secretary determines such a product may demonstrate significant improvement over existing therapies.                              {time}  1600  Mr.Speaker, this expedited approval is based on the successful breakthrough designation created by Congress back in 2012. This has worked. It has accelerated oncology drug reviews by more than 2 years.  Now, in short, H.4374 addresses the critical issue of military access to the newest available products by expanding the circumstances under which emergency use authorizations can be issued and by establishing an expedited pathway to full approval of products that the Secretary of Defense requests.  Mr.Speaker, policies in this bill are bipartisan. They were developed with the input from the administration as well as the authorizing committees in the House and the Additionally, CBO has indicated that H.4374 will have no impact on direct spending or revenue. So, Mr.Speaker, this is not only a good bill, it is an important bill for our men and women in uniform, and I urge my colleagues to support H.4374.  I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I can't tell you how grateful I am to cast a vote to move our Tax Code one step closer to its first overhaul in 31 years.  We know the Tax Code is broken. The American people know the Tax Code is broken. They are reminded every time they look at their paycheck. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will deliver progrowth tax reform to the families, farmers, manufacturers, and workers in my district.[[Page H9354]]  For families, we are delivering tax cuts so that hardworking Hoosiers can keep more of their hard-earned money. We are enhancing the child tax credit, preserving the Adoption tax credit, encouraging retirement savings, and streamlining 15 different education tax incentives.  We are delivering a Tax Code so simple that most Americans can file taxes on a postcard. In my district, 80 percent of filers already take the standard deduction. They will be able to keep even more of their money, because the standard deduction is doubled, and most itemizers will now be able to save time, money, and stress by taking the double standard deduction instead.  No one is ever excited to file their taxes, but I am all for a simpler, quicker process that makes it much more pain-free.  H.1 helps job creators grow. Small businesses get a lower rate and more simplicity. Family businesses passed down for generations won't have to worry about the estate tax anymore, and America will be a more attractive place to do business.

85,topic-id,959,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today as the ranking member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, as the co-chair of the National Guard and Reserve Components Caucus, as the co-chair of the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus, and probably more importantly, as a retired enlisted soldier to bring to your attention a number of provisions in the GOP tax bill that will negatively impact the men and women currently serving and transitioning from the United States military.  Mr.Speaker, I want to be clear. Tax reform is a laudable goal. It would have been nice had we actually done it, had we actually had debates, had we actually had witnesses. Zero, zero, zero. What we have is a closed-door bill brought forward and forced upon the In my opinion, trying to think that the American people would not watch what happens here is pretty risky.  These are folks in the military who risked everything to give us the right to debate things here. We should at least probably debate their future in an open manner. I hope we will strongly consider, Mr.Speaker, each of these following provisions in this bill that will put the prosperity of America's heroes at risk.  As the legislation is written, this tax plan includes provisions that will specifically harm members and veterans to help pay for tax cuts for corporations and the ultrawealthy.  How can you justify giving a tax cut for carrying interest, but not for carrying a rucksack?  That is what that vote will be today. Be very clear about this. When you cast your ``yes'' vote, you are being very clear.  The first thing it does is it repeals tax credits proven to help veterans find employment when they come home, such as the repeal of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which includes the Help Hire Our Heroes This credit is available to employers who hire veterans who have a service-connected disability, or are unemployed, or receive SNAP benefits.  Between 2013 and 2015, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit helped nearly 300,000 veterans find employment. But, again, don't take my word for it. The people who are telling you not to do this are the Air Force Sergeants Association, the United States Air Force Association, AMVETS, Army Aviation Association of America, Association of the United States Army, Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, Gold Star Wives of America, Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America, Marine Corps League, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Vietnam Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign They are telling you, if you vote ``yes,'' you are hurting the opportunities of America's veterans.  The GOP tax bill also repeals the disabled access tax credit. This simply allows small businesses to claim a tax[[Page H9261]]expenditure when they make their buildings more accessible for people with disabilities. Its elimination will discourage small businesses from making their workplaces accessible and friendly to those disabled veterans.  Mr.Speaker, by eliminating the deduction for interest payments or student loans, the GOP tax bill will make education even more expensive or out of reach for our veterans. While the GI Bill pays a portion of it, it does not pay it all. A large percentage of veterans also rely on student loans. This will hurt many veterans who rely on that to make school work.  This bill will make it more expensive for military families to sell their homes. How wrong is that?  The bill requires a homeowner to have owned and lived in a home for at least 5 years of the last 8 years to get a tax exemption on the money made from the sale of their home. No one serves in one location that long. No exemption was written in it. Had it been brought to the floor, we would have offered an amendment, and I bet you money, my Republican colleagues would have accepted it.  They didn't get that chance because somebody wrote it for them and passed it down here and is going to tell them to vote ``yes'' on it. That is simply wrong. I don't question their commitment to veterans. I question the way they wrote this bill. That is real life. These things will really happen, and it is verified by all kinds of outside sources.  By repealing the medical expense deduction, the GOP tax bill will hurt veterans struggling with costly medical bills. Most veterans aren't in the Most veterans don't qualify for the VA because they make more money than the threshold, or they are not disabled to the point where they get there. So most of them receive their health benefits through their employer. But when those expenses get too great, one of the things we have in current tax law is they are allowed to deduct those expenses. They are taking that away.  When you vote ``yes'' today, you are taking that away and giving billionaires a tax break. Once again, it is going to be a choice. It is very simple, yes or no; green light, red light. You will be able to decide on that. This hurts veterans.  By prioritizing corporations and the ultrawealthy over the middle class, they are directly harming veterans. Be very clear: a veteran's median income is $37,466. They are not going to see savings from this bill. If they are a disabled veteran or have a child going to college, they will pay more so that a very few of us can get a tax break.  Corporations, by the way, can deduct State and local taxes. Veterans can't. A corporation can deduct property tax. There is a lot more in here that is bad. Bring this back to the floor. Work with us. Protect America's heroes.

481,topic-id,1066,"Mr.President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of William Wehrum to be the next Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation at the Environmental Protection This job is really pretty straightforward. The person in this job must fight for the right of every American to breathe clean air. But here is the problem: Mr.Wehrum has dedicated his career to the service of corporate polluters. Like President Trump and Administrator Pruitt, in a fight between hard-working families and well-paid corporate polluters, Mr.Wehrum sides with the corporate polluters every single time.  President Trump promised to ``drain the swamp'' in But, seemingly, with every week, this Republican-controlled Senate approves yet another one of the President's corporate insiders to advance Big Oil and Big Coal's dirty wish list. The decision to nominate Mr.Wehrum is no exception. He is another conflict-ridden, climate-dismissing Trump nominee who has made a career of putting corporate profits ahead of hard-working families who depend on the EPA to have their backs.  Some of my Republican colleagues have argued that Mr.Wehrum has extensive experience serving at the EPA under the Bush administration, and that is true. Let's take a look at his experience. Mr.Wehrum fought to keep States from setting their own higher vehicle emissions standards in order to try to keep the air cleaner. He played a key role in the Bush administration's insistence that the EPA has no responsibility to combat climate change--a view that the Supreme Court rejected in 2007 in Massachusetts v. When the Bush EPA was required by law to propose a rule limiting mercury emissions from powerplants, Mr.Wehrum's influence helped tilt the rule to benefit big coal. In fact, several paragraphs of the proposed rule were lifted verbatim from memos provided by the same pro-coal lobbying firm that Mr.Wehrum had worked at before joining the  The egregious inadequacy of the proposed rule and its blatant disregard for rulemaking processes led to 8 years of unnecessary delay in limiting toxic mercury emissions. There were 8 additional years of an estimated 130,000 asthma attacks, 8 years of 11,000 premature deaths--all potentially avoidable if Mr.Wehrum and his colleagues had just listened to the science and made the protection of human life more important than the protection of corporate interests.  During his tenure at the EPA, looking out for big corporate polluters was standard practice for Mr.In 27 separate cases--27 cases--Federal courts found that the regulations that Mr.Wehrum helped write contradicted or violated the Clean Air Act and failed to protect public health.  Mr.Wehrum has a lot of experience--the weak-kneed experience of someone kissing up to big corporate interests.  In reflecting on his time at the EPA, Mr.Wehrum said: ``I'm a much better lawyer now than when I first joined the agency. To really get to know how the agency works and how it ticks, I think that is very valuable.''  Yes, valuable, sure, but valuable for whom? Valuable for small towns across America that desperately need more champions fighting in their corner? Valuable for our coastal communities and farmers dealing with the tangible effects of climate change? He meant valuable for his own bank account.  Mr.Wehrum describes his time working at the EPA as being ``very valuable'' because it allowed him to ``be effective in generating business and clients.''  I guess he thinks this latest trip through the revolving door will be even better for helping him drum up business from future polluters.  And why wouldn't he? Since leaving the EPA in 2007, Mr.Wehrum has been one of the go-to lawyers for big corporate polluters looking to get off easy or to save a buck at the public's expense. In at least 31 lawsuits against the EPA, Mr.Wehrum has fought to diminish Federal climate policy, to roll back limits on toxic mercury emissions, and to undermine public health protections. From what I can tell, not once has he chosen to use his valuable experience at the EPA to fight for stronger clean air protections that benefit our children and our seniors who suffer the most from toxic emissions.  When deciding whether someone is qualified for public service, sure, experience matters. But it matters who you fight for--whether it is a lawyer before the courts or as a senior appointee in the administration. It matters whether you have a demonstrated commitment to serving the public interest or the narrow corporate interests of rich companies.  Mr.Wehrum is not a person who fights for the moms and dads who know the terror of a child having an asthma attack. He is not a person who fights for the low-income and often minority communities that are literally choking under a cloud of industry toxins. He is not a person who fights for our communities that are suffering from the growing impact of climate change. No, he is a person who does the lucrative bidding of corporate DC insiders, both in government and outside government, and then he leaves American families to just suffer the consequences.  This administration, this Republican Congress, and nominees like Mr.Wehrum are experts at ignoring the facts, but they can't change those facts. Our planet is getting hotter. Our seas are rising at an alarming rate. Our coasts and islands are threatened by devastating storms. Our farms and forests are threatened by droughts and wildfires that are becoming so common across this country that they barely even make the evening news.  The effects of man-made climate change are all around us. Things will only get worse if we don't do something about it. We should never hand our government over to wealthy and powerful companies that put their own profits ahead of people. We certainly shouldn't put someone in charge of our clean air program that will not put the health, the safety, and the future of the American people ahead of short-term corporate profits.  Make no mistake, President Trump wants a fight. Administrator Pruitt wants a fight. William Wehrum wants a fight. And we will give them that fight because the American people will fight to protect the health of our children and our grandchildren, to build a clean energy economy, and to safeguard the future of our planet.  The American people deserve someone who will fight in their corner, and that is not William  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

827,topic-id,1194,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his leadership in impressing on the American people to take a look at Mr.Otting, who has been named to be the head of the I rise and join my voice with his in saying that this is a bad nomination for  Donald Trump promised during his inaugural address to fight for the ``forgotten men and women of our country.'' Yet, even before his bags were unpacked at the White House, he started bringing Wall Street to Washington, importing the worst of the worst bankers who had gambled away the economy, putting them in charge of regulating the same companies they once worked for. It is a long list.  It is the former Goldman Sachs president, Gary Cohn, to lead the National Economic Council and Wall Street fat cat Wilbur Ross to lead the Commerce Randal Quarles went straight from his private equity fund to the Federal Reserve, where he is now responsible for regulating our biggest banks.  Maybe the most important and most ridiculous of all of the Wall Street imports is Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman As the financial crisis was sweeping across the country, Mnuchin organized a team of billionaires to purchase IndyMac Bank out of Federal receivership. He rebranded the bank as OneWest and put himself in charge. Then Mr.Mnuchin and OneWest acted swiftly and decisively to boot more than 36,000 families out of their homes all over the country.  The Senate should never have confirmed that kind of person to run the Treasury Department, but it did. Now, among other things, he leads the Council that is responsible for making sure Wall Street does not blow up our economy again. I know it actually sounds like a joke, but the risks for the rest of us are way too serious.  Republicans don't seem to have any problem with any of this. In fact, they are doubling down. Today, they plan to confirm Mnuchin's former OneWest business partner, Joseph Otting, to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and take another seat on that same  The OCC is one of the most important regulators you have probably never heard of. It is the main bank overseer of the United It charters, regulates, and supervises more than 1,400 banks. The OCC writes rules to make the economy more secure, and it puts examiners inside the big banks in order to catch new tricks and scams before they harm consumers or, worse, before they crash the economy, and when banks mess up, it is the OCC's job to enforce the law.  Mr.Otting is buddies with the Treasury Secretary from their days of leading OneWest I guess that is why he got this nomination, but if you care about making sure regulators watch out for families, businesses, and our economy, it is hard to think of anyone worse for this job other than Steve We all know a segment of the banking industry specialized in squeezing American families, particularly after the financial meltdown, but OneWest may have been the worst of the worst, especially when Otting was president and CEO from 2010 to 2015.  What happened on Mr.Otting's watch?  OneWest ran a notorious foreclosure mill that threw thousands of families out of their homes and illegally--underline ``illegally''--foreclosed on dozens of servicemembers. The OneWest crew didn't just hurt families; it destroyed whole communities when it foreclosed on dozens of properties in the same neighborhoods, making it even harder for families to start over and rebuild. OneWest stole homes out from underneath families, lying to homeowners who were legally entitled to modify their mortgages and keep their homes under a government program and telling them the only way forward was through foreclosure.  OneWest treated all of its homeowners like garbage, but its treatment of minority homeowners was particularly disgusting. OneWest was nine times more likely to foreclose on a homeowner who was in a community of color than to offer him a mortgage.  All of this went down while the bank was busy vacuuming up more than $1 billion in taxpayer bailout money during the financial crisis. These scams at OneWest devastated a lot of American homeowners and, at the same time, put Mr.Otting in the same room with a lot of regulators.  After an investigation by the Treasury Department found that OneWest systematically cheated in foreclosure proceedings, including by lying in sworn statements to judges, cutting corners, and failing to check to make sure they had the right documents before foreclosing on families, Mr.Otting signed a consent decree with the government to agree that OneWest would pay more than 10,000 people for improperly throwing them out of their homes, but that is not all. In 2015, OneWest forked over more than $89 million in fines to the Department of Justice for defrauding the government and illegally putting taxpayers on the hook for the loans if they went bad.  So what happened to Mr.Otting after hurting all of those families, after lying to judges, after admitting to defrauding the U.Government? He got a nice $12 million severance check and a call from Donald Trump, asking if he wanted a corner office right here in  It is crazy to expect a banker who has broken the law to turn around and fight to enforce it. It is like putting criminals in charge of the police station and expecting them not to look the other way while their buddies keep stealing. There is nothing in Mr.Otting's record to suggest he would protect consumers from financial fraud or take the steps needed to rein in the banks or avoid future financial meltdowns.  You may not have heard of the OCC, but I promise you that when this agency refuses to stand up to the big banks and enforce the law, American families get hurt. It is as simple as that. Before the financial crisis, the OCC buddied up with the banks they were supposed to regulate, and everybody knew it. The result was the 2008 financial crisis that cost our economy $14 trillion. Millions of families lost their homes. Millions lost their jobs. Millions lost their savings and their retirement money. Nearly a decade later, many American families are still hurting. Now the Trump administration is ready to take us back to the bad old days, in which banks made gobs of money off risky bets while the regulators just looked the other way.[[Page S7251]]  Confirming Mr.Otting is kicking dirt in the faces of every one of OneWest's victims. It is a gut punch to every American who was hurt in the financial crisis. Even if none of that matters to you, it is a terrible idea because leaving Mr.Otting in charge of bank regulation will endanger our economy. American families and businesses need and deserve a cop on the beat who will fight hard to keep them safe. Everything we know about Mr.Otting says he will be out there fighting for the big banks.  I will be voting no on Mr.Otting's nomination, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.

472,topic-id,1078,"Mr.Speaker, I would be glad to. Just by way of introduction, I thank the ranking member for his leadership.  As the gentleman said, the biggest challenge we face in this country--and it is not a Democrat or Republican issue--is that wages have been stagnant for Americans for 20 years. They haven't had a pay raise. That is a huge challenge because the American Dream has always been premised on the fact that our parents have made an economy that has provided more opportunity for their kids.  Wages are flat. America hasn't had a pay raise in 20 years. So the fundamental question for me on a tax bill is whether that tax bill will increase opportunity for hardworking And it doesn't matter where they are[[Page H9370]]from, rural or urban. It doesn't matter what their race is. It doesn't matter what their gender or their sexual orientation is. Most Americans want to work and they want to take care of the people they love and they want to have an opportunity.  This tax bill comes up real short. By the way, I want to be somewhat self-critical of the We haven't been where we have needed to be, oftentimes, which is for hardworking Americans, but I think we are solidly where we need to be on this tax bill.  Mr.Speaker, I will give the gentleman a couple of examples in explicit response to his question. I went out to a school that provided training for young Vermont men and women who wanted to become welders. That is a great job. They get out of school and they get a job that pays them good wages. They have got to borrow money in order to do that.  In some cases, they have an employer who pays their tuition. Under this tax bill, that young woman or that young man who gets tuition assistance from his or her employer has to declare that as income and pay taxes on it.  That is an opportunity tax. A lot of those folks have borrowed money. We have got a wonderful Vermont Student Assistance Corporation program. It doesn't matter whether you are a Republican child or a Democratic child, you get low interest loans. They have lost their tax deduction.  This is when they are beginning their career, so their income is not great, and they are trying to pay their bills, maybe get a condominium; maybe, if they are really lucky, get a house. They have got to pay more taxes as a result of this bill.  The other thing is private activity bonds. This is unbelievable because what those bonds are--I didn't know much about this before I came to Congress--but it is a benefit where there can be an opportunity to borrow money from the private market, by the way, in order to provide low interest rates. The people who buy these bonds get the benefit of a tax deduction in order to provide a continuing benefit to lower interest rates for kids who are trying to get a welding degree or a community college degree or a higher education degree.  We are taking that away. We are taking away opportunity. We are imposing a big tax on the opportunity for young women and men in There is not a single Republican who would want to do that. But we don't have an opportunity in this bill to propose an amendment, to say: Hey, wait a minute. We made a mistake on this provision because we don't want the would-be welders in Alabama, the would-be welders in Texas, the would-be welders in Vermont to have to pay more in order to develop a skill that is really essential to making those joints on our bridges and doing the things that we need to rebuild our cities.  We are not allowed an opportunity to propose an amendment where every single American would know whether your Representative wanted to impose an opportunity tax on that student who wants to become a welder.  Where is the democracy in this? Where is the transparency in this?  That is what really is heartache for me. As Chairman Neal knows, we grew up in the same city and it was rough and tumble, working class, proud people, and ethnic.                              {time}  2045  We played hard in sports, and we battled all the time. But we had a kind of common pride in the value of work. We saw how hard our parents worked. We didn't necessarily notice that when we should have when we were younger. But as we grew up, we really were stunned at the kind of commitment they had to rebuilding the city that we were in and the gentleman became mayor of. We became so appreciative of the opportunity they gave us.  I grew up in a family of six kids, and how my parents did it in a small house with four bedrooms and sharing a bedroom, we didn't know. It was only after the fact that we became aware of how wonderful this opportunity was that they gave us and the sacrifices that they made.  Isn't it our job in this House of Representatives to give everybody the same opportunity to the experience that Mr.Neal had, that Mr.Lipinski had, and that I had? That was on the shoulders of parents who sacrificed for our benefit.  So the bottom line for me on this tax bill is whether it enhances the opportunity of every American striver, every American who wants to become better, more contributing, more of an active citizen, more of an accomplished adult, and more of a contributor to our workforce. Does this bill help them achieve that or does it impede them from doing that?  When I look just at one specific provision where we say that students are going to have to pay taxes on the interest that they pay on their student loan or when a student who earns, in fact, a scholarship or a fellowship to go advance their higher education and they have to pay income tax on that, I am truly horrified because this country--and this is not a Republican-Democratic deal--is all based on the optimism that, if we give people opportunity, it will benefit all of us. It will benefit that individual who is there to seize that opportunity and make the best of what they can do and, therefore, build the country.  So, Mr.Speaker, I really appreciate the ranking member's efforts on this.

Of those patients, 17 lives were saved due to rapid treatment with freeze-dried plasma.  H.4374 is important because it puts a process in place to broaden the definition of military emergencies and provides the Department of Defense with access to expedited FDA processes for the investigational products like freeze-dried plasma.  I support Chairman Thornberry's unwavering leadership on this issue. With rapidly developing medical technology, the FDA must be part of the modernization and readiness of our Armed We are committed to ensuring that the FDA does the best it can for our deployed forces, and I hope that we can find a way to enable the FDA to consider approved research and clinical studies from our allies in an effort to aid their approval process.  The future will likely bring more medical devices and drugs that can save lives. Having a process to approve and implement emerging medical technologies is a matter of life and death, especially for our brave troops.

483,topic-id,2717,"Mr.President, it has been a sorry spectacle for Americans to witness what the polluting industries are doing, with the full connivance of the Trump administration,[[Page S7130]]to the Environmental Protection Agency--an Agency that enjoys broad popularity among the American people but is obviously a thorn in the side of big polluters who make very big campaign contributions and therefore have inordinately big influence here in  The creep show parade of nominees to the offices responsible for protecting the public's health at EPA is nothing short of astounding. It is an array of cranks, charlatans, hacks, lobbyists, and toadies in really unprecedented measure in the history of our country. It seems that at this point the key and only credential for appointment to the Environmental Protection Agency is that you are reliably pro-industry and reliably anti-public health.  We are facing a nomination for one of these characters, whose name is William He was previously nominated to the EPA Office of Air and Radiation in 2006, but even back then, his record was such a scandal that the White House withdrew his nomination. Now, that was 2006. That was before Citizens That was before the flood of political power to the big polluting industries. Now, on this new political field, he is back, he is just as bad, and there is no hint that the Trump administration has any intention of withdrawing his nomination. He has a real problem dealing with environmental issues, and I think it relates to his record.  In recent years, Mr.Wehrum has represented industry in 39 Federal appellate cases opposing cleaner air protection. He is 39 to 0 in terms of taking the side of industry against clean air protections, and 31 of those cases involved lawsuits against So he will now be defending and judging cases of the type that he brought against the EPA on behalf of industry. Again, not one of those cases argued for better clean air protections. Many of them questioned air toxic standards that had been established by Some of the lawsuits were against rules that had to be rewritten by the Obama administration when EPA failed to follow the Clean Air Act, when a rule was thrown out by the courts for failing to be true to the law. So this is not a great moment for the integrity of government in this particular case.  When we asked Mr.Wehrum questions--for instance, I asked him about carbon dioxide's role in the observable effects of climate change, and he replied: ``The degree to which manmade [greenhouse gas] emissions are contributing to climate change has not been conclusively determined.''  That entire sentence hangs on one word: ``conclusively.'' So if 999 scientists said that this is indeed conclusive but you had 1 outlier--1 against 999--then you could argue that the degree to which manmade greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change has not been conclusively determined. But in the world in which Mr.Wehrum is going to be making decisions, that is not a relevant standard. That is a standard that comes from the climate-denial talking points; it is not a standard that arises from the law or from the way administrative agencies are required to review scientific evidence.  The distinguished Presiding Officer was an attorney general and knows very well that the standard for getting scientific evidence admitted in a court proceeding is whether it is accurate to a reasonable degree of certainty. There is no standard that it has to be conclusive; that is an imaginary prop of the fossil fuel industry to be able to address the fact that it is virtually unanimous science against them and there are only a few payroll scientists floating around to keep it from being conclusive.  To a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, are manmade greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change? Without a doubt. Indeed, NOAA and EPA have concluded that ``carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change.'' That is it. And rules at an administrative agency have to pass the test of being based on substantial evidence, as the Presiding Officer knows, and not being arbitrary or capricious. In any rational world, it would be arbitrary and capricious to deny the vast weight of science because it is not 100 percent conclusive. Nobody makes decisions on that basis in real life.  This, right in this individual's testimony, is a direct echo of fossil fuel industry talking points, fossil fuel industry propaganda, and it is a preview of coming attractions as to whose message he will be mouthing in a position of public responsibility.  Similarly, I asked him about ozone. One of the goals of the Clean Air Act itself is to set standards for how much ozone there can be in the air. This makes a big difference to Rhode Island because Rhode Island is a downwind State from most of the industrial and powerplant emissions through the Ohio Valley, in the Midwest, and through West We actually have ozone alert days in Rhode Island--ozone alert days, when you drive in in the morning and the drive-time radio is warning you that this is not a good day to be outside. It looks sunny. Ozone is transparent. It looks fine. It is usually warm because ozone is propagated in warm air. So on a warm, sunny day, you are driving in, it looks as if everything is fine, and you are warned that the elderly, small children, and people who have breathing difficulties or disabilities should stay indoors. That is the price Rhode Islanders are asked to pay for this ozone pollution we have to live with--stay indoors.  Ozone standards have been in place at EPA for 45 years. For 45 years, EPA has regulated ozone. What did Wehrum answer when I asked him about ozone? ``I am not familiar with the current science on the health effects of ozone, so I cannot comment on your question as to the appropriate level of the standard.'' Really? He wants to run this office--the office which has been handling ozone regulation for 45 years--and he is not familiar with the current science on the health effects of ozone? I think he is quite familiar with the current science on ozone, and in this position, he is going to be looking for ways to get around that science to help the ozone-emitting clients of his private practice.  I asked him about the endangerment finding. The background of the endangerment finding is this: In Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that carbon pollution was, in fact, a pollutant under the Clean Air They decided that in the Supreme Court, and that is now the law of the land.  Then, pursuant to that Supreme Court determination, the EPA had to take a look at whether it is a dangerous pollutant. And they did. Their determination as to whether it is a dangerous pollutant is called an endangerment finding. Sure enough, EPA found that carbon dioxide being emitted by these fossil fuel plants is, in fact, a danger to present and future Americans, to this generation and to generations to come.  Mr.Pruitt, who is one of the slyer rascals around out there, said in the Environment and Public Works Committee that he would not contest or seek to review the endangerment finding. There is an obvious reason why somebody who is completely in tow to the fossil fuel industry would not wish to revisit the endangerment finding; that is, because you would drop an avalanche of scientific fact on your own head. You would be obliged to put the phony little scrapes of climate denial that the fossil fuel industry funds and propagates through a whole bunch of front groups up against the real science that is agreed to by essentially every legitimate scientific organization in America, that is taught at every American State university in all 50 of our States, that has formed the basis of our Defense Department's Quadrennial Defense Review pointing out that climate change is a catalyst of conflict and a national security risk, and that is recognized and tracked by the National Laboratories of the United States that we fund.  Up against the phony-baloney nonsense that is propagated by the fossil fuel industry, that is a rout. Of course, the last thing the fossil fuel industry wants is a fair contest in a fair and factual forum between the real science and their phony science denial. So, of course, Pruitt doesn't want to kick that fight off, and, therefore, he is now stuck with the endangerment finding.  I asked Mr.Wehrum about the endangerment finding, since it is a finding related to greenhouse gases, which are subject to the Clean Air Act, which would be his responsibility in[[Page S7131]]this position at He said: I currently do not have a view on the endangerment finding.  I bet he had a view when he was being paid by the Rubber Manufacturers Association to consider emissions of carbon dioxide; I bet he had a view when he was being paid by the American Forest & Paper Association; and I am pretty sure he had a view when he was being paid by the American Petroleum So this new, sudden absence of a view seems improbable in the extreme. It looks like the best thing he can say to not have to admit the real science, knowing perfectly well that if he actually tried to deny it, that same avalanche of real science would fall around his head.  In some respects, it is tragic that we are now in a situation in which an agency of the U.Government has been handed over to the polluters lock, stock, and barrel. They have been given absolute sway to drive an industry agenda through the Agency that is supposed to be protecting us.  In the balance of Pruitt and all of his little minions in this creep show array of appointees, all you can expect from them is the industry point of view, as close as they can deliver it, without stepping on any of the factual or legal traps that will snap shut on them if they go a little bit too far and actually step into a forum like a courtroom or a contested proceeding where they are obliged to be under oath, where there is a prospect of discovery, and where you have to meet the proper standards for administrative rulemaking, such as based on ``substantial evidence'' or not ``arbitrary and capricious.''  There have been two recent descriptions that have come out that put the climate change problem into perspective. The first is the ``U.Global Change Research Program Climate Science Special Report,'' which is part of the ``National Climate Assessment'' that Congress mandated some years ago. The best scientists from 13 different agencies got together, and over many, many months they put together a comprehensive review of the science and of what is going on. The opening sentence is: ``The climate of the United States is strongly connected to the changing global climate.''  A little sidebar on that--what is happening on climate change in the United States is strongly connected to the change in global climate. When you dump carbon emissions into the atmosphere, it is not just our atmosphere; it is everybody's atmosphere. When China or Russia or India dump carbon emissions into the atmosphere, they are not just hurting their atmosphere; they are hurting our common atmosphere of the planet.  A little trick that Administrator Pruitt has developed is--in calculating the harms of climate change--to look only at U.emissions and look only at U.effects.  If you have an international problem, as our scientists say, strongly connected to the change in global climate, what happens when you look only at the American effects and look only at the American emissions? What that means is that when you are scoring the harm of climate change, you are cutting it down to a mere fraction of what actually exists. You are cutting out the harm that other nations cause to us with their emissions, scrubbing it right off the books, and you are scrubbing off the harm that our emissions do to other nations, scrubbing it right off the books. It doesn't change the harm, of course; it just tweaks the accounting with a piece of rhetorical trickery to help the fossil fuel industry not have to be accountable for the actual harm it causes. That is what we have learned to expect from the EPA--nothing about the actual harm that climate change causes but accounting trickery to try to dial the number down so that a huge majority fraction of the harm never even gets counted.  ``This assessment concludes, based on extensive evidence, that it is extremely likely''--which is the highest level of scientific certainty--``that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.''  It goes on. It is not only that the evidence entirely shows ``that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause,'' but when you look at what the alternatives might be, here is what the next sentence says: ``For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.''  Not only is there an avalanche of evidence supporting the determination that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are causing the climate change we have observed, but when you look to see, well, maybe there is another explanation, there is none, zero. It does not exist. Why not? Because it has never been real--the phony science on the other side. It has always been propaganda. That is why it is featured on talk shows instead of peer-reviewed scientific publications. That is why it comes through phony industry front groups like the George Marshall Institute rather than real scientific organizations. We have known that for a long time.  I see that another speaker has come to the floor. Let me conclude with the recent statement, just in the last few days, of the Pontifical Academy of One of the strongest voices for addressing climate change has been Pope Pope Francis not only sees it as a real problem for our planet and for our care of God's creation, but he also sees it as a justice issue, as a moral issue. The wealthier societies are degrading the quality of life in poorer societies, shifting costs and harm to them, which they are much more vulnerable to than we are, in a cocoon of wealth and air conditioning and supermarkets and all of that. He has been a remarkable voice for this.  One of the things he did was to set up this panel to take a look at climate change and what it means for the planet. The document is called ``Declaration of the Health of People, Health of Planet and Our Responsibility Climate Change, Air Pollution and Health Workshop.''  Here is its opening statement, which it calls the ``Statement of the Problem.'' ``With unchecked climate change and air pollution, the very fabric of life on Earth, including that of humans, is at grave risk.''  If you align the science that comes through the ``National Climate Assessment'' and align the universities of our great country, the national labs of our great country, the military experts in this area in our great country, and now this international body pulled together by Pope Francis, they all come to the same place. It is just here in Congress, where the fossil fuel industry, through massive amounts of political spending, has shut down responsible conversation about this problem that there is any window for climate denial to creep back in--and, of course, the ability of this administration, in tow to the fossil fuel industry, to stick climate-denying fossil fuel operatives into positions of public responsibility. This is a disgrace. The fact that this body cannot stand up to them, cannot find patently conflicted, patently unqualified nominations to be beyond the pale for us is a terrible testament as to how the power of the fossil fuel industry has corrupted our ability to perform our function in the  With that, I yield the floor.

816,topic-id,1171,"Mr.President, I was very pleased to be here for the remarks of my colleagues and friends, and I would just respond by saying that we are all for growth. We are all for growth of the American economy. I think, on this side, we are just a little bit less sure that you grow the economy by growing the share of the economy that goes to the superrich and to big corporations or that you grow the economy by growing benefits to corporations that move jobs from America overseas, and I am pretty confident that on our side we don't believe the[[Page S7242]]solution to the deficit is a tax bill that raises the deficit.                             Climate Change  Mr.President, I am here to talk about the U.Climate Change Conference that we just got back from in Germany, where the United States stood alone as the only Nation in the world--Syria and Nicaragua having left us--not a party to the historic Paris Led by Senator Cardin, my colleagues Senators Markey, Schatz, Merkley, and I went to Bonn to tell the nations gathered there that the Trump administration does not represent American views on this issue, nor American determination to tackle the climate challenge. It was not just us who went there to say we are still in. American Governors, mayors, universities, and major corporations all brought the same message that notwithstanding the Trump administration's efforts to separate us from the Paris goal, we are still in.  The urgency of the experts at our Nation's universities and Federal agencies is reflected in a major multi-agency climate report that was released last week and makes an astounding contrast to the position taken by the Trump administration. The ``Climate Science Special Report'' will serve as the scientific backbone for the ``Fourth National Climate Assessment'' due next year. The authors list is a who's who of top university scientists and Agency experts from NOAA, the EPA, NASA, our National Labs, the National Science Foundation, and the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Commerce, Interior, and State--in all, 13 Federal Agencies and This report was also peer-reviewed by our American National Academy of The New York Times properly described it as ``the United States' most definitive statement on climate change science.''  The report wastes no time getting to the heart of what is causing climate change. It states:       This assessment concludes, based on extensive evidence,      that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially      emissions from greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of      the observed warming since the mid-20th century.  It goes on to say:       The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades      will depend primarily on the amount of greenhouse gases      (especially carbon dioxide) emitted globally.  Further it says:       There is broad consensus that the further and faster the      Earth system is pushed towards warming, the greater the risk      of unanticipated changes and impacts, some of which are      potentially large and irreversible.  In a 2016 interview, President Trump said there is ``some connectivity'' between human activity and climate change, but, he said, ``you can make lots of cases for different views.'' Well, the President ought to read his administration's own report. There is more than just ``some connectivity.'' To quote the report, ``For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence,'' but this administration's industry hacks are not paying attention, and instead of helping, they are out busily doing things like deleting the words ``climate change'' from Agency websites. The Washington Post reported in September that EPA public affairs officer John Kronkus ``told staff that he is on the lookout for `the double C-word'--climate change--and repeatedly has instructed grant officers to eliminate references to the subject in solicitations.''  Maybe they think if they crawl under the bed and scrub out the words ``climate change,'' the scientific phenomenon will disappear, but in science it actually doesn't work that way.  Over at the Department of Energy is Secretary Rick Perry, who called climate change a ``contrived, phony mess'' in his 2010 book. He backtracked his position in his January confirmation hearings but still said he ``believe[s] some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also man-made activity.'' Well, the Energy Secretary might want to read the report. Manmade activity is not some of it; it is the dominant cause.  Then there is EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who said about human activity causing climate change: ``There's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.'' The EPA Administrator needs to read the report too. He is wrong and wrong. ``Dominant'' is what the report says with ``no convincing alternative.''  If Perry or Pruitt bothered to look at the report their staffs helped write, they would see this graph: ``Human Activities Are the Primary Driver of Recent Global Temperature Rise.'' This is the human activity column, this is solar effects, and this is volcanic effects.  Every once in a while somebody says: Oh, it is the volcanoes that are doing it; it is not us. It turns out volcanoes are actually having a slight cooling effect.  People say: No, it is solar radiation; it is not us. You can barely see the amount of solar radiation warming.  All of this is human-caused climate change. It is more than dominant. You can barely see other factors up against it.  As for Pruitt's claim that humans are not ``a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,'' well, you can turn to the report's page 31: ``Human activities are now the dominant cause of the observed trends in climate.'' Flip forward to page 36, and it states: ``Many lines of evidence demonstrate human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are primarily responsible.''  So, Administrator Pruitt, humans are not a primary contributor. The actual science shows ``human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are primarily responsible for the observed climate changes in the Industrial era, especially over the last six decades.''  You could flip to the next page where it says: ``[T]here are no suggested factors, even speculative ones that can explain the timing or magnitude'' of what is happening in the climate or ``that would somehow cancel out the role of human factors.''  Just last week, Kathleen Hartnett White rolled into the Environment and Public Works Committee out of the President's climate denial clown car. White is a prolific climate denier from the fossil fuel-funded Texas Public Policy She wrote that carbon pollution in the atmosphere is ``unquestionably a huge social benefit.'' Unquestionably a huge social benefit? She also compared climate science to a ``cult,'' which kind of lines her up a little bit with that Heartland Institute that has compared climate scientists to the Unabomber, just to give you an idea of the intellectual rigor of the climate denial arguments. Now she is up for consideration as chair of the White House Council on Environmental  In responding to our questions, ",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgS7231-2.txt,1823,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1156,topic-id,1953,"Madam President, I am here to respond to the nomination of Steven Bradbury for a senior legal position in the U.Department of I have had some experience with Mr.Bradbury, and in my experience, he is disqualified from serving in a legal government position of trust, such as he has been nominated for.  The Bush administration pursued a policy of detainee mistreatment that since has been acknowledged to include torture of detainees. The process that got the United States of America into a place where it was torturing detainees was a legal process that was full of mistakes and failures by the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice--by Mr.Bybee, by Mr.Yoo, and, following them, by Mr. Let's start with just a word on the Office of Legal Within the Department of Justice, the Office of Legal Counsel is seen as being the best of the best. The Department of Justice prides itself on attracting, training, and perfecting the skills of the best lawyers in  As a U.Attorney, I had the privilege of serving with a lot of absolutely spectacularly skilled lawyers and trial advocates just in the small Rhode Island U.attorney's office and working with others from the Department of Justice, and I have a very, very high opinion of Department of Justice lawyers and Department of Justice lawyering. But even within the expectation that the Department of Justice lawyering will be first rate, the Office of Legal Counsel is supposed to be a cut above. These are people who go into that office with the possibility that they will become U.Supreme Court These are people who come out of clerkships on the U.Supreme Court--one of the highest academic achievements a law student can have--and end up joining the Office of Legal The Office of Legal Counsel ought to be held to a very high standard.  What happened when the Office of Legal Counsel was asked to take a look at the CIA torture program in the Bush administration was that it fell down or rolled over in virtually every respect. The factual investigation into what the CIA was actually doing was weak and ineffectual. The legal investigation into the past, into precedents, was--as I said in previous speeches at the time--fire-the-associate quality legal work. It is particularly bad coming from the Office of Legal Counsel because the Office of Legal Counsel is supposed to be the best of the best.  It is hard to say that these guys failed having tried their best. They just weren't smart enough to figure it out. They just weren't working hard enough. They just didn't know enough about legal research or scholarship. So, you know, nice try but you blew it, but no harm in it because we don't expect much of you to begin with.  That is certainly not the case with The array of memos that the OLC wrote--the Bybee, Yoo, and Bradbury memos--were calamitous failures of historical and legal research. For one thing, they failed to recognize and report that there had been prosecutions of Japanese military officers after World War II for torturing American soldiers. One of the techniques of torture for which those Japanese soldiers were prosecuted and convicted as torturers, as war criminals, was the use of the waterboard. You may be able to say that there were some different justifications. You may be able to say that there were some different circumstances, but to not even mention that, to not even do the research to find out that had taken place is a pretty bad legal failing.  One of the reasons was that they kept it so close hold that they didn't let military lawyers know what they were doing. One could argue that there is consciousness of guilt there, that they didn't want other lawyers to know what they were doing because they knew that what they were doing was shoddy legal work and they didn't want to be caught out in it. In fact, ultimately, a lot of those opinions were withdrawn.  The fact of the matter is that it was a failure to properly inform the President of the United States about this history of our country actually prosecuting Japanese soldiers for the type of conduct that the Department of Justice was approving that the CIA engage in. It wasn't just prosecutions of Japanese soldiers by American military tribunals. There were also prosecutions of American soldiers in the Philippines by courts-marshal for torture. Guess what. The conduct involved was waterboarding.  Again, perhaps you can say that there were some differences, that there were some distinctions, but the fact is, in memo after memo--including the wrapup memo that Bradbury wrote--that was not discussed. It was not disclosed, and it was not discussed.  You may say: Well, you know, it is asking an awful lot of the Office of Legal Counsel to go and look at history, to go and look at the practice of our military in prosecuting adversary officers or in prosecuting our own soldiers. After all, we are just the Department of That is the Department of What could we possibly learn from that?  Well, obviously, that would be wrong and, obviously, that would be a mistake, particularly when you look across that boundary to military law and see these examples right on point that they did not bother to discuss or disclose.  Then, it gets better still. The OLC memos failed to disclose prosecutions by the Department of Justice for waterboarding. This is not some case that never got reported someplace, that was just a trial, and you would have to look deep into your own records to try to find out what took place--perhaps, without a reported decision, just a verdict from the jury. This was a case that was extensively documented with writings by the trial court judge, a U.district judge in the State of Texas, that went up on appeal to the circuit court of appeals, and the U.circuit court of appeals wrote a decision on appeal of the district court's decision.[[Page S7195]]  What were the facts? The facts were that there was a local sheriff. His last name was So the case was named United States v. Mr.Lee had gone into the business of waterboarding prisoners--strapping them in a chair, tipping them back, and pouring water over their faces to give the illusion of drowning. The court's decision over and over describes this conduct as torture. If you use legal search tools and look for the words ``water'' and ``torture,'' United States v. Lee comes up, and it is a circuit court of appeals decision.  How could they miss it? There are only two explanations that I can come up with. One is that they really did a shoddy job of workmanship, that they didn't bother to do basic legal research. That is why I have described this in the past as fire-the-associate quality work. If you haven't done the basic legal research to determine what the cases are on point on the question of whether the use of water on bound prisoners is torture, you haven't done much of a good job. The problem is that scenario is actually the best case scenario. The best case scenario is that they did such slipshod work at the Office of Legal Counsel that they didn't find a U.circuit court of appeals decision on point to the question upon which the OLC was advising the President of the United That is the best case scenario.  The worst case scenario is that they did find it and decided not to talk about it in their memos because you can read United States v. Lee and put it against those OLC memos, and I think any rational reader will find them impossible to correlate.  There is a real possibility that the Office of Legal Counsel decided that, because Cheney had decided on this torture program and because they were embarked on this torture program, they were going to have to deliver the legal opinion that allowed it to continue. If it meant ignoring a case that proved their opinion wrong, they were going to ignore the case, and they were going to go ahead with the opinion. As you can imagine, that is considerably worse than simply not finding the case.  We have never had a very good description of how this all came out. There was an OPR report from the Department of Justice that heaped condemnation on the various players here, but ultimately this question of what the obligation is of an OLC lawyer to fairly disclose what the relevant case law is in writing an OLC opinion was never reached. It was never reached because, at the end of this long and arduous process, the Department of Justice made, I think, a terrible decision.  There is a rule of professional conduct that is called the rule of candor to the tribunal. If you are a lawyer and you are going before a judge, you have an obligation to state the law fairly and accurately to the judge. If you are not being truthful to the judge about what the law is, that is a violation of professional conduct for which lawyers can be sanctioned. It applies to lawyers across the board. A hard-working lawyer with six or seven files under his arms, piling into a State district court to maybe run through three or four cases in that day before a busy judge, has the obligation of candor, and it includes an obligation to do adequate research, to actually have looked up the case law and to disclose it to the judge so that you are not misleading the court about the state of the law. That applies to lawyers across the country. The busiest, most distracted local lawyer and just a guy with a practice, maybe in a strip mall, who buzzes into court with a bunch of files under his arms--that lawyer is under that same obligation.  Yet the Office of Legal Counsel--this high temple of lawyering, this ``best of the best'' of the Department of Justice--made the decision that those lawyers, in their providing advice to the President of the United States, did not have the same obligation of candor that an ordinary, day-to-day, working lawyer in a local courthouse had to that local judge.  I believe that rule has since been reversed, and it is very good that it has been reversed because I think the President of the United States is entitled to at least the level of candor from these ``best of the best'' lawyers at the Office of Legal Counsel that a local judge is from the hard-working, overburdened, day-to-day lawyers who appear in front of him or her. That is not what the President got, not from this Office of Legal Counsel, not from Steve  Again, I don't know that we will ever know because that decision by the Department put to an end the investigation of the question of whether this failure amounted to professional malpractice by the OLC lawyers, but the options aren't great. These lawyers either did not do the work to discover the military tribunals, the courts-martial, and the Texas criminal prosecution by the Department of Justice, or, worse yet, they did discover those things and deliberately withheld that information so that they could give the opinion they thought they were supposed to give. It is about the worst thing a lawyer in that position could do, and until that is cleared up, I could not possibly support the nomination of Steven Bradbury to any position of trust in the Government of the United  I yield the floor.

195,topic-id,391,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018.  This bill fully funds our Armed Forces, increases troop end-strength, and sets in earnest the modernization of our military and ensures that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are properly compensated for the sacrifices they make for a grateful nation on a daily basis.  In my role as the Seapower and Projection Forces chairman, I vowed months ago to set the conditions for the Navy to grow to 355 ships, in accordance with the Navy's own force structure assessment. I am proud to say that this bill sends the signal to our Navy, the industrial base, and our adversaries that a 355-ship Navy is not[[Page H9204]]just a theoretical idea, but rather an achievable reality.  The bill expands on the eight ships requested by the administration by adding an additional five ships. The bill also recommends additional advanced procurement for the Virginia-class attack submarines, while fully funding the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program.  As to aircraft, the bill fully funds the B-21 Raider bomber program, a critical component of the future nuclear triad.  This bill also recommends an expansion of KC-46A aerial refuelers, C-130J airlift, and P-8 submarine aircraft. Finally, the bill delivers expanded authorities that will save the taxpayers billions of dollars.  Now, some of our colleagues have suggested that our defense budget is excessive and that additional moneys should be provided towards other efforts. Mr.Speaker, this thought is not only misguided, but it is dangerous. We have a constitutional responsibility to provide for the common defense of our We will not shrink from that responsibility, and I hope none of my colleagues undermine the efforts to deliver the $634 billion base moneys that are required for our national security.  Finally, I want to recognize Ranking Member Joe He has been and continues to be a true partner in ensuring the Seapower and Projection Forces of our Nation are properly resourced. I do not think that we would be anywhere close to delivering the 355-ship Navy or providing for our Air Force's deep-strike capability without his steadfast resolve and sincere efforts to realize bipartisan solutions.  Mr.Speaker, I also want to reflect that with the chairman and the ranking member and their leadership, and I urge my colleagues to support the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.

44,topic-id,844,"Mr.Speaker, I tell folks back home that they should watch this time at 10 in the morning, where any Member can come down and talk about anything they want to talk about, because you can learn a lot about one another.  There are folks who come to this floor every single morning to celebrate somebody in their district back home, to build up the country with optimism, and with the belief that if only we unite, if only we work harder, we can make tomorrow better than yesterday was.  There are those Members who come to the floor on a regular basis to tear things down. I tell you, Mr.Speaker, I have been in this world for 47 years. I know it is easier to tear things down than it is to build things up. Something has happened in this institution where the currency is how quickly can you tear the other side down instead of how quickly can you partner with them to build things up.  Tax reform is hard. I have a bill for folks who are uncomfortable with the elimination of special carve-outs, deductions, exemptions, and lobbyist loopholes. For folks who are uncomfortable with those things, I have a bill that repeals absolutely every one. It is called the FairTax It is H.25.  We are not going to vote on that bill today because this institution is not comfortable eliminating absolutely everything all at once. But there is a difference of opinion, Mr.Speaker, in what the Tax Code is designed for. Is it designed to punish people that you dislike and reward people that you do like? Or is it designed simply to raise the revenue so that the government can do the things it needs to do?  I believe the latter.  My friends have come to the floor today and they have said: Oh, we are eliminating this exemption and that deduction, and that carve-out and that loophole, and those things help with the cost of education.  Well, I say to my friends: If we want to help with the cost of education, let's deal with education.  The Tax Code is not the solution to every problem. Oftentimes it is the source of those problems.  For folks who believe that the cost of medical care is too expensive, I agree. Another carve-out, another loophole, another exemption, the Tax Code will not solve that problem. It may mask that problem, but it will not solve it. We have to come together to solve the healthcare inflation problem.  I say to my friends who are worried about the medical cost deduction: I worry about that, too. I worried about it when the Affordable Care Act made it 33 percent harder for Americans to claim that; when it raised that base level from 7.5 percent to 10 percent, meaning so many more Americans couldn't claim it.  This bill doubles the standard deduction so that families don't have to worry about the magnitude of their burden. Simply, the fact that they have a burden means that they will be able to exempt it.  My friend from Pennsylvania came and told the story of two families from Pennsylvania working in a picture tube factory. It was a powerful story of American manufacturing disappearing. If I looked around this institution to find a millennial here, they wouldn't even know what a picture tube is. That factory was going to go out of business because technology surpassed it.  We are losing American manufacturing overseas every single day, not because we are not the hardest working people on the planet, but because we have the most punitive Tax Code on the planet. Everyone here knows it.  In 1986, everyone knew it. America had the least competitive Tax Code on the planet, but Democrats and Republicans came together--Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill--and they took America from worst to first. Decades of economic prosperity ensued. We are doing that very same thing today: worst to first.  Would be that it were Democrats and Republicans together that were doing that, but I tell you, Mr.Speaker, the time is not too late to come together to do that. It was a worthy goal in 1986. It is a worthy goal today. The Tax Code should not be picking winners and losers. It should be creating an economic environment where the American worker can succeed; where the American worker and its commitment is not at a disadvantage to the rest of the world, but it is at least on a level playing field, if not advantaged to the rest of the world.  We can do that together today, and I hope that we will. It will always be easier to tear things down and than to build things up, Mr.But I know the men and women in this Chamber on a personal level, and I know they didn't come to tear things down. They came to build a better day tomorrow for their children, their grandchildren, and the constituents that they represent.  Mr.Speaker, I hope that we will fulfill that promise together.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-15-pt1-PgH9261.txt,2008,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017,15,November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On March 5, 1969, his reconnaissance team was assaulted by a North Vietnamese Army platoon. During the firefight, a hand grenade was thrown at him and a comrade. Realizing the consequences of his actions, Private First Class Jenkins, Jr., pushed his comrade to the ground and leapt on the hand grenade to shield him from the explosion. Absorbing the full impact of the blast, he was seriously injured and succumbed to his wounds.  John 15:13 states:       Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life      for one's friend.  On April 20, 1970, the Medal of Honor was presented to his family at the White House by Vice President  Private First Class Jenkins, Jr., is buried at Sister Spring Baptist Cemetery in Interlachen,  The sacrifice Private First Class Jenkins, Jr., made cannot be understated. Naming his hometown post office after him is just one small way we as a nation can continue to honor this American hero.

1235,topic-id,176,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, which contains critical reforms that protect access to affordable insurance, improves the way policyholders are treated when filing a claim, and places the National Flood Insurance Program on the path towards fiscal solvency.  Included in this legislation is the bipartisan bill I introduced with Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney that provides a credit to NFIP policyholders who reduce their flood risk through mitigation. Homeowners who do the right thing and invest in mitigation activities deserve a strong return on their investment in the form of lower NFIP premiums.  On Long Island, where the coastal economy is our main economy, protecting life and property from flood damage is a top priority.  I look forward to working with all my colleagues in Congress to get this bill passed in the Senate and sent to the President's desk without delay.  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this essential legislation, grateful for Chairman Hensarling's and Chairman Duffy's leadership on this issue, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
