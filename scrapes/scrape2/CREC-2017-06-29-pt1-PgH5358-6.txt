                   EDEN PRAIRIE BOYS BASEBALL CHAMPS

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Eden Prairie 
Boys Baseball team on becoming high school State champs recently. They 
secured a 5-1 win over Forest Lake.
  After a challenging first four innings, the Eagles, led by senior 
pitcher Jack Zigan, came back to win their very first State 
Championship since 2010. Jack threw a complete game, surrendering only 
three hits and one unearned run, with an impressive 11 strikeouts.
  This marked the end of a fantastic season for the Eagles, who 
finished the year 18-9 after entering the State tournament without a 
seed. They were never expected to get this far. They

were never expected to win, but they defeated the number 1, the number 
2, and the number 4 seed teams by a combined score of 25-2.
  So, Mr. Speaker, once again, I would just like to congratulate this 
hardworking team of student athletes, their coaches, and their parents 
for their State Championship win. This really does go to show that 
perseverance and hard work pay off.
