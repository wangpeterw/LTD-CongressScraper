                 HONORING THE LIFE OF REGINA FARR ROSS

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Ms. Regina 
Farr Ross, lovingly known in her North Side, Fort Worth community as 
Big Mama.
  Ms. Ross was born in Fort Worth, Texas, on the Fourth of July in 1914 
in Stick Town, which was a Fort Worth neighborhood. She attended Ninth 
Ward Elementary School and graduated from historic I.M. Terrell High 
School in Fort Worth.
  She worked as a dishwasher and a general helper for several 
restaurants, including the famous Pig Stand drive-in, the Farmer's 
Daughter, and the Cattlemen's Steakhouse in the stockyards, where she 
spent 39 years and retired at the age of 80.
  Ms. Ross was active in the community and volunteered her time to 
teach young children how to read, and on her birthday, every 
Independence Day, she had a huge party on Prospect Avenue in the North 
Side near the stockyards for everybody to come out and celebrate.
  Through her membership with the Association of Community 
Organizations for Reform Now, she traveled across the East Coast 
advocating for lower utility rates for senior citizens.
  On Wednesday, January 31, Ms. Ross passed away at her home at the age 
of 103. She is survived by five daughters, two sons, hundreds of grand-
, great-, great-great-, and great-great-great-grandchildren.
  I know the Fort Worth community will miss seeing Big Mama from her 
porch, waving to every passerby while she sits in her favorite chair.
