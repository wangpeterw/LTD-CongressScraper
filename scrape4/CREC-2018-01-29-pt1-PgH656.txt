                    HONORING THE LIFE OF SANDY CASEY

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Sandy 
Casey.
  Sandy had a great impact on the students and family she worked with 
as a special education teacher at Manhattan Beach Middle School. She 
was passionate about her work and was committed to continuing her own 
learning. Sandy would take on new projects that came her way, and she 
was devoted to all of her students.
  Sandy attended Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas with her 
fiance, Chris, and her friend. She is remembered by her community as a 
fun-loving, free spirit who was a compassionate and loyal friend.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to Sandy Casey's 
family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State 
of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.
