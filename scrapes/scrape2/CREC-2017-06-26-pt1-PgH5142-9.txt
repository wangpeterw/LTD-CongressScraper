               HONORING TEJ MAAN, YUBA CITY CITY COUNCIL

  (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Tej Maan, an 
upstanding citizen and council member in my district. Mr. Maan has been 
the director of environmental health in Yuba County since 1998, where 
he has created vital safeguards to protect the environmental health and 
well-being of the Yuba County community.
  Additionally, Mr. Maan is a member of the Punjabi American Heritage 
Society, the California Conference of Directors of Environmental 
Health, and the Yuba City Chamber of Commerce. He is the host of a 
local television show called ``Punjabi Waves,'' which features 
discussions and in-depth interviews on current events and issues in the 
Punjabi community.
  Mr. Maan is also the founder of the first Sikh school in the United 
States, which is located in Yuba City. Tej's love for America and his 
selfless dedication to his community have made him a well-respected and 
treasured member of the Yuba City region. I offer my utmost 
appreciation and gratitude for Tej Maan's many contributions to 
society.
