848,topic-id,594,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to a very critical issue that has occurred concerning our skies and the control thereof.  Our U.airspace is the busiest airspace in the world and, alone, is the safest and most successful. We have over 87,000 flights per day in the United States airspace. Our wonderful friends from Canada, just to the north, have only a mere fraction of that.  For decades, our air traffic control has been successfully managed under the FAA with the oversight of Congress and the American taxpayer. Like any system, there is always room for improvement and modernization. However, there are some who think that the only way to get to modernization is through privatization. This could not be further from the truth.  Congress will soon begin debating an FAA reauthorization bill. Chairman Shuster and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure have done a commendable job and worked tirelessly to craft a bill that brings much-needed reforms to the However, I strongly disagree with the idea to give control of air traffic services to a private corporation governed by a board made up of special interests. There are just too many reasons why this is a bad idea.  Under the plan, the corporation would operate air traffic control by charging flyers user fees. A private corporation concerned with raising money from user fees will be heavily incentivized to prioritize air traffic services where it can raise the most money.  This incentive would be very harmful to constituents like mine in rural areas who could very well see a reduction in air traffic services.  Further, a private user fee model would undoubtedly reduce revenues to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, as the administration's own budget predicts. This fund is critical for upgrades and maintenance in small- and medium-sized airports across the country.  Reliable air traffic services and airport infrastructure are essential for rural areas to attract business, for economic growth, and for Americans to have access to safe and efficient travel. This plan is bad for rural  Spinning off air traffic control to a private corporation is also a major liability for the American taxpayer. The administration's budget predicts that privatization of air traffic control would cost almost $46 billion over 10 years. These costs would be compounded by the fact that the private corporation will be required to hire all current Federal air traffic employees, continue to contribute to their Federal benefits and healthcare, and continue to collectively bargain with their union representatives. This is hardly privatization and hardly modernization.  Even more concerning, the taxpayers would likely be on the hook if the corporation took on more debt than it can pay for and is unable to safely operate our skies.  Yes, the bill says there is no Federal guarantee for the corporation, but this hasn't stopped the Federal Government from being forced to bail out other so-called private corporations to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars such as Fannie Mae and Freddie  Our airspace is a public resource and a great national treasure. Control over it should not be handed over to a private board with no oversight from Congress and, therefore, no obligation to[[Page H5889]]represent the best interests of the citizens of the United                              {time}  1215  Modernization should continue to be our goal, and Congress can get there without jeopardizing control and safety of our national airspace.  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the President to modernize our airspace while making sure that it remains the safest and most accessible in the world.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-17-pt1-PgH5888-2.txt,2244,HONORING FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL MASTER SERGEANT WILLIAM BISHOP,2017.0,17.0,July

These structures teach us about the lengths that African Americans went through to be educated and to fight for their place in American society.  They also provide important lessons for today, reminding us of how far we have come as a society and how these structures were once built to cope with Jim Crow America but now are used to educate our future lawyers, doctors, and politicians.  They also remind us of how far we have to go, how we must continue to address the numerous inequities HBCUs face compared to other universities when it comes to educating the next generation.  Funding from this program finances repairs that schools with large endowments take for granted, repairs from water damage, asbestos, lead paint, improvements to heating and ventilation systems, and increased physical accessibility for the disabled.  The program helps modernize HBCU campuses, creating a suitable environment for learning and achievement, while allowing these institutions to attract prospective students who deserve an education.  W.E.DuBois reminded us: Of all of the civil rights for which the world has struggled and fought for for 500 years, but the right to learn is undoubtedly the most fundamental.  In short, Mr.Speaker, this program is necessary to update HBCU infrastructure and maintain their competitive edge as institutions of higher learning supporting that fundamental right.  The President has said these schools are a priority for his administration. They are absolutely a priority for me as well as for my colleagues of the CBC and the bipartisan HBCU So passing it proves that Congress can come together to achieve something substantial for these schools and continue the conversation surrounding  ",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgH5207.txt,2201,HONORING FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL MASTER SERGEANT WILLIAM BISHOP,2017.0,27.0,July

923,topic-id,1131,"Madam President, I rise to recognize the first anniversary of a horrific tragedy that shook this One year ago, in the early morning hours of June 12, 2016, we all witnessed an unthinkable act of hatred and terror at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, It was Pride Month and Latin night, and dozens of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people, along with friends and family, were gathered simply to have fun in what should have been a place of acceptance, affirmation, and safety. In a matter of moments, what should have been a celebration turned into one of the worst mass shootings in American history--a targeted act of terror and hate, an attack on the freedoms we all hold dear. These 49 innocent people lost their lives in this attack, and 53 others were wounded. Many, many others bear the emotional scars.  This was not only a deadly act of domestic terrorism; it was a hate crime--a crime that targeted victims because of who they were and was designed not just to harm its victims but to terrorize everyone in the community.  Last year, I came to the floor to read the names and tell the stories of the victims of this massacre in Orlando, because we cannot and we must not forget these men and women. Their stories need a voice. Today, I rise again to remember the victims.  As I did 1 year ago, I come to the floor to ask my colleagues to find the courage to stand up, speak out, and act to confront the rising tide of hate crimes and discrimination in We must never forget the victims of this hate crime, and we must honor them with action.  While the Pulse shooting was an unimaginable horror, it is, sadly, far from the only act of violence that has been perpetrated out of hatred. Even before June 12 of last year, we had seen an alarming increase in reports of hate crimes against LGBTQ people but also against racial and religious minorities and immigrants. In the aftermath of a divisive election, we saw hundreds of documented instances of discrimination, harassment, and even violence against members of minority communities as well as increased hostility within our Nation's schools. In this year alone, at least 11 transgender people have been murdered, most of them women of color.  The fact is that many members of racial, ethnic, disability, and religious minority communities, as well as LGBT people, live in very real fear for their safety. They are scared, and it is[[Page S3385]]incumbent upon President Trump as our Nation's leader to demonstrate to them and to all Americans that discrimination and violence against any individual because of who he is, whom he loves, and how he worships will not be tolerated in this country.  When I stood here last year, I called for a greater investment in the Federal Government's effort to both try to prevent hate crimes and fully investigate and prosecute them whenever they happen. After President Trump took office, I was joined by a number of my Senate colleagues in urging him and the Attorney General to support robust funding for the Department of Justice's programs that combat bias-motivated crimes. I believe a documented increase in hate crimes demands an increase in the resources that are committed to fighting this problem. Yet the budget put forward by President Trump and Attorney General Sessions seeks no increases. In fact, it proposes cutting more than 100 staff from the Department of Justice's Civil Rights  This administration has failed to step up and speak out against this disturbing trend across our country or to commit the resources necessary to fight it.  Instead of showing the moral leadership our Nation needs in the face of increasing hatred and division, President Trump and his administration have taken steps to roll back our Nation's progress in many areas, including progress for the LGBT community.  Rather than issue a proclamation recognizing Pride Month and committing to address the many challenges still facing LGBT Americans, President Trump recently issued an Executive order that could open the door to discrimination with Federal taxpayer dollars.  Rather than stand up for transgender students facing bullying, harassment, and discrimination, this administration rescinded guidance to schools about the rights of those vulnerable young people under Federal law.  Rather than building on the steps taken to better understand the needs of LGBT people by simply counting us, the Trump administration has walked back efforts to ask about LGBT Americans in Federal surveys at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Census  Simply put, President Trump has not lived up to his vow to be a President for all  But where I come from, in Wisconsin, our State motto consists of one word: ``Forward.'' I believe that no matter who is in the Oval Office, our country must move in only one direction--forward.  Remember, while Pride Month is, of course, about celebration--of who we are and of how far we have come--it is just as much about bravely standing up and speaking out so that others will not feel compelled to live in silence.  To the survivors of the Pulse shooting and the families and friends of those who were murdered and who feel the wounds of this tragedy most deeply, we hear your voices and we are inspired by your strength.  As a community, we have never been deterred by tragedy and will not be now. One of the early leaders in our fight for equality was Harvey Milk, and he was also struck down by violent hatred. Harvey Milk famously said: ``Hope will never be silent.''  So today I rise to remind us of the power of hope in the face of tragedy. We must continue to work to pass on to the next generation a country that is more equal, not less. We must remain strong in fighting any rollback of progress, large or small.  There is more work to be done to ensure that all Americans are protected from hatred and discrimination, and the work toward full equality for LGBTQ people and their families remains far from complete.  For myself and those who stand united this Pride Month, we are guided by our uniquely American values. It is about freedom--the freedom to realize our founding belief that all Americans are created equal under the law. It is about fairness--whether gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Americans deserve to be treated just like their family members, their friends, their neighbors, their fellow workers. It is about opportunity--about whether every American gets to dream the same dreams, chase the same ambitions, and have the same shot at success.  This is the promise of America, and we must fight to make sure we keep it.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-12-pt1-PgS3383-3.txt,1558,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,12.0,July
689,topic-id,924,"Mr.President, over the past few months, Congress has passed 14 different resolutions that are going to save the American people money and are going to make it a lot easier for our economy to grow. There have been 14 times since February that we have struck down unnecessary, burdensome, and costly regulations.  These were called ``midnight regulations'' because they came at the end of the Obama administration. Some came out, actually, after the Presidential election had been completed. The outcome was known, and, still, the outgoing administration tried to continue with what President Obama's Chief of Staff at one time called ``audacious executive actions.'' Half of these 14 regulations--half of them--were actually put in place after the November Presidential election.  When one thinks about the election last year in November, President Obama said time and again during the campaign that his agenda was on the ballot. The American people rejected that agenda, and the President dumped these new rules on the American people as a parting shot. We wiped out 14 of these regulations--wiped them off the books.  In one resolution, we rolled back an important part of President Obama's war on coal. That was the so-called stream buffer rule. It was designed to shut down a lot of the surface coal mining in this country. It would have destroyed up to one-third of coal mining jobs in So we passed a resolution that will protect coal mining jobs and protect American energy independence.  There was another resolution we passed that restores the role of local land managers in deciding how best to use Federal land. Before the Obama administration, the local experts were the ones who would help decide how Federal land could be used in so many areas around the country. These are the people on the ground. They are the ones who know best what works there. They are the ones with the best sense of how to balance all of the different ways that land can be used. That could be things like recreation, energy production, and grazing.  Well, the Obama administration said it wasn't interested in hearing from the local experts anymore. It decided to put the decisions--all of those decisions--in the hands of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in Washington, So Congress passed a resolution that says these are decisions that affect local communities and those communities should have the say--and a significant amount of say--in how decisions get made.  When we look at these 14 resolutions all together, they will save Americans over $4 billion and more than 4 million hours of paperwork because not only are the regulations expensive, they are burdensome and time-consuming.[[Page S2895]]  I can tell my colleagues this is just the beginning. These resolutions are just one tool that we have to strike down bad regulations. There is much more that Congress can do and will do, and there is much more that the Trump administration can do.  The administration has already made it clear that the bureaucrats in Washington are not in charge anymore. I plan to make sure the Trump administration keeps up the pace and tosses some of the worst regulations and rules into the garbage where they belong.  A good place to start would be for Ryan Zinke, the Secretary of the Interior, to throw out another rule that makes it more difficult to produce American energy. This regulation supposedly tries to reduce how much methane gets lost in oil and gas production. There is always some unprocessed natural gas that gets released at gas and oil wells. Energy producers try to gather up this gas and then ship it to a processing plant where, of course, it can be sold. It can be used by customers, and taxes are paid on it that go to State and local governments, as well as money that is raised by the sales for the companies themselves.  To do that, the producers need small pipelines. They need these small pipelines to collect the unprocessed gas from the wells and to get it to the processing plant. Here is the problem: We don't have enough of these gathering lines. Without the gathering lines, the only option is for that gas to get burned, and that extra natural gas will escape into the air.  So what do the bureaucrats in Washington say? They could have addressed the real reason this gas is being lost; that is, the fact that they haven't allowed enough of these gathering lines on Federal land. Instead, they decided to write a regulation that makes it tougher for us to produce American energy here in The Obama administration blocked the permits to build the gathering lines.  So this methane rule is a terrible regulation. It is redundant. It is unnecessary. I believe it is illegal, and it needs to go. Secretary Zinke should wipe the slate clean and get rid of this outrageous rule immediately. He should also order the bureaucrats who work for him to start approving more of these gas-gathering lines. That is what we really need. We need to make energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, and do it in ways that do not raise costs for American families. We need to balance thoughtful regulation with a growing economy. We can have both.  The Obama administration absolutely failed to strike the right balance. The Trump administration and Congress have a lot more we can do to make sure we get the balance right.

1008,topic-id,1868,"Mr.President, I am here to share the words, the stories, the fears, and some of the faces of people in Connecticut who will be impacted by the bill that was released this morning--the so-called discussion draft, if that is the right term for it. We learned this morning, I think, why that discussion draft has been shrouded in secrecy. The reason is very simply that my Republican colleagues are ashamed and embarrassed about it, and rightly, because it is not only mean, as the House bill was, but it is meaner. It is cruel and costly.  It will be cruel and costly to the people of Connecticut, in human suffering and illness and disease, and it will be costly in failing to prevent and treat disease before it becomes more expensive. That is one of the lessons of public health policy today: Treat earlier; prevent before diseases or illnesses or conditions become even more costly. It is not only a way to save lives; it is a way to save money.  The voices and faces of Connecticut have been heard nowhere in this process because of its secrecy, because it has denied anyone in America, in fact, the opportunity to be heard, to comment, to make their views known. Speed and secrecy have been the watchwords, and they are a toxic recipe, and they should mean this discussion draft is dead on delivery today.  My constituents have actually come in overwhelming numbers to an emergency field hearing on healthcare that I began in Hartford earlier this week, Monday morning at 9 a.m. They came for 2 hours. There were many more than we expected on very short notice, and they were there to make sure their voices and faces were heard and seen. That is what I did earlier in the week when I entered their testimony into the Record of the I was proud to do so.  We are continuing that emergency field hearing, in fact, tomorrow at 1:30 in New Haven at the Aldermanic Chambers, which have even greater capacity. We are expecting many more, judging by the response to the email blast and invitations that we have sent, because people care about healthcare.  They should care because it is the difference between life and death, and this bill will be the difference between life and death for so many people in It will be death. Even though that statement may sound like hyperbole or exaggeration, the public health experts, the docs, and the hospitals that deliver healthcare in Connecticut and around the country know that it is true, and so do the people of Connecticut and our country.[[Page S3716]]  My colleagues have failed to hear those faces and voices because they have refused to have hearings, markups, committee meetings, and robust full debate on the floor of this Chamber, as is the practice and should be in other pieces of legislation. Why is it not for one of historic and unprecedented importance for the future of our Nation?  Instead, they have met behind closed doors, a group of men who, maybe, coincidently, produced a bill that defunds Planned Parenthood and, in effect, furthers a war on women's health--an assault on women's healthcare that will deny mammograms, screenings, preventive care--and on primary care for men, as well as women, in this country.  It will gut Medicare and It will rob millions of people of the healthcare they now have through It will mean higher costs and less care for America and especially for our seniors, who will be among the most victimized by these cuts.  For anyone who cares about opioid addiction and abuse--and everyone in this Chamber, by an overwhelming majority, during the last session voted for the 21st Century Cures Act and then for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, bipartisan, but it was nowhere nearly enough funded--this bill means, in fact, less funding than the House measure would have provided, from $65 billion increased funding for opioid addiction and abuse treatment to $2 billion.  When my colleagues characterize this bill as heartless, they underestimate its impact on people who suffer from the disease--it is a disease, not a moral failing--of addiction and abuse.  Yesterday the voices and faces that I elicited on the floor of the Senate were three people who have struggled with substance use disorder and encountered different endings--Justice, Sean, and We lost Sean just a few weeks ago. Frank could not come to the hearing we conducted on Monday because he is recovering, as well, and the heartbreak of Sean's loss so affected him.  But Maria Skinner described their struggle to recover from that substance use disorder. Justice will likely never recover from the injuries she sustained when she overdosed. Although Frank is doing well, I am pleased to say he has access to Medicaid and the essential treatment services that he needs only because Medicaid exists in the present form. Denying him that kind of service and treatment means that he may be consigned to the risk that doomed Justice and The coldheartedness of the House bill was hard to match, but on Medicaid the Senate version has outdone even that coldheartedness--cutting the program even more drastically and costing our Nation, not just healthcare but also jobs.  When we say Medicaid, let's be very clear whom we are talking about, and let me introduce three of the people who are affected.  With me in this photograph are Evan, Amelie, and They live with their mom in Ansonia, Following their father's death 6 years ago, the entire family went on Medicaid so they could continue receiving the coverage they need and deserve and the healthcare they need and deserve.  Their mom reached out to my office to speak at the hearing that I am having tomorrow. She wrote to me:       I am very frightened that federal funding for state      Medicaid programs will receive tremendous cuts with this      potential repeal. I hope to advocate to all those in      positions of power that will listen so they can see a face to      this problem.  The face to this problem is before us in this It is children and families that will see Medicaid decimated for them if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, as would be done by this so-called discussion draft from our Republican colleagues.  Today Evan, Amelie, and Amanda's mom is just learning how tremendous these cuts will be, and today she will fear even more for her children's health and well-being, because when we talk about cuts to Medicaid, we aren't talking about a line item on a budget. We aren't talking about a simple number or a statistic. We are talking about literally millions of children like Evan, Amelie, and Amanda, who have parents fearing what will happen if their reliance on Medicaid is betrayed ruthlessly, senselessly, and recklessly and if their dependence on this vital program for the basic healthcare they need is stripped away.  This bill would also jeopardize affordable access to people with preexisting conditions. At my hearing, a woman named Michelle Virshup told her story of how the Affordable Care Act was there for her to provide coverage as well as services when she was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease in her early twenties. Now, 3 years later, she is doing a lot better and is actually an attorney fighting to remove barriers to healthcare for others in her community. She will suffer under this bill because her access to essential services will be weakened. She will be stripped of coverage that is actually affordable. She will be effectively cut from healthcare once and for all.  When telling me about her illness, Michelle said:       The Affordable Care Act allowed me to see it through and      the Affordable Care Act protects me now. Though my health is      good, my experience is a preexisting condition that will      follow me for the rest of my life.  That is the thing about a preexisting condition. It follows people for the rest of their lives. It is preexisting before they have insurance coverage, and so it is preexisting forever. This bill, in enabling States to eviscerate the safeguards against abuse of preexisting conditions, means their healthcare will be in jeopardy and their lives will be at risk and the abuses that I fought when I was attorney general--time after time, year after year--will come back again.  Among the most meaningful of the work I did as attorney general was to fight person by person when insurance companies said: No, we will not cover that preexisting condition. Their excuse proved to be a ruse, a charade, because they could abuse preexisting conditions, and they will do it again if this bill passes.  This bill's depravity unfortunately goes even further. It actually defunds Planned Parenthood, our Nation's largest women's healthcare provider, while eviscerating protections that guarantee women have access to maternal care throughout their pregnancy. It not only stops and undermines effective family planning, but it then denies effective healthcare when women become pregnant. So it is a kind of catch-22.  This action is cruelly ironic, turning women away from basic birth control services and then threatening their access to maternity care when they unavoidably become pregnant. It is really and simply devastatingly bad public policy, a foolish proposal that attacks women's healthcare and defunds Planned Parenthood, which is an overwhelmingly popular healthcare provider. The objective is to score cheap political points on the far right.  Tomorrow in Connecticut, when I hold another hearing--and we may have another afterward--many of my colleagues may wonder why. They may well be scared of having that kind of hearing, where they have to listen to the voices and see the faces of the people who will suffer under this bill. They certainly have been too scared to have that kind of hearing in the U. I will hear from the people this bill will hurt. I will hear from people whose lives will be put at risk as a result of this heartless, cruel, and costly measure. I will be inspired by these people, and I will fight as long and as hard as possible to be sure that this bill never becomes law.  Listening to our constituents is really the way democracy is supposed to work. We are proud of talking about democracy. We are approaching the Fourth of What better way to celebrate our democracy than to listen in this Chamber, in these halls, to the people who have expertise and experience that we need instead of the secrecy and speed that we are seeing now.  I am proud that we are having these hearings in I urge my colleagues to do the same. They are emergency hearings because we face the historic and unprecedented exigencies of a proposed bill that will rip away guarantees of effective insurance coverage that Americans need and deserve.  Healthcare is a right. Eventually we will have single-payer in this country. But for now, let's build on the Affordable Care Act, let's make it better, let's cure its defects, and let's work together across the aisle. We can do that if we have that resolve.[[Page S3717]]  Thank you. I yield the floor.

694,topic-id,1707,"Madam President, I want to talk today about a topic that[[Page S2897]]I think is getting more attention now than it has gotten for some time--but still not the attention it deserves--and that is to talk a little bit in May, which is Mental Health Month, about mental health.  I was on the floor of the Senate the last day of October 2013, the 50th anniversary of the last bill that President Kennedy signed into law, which was the Community Mental Health Through the Community Mental Health Act, you saw the facilities that were about to be closed, but the anticipated alternatives, in so many ways, never really developed. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, approximately one in five adults experiences mental illness in a given year, and one in five young people between the ages of 13 and 18 will experience severe mental illness sometime during their lifetime.  The National Institutes of Health says that one in four adult Americans has a diagnosable, and almost always treatable, mental health disorder, a mental behavioral health issue, and that one in nine adult Americans has behavioral health illness that impacts how they live every single day. So whether it is the statistic that relates to one in four or one in five or one in nine, this is an issue that affects the lives of lots of people.  Half of the children in that age group, 13 to 18, rarely get the help they need, and even fewer adults do. About 40 percent of adults who have behavioral health issues receive the treatment they need for that issue. I think we are beginning to make great strides on this. Certainly, the discussion has changed. The opportunity to treat mental health like all other health has changed.  In the 113th Congress, just a few years ago, Senator Stabenow from Michigan and I worked to get a bill passed; it was called the Excellence in Mental Health Act, and we now have eight States that have projects going on. In those eight States--in significant areas of all of those States--behavioral health is being treated like all other health.  The idea is really built on the federally qualified health centers idea, the reimbursement model, where anybody can go, and if you are covered by a government program, that is taken into consideration. If you are covered by private insurance, that is taken into consideration. If you are paying cash, there is a significant and rapidly declining amount of cash that you have to pay because your income gets smaller. But everybody in these States would have access to mental health care, just as they currently have access to other kinds of healthcare.  At the community mental health centers that meet 24/7 standards, that are available, that have the staffing needs, and in other places that have the staff the law requires and the access the law requires, people can go to those facilities, and those providers will know they are going to be reimbursed for treating mental health like all other health.  I am certainly glad that my State of Missouri is one of the eight pilot States in that demonstration program. In our State, we have been--I think by any standard--forward-leaning on this issue for a long time, but not nearly as forward-leaning as we should be or as people who look at the pervasive character of behavioral health issues understand we should be.  When we passed the bill a couple of years ago, we really weren't sure how much interest we would get from There was some sense that, well, eight States would be all the States that would even want to do this, if every State that wanted to apply and could go through the application process did so. But, in fact, everybody in the mental health world was encouraged to see 24 States, which represented half of the population in the country, apply to be part of that pilot program--certainly, leading by example here, figuring out what happens.  Frankly, if you treat behavioral health like all other health, I think what many of these States will find--and they may all find--is that the other health costs are much more easily dealt with and, obviously, that not only is treating behavioral health like all other health the right thing to do, but it actually may save money to spend this money. People who have other health problems but who are seeing their doctor because their behavioral health issue is under control may be seeing two doctors. They are taking the medicine they need for behavioral health--if they need medicine for that--but because they are eating better, sleeping better, feeling better about themselves, they are also taking the medicine and getting to the appointments for any other health issue they have.  Early studies indicate that, actually, you save money by doing the right thing and understanding that mental health isn't a topic we don't talk about, but mental health is just another health issue we need to deal with.  We need to be sure that we have providers going forward. We don't have enough doctors in Missouri--or in other States--who are able to treat the increasing number of people who seek treatment. And as doctors retire in these fields, we are going to have an even greater shortage if we don't do something to encourage people to go into this field.  There is a particular shortage in care providers who deal with children. Children and youth who are in need of mental health services and who don't receive them run a greater risk of all kinds of other problems, including dropping out of school, not doing well in school, ending up in the criminal justice system--things that needlessly happen because we haven't stepped forward and viewed their behavioral health problem as we would if they had some other problems.  I was glad Senator Reed from Rhode Island and I were recently able to reintroduce a bill called the Ensuring Children's Access to Specialty Care Pediatric medicine doesn't pay as well as other medicine for lots of reasons. One is that children don't have a lot of their own money to pay with, and often their parents don't have it either.  This bill that Senator Reed and I introduced would allow physicians who want to specialize in, among other things, child and adolescent psychiatry to be eligible for the National Health Service Corps student loan repayment program. That program is generally not available now to doctors who go on and specialize on the theory that if you specialize, you are going to have more income than the general practice doctor might have. Those programs have always been focused on the general practice doctor, but if you specialize in children's health--whether it is, frankly, psychiatry or any other area of children's health--you are much less likely to financially benefit from deciding to do that. So this would allow those doctors to pursue that program as part of how they help get their loans paid back.  Whether it is physical or behavioral health, children have a unique set of health needs and often a lack of ability on their own to do what needs to be done. Medical residents who practice pediatric medicine require additional training. One of the barriers they cite for not getting that additional training is that they are going to have to have these additional student loans. Hopefully, we can allow ways for them to get into programs that other doctors get into, to see that they continue to be encouraged to be part of pediatric medicine and pediatric specialties.  Also, we are looking at another bill, the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act, commonly referred to as ACE What ACE Kids does is treat kids who have serious medical problems as exactly that--to have a way to look at health needs and medically complex kids whom you wouldn't look at otherwise, seeing that these particular patients don't have to go through all kinds of barriers to find a doctor, fee for service. Medically complex kids really need help, and I think we could easily design a new and different way to deal with them.  Finally, talking about kids, I want to say one other thing, and that is just to mention that this particular week is Teacher Appreciation I was a teacher after I got out of college, before I had a chance later to be a university president. I think teachers are always inclined to be teachers and try to tell the stories we need to hear. But when we are talking about mental health and teachers, healthcare, mental health, first aid are things that don't allow teachers to become child psychiatrists or mental health professionals but do allow teachers, as they[[Page S2898]]are watching the students whom they get to know so well, to identify what students need help and what students don't. Often teachers get the first chance outside the child's home to see that they are clearly challenged or may be challenged in ways that are easily dealt with, if they are dealt with, and are really troublesome if they are not dealt with at all.  So while we celebrate Teacher Appreciation Week at the very end of school and Mental Health Month, I hope we commit ourselves to look at these mental health issues for what they are. They are health issues. They need to be talked about. The right thing to do is to deal with them.  I think we are seeing new and better things happen there, but we are not nearly where we should be yet. As I said earlier, when Senator Stabenow and I could go to the Floor on the 50th anniversary of the last bill President Kennedy signed and 50 years later talk about how few of the goals set in that bill have been met in five decades by society, we really have a lot of catching up to do.  I believe and hope we are catching up, and I hope this is a month where people really think about telemedicine, contacts, opportunities, and excellence in mental health in ways we haven't before.

1015,topic-id,1418,"Mr.President, since the current healthcare bill--the bill usually called ObamaCare--passed, every year Missouri families have had to worry about whether their healthcare plans would be canceled, whether their options and access would be taken away, whether they could have the same doctors next year that they have this year, whether they could go to the same hospital next year that they could go to this year, whether their premiums would be going up, but if they were worried about whether their premiums were going to be going up, that was a worry that everybody else in every State had because premiums went up everywhere.  In fact, this situation has gotten so bad that in one-third of America's counties today, only one company in one-third of the counties today will even offer insurance. So the options are to buy from one company or to pay the penalty because your only choice is that one company. That one company gets to file a rate that the State regulator gets to agree to, if the one company is going to stay. In fact, I think this week the State of Iowa that has only one company providing individual insurance for the whole State, that one company said they would stay again next year, and then they filed an increase of over 40 percent on those policies for next year.  In Missouri, where I live, 25 counties will not have a provider next year, and it could be higher than that. One company has already said they will not be there next year. Twenty-five of the counties they sold policies in only had one company providing policies. We now know that at least 40 percent of all Missouri counties will not have--I mean, 40 percent of all U.counties will not have anybody even willing to offer these plans. This is a significant problem, and it just didn't occur when this President was sworn in or this Congress took over.  Premiums in your State, Mr.President, have gone up 123 percent since 2013. In my State, in Missouri, they have gone up 145 percent; in Alabama, 223 percent; in Alaska, 203 percent; in Oklahoma, 201 percent since this plan went into effect, and that was just 2013. This is not 30 years ago. This is 4 years ago.  The average increase for American individuals and families for getting policies under ObamaCare is 105 percent. Now, remember, this was the plan that was supposed to ensure that your costs would go down per family at least $2,500. The ``at least $2,500 number'' was close to right, but what was close to right about it is that your plan probably increased at least $2,500 if you had that kind of plan. The status quo just simply will not work.  The draft legislation, as it stands right now, preserves access to care for people with preexisting conditions, it strengthens the future of Medicaid, it does not change Medicare in any way, and it gives people more health insurance choices than they otherwise have as States exercise their options under the law. It allows people to stay on their family insurance until they are 26. That, along with preexisting condition coverage, is usually seen as the two most popular things in the law as it stands now. They would still be in the law.  Now, Members of both parties--and the reason I say ``as it stands today'' is Members of both parties will have an opportunity to amend this bill. In fact, we will have a vote probably the night before we take the final vote on the bill, where every Member can make amendment after amendment after amendment on this bill. There will be plenty of chances to change this bill on a topic that the Members of the Senate probably know more about, and, by the way, because it is such a big Federal obligation and responsibility, should know more about than virtually anything else we deal with in a level of specificity that is higher than anything else we deal with.  Believe me, anybody who wants to read that bill--and I will, you will, and others will, some will not--anybody who wants to read that bill will have plenty of time to read it and plenty of opportunity to amend it, but it will be amended, so we need to be sure we understand the final product might not be exactly what we have before us today.  I am going to carefully look at the final legislation. I am going to carefully look at how this addresses problems of I think one thing that is absolutely clear is that Missouri families need a more reliable and affordable healthcare system. This bill is an important first step in that direction. The status quo cannot continue to be the status quo.  By the way, there were plenty of opportunities over the last 7 years to make the kind of incremental changes that all of our friends on the other side said they would love to make, and they were in charge.  We had a bill over here that Senator Collins, I believe, was the principal sponsor of that said: Well, let's change that 30 hour requirement; that if you work 30 hours, you have to have insurance to 40 hours. Now, that is not a very big change, but it is a very big change if you have a 28-hour-a-week job, and the reason that you have that 28-hour-a-week job is the law told your employer, if you hire somebody for 30 hours, you have to provide health insurance for that person.  Now, the employers by the way--nobody is better in America today than employers to provide health insurance and there is no better place to get your health insurance than at work, but we have almost forgotten the tragedy of the workplace where because of ObamaCare so many people worked two part-time jobs because the law said you don't have to pay health insurance if they work less than 30 hours.  Well, we tried to figure out a way to get more people to work at a full-time job, not a very big change. Our friends on the other side were in control for year after year after year after that[[Page S3724]]bill was introduced. Nobody stepped up and said: Let's do that. Let's make that change. Let's get more people in full-time jobs.  These insurance markets were collapsing. I don't think there was any proposal on the other side to do anything about it. One of the difficulties we find ourselves in now is we are trying to save a critically important system--the American healthcare system--while that system is collapsing around us. That means it is not going to look as good as it would have looked if we could have gone back 7 years and done the things you and I wanted to do when we were House Members--giving more people more chances to buy more policies, having more transparency, being sure, if you didn't pay taxes on insurance you got at work, you also didn't pay taxes on money you spent for insurance if you had to buy it as an individual. There were lots of things that could have been done that were proposed. We can still go back and do that. This is clearly a first step.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services has over 1,400 places where that person's two predecessors defined what the law was supposed to mean. So earlier this week, Secretary Tom Price said he was going to look and his staff was going to look at every one of those 1,400-plus places and figure out if there is a way to define the law better so it doesn't have the impact on family economies or family access to healthcare that it currently has. That is an important step too.  This first step matters as well. I say to the Presiding Officer, nobody has been a more vigorous advocate of this debate than you have. We have an opportunity to continue this debate over the next several days. I look forward to it, and it will be interesting to try to remove the fact from the fiction when we talk about all the things that supposedly could have happened up until now. The fact is, they didn't happen.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

Sadly, Lieutenant Weatherford passed away later that evening.

This is the second Arkansas law enforcement officer we have lost in 2017.

728,topic-id,1802,"Mr.President, Russia remains a hostile, recalcitrant power that deploys its military, its cyber espionage activities, and its economic tactics to harm the United States of America--to drive a wedge between us and our allies.  President Obama began to impose tough sanctions for Russia's cyber attacks, its cyber intrusion, its illegal annexation of Crimea, and its continuing aggression in Ukraine and Congress joined in that effort by enacting two measures to tighten and broaden those sanctions. Lifting and relaxing those sanctions now would only reward Russia's attempts to undermine our democracy.  The administration continues to exercise a policy of strategic ambiguity when it comes to Russia, and the President, putting it mildly, has sent mixed signals. Just last month, Gary Cohn, the President's senior economic adviser, seemed to suggest that the United States could relax sanctions on Russia, and, as press reports confirmed 2 weeks ago, in its early days, the Trump administration considered removing all measures against Russia, according to former administration officials. Think of that.  We all hear the discussion--maybe collusion, maybe not--about the Russians' friendship with the administration, whether the Trump family or the Trump businesses or the Trump White House has had some kind of relationships--almost everybody here thinks--with the oilmen, with the oligarchs, with the Kremlin, maybe even Putin himself. And to think that soon after taking office, before the public and the rest of us began to start learning more about Trump's ties with Russia, the administration considered the removal of any kind of measures punishing Russia.[[Page S3442]]  This amendment, written by Senators Crapo, Corker, Cardin, me, and our offices and our staffs, sends an unambiguous message that the United States will not accept Russia's continued aggression, will adopt tough measures to both punish its past actions and deter future aggression against our country and our allies.  Over the last week, the chairs and ranking members of key Senate committees conducted intense negotiations over a package of tough and meaningful reforms and expansions to our current Russia sanctions regime. We have had good, positive, productive, bipartisan conversations. Last night we reached agreement on this broad package of new measures that substantially expands sanctions on Russia in response to its malicious cyber attacks, efforts to undermine democracy, and continuing aggression in Syria and in eastern This package assures Congress and the people we represent that we have more of a say in this critical national security debate.  The amendment would do a number of things. It would codify and strengthen six existing Obama administration Executive orders on Russia and Ukraine and on Russian cyber activities and the sanctions flowing from them.  It would provide for strict congressional review of any effort by the President to relax and suspend and terminate or waive Russian sanctions patterned after the Iran Review  It would require mandatory imposition of sanctions on malicious cyber activity against the United States, on corrupt Russian actors around the world, on foreign sanctions evaders violating the Russia, Ukraine, and cyber-related sanctions controls, on those involved in serious human rights abuses in territories forcibly controlled by Russia, and on special Russian crude oil projects around the world.  It would authorize broad new sanctions on key sectors of Russia's economy, including mining, metals, shipping, and railways, as well as new investments in energy pipelines.  It would crack down on anyone investing in corrupt privatization efforts in Russia--something we have seen a lot of over 20 years.  It would broaden the Treasury Department's authority to impose geographic targeting orders, allowing investigators to obtain ATM and wire transfer records so Treasury can better target illicit activity of Russian oligarchs in the United  It would require Treasury to provide Congress with a study on the tangled web of senior government officials from Russia and their family members and any current U.economic exposures to Russian oligarchs and their investments, and that includes real estate.  It would require the administration to assess and report to Congress on extending secondary sanctions to additional Russian oligarchs and state-owned and related enterprises.  Since 2014, Congress has worked together--Republicans and Democrats--to craft increasingly tougher sanctions to hold Russia accountable for a long line of misdeeds. It is a long line indeed, from Russia's violations of international law and of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, to its role in the brutal repression in the war in Syria, to the cyber attacks that we are learning more and more about on  The Ukrainian community in my State--vibrant, successful, progressive--and around the world knows firsthand the dangers of unchecked Russian aggression. We should strengthen--not weaken, not relax, not peel back--Russian sanctions.  I urge my colleagues here and in the House to support this amendment, and I will urge the President to sign it into law. We must continue to vigorously enforce and strengthen sanctions against Russia to send a message to its leaders and the world that the United States of America will not tolerate efforts to undermine democracy around the world.                          Freedom of the Press  Mr.President, our democracy is founded on checks and balances--and not just among the branches of government. Our Founders enshrined the freedom of the press in the Bill of Rights for a reason. We can't have a functioning democracy without freedom of the press. That is why last week the Newseum marked its annual Day Without News to remind Americans what our country would be--what we would be like, what we would look like, how we would act--without a free press.  Journalists' entire job is to ask tough questions and to challenge powerful interests. While in church, we comfort the afflicted, journalists afflict the comfortable. Reporters put their safety and far too often their lives on the line, whether it is covering floods and hurricanes at home or traversing the globe to bring us the stories of our troops. We depend on reporters in Ohio and around the world to both bring us the stories that impact our day-to-day lives and to tell the stories that simply otherwise might not be told.  Supporting a vibrant, independent, proactive press corps has rarely been more important in our country. Yet, too often we see reporters restricted, vilified, attacked, and even physically threatened, all for doing the jobs for which they were hired.  Today brought news in this body that some people in this building--some Members of the Senate--are trying to bar reporters from asking Senators questions. This is outrageous. If Senators can't handle tough questions from reporters about their plans to take healthcare away from millions of Americans, maybe they should change the bill, not restrict the reporters.  We remember that Oval Office meeting with Russian officials. We have seen the pictures of the President of the United States with the Russian Foreign Minister, with the Russian We have seen those pictures, but what we need to remember about those pictures--those photos that ran on front pages around this country and all over the world--those photos weren't taken by American journalists. The President of the United States threw them out of the Oval Those pictures were taken by the Russian state media.  The Russian state media was allowed to be in the room with the President of the United States in the Oval Office--hallowed ground in our democracy--while the American press was thrown out. The Russian state media, the old Soviet news agency, TASS, the remnants of the old Soviet propaganda machine, was allowed in, while the American press was barred. When you hide from the press, you hide from the American people.  On November 16, a group representing more than a dozen journalist organizations sent a letter to the President-elect. They wrote: ``This isn't about access for the press itself, it's about access for Americans in diverse communities around the country.''  Having a strong, independent White House and congressional press corps isn't just important for those reporters' stories. Think about the signal it sends to mayors and city council members and State legislators. If the Members of Congress--the President, by throwing press out of the Oval Office and bringing in the old Soviet news agency TASS, or the Senate, by throwing reporters out of the Senate--if they don't have to be accountable, why should a mayor, why should a city council person, why should a Governor think they should be accountable?  It is not just Washington reporters who are vital to democracy. It is reporters in Ohio telling us the stories, bringing us the faces of the opioid epidemic that devastates families and communities. It is Ohio's editorial pages highlighting how important the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is to our drinking water and our State's economy. It has enabled Senator Portman and me and bipartisan Senators all over the Great Lakes, from New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota--Senators from both parties fighting back and stopping the cuts that would have destroyed so much of the progress in cleaning up the Great It is journalists in every corner of my State highlighting the devastation that the proposed budget would have on our schools and our housing and rural communities. It is emphasizing again that 200,000 Ohioans right now are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance from the Affordable Care It is reminding politicians in Ohio of both parties that those people need insurance. That is what a free press does.  Parenthetically, I would add, my wife is a journalist. She is a Pulitzer Prize[[Page S3443]]winner. She is a columnist. She is soon to be a novelist. She clearly has outspoken views about this, as I do. She is a member of the press. I am a Member of this body. We both believe in a free press. We both believe in a free democracy.  We answer to journalists in this body because they are the eyes and ears of the people we serve. If you can't understand--if none of us are strong enough and articulate enough and gutsy enough to stand before reporters who ask tough questions about your positions, then maybe you ought to rethink your positions.  We need diligent, courageous reporters to dig up their stories. We need independent editors to put them on front pages. We need media organizations willing to hold the powerful accountable.  The American people have a right to know what is going on in their own government, from the White House down to the city council office.  The behavior today of the Rules Committee--the Rules Committee decision to ban reporters--television reporters specifically--from this body is just reprehensible. Thomas Jefferson said, ``Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost.'' That is as true today as it was more than 200 years ago at the time of our country's founding.  To all of the reporters out there, thank you.

754,topic-id,4542,"Mr.Speaker, how did we get to this point?[[Page H4118]]  The Affordable Care Act is simply not working for the American people. It is limiting choices. It is raising costs. It is leaving millions without access to care. And unfortunately, these are not just talking points but very real issues affecting very real  The Affordable Care Act has left the individual market in shambles and has driven insurers away from offering coverage. Now, we are seeing one-third of all counties in the United States of America with only a single insurer. And among the plans that have chosen to remain in these markets, there have been widespread, double-digit premium increases. In Texas, premiums have jumped 29 percent a year, on average, from 2014 to 2017.  The markets are in difficulty. They are failing to live up to the promise made 7 years ago, that Americans would be able to receive ``affordable care.''  As we knew then, and we still know now, this was an empty promise and has priced over 19 million Americans out of the market. What is worse, these individuals are forced to pay the individual mandate penalty or seek a hardship exemption because of the cost to purchase and use their health insurance.  Mr.Speaker, 11 months ago, Speaker Ryan released the Better Way plan to save the Nation's healthcare system and to bring relief to the American people. This plan, which served as the blueprint for the American Health Care Act, laid out policies to stabilize the markets damaged by the Affordable Care Act, repeal the burdensome Affordable Care Act taxes and mandates that have hindered innovation and limited access to care. So let's take a look at what the American Health Care Act does.  First and foremost, the American Health Care Act provides immediate relief to the State insurance markets. As Republicans, we know that one-size-fits-all works for no one, and certainly did not work for the individual markets. The States should have the flexibility to support their insurance markets and ensure that plans can continue to provide options for coverage.  To do this, we relax two of the more egregious market regulations that were imposed under the Affordable Care Act: the mandate that premiums cannot vary for younger and older Americans by more than a 3-to-1 ratio and the mandate creating fixed actuarial values for plans.  The mandate limiting a plan's ability to set premiums by age has driven up the cost of coverage for younger and healthier Americans and, subsequently, pushed them away from seeking coverage by the millions. Of the over 19 million Americans who have sidestepped the individual market, it is estimated that as many as 45 percent of these individuals are under the age of 35. Without these younger Americans seeking coverage, the markets have plunged, as insurers have hiked up premiums year after year to compensate for unhealthy risk pools.  To change this, there is relaxation of the 5-to-1 ratio. It will lower premium costs and provide necessary opportunities to stabilize markets. We also give States the option, the choice to go higher or go lower, which honors the spirit of federalism.  Additionally, we are repealing the actuarial values mandate to provide insurers with additional flexibility to offer more coverage options. The requirement for insurers to offer specified Bronze, Silver, and Gold level tiers has limited consumer choice, driving even more individuals away from seeking coverage and further contributing to the collapse of the healthcare markets.  To further supplement these efforts, we are establishing the Patient and State Stability This fund provides States access to a total of over $140 billion over 10 years to promote innovative solutions to lower costs and increase access to health care for their unique patient populations.  Mr.Speaker, the goal is simple, to provide States with maximum flexibility in how they address the cost of care for their citizens. The American Health Care Act provides States with options for how to use funds, including providing financial assistance for high-cost individuals, incentivizing insurer participation in those markets, reducing the cost of insurance, promoting access to preventive services, and reducing out-of-pocket costs for patients.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a combination of the Stability Fund and other proconsumer changes would reduce premiums by 10 percent below current projections of 2026.  We want patients to have access to high-quality, affordably priced health coverage. The Patient and State Stability Fund can help States lower costs and can increase access to high quality health care for their citizens.  In addition to supporting the insurance markets, the American Health Care Act creates needed reforms to the Medicaid program itself. Without any changes, the current Medicaid expansion is expected to cost $1 trillion in 10 years' time--$1 trillion a year in 10 years' time. Medicaid needs reform so that States can continue to provide coverage to children, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups, the very populations that this safety net program was created to serve.  To address these concerns, the American Health Care Act first phases out the Medicaid expansion, not traditional Medicaid but Medicaid expansion. The expansion has hurt State budgets and limited States' abilities to ensure that resources will continue to be available for the vulnerable populations for which Medicaid was designed. By phasing out expansion, we are providing States with greater budget autonomy.  Additionally, our bill helps further bend the Medicaid cost curve by shifting the program toward a per beneficiary allotment. Per beneficiary allotments set limits on the annual growth for per capita expenditures for which the States will receive matching funds from the Federal Per beneficiary allotments create greater fiscal accountability and ensure that the program can continue to exist for years to come.  This is not a new idea. This was an idea put forward by President Bill Clinton and, at one time, supported by every Democratic Member of the Senate in 1995.  Second, the American Health Care Act increases the amount of flexibility that States have in managing their Medicaid program. The bill scales back the Affordable Care Act mandates that have limited a State's ability to tailor plans toward the needs of beneficiaries. States can and States should be trusted to effectively manage the needs of their Medicaid beneficiaries. The American Health Care Act will allow them to do so.  Additionally, the American Health Care Act furthers the goal of providing the States with greater flexibility in managing their Medicaid programs by providing States with the option to implement two additional opportunities: work requirements and block grants for  When the Affordable Care Act was being debated, some of the most consistent complaints that we heard throughout the discussion came from Governors and State representatives expressing concerns about the negative consequences that they saw on the horizon.  This time around, we chose to engage our State counterparts in the discussion and listen to their input as we designed the bill; and at the top of their list was a desire to see the work requirements built into the Medicaid and the expansion populations, and the opportunity to work with Medicaid as a block grant.  Republicans trust that States know what works for their respective populations, and we are not going to stand in the way of States seeking to design Medicaid programs that work for them.  Finally, the American Health Care Act provides additional resources to bolster State safety net providers. The bill provides increases to the Community Health Center Fund, offers enhanced funding to support the safety net providers in States that did not expand Medicaid, and ends the cuts to Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, cuts that are going to occur under current law on October 1 of this year.  We are committed to ensuring that our local providers can continue to deliver lifesaving care and that the American Health Care Act turns this commitment into action. For the millions of Americans in rural and medically underserved areas, these actions[[Page H4119]]will provide needed relief that was undercut by the Affordable Care Act and will allow these Americans to continue to have access to care.  Moving forward, together, these efforts will provide meaningful reform and relief for the States and for the individuals seeking health care. We are stabilizing the markets, reforming Medicaid in the most substantive and consequential way in its 52-year history, and ensuring that all Americans can maintain access to care through local safety net providers.  We do recognize there is still more work to be done in health care, and that is why we only consider the American Health Care Act to be the beginning. It is the key that gets us through the door into additional health reform. From here, we will work with Secretary Price at the Department of Health and Human Services to further deregulate the marketplace and increase consumer choice in the healthcare markets, and we will enhance the American Health Care Act with additional legislative efforts to further the goal of lowering healthcare costs.  Mr.Speaker, this should be a very exciting time in health care. With all of the knowledge that has been gained over the years in the practice of medicine, I am humbled to be here today speaking in support of this legislation.  It will begin the much-awaited process of unwinding the Affordable Care Act and will finally return patients to the center of health care.                              {time}  0945  Mr.Mr.Speaker, wow. I yield myself such time as I may consume, and to rebut the gentleman from Texas, let me include in the Record a letter from the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the National Organization for Rare Disorders, and the National Coalition for Women with Heart Leading Patient Advocacy Groups Remain Opposed to the American Health                                 Care Act    Eight Organizations Issue Statement Criticizing Upton Agreement       Washington, May 3, 2017.--Earlier today, House Energy and      Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-OR) issued a press      release stating that an amendment proposed by Representative      Fred Upton (R-MI) to the American Health Care Act (AHCA)      provides ``protection and certainty for patients with pre-     existing conditions.'' Eight leading patient groups, listed      below, issued the following statement in response:       Despite the Upton amendment, we remain strongly opposed to      the American Health Care Act and urge Congress to consider      the people at the heart of this decision. The various      patchwork solutions offered by lawmakers would still leave      the millions of patients we represent, who have serious and      chronic health conditions, at risk of not being able to      access life-saving treatments and care.       There is no substitute for fundamental, unequivocal      protections for people with pre-existing conditions.       The AHCA, including the potential amendment, would      undermine vital safeguards against being charged more for      insurance based on health status. Increasing funding for risk      sharing programs and consumer financial assistance does not      address the legitimate challenges built into these proposals.       The other equally important problems with the AHCA remain,      including:       Allowing states to waive the guarantee of essential health      benefits, which would:       Segment the market into plans for sick people and plans for      healthy people, driving up the cost of plans for people with      serious health care needs       Undermine the protection against annual and lifetime      coverage caps, a critical safeguard for patients       Eliminating Medicaid expansion coverage for millions of      Americans and altering the program's financing structure in a      way that jeopardizes coverage of new and innovative      treatments       Increasing out-of-pocket costs for many Americans,      including some of the sickest and elderly among us       Given the numerous shortcomings of the American Health Care      Act in serving the patients we represent, our organizations      have no choice but to oppose this legislation and urge all      Representatives to vote against it, with or without the Upton      and MacArthur amendments.

[From the American Medical Association, May 3, 2017]AMA Warns that Proposed Changes to the American Health Care Act Do Not                        Remedy Bill's Shortcomings  Despite amendments to bill, millions of Americans would still lose                        health insurance coverage       Chicago.--American Medical Association (AMA) President      Andrew Gurman, M.D., issued the following statement today      about proposed changes to the American Health Care Act      (AHCA):       ``None of the legislative tweaks under consideration      changes the serious harm to patients and the health care      delivery system if AHCA passes. Proposed changes to the bill      tinker at the edges without remedying the fundamental failing      of the bill--that millions of Americans will lose their      health insurance as a direct result of this proposal.       ``High-risk pools are not a new idea. Prior to the      enactment of the Affordable Care Act, 35 states operated      high-risk pools, and they were not a panacea for Americans      with pre-existing medical conditions. The history of high-     risk pools demonstrates that Americans with pre-existing      conditions will be stuck in second-class health care      coverage--if they are able to obtain coverage at all.       ``Not only would the AHCA eliminate health insurance      coverage for millions of Americans, the legislation would, in      many cases, eliminate the ban against charging those with      underlying medical conditions vastly more for their      coverage.''       ``America should not go backward to the time when our      fellow citizens with pre-existing health conditions faced      high costs for limited coverage, if they were able to obtain      coverage at all. The AMA urges congressional leaders and the      Administration to pursue a bipartisan dialogue on alternative      policies that provide patients with access and coverage to      high quality care and preserve the safety net for vulnerable      populations.''                     Background on high-risk pools       A January report from the American Academy of Actuaries      notes that ``enrollment has generally been low, coverage has      been limited and expensive, they require external funding,      and they have typically operated at a loss . . . Removing      high-risk individuals from the insured risk pools reduces      costs in the private market only temporarily. Over time, even      lower-cost individuals in the individual market can incur      high health care costs, which would put upward pressure on      premiums.''       According to the Kaiser Family Foundation:       State high-risk pools featured premiums above standard non-     group market rates--with most states capping them at 150%-     200% of standard rates. Many also featured high deductibles,      some $5,000 or more.       Despite the fact that many individuals were forced into      high-risk pools because of a pre-existing condition, nearly      all states excluded coverage for these conditions for 6-12      months.       Almost all high-risk pools imposed lifetime limits on      covered services, and some imposed annual limits.       Some states capped or closed enrollment.       Combined net losses for the state high-risk pools totaled      more than $1.2 billion for 2011, or $5,510 per enrollee, on      average.       Furthermore, a 2010 paper by James Capretta and Tom Miller      that appeared in National Affairs estimated that the cost of      adequately funded high risk pools would be $15 billion to $20      billion per year.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter from the American Academy of Family Physicians in opposition to this bill.                                               American Academy of                                            Family Physicians,                                                      May 3, 2017.     Jim McGovern,     Representative, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Jim McGovern: Despite recent activities and      amendments, the American Health Care Act (H.1628) remains      a highly flawed proposal that will destabilize our health      care system, cause significant loss of coverage, and allow      for the discrimination against patients based on their      gender, age, and health status. For these reasons, the      American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) continues to      oppose the AHCA and[[Page H4120]]     encourages the House of Representatives to reject this failed      policy.       The fact remains that the AHCA will:       Cause more than 24 million people to lose their health care      coverage, including more than 7 million with employer-     sponsored coverage.       Destabilize the individual health insurance market.       Create a race to the bottom by eliminating any standards      with respect to minimum insurance benefits.       Enact draconian cuts in the Medicaid program that will have      an immediate negative impact on low-income individuals,      children, and millions of senior citizens who rely on the      program.       Eliminate community rating and return to medical      underwriting, thus allowing insurers to discriminate against      individuals based on their gender, age, and health status.       Deny individuals protection against annual and lifetime      spending caps, thus threatening the financial stability of      millions of individuals and families in the future.       Over the past few days there has been an effort to advance      policies that seek to protect individuals with pre-existing      conditions from facing discrimination in insurance      underwriting as a result of their health status. Despite a      willingness to spend more money on these proposals, the      current efforts on pre-existing conditions fail to accomplish      their goal. High-risk pools are inherently flawed and      expensive. The proposals under consideration provide      inadequate funding for an inadequate period of time, thus      creating an under-funded and temporary solution for the      millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. We find      it regrettable that Congress would seek to relegate      individuals with high health care needs to a program that has      a questionable history and would face uncertain financial      stability in the future.       By removing critical consumer protections that collectively      ensure that the millions of individuals with pre-existing      conditions can continue to purchase affordable health care      coverage, the AHCA would result in higher premiums and higher      deductibles for millions. Additionally, the negative impact      of the AHCA is not limited to the individual insurance      market. These policies also may impact the more than 130      million people with employer-sponsored insurance.       Thank you.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I also include in the Record a statement from the AARP in strong opposition to this bill.                                                         AARP,                                                      May 3, 2017.       Dear Representative: Older Americans care deeply about      access to and affordability of health care. With the addition      of the Upton Amendment, as reported, we once again write to      share our opposition to the American Health Care Act (AHCA)      and urge you to vote Changes under consideration that      would allow states to waive important consumer protections--     allowing insurance companies to once again charge Americans      with pre-existing conditions more because they've had cancer,      diabetes or heart disease--would make a bad bill even worse.      This would be devastating for the 25 million Americans 50-64      who have a deniable pre-existing condition. The Upton      amendment would do little to reduce the massive premium      increases for those with pre-existing conditions.       Throughout consideration of the AHCA, we have been      expressing serious concerns about the impact that this      legislation will have on older The Congressional      Budget Office (CBO)'s last estimate further demonstrates the      harmful impact of this bill on older Americans and some of      our most vulnerable. Specifically, the American Health Care      Act will weaken the fiscal sustainability of Medicare;      dramatically increase premium and out-of-pocket costs for 50-     64 year olds purchasing coverage on the individual insurance      market; allow insurance companies to once again discriminate      against those with pre-existing conditions; substantially      increase the number of Americans without insurance; and put      at risk millions of children and adults with disabilities and      poor seniors who depend on the Medicaid program to access      long-term services and supports and other benefits.       Our members and others 50 years of age and older care      deeply about health care and want to know where their elected      leaders stand. Recognizing the importance of the upcoming      vote on the American Health Care Act, AARP intends to inform      our members, and others over age 50, how their elected      officials voted. We'll communicate the results of the vote in      our widely-circulated publications, in e-mail alerts, in our      online channels, and through the media. Again, we urge all      Representatives to vote NO on the American Health Care Act in      its current form.                                Medicare       The American Health Care Act repeals provisions in current      law that have strengthened Medicare's fiscal outlook,      specifically, the repeal of the additional 0.9 percent      payroll tax on higher-income workers. Repealing this      provision would remove billions from the Hospital Insurance      trust fund, hasten the insolvency of Medicare, and diminish      Medicare's ability to pay for services in the future.                  Individual Private Insurance Market       Currently, about 25 million Americans age 50-64 have a pre-     existing condition, about 6.1 million purchase insurance in      the non-group market, and nearly 3.2 million are currently      eligible to receive subsidies for health insurance coverage      through either the federal health benefits exchange or a      state-based exchange (exchange). Since passage of the ACA,      the number of 50-64 year old Americans who are uninsured has      dropped by half. We are deeply concerned that the AHCA would      be a significant step backwards and result in millions of      older Americans who cannot afford their health care,      including many simply losing their health care. Based on CBO      estimates, approximately 14 million Americans will lose      coverage next year, while a total of 24 million Americans      would lose coverage over the next 10 years.       Affordability of both premiums and cost-sharing is critical      to older Americans and their ability to obtain and access      health care. A typical 50-64 year old seeking coverage      through an exchange has a median annual income of under      $25,000 and already pays significant out-of-pocket costs for      health care. We have serious concerns--reinforced by the CBO      estimate--that the bill under consideration will dramatically      increase health care costs for 50-64 year olds who purchase      health care through an exchange due both to the changes in      age rating from 3:1 (already a compromise that requires      uninsured older Americans to pay three times more than      younger individuals) to 5:1 (or more) and reductions in      current tax credits for older CBO concluded that      the bill will substantially raise premiums for older people      and force many into lower quality plans.       Age rating plus reduced tax credits equal an unaffordable      age tax. Our previous estimates on the age-rating change      showed that premiums for current coverage could increase by      up to $3,200 for a 64 year old. In addition, the bill reduced      the tax credits available for older Americans to help      purchase insurance. We estimate that the bill's changes to      current law's tax credits alone could increase premium costs      by more than $5,800 for a 64-year old earning $15,000.      Overall, both the bill's tax credit changes and 5:1 age      rating would result in skyrocketing cost increases for older      In their analysis, CBO found that a 64 year old      earning $26,500 a year would see their premiums increase by      $12,900--758 percent--from $1,700 to $14,600 a year.       Current law prohibits insurance companies from      discriminating against individuals due to a pre-existing      condition. The bill would repeal pre-existing condition      protections and would once again allow insurance companies to      charge Americans more--we estimate up to $25,000 more--due to      a pre-existing condition. As a result, the 40 percent of 50-      to 64-year-olds (about 25 million people) who have a deniable      pre-existing condition risk losing access to affordable      coverage. The Upton Amendment, which would add funds to      address the impact of premium increases for those with      pre-existing conditions, would do little to mitigate the      massive premium increase for some of the most vulnerable      AARP strongly opposes any weakening of the      law's pre-existing condition protections which benefit      millions of              Medicaid and Long-Term Services and Supports       AARP opposes the provisions of the American Health Care Act      that create a per capita cap financing structure in the      Medicaid program. We are concerned that these provisions      could endanger the health, safety, and care of millions of      individuals who depend on the essential services provided      through CBO found that the bill would cut Medicaid      funding by $880 billion over 2017-2026, about 25 percent less      than what it projects under current law. Medicaid is a vital      safety net and intergenerational lifeline for millions of      individuals, including over 17.4 million low-income seniors      and children and adults with disabilities who rely on the      program for critical health care and long-term services and      supports (LTSS, i.e., assistance with daily activities such      as eating, bathing, dressing, managing medications, and      transportation). Older adults and people with disabilities      now account for over sixty percent of Medicaid spending, and      cuts of this magnitude will result in loss of benefits and      services for this vulnerable population.       Of these 17.4 million individuals: 6.9 million are ages 65      and older (which equals more than 1 in every 7 elderly      Medicare beneficiaries); 10.5 million are children and adults      living with disabilities; and about 10.8 million are so poor      or have a disability that they qualify for both Medicare and      Medicaid (dual eligibles). Dual eligibles account for almost      33 percent of Medicaid spending. While they comprise a      relatively small percentage of enrollees, they account for a      disproportionate share of total Medicare and Medicaid      spending.       Individuals with disabilities of all ages and older adults      rely on critical Medicaid services, including home and      community-based services (HCBS) for assistance with daily      activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, and home      modifications; nursing home care; and other benefits such as      hearing aids and eyeglasses.       In providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person,      this approach to financing would likely result in      overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and      families unable to shoulder the costs of care without      sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to      program eligibility, services, or both--ultimately harming      some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens.[[Page H4121]]       The bill also repeals the six percent enhanced federal      Medicaid match for states that take up the Community First      Choice (CFC) CFC provides states with a financial      incentive to offer HCBS to help older adults and people with      disabilities live in their homes and communities where they      want to be. About 90 percent of older adults want to remain      in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.      HCBS are also cost effective. On average, in Medicaid, the      cost of HCBS per person is one-third the cost of      institutional care. Taking away the enhanced match could      disrupt services for older adults and people with      disabilities in the states that are already providing      services under CFC and would result in a loss of about $12      billion for HCBS over ten years.                           Prescription Drugs       The AHCA would repeal the fee on manufacturers and      importers of branded prescription drugs, which currently is      projected to add $24.8 billion to the Medicare Part B trust      fund between 2017 and 2026. Rather than repeal this fee for      Medicare, AARP believes Congress must do more to reduce the      burden of high prescription drug costs on consumers and      taxpayers, and we urge action on bipartisan solutions.       AARP remains willing to work with you to ensure that we      maintain a strong health care system that ensures robust      insurance market protections, controls costs, improves      quality, and provides affordable coverage to all      However, the AHCA does not accomplish these goals, and we      continue to urge you to vote           Sincerely,                                                 Nancy LeaMond,                                Executive Vice President and Chief                                  Advocacy and Engagement  Mr.Mr.Speaker, if this bill were so great, these organizations would be supporting the Republican bill, not opposing it; and they are strongly opposing it.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of my good friend Congressman Jim Clyburn's bill to reauthorize the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Preservation program.  I have known Jim Clyburn for more than 35 years, and this has been his passion ever since I first met him many years ago. I thank Mr.Clyburn for his passion and his leadership on this issue.  Since 1988, the HBCU Historic Preservation program has provided more than $60 million to HBCUs all across the country to support infrastructure and facilitate learning.  Both my undergraduate and law school alma mater, North Carolina Central University in Durham, an institution that I am now proud to represent in Congress, has greatly benefited from the program.  And I might say that my father graduated from Shaw University, which is an HBCU, and later from Meharry Medical My mother attended high school at Shaw University and graduated from college at Hampton Institute, now called Hampton  Mr.Speaker, HBCUs fill a unique and important role in our Nation's higher education system and in our country's narrative. Not only do HBCUs train our workforce of the future by producing the most African-American students who can earn science and engineering doctoral degrees, they are integral parts of our national identity.  The more than 100 HBCUs spread across the country house the books and the memorabilia from freedmen and former slaves dating back many years.  Many of the historic buildings on the campuses of HBCUs were used as meeting places during reconstruction and during the civil rights movement.  HBCUs represent the past, the here and the now, and the future of our country. By reauthorizing this important program through 2024, we can honor the many important faculty and students that have helped HBCUs endure, support people at those institutions today, and prepare our workforce for the future.  I strongly support this bill. I commend my dear colleague, Congressman Jim Clyburn, for his enormous leadership on this important issue. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation.                              {time}  1445  ",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgH5207.txt,1761,WEALTH CARE OVER HEALTHCARE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF CARIBBEAN AMERICANS,2017.0,27.0,June
730,topic-id,961,"Mr.President, I just want to follow up briefly with Chairman The two of us became friends in 2007, when we were both elected to the U.Senate the same year and were part of the same class. But I think the two of us really became close friends a little over 2 years ago, when we were confronted with how Congress should deal with the nuclear agreement being negotiated by President Obama with Iran and our European friends, along with Russia and  As the two of us worked around the clock to try to develop an appropriate review process so that Congress could play a constructive role--we recognize that we are the legislative branch, and we have oversight functions, but there is an appropriate role for us with regard to Executive actions--we came out with something that no one expected could be done; that is, nearly unanimous support in this body for a review statute in regard to the Iran negotiations.  Chairman Corker has taken this same template and has now used that to apply to Russia in the removal of sanctions on It started with a bill that was put together by Senator Graham and me. It has been modified through the negotiations we have had, as Senator Corker has commented, with Senator Brown and Senator But it does, in effect, provide that there will be notice to Congress before the administration can give any sanction relief to Russia, so there can be transparency and a discussion and a debate. Then there is a process by which Congress, if we feel strongly and can get the necessary support, can disapprove of sanction relief.  I think that is the proper way for us to deal with one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world--between the United States and Russia--and it is appropriate that it is going to be an amendment to the Iran sanctions bill because the review process came out of the Iran agreement.  The review process would be triggered if there is action taken by the President to give relief, but the legislation also includes additional sanctions, as the chairman pointed out, with It does this in a way that codifies the President's Executive orders so that there is now congressional support for Executive orders. It expands those sanctions in the area of cyber, as the chairman pointed out, and for energy projects, financial institutions facilitating transactions, Russian arms and related materiel to Syria, the corrupt privatization of government-owned assets.  I particularly thank the chairman for the way he was able to recognize that, in Russia, what we don't want to see us contribute to is corruption, and we concentrate on the corruption issue, not the business issue. It is the area of corruption that becomes the important thing.  We tighten up a lot of the different sanctions. Then we set up a process where there needs to be certified progress made; otherwise, these are mandatory sanctions the President must impose.  As the chairman pointed out, negotiations included aspects of legislation that was first introduced by Senator McCain and me on sanctions, by Senator Graham and me on review of sanction relief, by Senators Crapo and Brown on proposed legislation dealing with sanctions, and Chairman Corker had significant drafting issues that he brought to the table in our negotiations. So it was a free discussion, and the end result is--I said this before but I want to underscore this--the Banking Committee brought some very helpful suggestions to make sure the financial sanctions worked. It is one thing that we want to make sure there are penalties, but we have to make sure they[[Page S3444]]work right, and I compliment the work of the Banking Committee in making sure that we use the right standards and that this will meet international muster. It is absolutely essential that this template be one in which our European allies can follow our leadership. If we didn't do that, we could have been isolated, which would not have had the same impact as I think these sanctions will have in working with our European allies.  The chairman mentioned several of our colleagues on the committee. I need to mention Senator Shaheen and Senator Menendez, who played very, very important roles in our caucus. Senator Durbin and Senator Schumer also played roles in this, and I acknowledge their contributions.  Included in this bill is the democracy initiative, which deals with providing more unified support with our allies in Europe in fighting Russia's propaganda and attacks on our democratic institutions. Senator Portman made major contributions to that, as the chairman has also acknowledged, and then, brought to us mainly through the Banking bill, we have a strategy to trace terrorism and financing in terrorism, which I think is very important to be included in the amendment.  We will have a chance to vote on this amendment at 2 o'clock tomorrow. I encourage my colleagues to adopt this. Senator Corker and I expect to be back on the floor tomorrow as we manage the underlying bill, at which time I will want to comment on the importance of our passing the Iran sanctions bill, which is vitally important because of Iranian activities taking place today.  For all of those reasons, I encourage my colleagues to please read the amendment that has been filed in a bipartisan effort to deal with this challenge that Russia has provided through their activities in attacking our democratic institutions, in their continued aggression in Ukraine, and their human rights violations in  I might add that Senator Menendez's provisions on human rights sanctions are included in this amendment. It really does, I think, capture the essence of the broad consensus of the U.Senate and is worthy of our support.  I yield the floor.

We have done some very important things in recent years that I am very proud of, and many of those are included in the Affordable Care I know that Senator Carper and Senator Blumenthal will be on the floor; Senator Carper is here now. They have been instrumental in advancing quality healthcare for all Americans, but we do recognize that we have a special role in regard to historic discrimination on minority health. I was pleased that the Affordable Care Act included the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities so that we could have a focal point at NIH to deal with the historic problems and have a game plan to advance that.  I was also pleased that the Affordable Care Act provided coverage for minorities in greater numbers because when we looked at the number of uninsured, the number of minorities were a much higher percentage than the general population of uninsured. When we looked at inadequate coverage, we saw the same numbers. So we have made advancements.  In April, historically, I had filed a resolution in order to acknowledge the progress we made and to continue our commitment to make sure that all Americans have access to affordable, quality healthcare and that we do not discriminate. That resolution had always cleared without any difficulty until 2017.

808,topic-id,1389,"I thank Senators Menendez, Blumenthal, Brown, Hirono, Markey, Klobuchar, Van Hollen, Booker, Peters, Duckworth, and Carper for their help in regard to minority health and the resolution.                         Healthcare Legislation  So we couldn't do that, which is a pretty easy thing to do, but now the Republicans are looking to bring out in the next 2 weeks a rewriting of our entire healthcare law, one-sixth of our economy, and they are talking about bringing this out for perhaps passage in the U.Senate during the next 2 weeks.  I don't know of anyone who has seen a copy of this bill. I certainly have not seen it, and I am a member of the Senate Finance Senator Carper is a member of the Senate Finance We have not seen a copy of the bill, even though we are the committee of jurisdiction, along with the HELP I certainly want to be able to look at this bill, make sure that there are public hearings and an opportunity for input from all Members of the U.Senate--first those who serve on the relevant committees through the committee markups and then on the floor of the U.But what I understand from the majority leader is that may not be the case. That would be an affront to our Democratic institution. That would be insulting the Members of the Senate and the committee that I serve on, the Senate Finance  I need to mention that because we do know what the House of Representatives sent over to us. We don't know if that is going to be the bill that is going to be brought out, but there hasn't been any hearing on the bill that the House of Representatives sent over to us.  Compare that to the passage of the Affordable Care We had numerous, dozens of hearings on the Affordable Care We had months of negotiations on the Affordable Care Act back and forth--bipartisan negotiations. We had committee markups in two of our committees, and hundreds of amendments were considered. Many Republican-sponsored amendments were adopted on the Affordable Care We went through a regular legislative process.  Yet the Republican leadership is telling us that we are going to totally change the Affordable Care Act, totally change the healthcare system, and not offer the American people an opportunity to see what we are doing--or their elected Representatives to be able to offer comments or amendments to that? That is outrageous. That is not a democratic institution. We need to speak out about it.  Now we are all vulnerable to that, all I have thought about the people in my State, the 400,000 who have coverage under the Affordable Care Act, who didn't have coverage prior to the Affordable Care They are very much at risk because, according to the Congressional Budget Office, if we have on the floor of the Senate anything similar to what the House passed, most of those 400,000 are going to lose their insurance coverage. What are they going to do?  Then we are talking about putting a cap on Well, have you talked to the Governor of your State? Have you talked to your State legislature as to how they are doing with their budgets? Do you really believe the States can pick up what we cut? The answer is obviously no.  We offered an expansion of Medicaid so more working families, more veterans, more people who are vulnerable could get coverage. That is gone under the caps that the Republicans are talking about, putting our most vulnerable at risk.  I started talking about minority health. Let me just underscore that with In my State and in every State, when you look at the percentage of people who are covered under Medicaid, it is much higher for the minority community because they historically have been discriminated against. They do not have the coverage going into the Affordable Care That is going to affect our most vulnerable. It is also interesting to note that a higher percentage of veterans is under the Medicaid system. That will affect our veterans. Of course, our seniors depend upon Medicaid for longer long-term care. They are going to be adversely affected by these caps under the Medicaid  Then we have the impact on all of us who have insurance and may be able to[[Page S3539]]keep our insurance after this type of legislation. We are going to be adversely affected. Why? Because who do you think pays for those who do not have health insurance? You get cost shifting, and it is done in a more costly, expensive way so our healthcare costs go up. Those of us who have insurance pay more, and those who do not have insurance do not get the early interventions they need in order to stay healthy.  The vulnerabilities continue because one of the things that was affected by the House-passed bill was what we call the essential health benefits. What we did is require that those benefits be provided under all healthcare plans, including  So, yes, I could talk about obstetrics for women, which would be covered under all plans, and that women who need obstetrics would not have to pay a much higher premium as they would be in a high-risk pool. Because of the way the insurance would be done, only women who would need that would get into the plan, and it would cost a lot more. Yes, that discriminates against women.  Again, I could also talk about minority communities that now have coverage for mental health and addiction because that is required under the Affordable Care When it becomes discretionary with the States and they get into tight budget problems, they will lose that coverage.  We are all talking about the explosion of opioid addiction in our communities. In Maryland, I think the rate now is 60 percent higher this year than last year of overdose deaths. Do we really want to cut one of the major tools we have in trying to get this epidemic under control? That is what we are talking about in regard to what the House-passed bill does.  At a minimum, we need to have public hearings to know what we are doing. This is a democratic institution. Under the Affordable Care Act, we had dozens of hearings. The committees of jurisdiction need to work on this bill. They need to be able to mark it up. They need to be able to offer amendments, which was afforded to every Senator in this body under the Affordable Care Many of our colleagues who voted against the Affordable Care Act have amendments that were included in the Affordable Care That is how a democracy works.  Everyone is affected by this process but particularly the vulnerable, particularly those who are uninsured and those who will become uninsured. Those who have insurance and who have very few other options are going to find their benefits reduced. Minorities, our disabled population, older Americans, and women all will be discriminated against.  At a time at which we want to focus on the progress that we have made to narrow the gap in minority health and health disparities, it would just be a tragedy to move in the wrong way, to reverse the progress we have made, and to do that without an appropriate process of transparency, which has been the hallmark of American democracy.  I urge my colleagues in that there is still time. If you have proposals, work with us--all 100 I, certainly, have worked with my Republican colleagues on many healthcare issues that are now the law of this land.  We offer to work with you. All we say is don't tell us that you are going to do this by repealing a bill and then come to us to try to fix it. Work with us to improve our healthcare system, and we will work with you.

809,topic-id,1758,"Mr.President, I thank my friend, my neighbor from Maryland, for inviting a number of us to come to the floor today, this afternoon, to talk a bit about the Affordable Care I am really honored to stand next to him here as we do sit next to each other on the Finance Committee and on the Environment and Public Works He is a great leader on both of those committees.                         Sanctions Legislation  Mr.President, Senator Cardin and I were on the floor earlier today, along with the Presiding Officer, and we voted on legislation that attempts to send a message to  By the way, it just had elections, gosh, not even a month ago, whereby the reformist President Rouhani was reelected by a big margin. Reformists-moderates were elected as the mayor of Tehran and in other municipalities across the country. There are a lot of young people in that country who want a better relationship with this country, and they actually had a chance to speak at the voting box. They elected a number of women to serve in positions of real responsibility, not just in their Parliament but as members, say, of Tehran's city council.  By the way, the Iranians are basically keeping their word with respect to the agreement between five nations, including the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France, and They are actually keeping their word with respect to complying with the nuclear agreement that was entered into, oh, gosh, 2 years ago. What they are doing and that we disagree with is they are testing ballistic missiles, and there is basically the U.N.'s strong message to Iran not to do that. ``If you do, we will sanction you in different ways,'' but they have continued to test ballistic missiles. They say it is for defensive purposes, but you cannot be sure so we strengthened those sanctions.  With those sanctions, we also included sanctions that basically say to Russia--and all 17 intelligence agencies say Russia intervened in our last election--no question. They intervened on behalf of one candidate, Mr.They wanted to elect him, and they wanted to make sure Hillary Clinton did not get elected. They succeeded. That is not just Democratic messaging. Every one of our 17 intelligence agencies has come to the same conclusion and has testified publicly to that effect.  As a result, this legislation was initially focused just on Iran, but it refocused and pivoted--maybe refocused even more--on Russia in order to sanction them for their misdeeds, which I think are, in many ways, more significant than what the Iranians have done and have been sanctioned for again.  Why do I go back to this legislation that we just debated and adopted here this morning?  Consistent with what Senator Cardin has talked about--and he is very much an architect involved right in the middle of the effort to bring that legislation to the floor. It came out of his committee. He is the senior Democrat, the ranking member. Bob Corker, of Tennessee, is the chair. A number of members--Democratic and Republican--on that committee worked together to fashion that legislation, to bring bipartisan legislation to the floor.  I say to my colleague Senator Cardin that I didn't know what the final vote count was. It was 98 to 2. That is what we can accomplish when we work together, and I think it is a great message as we pivot and talk about the Affordable Care                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, when our friend from South Dakota, Senator Thune--a great friend for, I think, all of us and admired by both sides--was talking about how deplorable ObamaCare was and how it is in a death spiral and so forth, I just wanted to stand up and ask him to yield to me so I can say that when Barack Obama and Joe Biden stepped down as President and Vice President of the United States, my recollection was that every county of every State in this country had access to healthcare through the health exchanges.  Where did the idea for health exchanges come from? It came from the Republicans in 1993, from the Heritage Foundation, the rightwing Republican think tank.  They came up with an idea that says: Let's create exchanges in every State, where people who don't have healthcare coverage can get their coverage through large purchasing pool. There would be one in every The legislation said: Let's have a sliding scale tax credit to make sure low-income families who do not have coverage can afford that coverage in the[[Page S3540]]exchanges. As their income goes up, the tax credit buys down the cost of coverage. The exchange goes down, and it eventually goes away.  The Republican legislation in 1993, fashioned by Heritage, said there was going to be an individual mandate. People would have to get coverage in this country. If they did not, they would have to pay a fine. One could not make people get coverage, but there would be a fine. There was the idea that employers of a certain size and with a certain a number of employees would have to get coverage. We call that an employer mandate. Finally, the health insurance companies could not deny coverage to people in this country because of preexisting conditions.  Those are all concepts that were in the 1993 legislation that was introduced by Senator John Chafee and was cosponsored by, among others, Senator Hatch, of Utah, Senator Grassley, of Iowa, who are now two of the most senior Republicans in the Senate, including being the two most senior Republicans on the Finance Committee on which Senator Cardin and I are privileged to serve.  I said as recently as last week, when the Secretary of Health and Human Services was before our committee to defend the President's budget, that I applauded Senator Hatch and I applauded Senator Grassley for cosponsoring that 1993 legislation, which became the foundation for healthcare coverage in Massachusetts, which is where they cover everybody. It is called It was adopted when he was the Governor, and it was fashioned very much under the same foundation.  Senator Cardin and I are on the Finance Committee, and when we were debating the Affordable Care Act, we literally took those Republican ideas from Heritage, from Senator Chafee, from the 23 Republican cosponsors for RomneyCare and sort of made them the foundation of It is ironic just to hear my friend Senator Thune talk today about the tale of horribles from the Affordable Care Actually, the things my Republican friends are criticizing the most were their ideas from 24 years ago. Personally, I think they were pretty good ideas, and if they were given a fair chance, they could be very effective.  One of my Republican friends said the other day that when the Affordable Care Act was debated and voted on and so forth, the Republicans were pretty much shut out of the process. So it is too bad the Democrats are shut out of the process now as we revisit healthcare coverage with the terrible legislation that has come out of the House of I think, if I am not mistaken--correct me if I am wrong, Senator Cardin--they adopted it without a hearing. I think they adopted it on a straight party-line vote. I think they did it without any kind of score from the Congressional Budget Office and just sent it over here.  While they were doing that, I will just go back in time, if I can, to the year of 2009, when we debated the Affordable Care Act here. We had two committees of jurisdiction. One was the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions That committee held no fewer than 14 bipartisan roundtables. A roundtable is very much like a hearing, but it is not quite as formally structured. It held 14 bipartisan roundtables, which were designed to try to build a consensus around the Affordable Care Act, or healthcare coverage, in this country. Again, this was in 2009.  In 2009, the same committee--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, the HELP Committee--held 13 bipartisan hearings. So there were 14 bipartisan roundtables and 13 bipartisan hearings in all during the actual time they were debating on and voting on the legislation itself. During the HELP Committee's debate and in actually marking up the bill, some 300 amendments were considered that were offered by Democrats and More than half of those were accepted. Of the more than half of those 300 accepted--we turned down 160 or so--160 of them happened to be offered by Think about that. There were 14 bipartisan roundtables and 13 bipartisan hearings. There were 300 amendments offered, and over half of those were Republican amendments. Over half of those 300 were actually adopted, and 160 in all were Republican amendments. That does not sound like they were shut out on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  On the Finance Committee, on which Senator Cardin and I serve, we had 17 roundtables and hearings. We held 13 member meetings, 38 negotiation meetings, and a 7-day-long actual business meeting and markup in public, during which we offered amendments and voted on amendments. I think, roughly, a dozen Republican amendments were offered and accepted.  I have a friend who, when you ask him how he is doing, always answers: ``Compared to what?''  I would say, as to the process right now that we are looking at with the Republicans' belated response, if you will, to the Affordable Care Act that came out of the House and is now being negotiated in private--not debated but negotiated and some would say in secret. It is hard to keep a secret around here, but it is certainly in private. To my knowledge, there are no bipartisan roundtables and no bipartisan hearings. To my knowledge, there will not be an opportunity for markups or business meetings at which hundreds of amendments could be offered and debated and voted on--none of that. And it will use a process called reconciliation, where they will bring whatever they come up with in these closed meetings, and we have a chance to vote on it up or down.  The House never had it scored. The Congressional Budget Office never had a chance to say: This is how many people will lose coverage. This is what it is going to cost if people don't get help through This is what is going to happen to folks losing their coverage altogether.  They never did that in the I don't know if we will see that in the Senate either.

804,topic-id,2321,"Mr.President, I wish to start this afternoon with a reflection on what happened yesterday. We are thinking today of the individuals who were hurt in the attack during the baseball practice in Virginia, and, of course, we are praying for those who were injured. I will list them. Many of the names we already know, but it is important to list them.  Of course, Representative Steve Scalise from the State of Louisiana--we are thinking of his family and praying for them, and we hope for his speedy recovery. Matt Mika, who works for Tyson Foods, was also a shooting victim like Representative Zack Barth, who works for Congressman Roger Williams, was a shooting victim, and Special Agent Crystal Griner, of course, of the Capitol Police, who exhibited such courage in the line of duty. We are thinking of Crystal at this time as well.  We know there were individuals injured at the scene, including Special Agent David Bailey of the Capitol Police, who was not shot, apparently, but suffered an injury and was released from the hospital. We are happy to hear he has been released. Representative Roger Williams, who was hurt at the scene as well--not a shooting victim but hurt--and, of course, two of[[Page S3532]]our colleagues were there at the time, Senator Rand Paul and Senator Jeff We are thankful they were not injured in any way.  On these days, we come together as a family to remember those who have been the victims, and we are thinking of them and their families and praying for them.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, I rise today to talk about the healthcare debate and in particular not just the issue of healthcare but the effort underway by Senate Republicans in their attempts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  I have grave concerns about the substance of the legislation--what we know about it. It has been kind of a secret process. We don't know a lot, but we have some general sense of where they are headed. I also have grave concern about the lack of transparency employed by the Republican majority around the development of this healthcare plan.  Like millions of Americans, I oppose this secretive process--and I have to say it is a partisan process as well--that could result in major legislation that would harm children who will lose their healthcare, especially by way of the cuts to It could harm individuals with disabilities--and by one recent estimate in Pennsylvania, that means over 720,000 Pennsylvanians with a disability who rely upon Medicaid; and, of course, seniors--a lot of seniors across the country cannot get into a nursing home absent the full support of the Medicaid Program, and we are concerned about them as well; and finally, middle-class families who may not be able to afford healthcare if the House bill were to become law or a substantially similar bill passed by the  In 2009, the legislation passed the Senate after a yearlong, open process that included a total of 44 bipartisan hearings, roundtables, and summits. That was in the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, of which I was a member at the time and remember well those hours and hours and days and days of hearings. The Committee on Finance at that time also had many hearings over many months. This whole process by two committees led to the consideration of some 435 amendments offered by both parties, majority and minority, and a full debate on the Senate floor that lasted over 25 consecutive days. In fact, a number of Republican Senators were able to offer and get a vote on their amendments, some of which passed and became part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Yet, in the last 5 months, there have been no Senate hearings on this proposed legislation, no hearings on the House proposal, and certainly no hearings on what is being developed here in the If that is the case--if that remains the case over the next couple of days and weeks--then I believe we should institute a very basic rule: If you have no hearings, you have no vote. In other words, you can't have a vote on the Senate floor on a bill that will affect so many tens of millions of Americans and will change dramatically and, I would argue, adversely, to the detriment of a lot of people, our healthcare system. I hope the majority will agree with that--that if you don't have a hearing, you shouldn't have a vote on the Senate floor.  There have been no relevant bills considered in executive session by any of the committees of jurisdiction. Every indication is that the Republican majority will jam this legislation through with minimal opportunity for debate. This is unacceptable to me, but I also believe it is unacceptable to people across the country in both parties.  We know, for example, the reason--or one of the many reasons--folks would want a hearing before a vote, and that is because we are getting a sense of what the substance is. Just to give one example, I won't enter this whole report into the Record, but I am holding a full copy of the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate. This estimate is dated, May 24, 2017, analyzing H.1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017. This is the bill which passed the Page 17 of the CBO report says:       Medicaid enrollment would be lower throughout the coming      decade, culminating in 14 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by      2026, a reduction of about 17 percent relative to the number      under current law.  That is quoted directly from page 17 of the CBO report, that over the decade, 14 million people will lose their Medicaid coverage.  I know some here and across the city who were commenting on this legislation--either members of the administration, Members of Congress, or otherwise--are refuting this, but I think when you have a Congressional Budget Office report which is an independent entity that both parties have relied upon--and it is not only the This is a report authored by not just the Congressional Budget Office but also the Joint Committee on  So 14 million fewer people on Medicaid--why is that relevant to the Senate debate if the CBO report was analyzing the House bill? Here is what one think tank, which has analyzed healthcare policy for years, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities--they put forth a report this Monday, June 12. In that report of just a couple of pages, they had a chart--I am holding it. I do not expect people to see it, but here is what it says. It has four columns. The first column has the major provisions of the House bill; and then what are likely, based upon reporting and information we can ascertain so far, major provisions of the House bill; what happens if the House bill passes; and then major provisions of the Senate bill.  There is a section entitled ``Medicaid Expansion.'' When the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analyzed and compared the House bill to what we know so far about the Senate bill being proposed or at least the development of it, basically the Center on Budget says there is no long-term impact on any reported changes from one bill to the other. The Medicaid per capita cap--another very disturbing development that is being considered--when they compare the Senate bill to the House bill, they say no major changes.  So we are very concerned about what happens to I am very concerned because of the 1.1 million children in Pennsylvania, the disability number I mentioned before of over 722,000 people with disabilities who get Medicaid, and of course the seniors who depend upon So we are concerned about the elimination, even over time, of the Medicaid expansion. We are also concerned about the Medicaid Program itself.  In addition to those numbers, I want to highlight a few individual stories of people to get a sense of what is at stake when it comes to this bill and when it comes to  This past Friday, I met with German Parodi from Here is his story:  In 2001, he was a victim of a carjacking and was shot in the neck, leaving him paralyzed and unable to use his legs and having limited use of his arms. He was nursed back to health by his grandmother and has worked for the past 16 years to be a full citizen, going to school, working, owning his home, now caring for his grandmother who once cared for him. German, who now uses a wheelchair to get around, has worked to achieve what every American wants--to be a successful student, to own a home, and to care for his family. He can do this because of his knowledge, skills, and perseverance, and he has been able to achieve these goals because he gets direct care services paid for by His direct care professional helps him get out of bed in the morning, get showered, dressed, breakfast, and get to work. Medicaid and the services it provides makes it possible for him to use his skills to be successful.  German told me that without Medicaid, ``I would end up having to live in an institution. This would dramatically affect my life and my grandmother's life.''  While talking with me, he said: ``Please do everything in your power to protect my life and the lives of millions like me.''  I am short on time but here is another example. Latoya Maddox, whom I met at the same meeting, is from the Germantown section of She was born with arthrogryposis multiplex congenital, a disability that limits the use of her limbs. Latoya also uses a wheelchair to get around, including getting to school and getting to work. She is smart, energetic, and the mother of a soon-to-be 6-year-old. She is now a junior at West Chester University working on her bachelor's[[Page S3533]]degree in social work and works part time at Liberty Resources, Incorporated, one of Pennsylvania's independent living centers.  Like German, Latoya is a successful young professional because she works hard and takes advantage of the opportunities presented to her. She has support from Medicaid in the form of direct support professionals who help her with her daily tasks. Without Medicaid, the wheelchair and other medical equipment she needs and her direct care workers, Latoya would not be able to work, attend school, and care for her son.  While I was talking with Latoya, she told me: ``Medicaid makes it possible for me to live a regular, full, productive life, to be a parent, to go to school, and to be a reliable employee.''  While talking with her, it was clear that Latoya was proud of her son and proud to be his mother. She was clear that the support she receives from Medicaid makes it possible for her to be that proud parent.  She closed her remarks by saying that Medicaid ``makes it possible for me to be me.''  My last example is Karen Karen Stauffer is from Bucks County, She is a small business owner. She operates the River of Life Natural Foods store. Karen purchased her healthcare policy from the Pennsylvania Affordable Care Act exchange. She said to me that prior to the passage of the ACA, she saw her healthcare premiums increase from $300 a month in the late 1990s to $1,300 in the mid-2000s. She said to me that because of preexisting conditions such as high blood pressure and a long bout of Lyme disease, she was worried she would lose her healthcare. She said passage of the ACA was both an emotional and financial relief for her. Her premiums were reduced to $500 a month after being as high as $1,300, and she knew she had the protection of the law when it came to nondiscrimination because of her preexisting conditions.  As she spoke, she shared her fears from what she has been hearing about the House bill and what might come out of the Senate; that, at 61 years of age, her premiums could be five times that of younger policyholders and that the meager subsidies proposed by the Republican majority would make healthcare unaffordable for her. She said to me: I am frankly terrified about what could happen to me in the next 4 years. My income has gone down, I have preexisting conditions, and instead of making adjustments and improvements to the ACA, legislators are causing insurers to become concerned about the future.  Karen was distraught when talking about the future and reminded me that ``we all could be one accident or illness away from disaster.'' That is what Karen said.  So German, Karen, and Latoya, I think, give us a lot to think about. I hope the majority, when they are making the final edits to their bill, will make sure that any American with Medicaid, for example, who has it now--a child who comes from a low-income family, an adult or child with a disability or a senior trying to get into a nursing home--if they have Medicaid today and need it in the future, that there would be a guarantee that they don't lose their Medicaid, that they don't lose it this year or 5 years from now or 10 years from now, or longer. Stretching it out over many years and eliminating that coverage year after year, a little bit each year, is going to be just as bad in the long run.  I hope the majority would think of those families and the families in their own States when they are considering healthcare legislation in the We should have a vote only if there is a hearing on this legislation or, frankly, more than one hearing to consider something this complicated.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from Oregon.prayers for the Victims of the Congressional Baseball Practice Shooting  ",CREC-2017-06-15-pt1-PgS3528-4.txt,1828,EDWARD T.

H.3180 provides the intelligence community with the authorization it needs to continue working to protect and defend the United States, supports critical national security programs, such as those protecting Americans against terrorism, cyber attacks, and hostile foreign nations. The bill maintains critical congressional oversight of the activities of the intelligence community, and the bill makes no changes to any surveillance authorities, including those set to expire, which we will take up later this year in legislation separate from this bill.  Mr.Speaker, as you know, earlier this week, H.3180 was considered under suspension of the rules, which is not at all uncommon for bills, like this one, that receive unanimous bipartisan support in committee.  While the bill received well over 50 percent of the votes of the House, it did not achieve the required two-thirds majority to pass under suspension, which is why we are here today debating this rule.

My staff simply had to call and inform the committee that I would like to review the bill, and the committee asked when I would be available, and they made sure that a member of the committee staff was also there to answer any questions I had.  The process itself was seamless, was very easy, and was facilitated by the members of the Intelligence Committee staff.  Mr.Speaker, this is a good and important bill. It supports the men and women in our intelligence community and the work they do to keep us safe. This is not an issue we should politicize or subject to partisan debate.  The intelligence community plays a critical role in the defense of our Nation, and we need to support them, Mr.Speaker, by supporting this bill.

856,topic-id,625,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My colleague from Florida, with whom I have had the privilege of spending many hours in the Rules Committee debating this and a range of other issues, raised a number of points I think that are important to clarify.  First of all on the issue of minority recruitment, last night, in the Rules Committee, in open session, Chairman Nunes was asked about this, and he testified very clearly and directly that diversity is very important, that it is mission-critical for the reasons that my colleague from Florida stated.  I can report that there are several provisions in the classified annex--I won't go into the details about them--with which my colleague may or may not be familiar that support the whole notion of Centers of Academic Excellence, which are particularly focused on recruiting young people, recruiting minorities and young people across the board for service in the intelligence community.

And certainly, when it comes to healthcare, the arguments and the criticism from the other side of the aisle lose a little bit of their credibility when they simultaneously attack the Republicans for moving too slowly and then also for moving too quickly.  What I can tell you is we are debating hugely important issues and hugely important topics. We are absolutely committed to repealing and replacing It is a system that is collapsing. It is a system that has devastated the lives of people across this country. It is a system that has driven premiums and deductibles through the roof. It has absolutely limited people's choice in terms of insurance plans, in terms of healthcare providers. It is a system that is failing.  We have seen the Democrats' fundamental approach was a government mandate and their attempt to force people across this Nation to buy health insurance. They thought that, through a government mandate, they would be able to force young people into these insurance pools and, therefore, drive the cost down. That is not what happened. It didn't work.  We know we have got to put in place a system that will be able to provide people the kind of care that they need, access, as well as lowering the cost and increasing availability. So there are a whole range of very important substantive efforts going on.  I think that it is clear that the folks on the other side of the aisle don't support the direction we are going in, may[[Page H6530]]not support the policy, but the people across this Nation--certainly, in my home State of Wyoming--spoke very clearly last November that they wanted a change, that they wanted to see the government reduce its role in their lives, and that they wanted to see us begin the process of building our military, rebuilding what has been lost over the course of the last 8 years, as well as rebuilding the facilities and the capabilities of our intelligence community, and that is exactly what this bill does. That is exactly what we are here doing this morning.  Mr.Speaker, I think that is why it is so important that my colleagues support this rule, that we provide the authority that the intelligence community needs through this bill to continue to do its important work to keep us safe.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-28-pt1-PgH6528.txt,99999999999999,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2192, PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT",2017.0,28.0,May

I would only note that in the 111th Congress, when they were in the majority, they enacted this process 26 times; in the 110th Congress, 17 times.  It is an important ability for us to have when we know we might need to move quickly on something. As a member of the Rules Committee, I am committed to ensuring we do everything possible to make sure that we are able to bring bills to this floor that carry out the kind of changes and improvements that the people of this Nation sent us all here to undertake.  I was really disappointed, Mr.Speaker, earlier this week when this bill was defeated under suspension of the rules. There are many things that are partisan issues in this body, and it is too bad when the minority uses the Intelligence Authorization bill as part of a political stunt to make what should be a bipartisan process and a bipartisan committee appear partisan.  The bill, H.3108, received unanimous support in committee, and I certainly hope today, Mr.Speaker, that the minority members of that committee, and frankly all on the minority side who understand the importance of the intelligence community in keeping our Nation safe, will put aside the partisanship, will put aside the games that the American people are so tired of, and will join me in supporting a good, effective, and important bill, that, frankly, the minority members in the Intelligence Committee worked very hard to help craft.  Mr.Speaker, I urge adoption of both the rule and H.3180.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.  The previous question was ordered.

Since taking office, President Trump has failed to use American steel for the Keystone pipeline, proposed $2.5 billion in cuts in the Labor Department, which will reduce funding for critical job training in advanced manufacturing, and proposed complete elimination of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a Federal initiative that provides critical matching grants to support regional manufacturing economies.  If President Trump were serious about putting working people first, he would work with Democrats to pass bills we have already introduced to strengthen manufacturing, bills like Make It In America Manufacturing Communities Act that I have introduced to revitalize manufacturing economies and legislation to modernize and strengthen Buy America provisions.  If Donald Trump wants to keep the promises he made to working people, then he needs to start working with Democrats to deliver results. We are ready to go. We have introduced bills to strengthen American manufacturing.

882,topic-id,673,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding me the time.  Mr.Speaker, as a student and former teacher of history, I have worked during my tenure in Congress to preserve and protect our Nation's historic treasures.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, commonly called HBCUs, are some of the most important historic educational institutions in our country. There are over 100 HBCUs in the country, and eight of them are in South I proudly represent seven of them and I am a graduate of one.  Many of them have buildings and sites on their campuses that have existed for over a century and are of great historical significance. Unfortunately, many of the historic buildings and sites on these campuses have deteriorated over the years and are at risk of being lost if not preserved and protected.  In 1998, at the behest of the Congressional Black Caucus, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, surveyed 103 HBCU campuses to identify the historically significant sites on these campuses and project the cost of restoring and preserving these properties. The GAO identified 712 historic buildings and sites, and projected a cost of $755 million to restore and preserve them. Each of these sites has national significance to American history, and I believe we have an obligation to be stewards of these historic treasures.  In 2003, working with our former colleague Jim Hansen of Utah and our current colleague and my dear friend Jimmy Duncan of Tennessee, Congress expanded the program and authorized expenditures of $10 million annually for 5 years. I have seen the results firsthand. Last year, Allen University rededicated the historic Chappelle Auditorium on its campus in Columbia, South Carolina, which was painstakingly restored thanks to funding from this program. Originally built in 1925, this building was central to the cultural life of African Americans in South Carolina for generations.  In 1947, Reverend Joseph DeLaine attended an NAACP event at Chappelle Auditorium that inspired him to organize Black families in Clarendon County to petition their school district to provide buses for Black students who, at the time, were forced to make a daily walk of 9.4 miles to school. That was 9.4 miles to school and 9.4 miles back home.  The legal case that grew from this petition, Briggs v. Elliott, precipitated the frontal attack on segregation in the country and was later combined with four other cases that became Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, at the Supreme Overturning the separate-but-equal fallacy, Brown ended legal segregation throughout  This is just a singular example of the history living on HBCU campuses. Because of our past efforts, historic buildings and sites at 59 HBCUs in 20 States have received funding from this program. However, many historic structures are still endangered.[[Page H5208]]  Consequently, in the omnibus appropriations bill for 2017, which passed earlier this year, Congress included $4 million for HBCU Historic Preservation so that we could continue this progress.  Last year, the House passed this bill unanimously, but it was not taken up by the I thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for supporting it again today. This bill is supported by the United Negro College Fund, the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, and the National Trust for Historic  The HBCU Historic Preservation program serves as an essential purpose to HBCUs, which have a special place in the fabric of American history, culture, and education. Countless individuals have worked tirelessly to cultivate HBCUs, and their legacy is seen in graduates whose achievements adorn the pages of American history. From Booker Washington, to Mary McLeod Bethune, W.E.DuBois, to Martin Luther King, Jr., HBCU visionaries and graduates have set powerful examples of leadership.  The legacy of HBCUs is one of significant courage and steadfast determination. The structures on these campuses across the country are living testaments to African-American history, and they deserve to be stabilized and restored. HBCUs are among America's national treasures that must be preserved and protected for future generations.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this needed legislation.

779,topic-id,387,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.657, the Follow the Rules Act, introduced by Congressman Sean Duffy of  Less than 1 month ago marked the 28th anniversary of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. That bill was a landmark accomplishment establishing enforcement mechanisms to protect those who help identify waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal It also protects those who, in good conscience, refuse orders that could violate the law.  Last year, the U.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered the case of Timothy Rainey, an employee of the State Department, refused an order to violate the Federal Acquisition  Rainey's supervisors subsequently took away his responsibilities as a contracting officer representative. He argued it was because of his refusal to obey the order. Thus, the Federal Circuit considered whether Federal managers can retaliate against employees who refuse to obey an order that would violate a government rule or regulation rather than a statute.  Unfortunately, the Federal Circuit has a record of misinterpreting the law on whistleblowers. That is precisely what happened here. The court held such employees were not protected. Ironically, the court relied on a significant 2015 Supreme Court decision, DHS v. MacLean, which reaffirmed the protections of the Whistleblower Protection  The Federal Circuit's decision puts Federal employees in an impossible situation. It forces them to choose between following their superior's orders or following the agency's rules or regulations. In many ways, an agency's rules and regulations are the standing orders of the head of the agency.  My colleague, Representative Duffy, introduced the Follow the Rules Act to fix this problem. H.657 makes clear that employees are protected from retaliation for disobeying orders that would violate an agency rule or regulation. Refusing to obey such orders is exactly the type of action for which Federal employees should be protected from retaliation.  This legislation has bipartisan, bicameral support. It passed the House by voice vote near the end of the last                              {time}  1715  I hope that this legislation will be signed into law this Congress and Federal employees will be protected in trying to do the right thing. I thank Representative Duffy for his leadership on this issue.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

780,topic-id,654,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  When we are going to pass a bill on a bipartisan basis, it might be useful to acknowledge the bill has a Democratic cosponsor. I am proud to be the lead cosponsor with Congressman Duffy on the Follow the Rules Act--in fact, he asked me to play that role--and I rise[[Page H2984]]clearly in strong support of the legislation which will protect, critically, whistleblowers who disclose waste, fraud, and abuse.  I want to thank my colleague, Representative Duffy, for working with me in a bipartisan way on this important bill. We initially introduced the bill together in the 114th Congress, and it passed the House without opposition. Unfortunately, the Senate did not act. Hopefully, this Congress we will be able to persuade the Senate to enact this important protection.  This bill would clarify that, under the Whistleblower Protection Act, an employee who refuses to obey an order that would require the employee to violate a law, rule, or regulation is protected.  Congressman Duffy and I introduced the bill to address a misinterpretation of the Whistleblower Protection Act by the U.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the case of Rainey v. MSPB in 2016, as my colleague from Kentucky suggested. In that case, a contracting officer, Timothy Rainey, was ordered by his supervisor to tell a contractor to rehire a terminated subcontractor. Rainey, in principle, refused because carrying out that order would have required him to violate the Federal Acquisition Regulation by improperly interfering with the contractor's personnel decisions and requiring the contractor to act contrary to the terms of the contract.  What reward did Rainey get for doing the right thing? He was stripped of his duties and given a negative performance rating.  The Federal circuit, God knoweth how, held that an employee who refuses to obey an order is protected only if the order would violate a law, a statute, but not if the order would violate a rule or a regulation. Talk about looking at angels on the head of a pin. The court's ruling was contrary, clearly, to the Whistleblower Protection Act and the intent of this  In enacting the Whistleblower Protection Act, Congress clearly intended that protections granted to government employees who blow the whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse be construed broadly. We clearly had in mind not only laws, but rules and regulations as well.  Congress and the American people rely on whistleblowers to make government efficient, honest, and effective, and we in Congress want to support those people. As a member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I rely on whistleblowers to help us with our oversight and reform work. Without them, rooting out mismanagement, abuse, and corruption would be very difficult.  The underlying principle of the Whistleblower Protection Act is that employees should be protected from retaliation if they do the right thing, even if it means disobeying orders from their superiors. Given the Trump administration's attacks on the Federal workforce, it is especially important now, more than ever, for this Congress to uphold whistleblower protections for all of our public servants.  We cannot tolerate the issuance of gag orders to silence dissent, and we cannot permit the firing of agency employees who have differing political views from our own or who might object to administration actions. If the administration and my colleagues are serious about draining the swamp, we need to do all we can to ensure that Federal employees are allowed to perform their jobs free from political pressure to violate laws, rules, and regulations.  Protecting whistleblowers has been and should continue to be a bipartisan--indeed, nonpartisan--issue and something on which we can find common ground. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this important bipartisan legislation. I am proud to cosponsor it with my friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.Duffy).  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-05-01-pt1-PgH2983.txt,1959,COUNTERING IRAN'S DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES ACT OF 2017,2017.0,1.0,June

I think the ruling of the circuit court in many ways tells us about the perils of a very juridical view of what a statute is all about. To refuse to take into account context, history, legislative history, and congressional intent that is reflected often in the kind of debate we are having here on the floor I think is not in the spirit of trying to interpret the laws as Congress intends them. Sooner or later I think Congress is going to have to address this kind of fundamentalist, originalist approach to laws that I think is nonsensical and leads to this kind of cherry-picking about what it was Congress intended to protect.

It mandates sanctions on Russian deep-water, Arctic, and shale projects worldwide and yet allows for waivers to be made based on national security interests of the United  This amendment prioritizes U.foreign assistance to allies in their fight against Russian aggression. This is something I know Senator Cardin worked hard on, and I appreciate his efforts.  It authorizes $250 million to establish the Countering Russian Influence Fund to implement programs in EU and NATO member countries--Senator Portman played a role in this as well, and I appreciate his efforts--as well as candidate nations, to combat Russian interference, with a priority given to programs that develop cyber security, address public corruption, respond to humanitarian crises, counter disinformation, and support democratic institutions.  It requires the State Department and other Federal agencies to collaborate and develop a plan to reduce Ukraine's dependence on Russian energy imports, which we know Russia has used to extort  I think it is a very good piece of legislation.

922,topic-id,1551,"Madam President, I would say to my friend from New York that he is omniscient if he claims to know the content of a bill that has not yet been voted on or agreed upon by Republicans in the I would just put that in the same category as his other advice to folks on this side of the aisle and again challenge his memory to how we got here in the first place.  I was here on Christmas Eve when we voted. I ended up voting against, but Democrats voted to jam ObamaCare through this body and on a strictly party-line vote. The fact is, ObamaCare is failing millions of people because if they have access to coverage at all, many of them have seen their premiums go up an average of 105 percent since 2013. That is the average in the 30-plus States that carry ObamaCare insurance on the healthcare exchanges--a 105-percent increase. Many of them have also seen their deductibles get so big that they cannot even really use the insurance they have because basically they are effectively self-insured.  So I take with a grain of salt the comments from my friend from New York that somehow we are doing something that is so horrible when we are trying to rescue the American people and clean up the mess our Democratic friends created when they jammed ObamaCare through on a party-line vote. If they were serious about it, what they would do is accept our invitation to work with us to improve healthcare for all It would be much better if we could do this on a bipartisan basis. It would certainly be more durable and be sustained for much longer than things done strictly on party-line votes. Yet, in the absence of any real help from our Democratic friends, who just seem to be standing idly by and not lifting a finger to help the people being hurt by ObamaCare today, we are going to have to do the best we can with the hand we have been dealt on behalf of the people whom we represent.  Madam President, on another matter, as a global leader of state-sponsored terrorism, Iran continues to threaten the very existence of the nation of Israel and destabilize the Middle East by creating a breeding ground for violence and hatred.  For the past several years, the United States and our allies have attempted to contain Iran, often to no avail. For one, President Obama's lopsided nuclear deal left a zero imprint on Iran's terrorist activities. So last week the senior Senator from Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced legislation to apply impactful and powerful sanctions on the nation of This bill will give the President the ability to block any trade that could benefit Iran's ballistic missile programs or support its military buildup.  I plan to introduce a bipartisan amendment to this bill that would target Mahan This is Iran's largest commercial airline that doubles as the preferred mode of transportation for terrorists and their weapons. That is right. It is a civilian airline, but it is actually used to facilitate terrorism and to transport weapons. Mahan Air not only supports the efforts of the Quds Force, which is a special unit of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard[[Page S3384]]Corps, but it supports Hezbollah as well. This terrorist airline is a conduit for personnel, weapons, and a violent ideology throughout the region.  Unfortunately, despite its proven transgressions, Mahan Air continues to expand international operations by adding more international airports to its flight patterns, including several in This is an obvious threat to the safety and security of the people where these planes are allowed to land. Not only are the goods they transport a cause for concern, but their very presence is a security risk to Americans who fly in and out of airports at which a Mahan aircraft may land.  Through all of this, of course, Iran continues to support their terrorist activities, indeed carrying on under the guise of commercial civilian aircraft flights.  My amendment would require the Department of Homeland Security to compile and make public a list of airports at which Mahan Air has recently landed and then require the Department of Homeland Security to assess what security measures should be added.  We have a duty to protect American citizens, and I am thankful that Chairman Corker will bring this legislation to the floor. The fight against terrorism is multifaceted, and it is not easy, but we can start by targeting state sponsors of terrorism like Iran with economic sanctions while we strengthen our military and continue the great tradition of American leadership around the world.                         Healthcare Legislation  Finally, Madam President, let me return to where I began--to the issue of  There is a lot of work to be done here at home as well. I know it is easy for us to get mired in the ``how,'' but it is also important for us to remember why we are repealing ObamaCare and why we are replacing it with something far better for American families.  I want to continue to highlight one of the many stories I am hearing from my constituents. I wonder whether the Senator from New York is hearing some of these same stories from his constituents.  This gentleman is a small business owner in the Fort Worth area who told me that since ObamaCare was implemented, this small business owner has been forced to change his insurance every year. Can you imagine going through that headache and hassle when President Obama said: If you like your health coverage, you can keep it. He was also the one who said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. He also promised that premiums would go down an average of $2,500 for a family of four--none of which has proved to be true. In this particular gentleman's case, as is the case for many Americans, his rates have gone through the roof, rising from roughly $350 a month to $800 a month. Despite the higher cost, he now receives less coverage because his out-of-pocket maximum has risen from $3,500 to $14,000. That is simply outrageous. Throughout the entire process, he has been fighting a losing battle.  As is the case with many States, including Iowa, provider after provider has pulled out of my State as well, as they are unable to afford ObamaCare at all.  This small business owner is not only forced to literally find new insurance every year, but he has to change providers each year and has fewer options available. Along the way--this is the other promise President Obama made that has been broken--this gentleman has lost access to his doctor of 20 years. He refers to the hope he had when President Obama looked into the camera and said: Now listen to me. You can keep your insurance, and you can keep your doctor, and you will pay less. That is what President Obama said when he was selling Instead, this gentleman, this small business owner from Fort Worth, did not get to keep his insurance. He lost his doctor of 20 years, and he now pays nearly three times more for less coverage and higher deductibles.  He closed his letter to me with a question. He asked: Can I count on you?  I look around the Chamber, and I ask all of us: Can the American people count on us?  I know they can because it is our responsibility to provide something far better than what they have had under They can count on us if we work together to find solutions that actually provide the high-quality healthcare American families deserve at prices they can afford. In many instances, this means getting government out of the way and allowing the marketplace to lower costs and increase quality, which is what markets do much better than government regulation.  Right now, every Senator on this side of the aisle is discussing with our colleagues how best to accomplish that, and we are also discussing this with the people whom we represent--the physicians, the healthcare providers, and others--to try to determine the best way forward. I hope our Democratic colleagues will join us rather than give us lectures from the Senate floor about the way we are conducting our business, particularly when their hands are unclean, to say the least, when it comes to the way they jammed ObamaCare down the throats of the American people to such bad effect. I would encourage them, rather than to just obstruct, to actually work with us in a bipartisan fashion. We would come up with a better product, a more durable product, if our Democratic friends would work with us rather than just sit on their hands or actively obstruct our efforts to get the job done.  I urge our colleagues from both sides to work together to find a solution that repeals what is broken in ObamaCare and replace it with patient-centered, accessible, and affordable healthcare. I hope that eventually others will come around to join us if for no other reason than their constituents are hurting from the status quo.  Madam President, I yield the floor.

1010,topic-id,3048,"Mr.President, I enjoyed listening to the comments of my friend, the Senator from Minnesota, and I would just say a couple of things.[[Page S3718]]One is that if 10 or so Democrats would have the courage to work with us, we could pass a true bipartisan healthcare bill, but the message we received from Democratic Leader Schumer and others is that they don't want to get involved in the process. So it is a little hard to take seriously the statement that if we would just be willing to work with them, we could get this done, because we have asked, and they have refused.  But it is not too late. If we could get a bipartisan group of Senators to actually improve the status quo, which is a disaster under ObamaCare, then I think we could make progress. But that is not what I hear.  I hear Senators criticizing the House bill. I guess that is because they haven't read the Senate bill, and we have said all along that we want to improve on what the House did. I think the draft bill, which is just that--it is a draft; it is a work in progress--does represent in many instances an improvement over the House bill.  I look forward to working with a coalition of the willing, whoever that might be. I hear some happy talk, but I don't see many people willing to cross over and actually work with us, roll up their sleeves, and do the hard work to actually pass a bipartisan bill.  I just have to say, I hear the criticism about cutting Well, the fact is, under the draft bill that was filed today, the essential safety net for low-income Americans is preserved. We actually will end up spending more money next year than this year and more money the following year because what we do is add a consumer price index increase.  As the Presiding Officer knows, being a practicing physician, this is a complex issue, but the fact is, it is absolutely critical to reforming Medicaid and making it work better. In addition to spending more money each year, which is not a cut in most of America--maybe it is in Washington, DC--as we all know, Medicaid is an open-ended entitlement, so if you qualify based on your income, then you get access to Medicaid continues to drive the budgets--not only the Federal Government but also the State government--and crowd out other priorities that are also important, such as law enforcement and education.  What we have decided we must do is to put Medicaid on a sustainable path by spending more money each year on low-income We still have some more work to do. But the idea that just because--compared to an uncapped entitlement with no limits on spending--we end up spending a set amount, as we spent this year or will spend next year and add more each year based on the cost-of-living index, that somehow is a cut, is just ludicrous. That is certainly not my understanding of what a cut is; it is a reduction in the rate of growth. So if you call that a cut, that assumes we are going to spend all of that uncapped amount of money, and we can't sustain the program if we do that.  This is one of the three major entitlement programs--Medicaid, Medicare, and Social I think it is our obligation, our duty, as we are saving the millions of people who are being hurt by the status quo and ObamaCare, to act responsibly to make sure this safety net program is available for low-income people going forward. We all should agree on that--that it is important and that we ought to put it on a sustainable, responsible fiscal path.  So this was kind of an interesting experience here this morning. We roll out the discussion draft of the ObamaCare repeal-and-replace bill, we put it on the internet, we make sure everybody has access to it, and we ask for their input, their advice, and their suggestions, and we are starting to get suggestions. We welcome suggestions that people have to this initial discussion draft. But you have to start somewhere, and this is where we are going to start. Then we will have a process next week whereby any Senator who has an amendment to the bill has an absolute right to file that amendment and get a vote on it. I can't imagine a more transparent and open process than putting it on the internet, inviting people to comment and discuss, and then having an open amendment process following debate and then vote. That is what we are supposed to do--vote.  So I think today represents a big step forward in saving those Americans who are being punished by health insurance choices that limit their right to choose a product at a price they can afford that suits their family's needs.  We know what the promises were, and I guess I just have to repeat them again. President Obama said: If you like your policy, you can keep your policy. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. An average family of four will see a $2,500 decrease in their insurance premiums.  What we have seen is a $3,000 increase in insurance premiums for the average family of four--not a decrease of $2,500, an increase of $3,000. And people who buy their health coverage on the insurance exchanges in the individual market have experienced a 105-percent increase in their premiums. Now, I don't know about you, but there are not many things that come out of my paycheck on which I can sustain over a period of just a few years an increase like that of 105 percent. Imagine if you had a 105-percent increase in your rent payments for your apartment or your mortgage payments for your house or your car payments or anything else. That is harmful and damaging to hard-working Americans, and it really is a breach of faith with them, when they were told when ObamaCare passed that they would actually save $2,500.  This discussion draft that was released today and put on the internet and is available to anybody who wants access to it is a product of years of debate on this floor and discussions among not just Republicans but the entire Senate and our constituents as well. We made our ideas public, and we sought feedback.  The Senate Finance Committee alone, on which the distinguished Presiding Officer and I serve, has had no fewer than 36 hearings on ObamaCare since 2011, ranging from the high cost of ObamaCare to transparency in the Medicaid system.  Just this year, there have been dozens of meetings throughout our conference. We would love to include Democrats, but they have chosen not to participate. Since May 4 alone, 18 of our conference lunches have been entirely dedicated to healthcare. There is a practical reason for that too--because without Democrats participating in the process, we have 52 Republicans in order to get 51 votes to pass a bill. That means everybody is essential to a successful outcome in repealing and replacing  So no one has been excluded. Everybody's ideas have been solicited. That doesn't even count individual meetings we have had with Senators and constituents.  Even after receiving this discussion draft, some of my colleagues across the aisle continue to refuse to enter into debate because they say it is not a final bill. Well, that is the point. We didn't present this as a fait accompli; we presented this as a place to start. And they don't even want to start. All they want to do is criticize. But they don't want to criticize an actual bill; they want to criticize the House bill, because they haven't even read the 142-page Senate bill. This is called a discussion draft for a reason: We are opening up a conversation and a discussion with the American people.  But we know Senate Democrats have chosen not to help to clean up the mess left by I don't really understand how they can turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to their constituents. I am confident, with all of the people who are writing and calling me in Texas, that they have to have people in their States who are calling them and saying: My premiums are skyrocketing. My deductible is so high that I effectively don't have access to insurance.  By the way, the insurance companies are pulling out of my State as fast as they can because they are hemorrhaging money.  I don't know why they are not motivated to work with us, but apparently that is the decision they have made.  Unfortunately, I think it goes back to this: When President Obama visited Capitol Hill the last time, in January of 2017, he had one message to Senate Democrats; that is, don't work with Republicans on healthcare. The President of the United States said don't work with Republicans on healthcare. This flew in the face of three consecutive elections since ObamaCare had passed where the voters had clearly[[Page S3719]]demonstrated their dissatisfaction with how ObamaCare actually worked. That shouldn't have been a surprise to anybody.  I remember being here on Christmas Eve 2009 when Democrats passed ObamaCare with only Democrat votes at 7:30 in the morning. No Republicans voted for the bill; only Democrats voted for the bill. Since that time, they have gone from 60 Democratic Senators down to 48. They went from the majority in the House to the minority in the They went from holding the White House to Republicans now holding the White To me, the message isn't all that confusing, nor is it subtle. It is clear to me that the American people have rejected the failed promises of ObamaCare and have, frankly, punished our Democratic colleagues for passing it in the way they did and as a result of the failure to keep the promises that were made when it was sold.  I have heard these concerns from my constituents in Texas for the last 7 years. I have read their letters and their emails, sharing some of their stories here on the Senate floor.  This law has been expensive--about $1 trillion in new taxes. People wonder why the economy hasn't grown during the Obama administration and since the great recession of 2008. One reason is because of the huge tax burden and because of the regulatory burdens it imposed on small businesses, which are the primary engine of job growth in the country, and ObamaCare has been part of the reason for that.  To my mind, this discussion draft does five things.  First, our legislation zeroes in on the unstable individual market.  Under ObamaCare, insurance markets across the country have languished under high costs and taxes, and the result has been that 70 percent of counties nationwide have fewer than two insurers to choose from. Less competition means higher prices because companies don't have to compete for the sale of a policy. In my State, one-third of Texas counties have only one insurance option. That is not exactly a choice; that is a monopoly.  Our legislation will help the collapsing insurance markets that have left millions of people with no options by creating a stabilization fund that will balance premium costs and address the lack of coverage that so many across the country have been experiencing.  I don't care what our critics say, we are not pulling the rug out from anyone. We will continue Federal assistance for healthcare markets through 2021 to make the transition smooth, much unlike our experience with Ultimately, if we want to encourage a market to lower costs while providing better quality care, we have to get the government out of the way.  The only thing I hear from our Senate Democrats is that they want more government involvement in your healthcare. That seems to be their default position. Well, we know from the failed experiment of ObamaCare that it doesn't work, at least insofar as the promises that were made when it was sold. So why would they default to a position of more government as opposed to more freedom to let you choose instead of government choosing for you and to punish you with a penalty if you don't buy the product that government orders you to buy?  Our second goal is making healthcare coverage more affordable.  Under ObamaCare, taxes and mandates cost the American economy $1 trillion--I mentioned that a moment ago--which, as our constituents felt firsthand, was ultimately paid by patients through higher healthcare cost.  Our friends across the aisle think we can raise taxes by $1 trillion and it won't have any impact on the consumer. Well, that is just ridiculous. We all know that those expenses get passed on to the consumer and that they get passed on in the form of higher healthcare costs. So when you tax prescriptions, for example, well, it is going to cost more. When you tax health insurance plans, which ObamaCare did, premiums are going to go up. And guess what. Taxing medical devices increases the cost of those devices and leads to job losses because they leave the United States, and they make those lifesaving medical products offshore in order to avoid the medical device taxes.  These taxes and mandates have crippled our economy, and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle recognize that as well. That is why our healthcare plan will improve affordability by addressing ObamaCare's taxes, which have hurt American families directly by making their healthcare less affordable. This framework provides a long-term State innovation fund that encourages States to assist high-cost and low-income individuals, making healthcare more affordable.  We are also encouraging tax credits to help defray the cost of purchasing insurance, adjusted for age, geographical location, and income, so that those who need financial assistance get the help they need.  Health savings accounts will also be expanded under our draft, giving Americans the choice of buying a hospitalization plan which covers major medical costs--not if they choose not to buy a comprehensive health insurance policy but, rather, to save money in a health savings account to be used for healthcare if they need it, and if they don't need it, they can use it for their savings. We give them that option, which they don't currently have under  The third principle is something our Democratic colleagues can certainly agree with us on, I assume, unless their reflexive action is to disagree with us on everything regardless of the facts, which sometimes seems to be the case, and that is, we should protect those with preexisting conditions. No American should worry about their ability to be covered when they move from job to job.  Our draft legislation also allows children to stay on their parents' policies through age 26.  There are no changes to healthcare for veterans, for Medicare, or changes to Social  Our fourth point of action is safeguarding Medicaid, which I addressed a little earlier, by giving States more flexibility. As we know, Medicaid is paid for by both a State and a Federal share, but the Federal Government sets the conditions by which that money can be spent on healthcare in the State as part of a low-income safety net. Bureaucrats in Washington, DC, shouldn't decide how Medicaid is applied in I don't know what rationale exists there. Why should the Federal Government tell a State how to spend its own money under Medicaid?  I believe States know how to handle this best because they are closest to the problem and they can design healthcare programs that meet the needs of those I dare say, the healthcare needs in Texas are much different from States like Vermont, Idaho, or other States--smaller States, certainly, with a more homogenous population. We have a very diverse We have a large number of noncitizens in my So why not send the money to the States and give them the flexibility to design programs to deal with the needs of their people? That is why our draft allows States to choose between a block grant and a per capita support for the Medicaid population starting in 2020.  We have done our dead-level best to make sure our draft doesn't leave anyone out, to ensure that the most vulnerable have protection--including children with medically complex disabilities.  Perhaps most importantly is the fundamental goal of this legislation to free the American family from ObamaCare mandates that have hit them where it hurts the most. We are giving Americans back their freedom of choice when it comes to healthcare, which has so long been denied them under the command-and-control regime of  Our healthcare plan empowers families to make their own choices. It repeals the individual mandate which punishes you if you don't buy the government-approved policy and the employer mandate that has resulted from people going from full-time work to part-time work because employers have sought to avoid that penalty. Finally, no longer will folks be forced to buy plans they don't need at a price they can't afford.  I believe this is the framework for better care. But we are going to continue to discuss this plan and talk to anybody who is willing to talk to us[[Page S3720]]and work with us. If there is a way the bill can be strengthened, I am open to it. But the status quo isn't working, and our Democratic colleagues know it.  This morning, I likened it as happening upon a terrible accident on the highway. We know people have been injured, and we have two choices: We can either stop and render aid--which is what we are trying to do for people hurt by the failures of ObamaCare--or you can drive right on by.  Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues have simply chosen to look the other way and drive on by. But before them is a real solution, one that has a chance to change the lives of millions of Americans for the better. So we hope they will reconsider and join us.  I yield the floor.

739,topic-id,593,"Mr.President, today, I speak in favor of the Iran sanctions bill. I am an original cosponsor of the bill, so it should come as no surprise that I support it. My only concern is that we did not pass it sooner.  As I stand here today, I cannot help but feel that this moment highlights the folly of the last 8 years of President Obama's foreign policy. For 8 years, President Obama did everything he could to curry favor with the Ayatollahs in He ignored popular protests, known as the Green Movement, and the thousands of Iranians who cried out for something more than sham elections. He lectured our Gulf Arab allies on the need to ``share'' the Middle East with their sworn enemy in some kind of cold peace. He insisted on putting daylight between us and our friend He dallied and dithered as the regime helped its client Bashar al-Assad help tear apart his own country in a brutal civil war. Most infamously, he traded away billions of dollars in sanctions relief for a flimsy, one-sided nuclear deal--a deal that did not prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon so much as ultimately guarantee it in just a few years.  What do we have to show for all of this? What did we get for looking the other way for 8 years? Not a more reasonable Iran, not a more open, tolerant, democratic Iran, not a friendlier Iran, but an emboldened Iran--one that continues to launch ballistic missiles in willful defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions. For everything we have done to mollify the ayatollahs and their sensitivities, they have gone out of their way to inflame ours. What did President Obama do? Nothing but appease them.  But we should not lay these failures solely on the last President's doorstep, because he represents a mindset that is too widely shared. It is one that sees Iran's obvious imperial aggression in the Middle East and yet still considers America the aggressor. It is one that tries to compartmentalize and haggle with a regime whose leaders shout ``death to Israel'' and ``death to America'' virtually every It is one that refuses to call a spade a spade and say to the Ayatollahs that enough is enough.  But today we are changing course--and not a moment too soon. This legislation will finally hold the regime and Tehran accountable for their brazen attempts to bully their neighbors and assert supremacy throughout the Middle It will put heavy sanctions on anyone who is involved in helping Iran develop ballistic missiles, circumvent our arms embargo, or spread terrorism throughout the world.  I know there are those who consider this kind of a move to be provocative, but I would say that it is the Iranian regime's aggression that has been provocative. All of these sanctioned activities are things that the regime and Tehran should not be doing in the first place. I do not think it is provocative to hold our enemies to the same standards as our friends. I do not think it is unreasonable to do what we can to protect our friends and ourselves from Iranian-supported terrorism and from a regime that is responsible for killing hundreds of American troops in the Middle Instead, I think it is long overdue.  Today, I am glad to see the Senate finally prepared to rectify these grave mistakes.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

737,topic-id,1475,"Mr.President, I rise to speak on the Crapo-Brown-Corker-Cardin Countering Russian Aggression and Cyber Attacks Act of 2017. This bill, filed as an amendment, was filed as amendment 232 to the Iran sanctions bill late last night.  Yesterday, the Senate Banking and Foreign Relations Committees concluded their work on a groundbreaking piece of legislation regarding Russia sanctions. I say groundbreaking because the legislation not only ratchets up pressure against the Russian Federation for its illegal invasion and annexation of Crimea, continuing escalation of violence in eastern Ukraine, and its cyber activities against businesses and citizens of the United States, but it also, importantly, provides Congress with a strong oversight process over almost any termination or suspension of these sanctions.  Senators Corker, Brown, Cardin, and their staffs spent many hours to ensure that we put together a thoughtful and measured product, and I thank them for their work.  Senator Brown and I have worked together for months to try to craft a responsible Russia sanctions package, and Senator Corker has been a tireless champion of this measure as has Senator I also would be remiss if I did not recognize the work of Senators McCain, Brown, Shaheen, and the many others who have worked to develop much of what has ended up in this legislation. All of us appreciate the leadership of Majority Leader McConnell and Senator Schumer, who worked with us as we came to our final agreement.  The need for this legislation was underlined by the fact that many Americans have deep concerns about Russia's behavior over the past few years. Since coming to power, Russian President Putin has become increasingly belligerent, nationalistic, and autocratic.  Currently, the United States has imposed sanctions on Russia for Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea and its role in supporting the separatist movements in eastern Ukraine, Russia's increasing cyber attacks and cyber espionage against the United States, Russia's support for the Assad regime in Syria, and Russia's complicity for corruption.  Although this is not an exhaustive list, it demonstrates the lengths to which Russia will go to seize power and influence in the international arena.  Unfortunately, Putin's desire to increase Russia's political influence is not driven by a desire to raise the standard of living for Instead, it is driven by a craving to enrich and empower himself and his cronies.  Over the course of the past 3 months, the Senate Banking Committee has held hearings assessing the impacts of the current sanctions regime against We examined the existing Russian sanctions architecture in terms of its effectiveness and its economic impact. The Russians have largely learned to live within the economic confines of the existing sanctions regime.  In Putin's calculation, the cost of the sanctions do not outweigh the benefits of occupying Crimea and contributing to unrest in Ukraine, to continuing to support the Assad regime's assault on civilians in Syria, and conducting cyber attacks on people, companies, and institutions around the globe.  Many of us on both sides of the aisle feel the United States needs to be much stronger in its response. Americans want to see the United States stand firm in the defense of our long-held values, which include respect for territorial integrity, human rights, and liberty.  At this point, the only way to change Putin's cost-benefit analysis is to increase the pressure which we apply directly through sanctions.  The Crapo-Brown-Corker-Cardin amendment is an effective way to increase the pressure on Russia for its irresponsible conduct. Our legislation signals to the world the unflagging commitment of the United States to the sanctity of territorial integrity, human rights, and good governance. Our amendment also demonstrates our resolve in responding to cyber attacks against U.citizens and entities and against our allies.  In summary, the Crapo-Brown-Corker-Cardin amendment does four things: It escalates and expands the current sanctions regime against Russia; it creates new sanctions against Russia; it engages Congress at a higher level than before by providing a mechanism for Congress to vote before lifting any sanctions on Russia; and it increases the Treasury Department's ability to track illicit finance, including illicit flows linked to  We escalate and expand the current sanctions regime against Russia by codifying and modifying six current Executive orders. Four of these orders relate to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and two relate to Russia's malicious cyber activity.  We expand the sanctions under the Ukraine-related Executive orders to reach Russian deep-water, Arctic, and shale projects worldwide. We also permit the President to apply these sanctions to Russian railway, shipping, and metals and mining sectors.  The amendment also creates several new sanctions against There are new sanctions for those who are engaged in significant activities undermining cyber security. These sanctions also apply to those providing material support for such malicious cyber actors.  We also impose mandatory sanctions on entities engaged in special Russian energy projects and on foreign financial institutions facilitating transactions in response to Russia's continued aggression in  The amendment includes tough sanctions on Russian Government officials, their relatives, and close associates responsible for significant corruption in Russia or elsewhere.  It sanctions people who help others evade sanctions and people responsible for human rights violations in any territory controlled by  Additionally, it sanctions those who work for or on behalf of the Russian defense and intelligence sectors, those who invest or support the construction of Russian energy export pipelines, and corrupt government officials who enrich themselves after making deals to privatize state-owned assets.  Finally, it sanctions those who help the Assad regime acquire chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons technology, ballistic or cruise missile capabilities, or destabilizing numbers and types of advanced conventional weapons.  The Crapo-Brown-Corker-Cardin amendment will result in some very powerful new sanctions on Part of our agreement includes congressional review language to ensure Congress exerts proper oversight on the use of these powerful sanctions. We require the President to notify Congress when imposing certain types of sanctions, and we will have the opportunity to review any attempts to lift sanctions with regard to We intend to use this review model on all sanctions regimes moving forward, and I intend to work to apply it to sanctions on  Amendment 232 is more than just the sanctions and congressional review;[[Page S3448]]this legislation also includes important counterterrorism financing provisions adopted by the House and Senate during the 114th It requires the creation of a national strategy for combatting the financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit finance. This strategy ensures that the United States pursues a coordinated and effective fight against illicit finance at all levels of the Russian  Our measure requires the strategy to enhance public-private partnerships to prevent and detect illicit finance. The measure also requires the Treasury Department to report on its efforts to identify illicit finance flows linked to Russia affecting the U.financial system or the financial system of our allies. We must engage all of our allies, particularly our trading partners, to work with us so that we achieve our objectives without collateral damage, which is so often the case. It is important that our trading partners be with us on this issue rather than being the victims of the actions we take.  This is a strong bipartisan measure that in important respects represents the next step forward. Of course, this will not be the last step if Russia does not begin to demonstrate verifiable steps toward reducing its course of aggression on multiple fronts. Make no mistake--the sanctions currently in place and those submitted in our amendment last night are Putin's fault and not a result of Putin's confused notions of Russian power and pride.  Even though unilateral actions are not the best option, America must lead on this issue and encourage others to follow since the most successful sanctions result from a united front of United States and European Union cooperation.  Since the unlawful annexation of Crimea, the years of destabilizing eastern Ukraine through relentless war, the global spread of cyber intrusions, and Putin's indefensible support of Assad's leadership of Syria, particularly in light of its recent chemical attack, fewer are left in Europe to defend Putin's policies. The times call for clarity of purpose and a correct amount of pressure. We have that in this amendment.  Again, thank you to Senators Corker, Brown, and Cardin for your hard work and support and to each of the other Senators from both sides of the aisle who have worked to help develop and pursue the policies adopted in this legislation.

The majority thinks they have finally found the right combination of political giveaways to pass their bill, a bill that we have to remember still kicks 24 million Americans off their healthcare coverage. It still charges seniors more. It still takes away some of the most basic protections of your health plan that it should cover. Despite what you hear, this latest Band-Aid amendment is not going to change any of that.  That is just what we know so far. Since this bill was built by backroom deals and haphazard guesses, we don't even know how much this bill will cost America--not just dollars added to the deficit, but the human cost of how much more damaging this bill will be.  It is the height of irresponsible governing, not just rushing something through without full and fair consideration. Frankly, we are getting used to that on our side of the aisle.

Let me tell you, with his leadership, what we accomplished. For two straight years, Senator Blunt has been able to raise the appropriations for medical research at the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion or more. The net result of that is that a $30 billion budget has grown to almost $34 billion. What does it mean? It means that researchers don't get discouraged. They stay on their projects. They keep working to find cures.  Secondly, we are making dramatic advances in medicine because of it. His leadership has been absolutely essential. If there is ever a bipartisan issue, this is it.

697,topic-id,3762,"I thank my colleague from I will tell you that he set a standard. I hope that both parties will agree that this is the starting point. For every year's budget, the starting point is at least a 5-percent real growth increase in medical research.  Thank you, Senator Blunt, for your leadership.                         Healthcare Legislation  Madam President, I also want to address an issue that came up in debate last week in the U.House of Representatives; that is, the question of the repeal of the Affordable Care This is an issue where reasonable people can disagree about how exactly to run our healthcare system.  But at the end of the day, I hope that, as with medical research, we can all come together with some basic issues. Congress should not pass a law taking away health insurance coverage from Let's start there. Congress should work together on a bipartisan basis to find ways to reduce the cost of healthcare and health insurance premiums. I think we should agree on that too.  Third, we have to find a way to make sure that consumers and families across America are protected with health insurance that is there when they need it. Now, it was a little over a week ago when I became a statistic--not just a Senator but a statistic--in healthcare. I went through a heart catheter procedure in Chicago last week on After that procedure--which turned out just fine; thank you--I am a statistic. I am a person in America with a preexisting condition. I have to check that box that says I have had a heart procedure.  It used to be if you checked a box like that--diabetes, asthma, whatever you checked--it ended up having a direct impact on what you paid for health insurance or whether you could even buy it. There were people who survived cancer--children, adults--who could not buy health insurance because they were too big a risk for health insurance companies.  Well, we changed that. The Affordable Care Act changed that and said: Just because you have a preexisting condition--and one out of three Americans has one--you should not be denied coverage. Now, the House of Representatives passed a bill that allows Governors literally to take away that requirement in health insurance plans. What are they thinking?  Do they think they are so darn lucky that they will never have an accident, never have a diagnosis where they end up with a preexisting condition? It can happen to anybody, and it does. So what the House of Representatives did in this regard is a step backward.  They also changed the Medicaid system. People have this image, when you say Medicaid: Oh, that is the same as No, Medicare is for seniors and disabled people. Medicaid is a policy of health insurance that is available for people who do not have a lot of money. Well, who qualifies for that? Well, it turns out that the largest number of people who qualify for Medicaid are children and their moms.  In my State of Illinois, half of the kids who are born in the State are covered by So the moms, when they need prenatal care to make sure the babies are healthy, and the babies, when they need care after the hospital, rely on But that is not the most expensive thing when it comes to The most expensive thing in Medicaid are your moms, your grandmoms, and granddads who are in nursing homes. You know what happens? They reach a point where they need to be in a place where folks can watch them and help them.  They have medical issues and age is taking its toll. But many of them get there, and all they have is Social Security and Medicare, and it is not enough. So Medicaid steps in and supplements it so that your mom, your dad, or your grandmother can stay in that place, which is good for them, secure, safe, and with the right kind of healthcare. The other group that relies on Medicaid the most in their daily lives are disabled people, folks who are born with a disability or have acquired one in life and they need ongoing medical care they cannot personally afford.  Children and their moms, elderly folks in nursing homes, and disabled people depend on So what does the Republican bill that passed the House of Representatives do to the Medicaid Program across America? It ends up cutting over $800 billion in coverage. What it means in Illinois is that 1 million people--out of our 12.5 million population--are likely to lose their health insurance because of the action taken by the House of  Even my Republican Governor in Illinois came out publicly and said what they did in the House of Representatives is disastrous for our It has a significant negative impact on the cost of healthcare and the coverage of health insurance. So why would we want to do that? Why would we want to take health coverage away from the groups I just mentioned?  Do we want to put less money in prenatal care? Well, if we do, we run the risk that children will be born with problems and challenges that could[[Page S2899]]cost us a fortune and compromise their lives.  Do we want to put less money into supporting elderly people who are in nursing homes? Well, what are they going to do? What are they supposed to do? If they can't stay in a place that is good for them and with the right kind of care, does that mean the family now has to find a spare room for grandma or your mom? I hope not. These folks want to live in dignity, and they don't want to be in a situation where they have to look for charity or beg for help from their families.  The third group is disabled people. For goodness sakes, we are lucky. We have people with disabilities who are doing amazing things today. But many who are in lower income categories need the help of  I had a group of hospital administrators come in to see me this week from They were from every part of the If you go down to our beautiful Southern Illinois area, there are some great towns. One of them is Anna, IL, right near Cobden, It is down in the southern end of our It is a very rural area with smaller towns.  Then I had administrators in the same group from Quincy, IL, from Springfield, IL, my home town, and from the city of They all came here to tell me the same thing: The bill that passed the House of Representatives last week is a disaster when it comes to Illinois hospitals. They estimate they are going to lose up to 60,000 people who are currently working in hospitals in Illinois, because of that bill, and they are also going to see closures and reductions in services at these same hospitals while we see the Medicaid cutbacks take place.  Now, why is that? Let's assume you have a small rural hospital in a town that you live in. If you do, you value it very much because that means there is healthcare there, right next door, when you need it. You don't have to drive 50 miles or more. You have it right there. You also know it is a great employer in your area. You also know, as well, that that is the way you keep a lot of businesses in your town and attract new ones.  So what these hospitals are telling us is that the bill that passed the House of Representatives to repeal the Affordable Care Act is a threat to the future of those hospitals. If the patients don't come in covered by Medicaid and pay for some of their services, the hospitals will still treat them, but they are charity patients, then, and the hospitals have to charge every other patient more because of it.  So that is a terrible way for us to approach healthcare reform in That is the reality of what we face today. I am troubled by the fact that this bill, which passed the House of Representatives by two votes--two votes--if two Congressmen had voted the other way, this bill would not have passed. This bill was never reviewed by the Congressional Budget Well, who cares? I care.  For everything we do that is supposed to be that important to affect the American economy, we are supposed to go to the nonpartisan experts and ask them: Well, what does this really do? We have been held to that standard--Democrats have and Republicans, too--until now. Now, we have this decision by the House of Representatives to pass this bill affecting America's healthcare system--one-fifth of our economy, I might add--and they never went for an analysis to the Congressional Budget  That has never happened before. They did it anyway. You know why they did it? Because the first version of this bill was a disaster. They sent that bill in for an analysis--24 million Americans losing their health insurance over the next 10 years. It was a disaster. They were afraid they would get the same analysis on the second bill. So they never sent it in for the analysis. In 2 weeks, we are going to have the numbers.  But it really gives you fair warning that this bill could be very hurtful to a lot of people across America, and yet it passed the House of So today people say to me in Illinois, when I have town meetings: Well, we are listening to you, But what do you want to do about healthcare today? What would you change in the current system? Well, let me tell you first. I voted for the Affordable Care I believe in it. The number of uninsured people in America--the percentage--has been cut in half because of the Affordable Care Is it perfect? Of course not. Does it need to be changed?  I can give you two or three specifics, and I will. First, we have to do something about the price of drugs in America--pharmaceuticals. You see what is happening. Hedge funds are buying the rights to drugs and raising the prices two, three, four, and ten times because they have an exclusive drug. There is a family I have come to know who has a young son who is in high school in He has diabetes. He is an amazing kid. He is going to be a great success in life. He has fought diabetes for years and years. His mom and dad have stood behind him.  They came in to tell me: Do you know what has happened to the cost of insulin--insulin--which diabetics need dramatically? It has gone up two, three, four, and five times in the last few years for no reason other than that they can charge it. Of course, a person with diabetes may be dependent on that insulin even to survive.  So the first thing we ought to do when we look at the healthcare system is figure out how to make sure that we have reasonable pricing when it comes to pharmaceuticals. Of course, I want them to make a profit. Those pharmaceutical companies, with a profit motive, will keep doing research to find the next drug. But do I want these hedge funds and others--investment bankers--to buy out the rights to those drugs and drive their prices through the roof? That is not fair. It adds dramatically to the cost of healthcare.  Blue Cross Blue Shield is one of the biggest insurers in It is the biggest in my State of My wife and I have a plan with them. So the head of Blue Cross Blue Shield came to me, and she said: Senator, did you know that last year Blue Cross Blue Shield paid more for pharmaceuticals than they paid for inpatient hospital care? What? Inpatient hospital care, people who have to come in for surgeries and things--you paid more for pharmaceuticals?   Well, there are things we can do about it. I have legislation that I have introduced that reviews the pricing on pharmaceuticals, holds the pharmaceutical companies accountable. I take a position on an issue that all of my colleagues don't share, but I want to share it with you. There are only two nations in the world--only two--that allow pharmaceutical companies to advertise on television. The United States and New  Well, what difference does it make? Have you turned on the TV lately and tried to find a show that did not have ads about pharmaceuticals? Have you tried to write down the names of some of those pharmaceuticals so that you might remember them if it is something of interest? Have you tried to listen to the warnings that they give you about all of these pharmaceuticals?  Well, some of the warnings are amazing: If you have had a liver transplant, be sure and tell your doctor. Well, yes, that explains that incision. A liver transplant? Why do they do that? Why do they buy all of those ads on television? Real simple. If you have some condition, and they talk about it in one of those ads, you are going to ask your doctor about that drug, and it is likely, in many cases, that doctor, then, will end up prescribing that drug.  Is it necessary? It may not be. Is it the cheapest form of the drug? It may not be. So, then, why does the doctor write the prescription? Because it is easier to do that than a 10-minute stop in the office for him to sit down with you and patiently explain: You don't need this drug, or you can use a generic, or we ought to wait a while before we go into this.  The result of it is that more and more pharmaceutical companies have their drugs being prescribed and more and more profits coming their way. So I, for one, think that this direct consumer advertising is really hurtful in terms of the cost of healthcare in our country, and it is something we ought to deal with. I would make that part of the reform of the Affordable Care  The second thing we need to do is to make sure, I believe, that in every place in America, if you so choose, you can choose a Medicare-type public plan[[Page S2900]]to cover your family. Right now, it is private health insurance companies. You may choose to stick with the private health insurance company. That should be your choice. But you also ought to have a Medicare-type plan.  Over 50 million Americans are covered by Medicare, and most of them--the overwhelming majority of them--are happy with What if we had a Medicare-type plan, a public option, available to every American to choose if they wish? I think that could reduce the cost of healthcare, and I think it is an option we ought to consider.  The third point I would make is that when we are dealing with reforming the healthcare system, we have one group in particular who is giving us a real challenge: individuals who are buying health insurance. The vast majority of Americans get their health insurance through their employment and many others through Medicaid--a program I described earlier--and then there is that group out there buying insurance on the open market. They are the ones who are seeing the runup in premiums and costs and overruns that they have to face, seeing copayments going up and the like. We need to find a way to deal with this group to give them affordable health insurance. There are a lot of ways to approach that, but that ought to be a target of what we do for the ones who are facing the toughest increases in health insurance.  I will just say this too: The good news about this conversation in the Senate is that it is finally reaching a new level. Now there are 12 Republican Senators who are meeting with Senator McConnell, and they are setting out to draw up a plan and try to pass it with just Republican votes. I hope that does not succeed, and I will tell you why. If we can do this on a bipartisan basis and sit down in good faith and work out these improvements to the Affordable Care Act, that is the best option for this country. Senator Collins of Maine and Senator Cassidy of Louisiana are trying to start that conversation. I have said to them that if this is a good-faith effort not to repeal the Affordable Care Act but to repair it, I want to pull a chair up to the table.  Let's have this conversation. We may not agree, we may not be able to come up with the best solutions, but the bipartisan approach of solving the current problems with the current healthcare system is a much more sensible thing to do than to have an all-Republican bill trying to force its way through here. I hope that doesn't happen. It is far better to do this on a bipartisan basis, and I hope that is what will be done.  I will be going home, as I do regularly, to talk about the impact of the bill passed by the House of I have just touched on some of the major points of it.  There is one thing I do want to mention, though. It has an age tax in it that many people between the ages of 50 and 64 may not be aware of.  Currently the law says that there cannot be a disparity of difference in premiums charged of more than 3 to 1; that is, the most expensive premium charged to someone for health insurance, no matter what their health or condition, cannot be more than three times the lowest premium charged. That is current law. The bill passed in the House of Representatives changed that dramatically. It says: Instead of 3 to 1, let's make it 5 to 1. Who is going to pay the difference? Folks who are older and those facing chronic illness.  If you are between the ages of 50 and 64, watch out for your health insurance premiums under this measure that passed the House of That is something which should not have been included. That is why the American Association of Retired Persons has come out against this bill. It is another reason we have to ensure that the bill that passed the House of Representatives does not become the law of the land. To have this discrimination against people because of their age is unfair, and I agree with the American Association of Retired Persons on that particular issue.  Let's hope we can find a bipartisan path to making healthcare even better in I don't care who takes the credit for it. If at the end of the day more families have peace of mind with health insurance that they can afford, that provides them quality care when they need it, that is something we need to achieve.  As I said earlier, I again learned this lesson last week. The lesson is simply this: If you go in for a diagnosis and learn that you need quality healthcare, you want to have health insurance. You want to have access to the best doctors and hospitals. Everyone in America wants that. That shouldn't be a privilege which is reserved just for the rich and lucky; that ought to be there for every single  I believe healthcare is a right, not a privilege. If we start off with that premise, we can build a healthcare system in this country that is still the envy of the world.  Mr.Madam President, today I come to the floor in opposition to the nomination of Robert Lighthizer to be United States Trade Representative, After close examination of the confirmation process for Mr.Lighthizer, I have come to the conclusion that Mr.Lighthizer does not adequately understand the positive economic benefits the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, has had and will continue to have on Arizona and our His advocacy for protectionist shifts in America's trade policies, including his support for the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, and the Trump administration's incoherent and inconsistent trade posture, have only solidified my opposition to his nomination to be  As I wrote in a February piece in the Arizona Republic, coauthored by my colleague Senator Flake and Arizona chamber president Glenn Hammer, NAFTA has delivered enormous economic benefits to the United States since its inception in 1994, especially for the citizens of In just two decades, Arizona's exports to Canada and Mexico have increased by $5.7 billion, or 236 percent. Mexico stands as Arizona's 1 trading partner, with bilateral trade accounting for 40 percent of our State's exports to foreign markets in 2015 and totaling $9.2 billion. Arizona's trade relationship with Mexico also directly supports more than 100,000 Arizona jobs.  While I understand NAFTA could be strengthened and modernized, any efforts by this administration to withdraw from NAFTA or impose new restrictions or barriers on our ability to trade with Mexico and Canada will have serious consequences for Arizona, including massive job losses for workers and dramatically higher costs for consumers. Furthermore, I am troubled by the need for and the process by which Congress recently granted Mr.Lighthizer a waiver to serve as USTR given that he previously represented a Brazilian and Chinese client in trade litigation matters. As part of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, Congress adopted my amendment to prohibit an individual from serving as U.Trade Representative or Deputy U.Trade Representative if that person has ``directly represented, aided, or advised a foreign entity'' in ``any trade negotiation, or trade dispute, with the United States.'' Ultimately, the waiver was tucked in the must-pass omnibus spending bill, with no chance to debate or vote on such an important trade related policy.  As Senator Sasse and I recently wrote in a letter opposing Mr.Lighthizer, the administration's incoherent and protectionist message on trade ``is especially troubling because confirming a USTR grants the Administration additional legal authority to negotiate trade deals that Congress must consider under `fast track' procedures. Given these circumstances, granting the Trump Administration additional legal powers through your confirmation without understanding how you or the Administration intend to use those powers would be irresponsible.''  I plan to vote against the nomination of Mr.Lighthizer, and I urge colleagues to join me.

I thought I would talk for just a couple of minutes about the consequences of such action, what has been accomplished in Cuba, what our goals are, and what I think our goals should be.

I always thought that certainly there is a place for economic sanctions. Sometimes they can help nudge countries or push countries toward a desired outcome--but a travel ban? You only impose a travel ban under extreme circumstances, such as when national security reasons dictate, and there hasn't, for a long time, been national security reasons for a travel ban. I have always thought that as an American citizen that if somebody is going to limit my travel, it ought to be a Communist, somebody from another country that wouldn't let me in, not my own government to tell me where I can and cannot travel. I think most Americans feel that way.  I think we ought to first consider whom these sanctions are on. The sanctions we have had for so many years have not really been on Cubans; they have been on Gratefully, the previous administration lessened these restrictions or lessened the impact around them. Around 2008 or 2009, the last administration said that Cuban Americans should be able to travel freely at least. Prior to that, we had instances where Cuban Americans would have to decide, if their parents, for example, were still in Cuba and were aging, maybe their mother was infirm--they had to decide if my mother passes away, do I attend her funeral or if my father passes away within 3 years--see, it used to be that Cuban Americans were limited to travel to the island just once every 3 years. They had to decide whether to attend their mother's funeral or their father's funeral. What a terrible thing for our government to tell American citizens, that they have to choose whether to attend their father's funeral or their mother's funeral. What kind of a country is that? Why would we do that? Yet we did for a number of years.  Gratefully, the last administration lifted restrictions on Cuban-American travel and at the same time lifted considerable restrictions on remittances, allowing money to flow more freely to relatives and others on the island. That coincided with the time the Cuban Government realized they couldn't employ every Cuban, not even at $20 a month, so they said: Go ahead and find another line of work in the private sector, run a bed and breakfast, have a private restaurant, have an auto repair facility or a beauty shop. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans have done so over the past 5 years, largely with seed capital provided by travel from Americans, particularly Cuban-American travel and remittances.  So there was a situation where virtually no Cuban was employed in the private sector 5 years ago, but today as much as 25 percent of the Cuban workforce is now in the private sector. They have obviously more economic freedom. The average waiter in a Cuban private restaurant brings in $40 to $50 a day, while the average Cuban working for the Cuban Government brings in $20 to $30 a month. So there is significantly more economic freedom for those in the private sector in Cuba but also significantly more personal freedom as well. That is a good thing. That stands with the policy and goal we always had to increase freedom for the Cuban people.  Now we hear that the administration may want to turn back some of that progress and say that Americans shouldn't be able to travel as freely or as frequently to Some of the rumors say they will limit travel to once a year. We don't know if that will be for Cuban Americans or all By the way, it seems rather strange to have a policy that is ethnically based, where we say: You are a Cuban American, you can travel, but if you are another type of American, you can't. That just seems pretty un-We can't get back into a situation where a Cuban American, living in the United States, will have to choose whether they can attend their mother or their father's funeral. I hope we don't get back into that time.  Another thing we ought to consider is that when Americans travel more freely, as they have been able to do under what is called a general license for individual travelers--that was one of the changes that was made in just the past couple of years--then individual American travelers tend to go to Cuba and stay in a bed and breakfast run by a private Cuban citizen, travel in private taxi cabs, frequent a private restaurant. My own family has done that.  If we go back to the time when American travelers have to travel under a specific license or as a group, then those travelers will be pushed toward the Cuban hotels which are owned by the Cuban Government or military. Therefore, you have aided the Cuban Government more than the Cuban people. Under no system will you be able to cut off money completely from the Cuban Government or the private sector. There is leakage everywhere. That is how economies work. Why in the world do we have a policy where we directly benefit the Cuban Government[[Page S3441]]by pushing American travelers to the hotels they own rather than the private homes owned by private Cuban citizens? It seems to me these policies, if they are going to come forward--and it seems that they might be--just go against the policies and the goals we have.  Another thing we need to consider is that in the old times, when we had more restrictive policies on travel on Americans, those had to be enforced somehow. That falls upon the Office of Foreign Assets Control at  OFAC, you may have heard recently, is the office we charge to enforce our sanctions on We are putting new sanctions on They will be charged with enforcing those. They will be charged with enforcing sanctions on Russia and new sanctions on Russia as well. Sanctions on North Korea, again, falls to Yet we are telling OFAC that now they are going to have to spend a considerable amount of time and resources and manpower tracking down people going to Cuba to see if they stick to their designated, approved itinerary, whatever that might be, whatever we think they ought to be doing there, rather than what they want to be doing there. That just seems foolish to me and a waste of money, time and resources, and wrongheaded priorities with regard to other priorities that we have on sanctions.  We had situations in previous years that would simply be laughable if they weren't true, but I think the administration ought to consider that when we have a restrictive policy on travel, we are going to have situations that are just flat embarrassing to us. If that sounds crazy, it doesn't sound crazy to Joan Slote of San Diego, who traveled to Cuba in the year 2000 at the age of 72 with a Canadian company that organized cycling tours. She was fined $7,500 in the United States because she hadn't preapproved the itinerary and didn't follow the guidelines. She went through a Canadian company to do that. The subsequent fees totaled nearly $10,000. I think it was settled for something less, but why in the world are we sanctioning and fining a 72-year-old woman who went on a biking tour in  Consider the case of Cevin Allen in the State of He spent part of his childhood in Cuba, where his parents were missionaries. They built an Assembly of God Church in a town in southeastern His parents died in 1987 in a house fire. Ten years later, Allen traveled to Cuba to scatter the ashes of his parents at the church they had built. He also brought a family Bible to give to the church's pastor. Cevin returned to the United States via Nassau, Bahamas, where he told U.agents he had just been to He told them the reasons for his travel. His initial fine was $7,500.  Do we really want to be fining people who are scattering the ashes of their parents? These aren't isolated incidents. This went on for a while.  A woman from Indiana was fined for distributing Bibles in Cuba because her itinerary didn't include a trip to the beach. She went to the beach, I am told, to participate or to watch a baptism that was happening at that time. Why in the world would we try to limit that kind of travel? Yet that is what we would be doing if we go back to restricting travel.  Maybe these rumors are overblown. Maybe we will not be imposing new restrictions on travel, but if we are, I hope the administration will consider these things.  There is another rumor out there that we know that if we diminish American travel, therefore diminishing the amount of money that goes to these Cuban entrepreneurs who are running bed and breakfasts and private restaurants, then we can make up for it somehow by having some of our government agencies teach entrepreneurship classes. Anybody who has been in Cuba understands that Cubans who have survived on $20 a month for decades are more entrepreneurial than we will ever be. They don't need lessons in entrepreneurship, they need customers, and by denying Americans the freedom to travel to Cuba, we will be denying them customers, and they will be worse off. Their political freedom will be diminished. Their economic freedom will be diminished. Their personal freedom will be diminished. That is not what we want.  Obviously, we want the Cuban Government to change. It has been disappointing, the rate of change. Why would we take it out on the Cuban people? Don't they have it tough enough with a Communist government that wants to control and keep that control as long as they can? Why don't we continue to help the Cuban people as they have been helped over the past couple of years? We also want to consider the cooperation we have with the Cuban Government with regard to issues such as drug interdiction, environmental cooperation, immigration enforcement. In the past couple of years, we had a lot of Cubans rafting to South Florida because of the wet foot, dry foot policy. We have had tens of thousands of Cubans crossing the Mexican border to make it to Arizona or Texas or California or New Mexico to claim or to be paroled into our system and ultimately perhaps to get citizenship. Because of agreements we have had and the diplomatic cooperation we have had over the past couple of years, and specifically over the past couple of months, we have been able to reach an agreement where we don't have that kind of migration and those kinds of issues. So there are tangible benefits to the diplomatic cooperation we have had. I am told we are not going to touch that; that we are not going to roll back. We have diplomatic relations and that is a good thing.  We don't want to go back to the time where instead of an embassy, we had a special interests section in Cuba and the Cubans had one here. I hope the President of the United States and his Cabinet will consider these things as they make decisions on what to do on There are changes to policy we can make, but I would argue they would be more in terms of further liberalizing travel. We have a bill that has been filed in the Senate with 55 cosponsors. It is a bipartisan bill to completely lift the travel ban and get rid of it completely. If such a measure is brought to the floor, I am confident there will be between 65 and 70 votes--maybe more--for such a bill. Instead, we seem to be going in the other direction or the administration is talking about going in the other direction. I hope they will reconsider.  I yield the floor.

The House of Representatives works on many important issues, but few are more important than making sure that innocent arrestees are promptly released and that culpable suspects are not released to strike again.  Rapid DNA technology has the potential to do both of those things and, as such, can be an important tool for law enforcement and a key component of this body's ongoing efforts on criminal justice reform.  I applaud the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.Sensenbrenner) for reintroducing H.510, the Rapid DNA Act of 2017, in this session of  With Rapid DNA technology, it is possible to test the DNA of arrestees as soon as they are in custody and determine within hours whether they match the DNA profile from a crime scene or from other earlier crimes.  This technology would also enable police to check the Federal DNA database to see if an arrestee matches the DNA profile from previous crimes for which a DNA sample exists but no known suspect has been identified.  Rather than waiting weeks for a DNA sample to be processed and risk releasing a suspect back into the public to potentially reoffend, creating new victims, police will be able to determine at initial booking if the suspect is a person of interest in other crimes.  This bill will provide important tools for law enforcement. For instance, it will inform decisions about pretrial release or detention and their conditions. It will solve and prevent all crimes, including violent crimes. By freeing up forensic analysts, it will prevent DNA analysis backlogs.

782,topic-id,449,"Mr.Speaker, those of us in this institution talk about we are a country of laws. However, over time, more and more of the statements that we have to live by are not laws. They are rules and regulations. Therefore, when the Whistleblower Protection Act was passed in 1989, I am not sure at the time whether it was intended to cover rules and regulations, but, as a practical matter, I think Federal employees will run into problems in which they are asked to disobey rules and regulations even more than statutory laws themselves.  On June 7 of last year, the U.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in Rainey v. Merit Systems Protection Board that, while laws were covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act, rules and regulations were not, at least if you weren't a Federal employee.  Why is it relevant that we have to make up for the problems caused by this decision? Timothy Rainey was a State Department employee who, while serving as a contracting officer in 2013, was ordered by his superior to violate the Federal Acquisition Rainey refused and was subsequently removed from his duties.  When Rainey invoked the right-to-disobey provision of the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Merit Systems Protection Board ruled the law only protected him from violating Federal laws, but such protections don't apply to rules or regulations. Rainey appealed the case, and the U.Court of Appeals upheld the Protection Board ruling and, in doing so, exposed a glaring inconsistency in the application of the act.  What does this mean? Federal whistleblowers play an important role in exposing mismanagement, the rampant mismanagement at Federal agencies, and supporting the oversight work of Critical to them is the Whistleblower Protection Act which provides Federal workers with certain legal safeguards to disclose information that an employee reasonably believes evidences gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a violation of the law.  This ruling will take away the protections when they stand up to bad actors in the Federal workforce. In effect, this ruling will give permission to supervisors in positions of authority to force Federal workers to violate the rules and regulations that Congress, through law, directs the agencies implement.  Regardless of your opinion about certain rules, we should not leave, exposed, Federal workers who are just trying to follow the rules instead of obeying supervisors who want them to disobey the rules and regulations. The bipartisan Follow the Rules Act, which I am an original cosponsor of, will close this loophole created by the court's ruling and ensure that Federal employees have protections for refusing to violate the rules and regulations in addition to the law.  I ask support for this bill.  ",CREC-2017-05-01-pt1-PgH2983.txt,2276,COUNTERING IRAN'S DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES ACT OF 2017,2017.0,1.0,July
797,topic-id,816,"Mr.Speaker, this past Saturday, I was a guest at Lincoln United Methodist Church in Chicago, where we had an emergency meeting to discuss how we would defend the DACA--Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--initiative started 5 years ago.  DACA has allowed nearly 800,000 DREAMers--immigrants who were brought to the U.as children and who grew up here--to work and live here if they meet certain requirements, go through a background check, and renew their application periodically.  Now, Republicans, led by the Governor of Texas, are planning to sue the President if he doesn't rescind And given this President and his opinion of Mexicans, Latinos, and immigrants, we are not expecting the President to put up much of a fight.  So for a few weeks now, I have been telling people to prepare for the end of DACA, maybe as soon as You can watch the speech on Facebook or A lot of Trump supporters got angry about what I said on They didn't even take the time to watch or listen to my speech, no. They got fired up by Breitbart, the only publication I can count on to cover everything I say.  Breitbart said I was unhinged and said in the headline that I said it is time to eliminate Trump and bring him to his knees. The Washington Times didn't watch the speech but saw Breitbart's fair and balanced coverage and said I threatened Trump with physical violence.  FOX News then echoed the idea that evening, saying I was threatening violence and would bring our violent movement to every neighborhood in So by the time you got to The Daily Stormer--that whipped cream on top of the White Nationalists/Neo-Nazi banana split--they cited the FOX News story and read the headline, ``Subversive Beanman Luis Gutierrez Calls for Trump's Elimination.''  If FOX, Breitbart, and Daily Stormer report something, it has got to be true, I thought. So I went back to the video to see if I had threatened to assassinate the  And you know what? I didn't. Here is what I said this past Saturday: ``I am going to make sure that I am there, to make sure of one thing, that we write those articles of impeachment and take the Trump administration to trial before the Senate and eliminate him as President of the United He cannot fire Comey, threaten to fire Mueller, and say `I am the king,' `I am a dictator.' ''  This is the quote, and I clearly am talking about the impeachment process, which I believe to be nonviolent. I mean, former President Bill Clinton went through it, and he is still alive. In fact, in shorthand, I am saying we should go through regular order.  And that is nothing new for me. I have stood on this floor and called on the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to begin the process of hearings and witnesses, just as the Senate Judiciary Committee is doing, because that is our job.  Just a moment. Later in the speech, I said: ``This is a democracy, and we will make democracy work. We will make it work for everyone, whether you are gay, straight, Brown, White, documented or undocumented, we are going to make sure democracy works for you . . . '' Meaning the people packed in the church that day, and really everyone else.  I continued saying: ``And we are starting here this afternoon at this marvelous church in Get ready. Our movement is coming somewhere in your neighborhood.''  So what Breitbart imagined as an incitement to violence was really a call to action for people to get involved in their democracy, which, last time I looked, is still a form of government we aspire to in this country, and it is still nonviolent.  But my favorite part of the Breitbart headline and the whole bloodthirsty Brown people motif that drove the coverage from Breitbart to FOX to Daily Stormer is that I said I wanted to bring President Trump to his knees.  But what I actually said was, Gandhi, by employing the techniques and practices of nonviolent resistance, brought[[Page H6302]]the British Empire to its knees. Which is actually true, and we should learn from his example.  Indeed, King, a disciple of Gandhi, applied those strategies to the American civil rights movement to great success. And were it not for King and the other heroes who laid down their lives during the civil rights movement, I would not be standing here before you, and we wouldn't even be standing up or talking about The Daily Stormer, Breitbart, or Trump in defending immigrants and other vulnerable communities.  So we owe the civil rights movement a great debt. I want to follow in those footsteps.  So I read the headlines in Breitbart and I went back to look at what I actually said. You know what? I stand by it and I won't back down.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-26-pt1-PgH6301-4.txt,478,COUNTERING IRAN'S DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES ACT OF 2017,2017.0,26.0,June

The brazen and reckless manner in which this bill was first brought to the floor is evidence that my friends across the aisle have still not figured out how to govern. The learning curve may be steep, but it is not that steep.  Quite simply, my friends, it is time for you to start governing responsibly, not with closed rules and martial law, without hearings, and without CBO scores, but through regular order, with an opportunity for all Members and, through them, their constituents to take part in legislating. The White House may be in chaos, but that is no reason for the House to legislate in a similar manner.  For the good of the country, we must return to regular order. We must work to ensure that those serving in the intelligence community are able to do their best work, to do it as safely as possible, and to do it knowing that they will receive the respect they deserve from all branches of their government. I worry that they, increasingly, do not receive this respect, and that this disrespect, should it continue, will make it more difficult for us to retain and recruit the talent we so desperately need to protect our national security.  Of course, the intelligence community is only one part of our national security apparatus. The men and women in our military are an equally important part of maintaining our national security. And, unfortunately, we learned just yesterday that these brave servicemembers are not immune from baseless attacks from the administration.  It was announced, on the 69th anniversary of President Truman's issuing an executive order that desegregated the Armed Forces, that transgender servicemembers would no longer be able to serve in the military. Were these individuals, numbering between 10,000 and 15,000, banned because they are not brave, because they are not patriotic, because they are incapable of meeting the rigorous requirements of being in the military? No, they have been banned because bigotry defeated decency yesterday, and they have been banned because of who they are.  As I mentioned the other evening, I had three uncles who were in the They served proudly. They served bravely. They served in a segregated Two of them received purple hearts.                              {time}  1000  It was a great offense that they had to serve in a segregated Army in which they were made to feel that somehow their bravery, their patriotism, and their devotion to their brothers in arms was somehow less because of the color of their skin.  President Truman knew this was wrong, and he ended it. Simply put, President Truman knew then what our current President is incapable of understanding today: the strength of our military is not found in the race or the religion or the creed or the sex or the gender identity of its servicemembers, but rather in the bravery and honor exhibited by these individuals on a daily basis. They, like all of us here today, are proud citizens of this country. They, like all of us here today, are God's children.

709,topic-id,676,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague, who is an excellent person to work with. We enjoy each other and enjoy working together. We are getting a lot done, and I appreciate his kind remarks here today.  I rise today in support of the nomination of Robert Lighthizer to be the next United States Trade Mr.Lighthizer was reported out of the Finance Committee unanimously--Democrats and Republicans--and I hope he receives a similarly strong bipartisan vote here on the floor.  By statute, Congress has designated the USTR as the primary official for developing and coordinating U.trade policy, advising the President on trade, and leading international trade negotiations. The USTR must also report directly to and consult closely with Congress on a wide range of issues affecting international commerce. The USTR is Congress's first and most important point of contact when it comes to trade policy. Therefore, in order for Congress to have an effective voice in shaping our Nation's trade agenda, we need to have a fully staffed and functional USTR office.  For that reason, I have been very critical of the pointless and unprecedented delays we have faced in filling this vacancy, in filling this position, due to some unreasonable demands from some of my friends on the other side of the aisle. This delay has served only to weaken Congress's position in trade policy and has hampered our ability to provide the new administration with substantive input. Despite this ill-advised delay, I am pleased that Mr.Lighthizer's nomination has finally been brought to the floor, and I thank my colleagues for that.  Mr.Lighthizer's years of experience in public service, including as staff director for the Senate Finance Committee, as Deputy USTR during the Reagan administration, and in private practice, make him extremely well qualified to serve as our Nation's representative. Mr.Lighthizer's knowledge and experience will be vital to his service in this position and vital to our country.  Put simply, growing our economy and creating better paying jobs for American workers require increased U.trade. Toward that end, I have spoken to Mr.Lighthizer about the importance of removing trade barriers for American businesses, workers, consumers, and, where those barriers have already been removed, maintaining the status quo.  I know there is quite a bit of discussion going around about potential changes to the North American Free Trade As I told Mr.Lighthizer, there are definitely opportunities to update and improve NAFTA, but it is important that the administration follow the spirit of the Hippocratic Oath: First do no harm.  Mr.Lighthizer and I have also discussed the importance of protecting U.intellectual property rights around the globe through strong enforcement and better rules in trade agreements. I believe he recognizes the importance of this priority, and I will work to ensure that this issue plays a prominent role in our future trade negotiations.  I have also made clear to Mr.Lighthizer that I believe consultation on trade policy between Congress and the administration is essential, particularly if our agreements are going to adhere to the standards Congress put forward in the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, the statute that included the most recent reauthorization of trade promotion authority.  On this key point, I believe Mr.Lighthizer and I are in agreement. As U.Trade Representative, Mr.Lighthizer will have the task of holding our trading partners accountable, ensuring that Americans don't pay more for the products their families need and helping American businesses and workers sell more of their goods and services around the globe.  This is not an easy job, but I am confident that Mr.Lighthizer is up to the task. As chairman of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over our Nation's trade policy, I am committed to working with him to ensure that we advance a trade agenda that will grow our economy, create more jobs, and expand market access around the globe for America's farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers.  Mr.President, I suggest we vote on Mr. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING All postcloture time has expired.  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Lighthizer nomination?

702,topic-id,759,"Madam President, these are not ordinary times. It is not ordinary for a winning Presidential campaign to be under investigation for collusion with a foreign adversary to influence our 2016 election and undermine our democracy. It isn't ordinary for a President to fire the man responsible for conducting this very investigation. It isn't ordinary for a President whose campaign is under investigation for having ties to Russia to hold an Oval Office meeting with that country's Foreign Minister and only invite the Russian press. This meeting came only a day after firing the person in charge of the Russia-Trump investigation. Yet, here we are. The question is, What should we do next?  The events of the past 48 hours have been shocking and concerning. Firing FBI Director James Comey in this manner, under this pretext, and at this time is a total disservice to the American people.  President Trump hopes the American people will believe he fired Director Comey because of how he treated Hillary Clinton during the Presidential campaign. President Trump hopes, as his Deputy Press Secretary said on Tuesday night, that the American people think it is ``time to move on.'' President Trump hopes his attempts to distract us from the importance of getting to the bottom of the Russia-Trump matter will succeed. President Trump's hopes are misplaced. If anything, President Trump's firing of Director Comey has resulted in an increased concern about the Trump team's connections to Russian interference with our 2016 Presidential election.  The country is asking, Mr.President, what do you have to hide?  We are learning practically on an hourly basis about how the President made this decision to fire Director Comey and why. This information does not square with the official line coming from the White House, which also changes.  Most recently, the Washington Post reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein threatened to resign after the White House misrepresented his role in the decision to fire Director CNN reported that President Trump fired Director Comey because he would not provide ``assurance of personal loyalty.'' Both CNN and the Wall Street Journal reported that the decision to fire Director Comey came after the FBI's investigation was accelerating. All of this information has emerged in the last 48 hours or so.  This kind of Presidential interference, through the firing of the FBI Director during an ongoing investigation, is unprecedented, suspicious, and deeply concerning. These revelations and those that are sure to come further argue in favor of appointing a special prosecutor to fully investigate the Russia-Trump matter. A special prosecutor with full autonomy can follow the evidence wherever it leads and prosecute as appropriate.  I call upon Republicans of conscience to stand up and join the call for a special prosecutor.  Over the past few days, a number of my Republican colleagues have spoken out against the way the President had fired James In particular, I would like to acknowledge Senators McCain, Sasse, Flake, Burr, Kennedy, Boozman, and Corker for speaking out. I hope, as more information about President Trump's decision to fire Director Comey emerges, our Republican colleagues will join in the call for a special prosecutor.  Leader McConnell argued yesterday that appointing a special prosecutor would disrupt the ongoing work of the Senate committees that are conducting their own investigations. I disagree. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Judiciary Committee have important oversight responsibilities regarding the Russia-Trump matter, but neither committee has the power to convene a grand jury or prosecute any crimes that may have been committed. Therefore, I reiterate the need for a special prosecutor with the mandate and authority to follow the facts wherever they lead--free of political considerations.  In the coming weeks, President Trump will nominate a new Director for the This person must be above reproach and be someone whose independent judgment can earn the country's confidence. I have been disturbed by some of the names being floated as potential replacements, names like Chris Christie and Rudy We cannot allow President Trump to appoint one of his buddies to oversee the Russia-Trump investigation or to lead the  The investigation into the Russia-Trump matter cannot and should not be a partisan issue. We should all care that a foreign government has sought to interfere with our elections and with our democracy. This is not just about the election. This is really about protecting our democracy.

691,topic-id,2004,"Mr.President, first of all, I appreciate the comments made by my colleague from North It is even more meaningful to me because all during the time the regulations were coming on, I happened to be the one who was chairing the Environment and Public Works Committee, and we knew what was going to happen.  I am almost speechless when I think about the success. We went 20 years only taking up 1 CRA, and then we end up passing 14 of them--all but 1. That is a huge, successful record. My colleagues understand, this gives us the opportunity for people who are answerable to the public--people who are elected and have to stand for elections--to have a part in what is sometimes considered to be the action of an unelected bureaucrat.  We have had great opportunities here. I think the ``midnight'' regulations--a term that is used quite often--so that a party going out of office, such as President Obama, being very liberal--a very proud liberal, I might add--wanted to get as many of his rules in at the last minute. We were able to come in and pass these in the time required. We were able to pass 14 of these, in addition to the other regulations and other methods of doing regulations, which I want to address a little bit. It is just not something that we really anticipated would happen.  Now, I am particularly proud because mine was the first CRA to be passed in 20 years, and that was the very first one that came from what President Obama wanted having to do with the oil and gas industry, but the fact that nothing passed in that long period of time just shows now that people are recognizing that we who stand for election should be involved in this process of doing away with these regulations.  Now, the rule that I brought to the floor, which was the first one the President signed--we had a great signing ceremony and I enjoyed it very much--was the one that affected the oil and gas industry. It was an SEC ruling of the Obama administration that said that if you are a domestic producer of oil and gas--of course, that is the private sector--you have to release all of the information you are using in producing a bid against maybe another country. To use an example, in China, it is not in the private sector like it is in the United Their oil and gas business is in the public sector so they would have a distinct advantage. Quite frankly, it is consistent with what the previous President--President Obama--was doing in his war on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are coal, oil, and gas, and he was very proud to be opposed to coal, oil, and gas, and frankly nuclear too.  I have often wondered--I go back to Oklahoma virtually every weekend that I don't have to be in one of the war zones or someplace like that. I go there really for my therapy because they ask questions that make sense. We don't get these questions in One of them I remember was in Shattuck, When I was there, somebody said: Explain this to me. We have a President who wants to do away with fossil fuels and he wants to do away with nuclear energy. Now, we are dependent upon fossil fuels, coal, oil and gas, and nuclear energy for 89 percent of the power it takes to run this machine called If he is successful in doing away with it, how do we run this machine called America?  Well, I am proud to say that the war against fossil fuels is over. The particular CRA I sponsored came out of the Dodd-Frank  By the way, overregulation is overregulation. When I talk to people back in my State of Oklahoma, if they are in[[Page S2896]]the banking business or the financial services business, they are concerned about the overregulation that comes from Dodd-If they are farmers, they are concerned about the regulation that would take the jurisdiction of regulating our water resources out of the States and putting it in the Federal So that is what this is all about.  So I will tell you how serious this was. The CRA that I had was so significant that the Federal courts came in, in July of 2013, and said that the SEC made several errors in rushing this regulation through. They actually vacated the rule. That was a major accomplishment. I was very proud that I had the courts on my side, for a change.  Anyway, the SEC finalized the second rule under the authority of Dodd-Frank, section 1504, by making some--without any really substantial changes. Nonetheless, this is the one that he first signed.  So thanks to the Congressional Review Act, oil and gas companies are not at a disadvantage when they are competing with State-owned oil and gas companies such as we have in  We passed other critical CRAs because regulations tied the hands of our businesses and took local control away from the A lot of people in America--and I think a higher percentage of my people in Oklahoma--are really concerned about Second Amendment rights. Of course, we had one of the regulations that went through--in fact, Second Amendment rights, when we talk about the farmers and the ranchers and not just from my State of Oklahoma--we are a farm State--but throughout America, they will tell you that there are problems. Their 1 concern was--and I asked the Farm Bureau representative. He said the greatest problem facing farmers is not anything that is found in the ag bill, it is the overregulation by the EPA and specifically what they call the WOTUS bill. The WOTUS bill, which is the one I just mentioned, would take the jurisdiction away from the State and give it to the Federal  I have to say this. When you talk about ``liberals,'' that is not a negative term. It is a reality. It is how much power should be in the hands of the Federal bureaucrats as opposed to individuals and the So we have a lot of these regulations. One of the things the CRA has done is, it has taken away an excuse that people will use--I am talking about people in this Chamber who are legitimately liberals and believe we should have more control in Washington--it takes the power away from the Federal bureaucrats because what they can do is go ahead and pass the regulations. Then you go back home and when people are yelling and screaming about being overregulated back in their home States, they say: Don't blame me, blame the unelected bureaucrats. A CRA takes away that excuse because it forces them to actually get on record.  So as chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, we were involved with more of these regulations than any other committee because that is what we do for a living there. So I was very happy to see all of the successes we had.  Let me just mention because I don't think it has been mentioned before--and I will submit this for the There are two ways of doing away with these regulations, and one is through Executive orders. I think everybody knows that. But they don't realize what has already been done. I think we have had a total of 30, 31 regulations that have been done away with either through Executive orders or through the Congressional Review Some of the Executive orders, for example, are the WOTUS, the one we have been talking about; clean energy, something which repeals the Clean Power Plan and something which officially ended the war on fossil fuels, I might add; the Executive order on rebuilding the military; the Executive order on the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines--we are all familiar with that and the ongoing debate.  Some of the CRAs really aren't talked about too much, and we are talking about regulations that came from the Obama administration that now have been done away with through use of CRAs--the educational rule mandating Federal standards for evaluating teacher performance; the educational rule establishing a national school board, with an effort to get away from local control of the schools; the Interior rule that blocked Alaska from controlling their own hunting and fishing in that beautiful State; the Social Security rule that put seniors on a gun ban list--Second Amendment rights.  All of these things are very significant, and I am very proud, quite frankly, of this body. With the exception of one, we passed all 14 of the CRAs, and I can't think of any time that has been done in the past. So it is a great thing. It did put the power back in the hands of the people who are elected here, and I am very glad to have been a participant in that.

812,topic-id,2996,"Mr.President, first of all, let me say that I am really glad the junior Senator from Georgia has taken this on. This is something that some of us who have been around a little bit longer have gone through before.  I think everyone realizes that what was attempted to be done by President Obama was a single-payer system. Ultimately, that is what liberals want. I remember back in the 1990s what was referred to at that time as Hillary healthcare during the Clinton administration. I remember so well the efforts that were taking place.  Sometimes I go back to my State of Oklahoma just to be around logical people, and they will ask the question: If this system is not working in Canada, is not working in Sweden, and is not working in Great Britain, why do they think it will work here? Liberal individuals will never tell you this, but what they are really thinking is this: It would work if I were running the show.  So we are going through a similar thing again, and I am so happy we have leaders, as the occupier of the Chair,[[Page S3543]]and we have more doctors right now in the This is the time to make these changes and really accomplish things. But that is not why I am here.                   Climate Change and Paris Agreement  Mr.President, I noticed in the news this morning one more of these incidents happened where they had groups of people going to either the Antarctic or the Arctic to try to reaffirm their positions that somehow the world is coming to an end because of global warming and global warming is because of manmade gases, which, of course, we know is not the case. The interesting thing about yesterday was that a group of some scientists, some individuals, and some environmental extremist activists was going to the Arctic to show that things were melting, and they got stuck in the ice. This is the fourth time this has happened in the last 4 years because they didn't anticipate the fact that we have actually some areas where it is increasing.  I thought, well, it is time to make one last compliment to the President when he had the courage to pull out of the Paris climate agreement.  A lot of people don't know what these climate agreements are. This was the 21st year we had a climate agreement. It was all started by the United Nations some 21 years ago. The idea was to go to exotic places around the world and invite all 192 countries to come in to convince them that they need to reduce their own greenhouse gases, their CO2 emissions.  Toward the end of the Obama administration, after eight such meetings they decided this wasn't going to work. They finally decided they would go ahead and try to make one look like an agreement, and, hence, there was the Paris Agreement--not a treaty but an agreement, not anything that would come through ratification, obviously.  I have been over there for some of these meetings. What is interesting about this is that most of the 192 countries involved in these meetings think that if the President says something, it is going to happen. They forget about the fact that we have another branch of government called Congress, and we have to ratify some of these decisions.  So I do want to make a couple of comments about what the President has accomplished by getting out of this agreement.  First, since there is a deliberate effort to make people who are reluctant to believe one narrow view, in terms that the world is coming to an end is a reality, they try to make it change into the argument that as to climate change, anyone who is against the idea that we are having these problems out there is opposed to the idea of climate change.  Look, we have said so many times on the floor that the climate has always changed. All the evidence--historic evidence, scriptural evidence, archeological evidence--shows very clearly that climate is always changing. The arrogance is that somehow climate change can be managed by man. Did man ever cause the ice age or any of the other extreme weather patterns the Earth has seen just over the last few thousand years? The answer is no.  But earlier this year, a climate change study was released which found that little agreement is found with climate modeling simulations and consistently overstate recent summer warming and underestimate preindustrial temperature changes. That was the study. It is no surprise they found forecasts to be inaccurate. According to the environmental extremists, every summer is going to be the hottest. I have yet to see a summer that wasn't going to be the hottest. Every year they say that is going to take place.  In one of the charts from the study I have here, all you have to do is go back and look historically at what has happened in this country. We go through warming periods. We go through ice ages. I will tell you what is interesting about this chart. The largest increase we had in global warming happened right after World War II, in 1945. That was the year we had the largest number of CO2 emissions that took place. Historically, no one disagrees. That precipitated not a warming period but a 20-year cooling period. So we have been going through this for a very long period of time now.  Essentially, the findings of the study show that the climate patterns we see now are not significant in the grand scheme of things, as we can see by this chart. People like to vilify those of us who talk about this subject and openly question the inaccurate statements and so-called findings of fearmongering scientists who tell everyone the world is ending because of manmade gases. They think that just because many of us recognize that science is not settled and we question exactly how much man affects climate change, corruption must be involved, and so forth.  But we look at the real science. I have not yet met him personally, but I know about a guy named Richard Richard Lindzen is an MIT professor. He arguably could be considered the most knowledgeable person in this field. He made this statement: Regulating CO2 is a bureaucrats dream. If you regulate CO, you regulate life. So that is what is behind this, and we have watched this play out now for about 20 years. To question the idea that man is single-handedly responsible for the changes in climate and doomsday is near due to the fact that we burn fossil fuels is entirely inappropriate and, frankly, unnecessary.  I remember very well a climate fanatic named Michael I mentioned that Paris was the 21st meeting the United Nations has had. In 2009, that meeting was held in At that time, I chaired the Environment and Public Works The first year of the Obama administration, I remember getting ready to go to Copenhagen to explain to people they had been lied to. At that time, Obama was going over, Hillary Clinton was going over, John Kerry was going over, and all the rest, saying we in the United States were going to pass cap and trade. I wanted to make sure they knew we were not going to be passing cap and trade.  I was getting ready to go over. Lisa Jackson was the first Obama designee to be the Director of the I looked at her, and I said: I have a feeling that as soon as I leave town, you are going to have an endangerment finding so you can start regulating this stuff. She kind of smiled. I said: When that happens, it has to be based on science. So tell me, what science will you base this on? She said: Well, it is going to be based on the  IPCC stands for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate That is the United  As luck would have it, right after that, a matter of days after that statement was made by her, we had climategate. Do you remember climategate? Not many people remember it because the media didn't play it up here like they did in Europe and around the world. Climategate was where they caught two scientists--one was Michael Mann and one was Phil Jones--who had rigged--there was evidence of this through communications that were disclosed--they were actually rigging the science. They didn't pay much attention to it here in the United States, but I remember at the time that Christopher Booker of the UK Telegraph--that is one of the biggest communication operations in the UK--they called this the worst scientific scandal of our generation. That is climategate. That is cooking the books on science to make people believe things that weren't true.  Clive Cook of the Financial Times said:       The close-mindedness of these supposed men of science,      their willingness to go to any lengths to defend a      preconceived message, is surprising, even to me. The stink of      intellectual corruption is overpowering.  That is the science on which they have relied for a long period of time. In fact, to give you an example of the hockey stick--that was what Michael Mann came up with in trying to show, instead of what we are showing on this chart here, that somehow this all happened in a recent period of time. It is another research exploration that was wrong.  I started off talking about what happened on the climate change research exploration that just took place in the last few days. Many of these were postponed in the Arctic because of the unusual amount of ice that has taken place. Before a research team could embark on their exploration to study climate change--keep in mind, this group went there to try to show what things are happening, that ice is melting all over the world. Their ship, the Canadian research icebreaker Amundsen, had to be borrowed by the Canadian Coast Guard for search and rescue[[Page S3544]]efforts to help fishing boats and supply ships that were trapped in the unexpected, large amount of ice.  This is at least the fourth time this has happened in recent years to research ships around the world. There was a situation a few years ago where a Russian ship carrying climate scientists and journalists and activists and tourists and an entire crew became trapped in ice that was at least 10 feet thick. An Australian icebreaker arrived 6 days later to rescue them, but it was unable to do so because of the ice. A few days after that, a Chinese icebreaker sent out a helicopter that was able to airlift 52 of the passengers from the Russian ship to safety on the Australian icebreaker. Unfortunately, during the rescue effort, the Chinese icebreaker became trapped as well.  I tell you these stories because all of these expeditions that were going to the various posts were doing so to try to prove that ice was not accumulating, and they got stuck in the ice.  Most of the predictions that have been published over the last few decades have been widely inaccurate, but most have been accepted by the environmental groups and some of the extremists because they are maintaining their war on fossil fuels, although Trump has ended that.  I have to say that one of the reasons I go back to my State of Oklahoma every weekend is to talk to real people. They will ask a question. I remember that during the Obama administration, he had a war on fossil fuels--fossil fuels are coal, oil, and gas--but he also didn't like nuclear. You don't get these questions asked in They asked me: Inhofe, explain this to me. We have a President who is trying to do away with fossil fuels--coal, oil, and gas--and nuclear, and we are currently dependent upon coal, oil, gas, and nuclear for 89 percent of the power it takes to run this machine called What is going to happen if we are not able to do it?  Of course, as I said, you don't hear those questions around  Anyway, by fearmongering techniques, environmental extremists and the Al Gore fan club can easily convince a large number of people that regulatory burdens like the EPA's Clean Power Plan, the Quad Oa, the venting and flaring rules, and the waters of the United States rule are a good thing and that we can save the Earth without any consideration of the effect these rules have on energy.  By the way, for any conservatives who are out there, I would like to remind them that even though it didn't get much play in the media, this President in the first 100 days in office has been able to do away with some 47 of the regulations. The two ways of doing away with a regulation--one is through Executive order, and the other is the CRA, the Congressional Review In fact, I was proud that the first signing ceremony our new President had was signing a bill that I had passed. It is one that has really made an effort to try to save enough of the oil and gas industry to run this machine, as I mentioned, called  Now we are actively working to face the problems inherited from the previous administration. For the past 8 years under the Obama administration, the American economy suffered under the effects of his climate agenda. That era is over. President Trump has delivered on his campaign promises since he was sworn in. The strongest signal of this was President Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord.  It was just a few weeks ago that I was on the Senate floor urging President Trump to pull out of this Paris That same day, 21 of my Senate colleagues and I sent a letter to the White House with that same request. Our message resonated with the President, and it was clear that our voices were heard because it was exactly 1 week later that the President announced to the world he was getting out of a bad deal.  Let me mention one thing about this Paris The Paris Agreement supposedly is something that 192 countries--each said what it was going to do to reduce greenhouse gases, their CO2 emissions. For example, the agreement President Obama said at that time--he said: We commit that we will reduce our CO2 emissions by between 26 and 28 percent by 2096.  The interesting thing about that is that it can't be done. In fact, immediately after he made that statement, we had a televised public hearing of the EPA to ask them how in the world we could reduce by some 27 percent greenhouse gases in the United States of They said it is impossible and we couldn't do it. So what the President was doing then was telling people that we in the United States were able to do something--were going to do something that was very meaningful by our reduction, even though he knew at the time it could not be done.  Then we have the other countries--China, for example. China is the second largest emitter of Currently, as we speak right now, they are cranking out one coal-fired powerplant every 10 days. What did they agree to in this Paris accord? They said: Well, we will continue to increase our output in We will continue to have a new powerplant every 10 days or so until 2025. At that time, we will consider reducing it.  Then along comes India, the third largest emitter of India said: Yes, as long as we get $2.5 trillion, we are willing to do it. Well, where would that $2.5 trillion come from? The good old United The big green fund.  That is how ridiculous that whole thing was. It was the right decision for him to make this a reality.  Many believe that if we lose our ability to negotiate with other nations--this is the only legitimate complaint I have gotten that I really heard during the time. They said: Well, if we don't have a place at the table, then we are not going to be able to be in on any future discussions.  That was wrong, and those who are using that argument were wrong because the agreement that gave us a seat at the table has already been ratified by the United States, meaning the Senate gave its advice and consent. It is known as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate This was in the 1992 treaty that supports all of the big parties that are held every We are still at that table. That decision was made a long period of time ago. We will be at any future activities that take place.  I will wrap up by saying that this was the right thing to do. Stop and think about it. The previous speaker on the floor, the junior Senator from Georgia, was talking about the dilemma we have in this country, the spending dilemma, and how we are going to have to do something about it. We are going to eventually have to get to some of the entitlements, the big spending items.  If we had stayed with the program that the President had outlined and had committed to the other 192 countries, that would have constituted arguably the largest single tax increase in the history of America, and there would have been nothing that would have been accomplished by it.  My final thought. I would like to thank President Trump for pulling out of the Paris It is the right decision, and it will without question help the United States in the long run.

1006,topic-id,803,"Mr.President, as we begin the markup--that is what we are going to be starting on right away. We have already had an initial meeting with the Senate Armed Services Committee on the National Defense Authorization I want to express my deep concern over the continued malign behavior by the overtly hostile nation of North  I often talk to people, and they shake their heads in disbelief about a country that is run by a mentally deranged individual who is rapidly developing the capability of hitting the mainland United States with a missile. I think it is important that we immediately get to our Defense authorization bill, so we can start addressing this and many other problems that we have.  It is important to us in the Senate to communicate to the American people the incredibly grave situation we are facing right now in North The Kim Jong Un regime has expressed a desire to destroy the United States of Normally that wouldn't be a concern because he wouldn't have the credibility, but right now we are seeing progress being made in their technology and their ability to actually hit major areas.  In April, North Korea's official newspaper relayed the threat of a preemptive strike to ``completely and immediately wipe out not only U.imperialists' invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U.mainland and reduce them to ashes.''  That is a threat--a threat that has come directly from the leader of North This is the most recent in a long line of threats by that individual.  In addition, North Korean leaders constantly threaten our friends and allies in South Korea and These threats are not just hollow words any longer. North Korea's capabilities are rapidly improving to meet their long-stated intent.  We thought that Kim Jong Il was bad, but in 6 years, his son Kim Jong Un has conducted as many as 75 ballistic missile tests. In comparison, over a 17-year period, his father conducted about 30. In other words, he has done over twice as many in a fraction of the time.  Additionally, Kim Jong Un has sped up North Korea's nuclear program since taking power in 2011. North Korea's nuclear technology is advancing at an alarming rate. For example, the bomb North Korea tested in its most recent test last September was 10 times more powerful than what the regime could have produced in 2006--10 times more.  At the same time, North Korea has actively worked on miniaturizing nuclear weapons so that they can deliver by way of a ballistic missile. Earlier this year, analysts detected activity at a North Korean nuclear test site, indicating another nuclear test may be imminent.  Intelligence and military experts have repeatedly argued that it is prudent to assume that North Korea has successfully miniaturized their nuclear weapons. That means the only technology they need to conduct a nuclear strike on the U.mainland--that is us; that is right here--would be a functional intercontinental ballistic missile, or  In January, Kim Jong Un said North Korea is in the ``final stage in preparations.''  Let's make sure we understand what we are talking about. We know that their capability is getting very close to it, and they have already said that they would send something over to the mainland United  Unfortunately, when you talk to people in the real world, they can't believe this could be true--that one guy who is mentally deranged could be heading up a country that has the capability of blowing up an American city. Yet we know this is going on right now.  Recently, in the Armed Services Committee--and I was in attendance at that time--the Defense Intelligence Agency Director, Vincent Stewart, told the Armed Services Committee: ``If left on its current trajectory the [North Korean] regime will ultimately succeed in fielding a nuclear-armed missile capable of threatening the United States homeland.''  That is a direct quote by the guy who knows more about this than anybody else. Lieutenant General Stewart added that ``the North Korean regime is committed and is on a pathway where this capability is inevitable.''  I will say that again. Our intelligence experts assessed that, unchecked, North Korea will inevitably achieve the capability to strike the U.homeland with a nuclear missile.[[Page S3714]]  Even without the ICBM capability, the missiles we know they already have can range U.S.--that means it can reach the United States--military personnel and other citizens in South Korea, Japan, Guam, and many other areas.  North Korea's known missile inventory now includes a missile that North Korea successfully tested for the first time on May 14. That missile represented a major breakthrough in North Korean ballistic missile technology. The reports indicate the missile traveled over 1,300 miles at an altitude and successfully exited and then reentered the Earth's atmosphere--a key requirement for nuclear capable ICB",CREC-2017-06-22-pt1-PgS3713-2.txt,583,REAUTHORIZING THE HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HISTORIC,2017.0,22.0,June

I appreciate his courtesy, and I will pay him back.  Ironically, I am thanking him for giving me time to make a speech I have never wanted to make. In fact, I have three times canceled the time I had asked for to make this speech in the last month because when it came time to make it and I opened those doors to come down here, I couldn't quite do it. I couldn't quite do it because, every once in a while, something happens in your career with a loved one or friend or cohort who is so close to you and so meaningful to you that to talk about it is an emotional thing to do.  Such is the occasion tonight for me to pay tribute to Stefanie Mohler, who is my scheduler and has been for years. She came to work for me when I was a Member of the She has worked for me time and again in the U.Senate, except for the one time she left me to go work for George Bush--and I understand that.

She had a wonderful family and lived at home with her folks. She applied for a job as a scheduler for me and came to work for us.  I ran a pretty large company. I had about 1,000 independent contractors and 250 employees. I know a good worker when I see one. Stefanie was the best. But she had that quality beyond just being the best. She cared about every single thing she did and every single person whom she helped and every single person whom she couldn't help. She grew in the job, and she made me a better Congressman and, later, a better  She came to me about 18 months ago and said: I have some news for you. I am pregnant. I am pregnant with identical twins.  I was so excited for her and her husband because she wanted more than anything else in the world to have a family. My wife and I had a party for her at Christmas in December, and the two babies came in the early part of this year. They are beautiful. She is a wonderful mother. But she has stayed, and she has worked. Her mom has come in and helped her do the chores at home as she continued to fulfill her commitment to me.

You also know what it looks like to see somebody who is in love. You can't describe it, but there is a glow. It is just something that is there.  I was in Jacksonville, FL, with Saxby Chambliss, waiting to come back to Washington when Stefanie was[[Page S4019]]coming back from taking Chase to meet her family in When she turned the corner in an airport concourse coming toward the planes, I could tell from the glow on her face and the look on her face that something special had happened in her life.  I said: Stefanie, what are you so happy about?  She said: I have found a husband. I am going to marry him. He asked me to marry him.  I was so happy for her and so happy for Chase because I had met him. They had dated while she was working in my office and later married. Chase works for the State Department and has been serving here in But he got a promotion, and he is going to the North Carolina coast, and he is going to take Stefanie with him.  I am losing the best person I have ever had doing what Stefanie has done for me. He married the best person I have ever seen, and she is doing everything in the world for him.  So I thought I would come to the floor tonight, not to list the accolades--which I could in the thousands--not to say all those platitudes we always love to hear said about ourselves or about somebody important, but to make a confession. I am in love. I am in love with Stefanie Mohler because for most of her adult life she gave her time and her effort to make me a better Member of the U.She supported my wife when she needed it, and I couldn't help. She supported our office when they needed it, and they couldn't help. She did all of the little things that you never ask someone to do because you think it is too little, but it is so important to make a difference in every day that goes by.  When she leaves in about 3 months, I am going to be sad. I will shed a tear or two. I will probably shed one for her before the night is over. But when she leaves, I want her to know and I want the whole Senate document to record that once in a while--every once in a while--somebody special comes along and makes a difference in your life, your effort, and your ability. Stefanie Mohler has been that for me. I will never forget her for all that she has done for me, and I will always be there for her if she ever needs me.

746,topic-id,480,"Mr.President, when a United States servicemember gives their life in service to their country, they often leave behind family who we are equally indebted. Ensuring that these survivors are provided every opportunity to succeed and get a quality education supports our values and upholds our promise to servicemembers and military families. Unfortunately, our ability to uphold our promise to dependents of servicemembers who were killed in action (KIA) in Iraq and Afghanistan following the attacks on September 11, 2001 was affected recently.  In May 2016 the U.Department of Education sent a letter to institutions of higher education requiring them to reduce the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant awards by 7% or roughly $400 per student. These grants are critical for students to use for tuition, books, and room and board and any future cut would be significant for a young college student. Many children and dependents of servicemembers who were KIA in Iraq and Afghanistan are now reaching college age so more and more students will not be receiving as much in grants as they should be getting and rightfully deserve.  Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleague Senator Tester the Protect our Gold Star Families' Education Act of 2017. This legislation will move the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant program to the Pell Grant program to stabilize the funding source for these awards and ensure Gold Star families have access to the maximum Pell Grant funding available if they previously did not qualify for Pell The program would maintain the same eligibility requirements under the existing Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants--parent or guardian having died as a result of military service in Iraq or Afghanistan after 9/11 and are 24 years old or younger--and the award would continue to equal the maximum Pell Grant for that award year.  While Virginia public universities already offer tuition assistance to dependents whose parents were killed in action or were permanently disabled under the state's Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program (VMSDEP), these funds could be used to offset tuition at private institutions and could also cover additional expenses, including room and board, books, and supplies. Over 500 Virginians have attended or are currently attending college at public universities with assistance through VMSDEP and would qualify for these Pell Grants as well.  Our Gold Star families have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country and ensuring they have access to a quality college education is the right thing to do. Moving the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant under the Pell Grant program will provide more security to Gold Star families and help ease the burden of college costs. As more of our post 9/11 Gold Star children are starting to reach college age, now is the right time to improve the grant system.

799,topic-id,1569,"Madam President, I rise to speak about the ongoing debate in the body concerning the next chapter in healthcare and what we can do about it together and, especially, to address one part of the healthcare market--the individual market.  As most know--and this has been an item about which we are deep into discussions, the people and the Members of this body--before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Americans with preexisting conditions faced unfair barriers to accessing health insurance coverage, and healthcare costs had risen rapidly. Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, my own family, which is probably like the healthiest family in America because the five of us have only had three hospitalizations for three childbirths--all for my wife--we had twice been turned down for insurance coverage for at least one member of our family because of preexisting conditions.  Since 2010, the rate of uninsured Americans has declined to a historic low. More than 20 million Americans have gained access to health insurance coverage--many for the first time in their lives. In Virginia, over 410,000 Virginians have accessed care on the individual marketplace and another 400,000 would be eligible if Virginia decided to expand  Many Virginians use the individual market, and they have shared their stories with me on my website. I have on my Senate website ``ACA Stories,'' where I encourage people to share their stories.  The individual marketplace, as folks know, is if you are buying health insurance, not through an employer, and you are buying individually--you may or may not be qualified for a subsidy--that particular marketplace is really important for people who aren't employed by companies that offer group plans, but it also has its challenges.

That September, my husband was diagnosed with      Parkinson's We are farmers, we raise the food for      As such, we are independently insured.[[Page S3529]]  They have no large employer to cover them.       Prior to finding a plan through the ACA in January 2015,      our monthly insurance premiums were to increase to nearly      $3,000 a month . . . yes, each MONTH! On top of that, our      health insurance had an annual cap on prescription coverage      of $5,000. The Humira that my daughter takes to combat her      Crohn's Disease retails for $3,800 a month, and that is not      the only medication she requires. So basically, after one      month, we reached the prescription coverage cap, meaning we      would have to pay $3,800 a month for medication on top of      $3,000 a month premiums. Who has an extra $6,800 a month to      pay for this? That is way more than we earn monthly as      farmers.       With the health insurance plan we got through the ACA, our      premiums for 2015 were $1,500 a month, less than half of what      we would have been paying under the previous plan. But the      real saving grace was no prescription cap, so my daughter's      medications are covered with a copay after we reach the      deductible. This is still a lot of money, but at least we can      treat our daughter's disease and hopefully keep her healthy.      And even though our premiums have gone up to nearly $2,000 a      month from $1,500 a month under the ACA, at least we can      still have insurance.  For families like Lauren's and Laura's, the individual marketplace is critical. But like Laura said, premiums are frequently too high. You have to have robust enrollment, competition, and certainty for premiums to come down.  Unfortunately, there has been increasing uncertainty in the individual market due to actions taken by the current administration. On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive order directing relevant agencies not to enforce key provisions of the Affordable Care Later in January, the administration terminated components of outreach and enrollment spending, including advertising to encourage people to enroll in the individual marketplace.  The administration has also repeatedly threatened to end cost-sharing reduction payments, which reduce costs for approximately 6 million people with incomes below 250 percent of the poverty level. These actions, these statements, these inactions, and this uncertainty have created uncertainty in the individual marketplace, leading to instability for insurance carriers, higher premiums, and reduced competition.  In Virginia, we have seen Aetna and United leave the individual marketplace, and they have cited this uncertainty created by this administration as the principal reason. In other States, there are counties that are at risk to have no insurers offering coverage on the marketplace in particular States or sometimes in regions in the  So this is a problem we can address, and we don't have to repeal the Affordable Care Act to do it. We just need to improve the Affordable Care Act, using a tool that has had bipartisan support in this body for some time.  So yesterday Senator Carper and I introduced the Individual Health Insurance Marketplace Improvement Act, and I want to thank the other original cosponsors of the bill: Senators Nelson, Shaheen, and  One way to address uncertainty is to use a common insurance tool, reinsurance--a permanent reinsurance program to help stabilize premiums and increase competition. The Affordable Care Act originally had a reinsurance program. It was temporary. It lasted for the first 3 years of the program, and it did hold premiums down. What we would do is that we would take that idea, which worked, and we would make it permanent. We would make it permanent and modeled after a very successful and bipartisan program: Medicare Part Medicare Part D provides a prescription drug benefit for seniors. It was passed with bipartisan support during the administration of President George Bush, now more than a decade ago, and the reinsurance program has helped hold down costs.  This reinsurance program would provide funding to offset larger than expected insurance claims for health insurance companies participating in State and Federal marketplaces. It would encourage them to offer more plans in a greater number of markets, thereby improving competition and driving down costs for patients and families. Basically, if reinsurance can cover high costs, an insurance company will know it has a backstop, which gives it a measure of stability, and also can set premiums at a more reasonable level for everyone.  The bill would also do one other thing that is important. It would provide $500 million a year from 2018 to 2020 to help States improve outreach and enrollment for the health insurance marketplaces, especially to draw in new members and educate the public--especially young people who are maybe moving just past their 26th birthdays and can no longer be contained on family policies--about the need to be insured. The outreach funding prioritizes counties where there are limited insurers left in the marketplace.  This is not the only improvement that is needed for our healthcare system. We need to do more to keep costs down, figure out a way to have prescription drugs be more affordable, and we can certainly use technology and data to drive better health outcomes, but this is a fix. It is a fix of an important part of our system, the individual market. It is a fix using an idea that has already worked and has already compelled the support of both Democrats and Republicans--reinsurance in Medicare Part This should be something Democrats and Republicans can agree to.  My worry is that we are participating now in a secretive effort to write a healthcare bill behind closed doors and possibly put it on the floor for a vote without hearing from a single patient, without hearing from a single provider, a hospital, a business that has a hard time buying insurance for its employees, an insurance company, or pharmaceutical company.  We ought to be debating these bills in the world's greatest deliberative body and proposing amendments and hearing from stakeholders and then doing the best job we can when we are dealing with the most important expenditure that anybody ever makes in their life, healthcare. Healthcare is also one of the largest segments of the American economy, one-sixth of the economy. Why would we want to pass a bill in secret?  Senator Carper, my colleagues, and I have introduced this bill as a good faith effort to say what I actually said when I first got on the HELP Committee in early January of 2015. There is a huge group of us just waiting for the door to open so that we can have a meaningful discussion about moving our system forward, and I believe this bill could be a very good part of stabilizing and improving the individual market and bringing relief to many  With that, I yield the floor.

1012,topic-id,2352,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about the healthcare bill that is currently pending before us. Now that I have had a chance to look at it a little bit, I can see why there has been a lot of secrecy surrounding this process.  Before talking about how I think this bill would hurt Virginians, let me talk about the process itself and how flawed I think it is. But the good news is that it is a process that can be fixed.  This morning, when the bill was first described on the floor, I was interested when my friend the senior Senator from Texas, the majority whip, said we were doing it this way, through a budget reconciliation process, because Democrats didn't want to work together. I took offense at that comment.  As the Presiding Officer knows, I am a member with him on the committee. I was just added to the committee in I have been in the Senate for 4 years. I have had great committees, but this is the committee I always wanted to be on because, as a former mayor and Governor, the two biggest line items in the budget I have had to deal with have been education and health. So, finally, I am on the committee I most want to be on.  I believe this session of the Senate started on January 3. That was my first day on the committee. I have a letter I wrote on January 5. I had been a committee member for 2 days, and I wrote a letter to my chairman, whom I hold in the highest regard, Senator Alexander; the Senate majority leader, Senator McConnell; and the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid and Medicare issues. I wrote a letter on January 5, and I got 13 Democrats, including me, to sign this letter.  The gist of the letter is this: We would like to work with you. We would like to work with you to find solutions that would improve our healthcare system, whether that be within the Affordable Care Act or, more broadly, Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare Part We want to work together.  That was on January 5, 2 days after I had been added to the committee. As a member of the committee, I have been given no opportunity--not one--to work on this bill.  The committee we serve on works productively. We work productively on pharmaceutical issues. We work productively on educational issues. In the committee the Presiding Officer and I serve on, we have passed legislation through our committee and sent it to the floor. Some of the legislation we have sent has already gone off the floor to the This is a committee that has a great bipartisan track record, and I am convinced that bipartisan track record is going to continue. But there has been one topic which has been taboo, and that has been to allow meaningful bipartisan discussion about this healthcare bill.  When the House bill passed--now a number of weeks ago--it was our expectation that we would have hearings in the HELP Committee and in the Finance Committee about the bill. We haven't. The Democrats on the HELP Committee got a little riled up one day. We were having a hearing about something else, and a lot of us said: Wait a minute. We are not talking about the biggest topic in domestic politics in the country right now, which is this House health bill. We should be doing that in this committee. If we are not doing it in this committee, we are really not doing it.  Why does it matter to have hearings in the committee? It is the committee hearing process where you put witnesses at a table and ask them questions. We would have patients, we would have hospitals, we would have doctors, we would have nurses, and we would have pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies, and we would ask them: What is good and what is bad about this bill? What is good and what is bad, and what needs to be fixed about healthcare in this country? That is what you do in hearings, but we haven't had one hearing, and the Finance Committee hasn't had one hearing either.  We haven't had hearings in the committee on the House bill. We have had no willingness to hold hearings on the Senate substitute that was revealed today. The effort to draft the bill was closed-door. The notion that Democrats wouldn't participate--we weren't invited to the meetings. We didn't know where they were. We didn't know when they were. We had no chance to participate. Now we are being told that this bill described this morning--and we thought we were reading it online--no, that is a discussion draft, not the bill itself. So I don't know whether the bill is going to be different, or is it the same? The notion is to rush it to the floor and then essentially to close off debate with a very meager amendment process.  The Presiding Officer knows this, but I just want to explain for the public. By not having committee hearings where you can talk to witnesses and hear from the public and then discuss and propose amendments, this is what it will be on the floor: 20 hours of debate about the most important topic in anybody's life--their health. Twenty hours and then you finish the debate.  Then, the majority leader indicates there is an unlimited amendment process, but the amendment process under budget reconciliation is as follows: An amendment will be considered, and there will be 1 minute of debate allowed for each side--1 minute.  We are talking about healthcare. We are talking about life and death. I have a number of bills I filed that I want to offer as amendments, but for us to truly debate it and for the American public to truly understand it, 1 minute is ridiculous. But that is apparently going to be the rule for us next week.  I think it is an outrage for a body that is known as the greatest deliberative body in the world to take up such an important topic and be told that it is in such a constrained way. So I just want to object to the characterization of the process this morning, that Democrats refuse to work together. I have evidence to the contrary. Within 48 hours of being put on this committee, I asked for an opportunity to participate in this debate. I think I am entitled to respect as an elected Member of this body and a member of the HELP Committee to be engaged on matters dealing with healthcare. But thus far, I have not had this opportunity, and that is so out of character for the HELP Committee, I might add.  I am going to be discussing this bill tomorrow with stakeholders in Richmond, where I live. Let me tell you what I see that really troubles me about the Senate bill. I think this bill hurts Virginians--especially seniors, children, people with disabilities, and working families--and it hurts them all to deliver giant tax breaks, largely to the wealthiest It also shifts costs from the Federal budget to the States, and as a former Governor, that worries me.  This bill would slash traditional Medicaid, which is a program that more than 1 million Virginians rely on. It is really important to point out that, when you are cutting Medicaid by potentially more than $1.3 trillion over 10 years, that is what the House bill cut out in Medicaid--the House bill plus President Trump's proposed budget, $1.3 trillion in cuts to Medicaid--and this bill could cut Medicaid even deeper by our reading of it.  You have to ask yourself, you cut Medicaid by that much--who are Medicaid recipients? In Virginia, nearly 60[[Page S3721]]percent of Medicaid recipients are children. Kids who are in public schools receiving special education, many of their services are paid for by A youngster undergoing a cancer operation at Children's Hospital of King's Daughters in Norfolk, a lot of that is being paid for by  A kid who has autism and is getting a couple of hours of autism-related services to help them be successful in school is paid by A child in a dangerous household who might have to get institutionalized--not because the child is doing something wrong but because there aren't parents in the household who are helping the household stay together, they are in danger of being institutionalized--Medicaid can send services a few hours a week into the household to stabilize the family so the child doesn't have to be institutionalized, and that is being paid by  When you cut Medicaid, that is whom you are affecting; 60 percent are children, 15 to 20 percent are people with disabilities. That is who is on Medicaid in Virginia; 10 to 15 percent are parents and grandparents in nursing homes and pregnant women. That is who is on Medicaid in  The Medicaid cuts in this bill are even steeper, even more significant than the cuts in the House bill. The bill would continue to allow something that I think is very challenging and that was a carryover from the House bill and may even be worse, which is the ability to charge older adults in the 55- to 64-year-old age range as much as five times higher than younger enrollees in the marketplace.  When most people are in the 55- to 64-year-old range, they are not necessarily at the peak of their earnings. Their earnings are often starting to come down a little bit. If you let their rates rise that dramatically, you are really hurting people who can't easily go back and reenter the marketplace and the workforce at the same level they could have when they were younger.  This is a bill that will hurt 22,000 Virginians who rely on Planned Parenthood for lifesaving healthcare. That is how many women in Virginia use Planned Parenthood as their primary doctor, as their primary physician--22,000, and this bill would hurt it.  This bill would weaken health benefits by reducing the essential health benefits contained in the Affordable Care Act, and that affects pregnancy, that affects mental health, that affects opioid treatment programs, and it would force States to make very difficult budget choices.  If you cut Medicaid by that much, you are going to make Governors and mayors decide: Whom do I cut? Do I cut the kids? Do I cut the disabled? Do I cut the elderly? Do I cut all three or do I raise taxes? You are just pushing this off on the shoulders of  There is good news. I want to finish with good news. I always try to finish or find some good news. There is good news. We can do this right. We don't have to do this wrong. It is actually really simple. When the Senate bill is truly ready, and it is not just a discussion draft but a real bill and it is put on the floor, all we have to do is refer the bill to the two committees--the Finance Committee and the HELP  Let the committees hear from the public, from providers, patients, doctors and nurses, and hospitals. Let members of the committee--Republicans and Democrats--ask questions. Let us propose amendments. Let us improve it.  This doesn't have to be a complete up-or-down. Why can't we have a meaningful discussion and ask questions and propose amendments in a deliberative way and improve the bill? It is not as if the Democratic minority can just roll over you. We are the minority in this body, and we are the minority on both the HELP and Finance Unless I can put an amendment on the table and convince some Republicans it is a good idea, my amendment is going to be voted down. If I can't convince somebody around the table this is a good idea, I will take it, and my amendment will be voted down. At least, let's have a meaningful discussion about the most important expenditure anybody ever makes in their life and the largest sector of the American economy.  What would be wrong, what could be wrong in letting the HELP Committee take a look at the healthcare bill? What would be wrong, what could be wrong with letting the Finance Committee take a look at a bill that affects Medicaid and Medicare, which is in their jurisdiction?  What would be wrong, what could be wrong with allowing public witnesses to come to these committees and testify what they like and what they don't like? I may learn some things about the bill that I like after listening to some witnesses. What would be wrong, what could be wrong with allowing this to happen in this great deliberative body?  I guarantee it would improve the outcome. It would improve the product. More minds looking at this and debating and in dialogue will improve it, if what we want is an improved healthcare system. Maybe that is not what we want. Maybe doing our best job is not what we want. Maybe what we want is the ability to put something through only with votes from one party and with the other party completely shut out of it.  What I think we should want is to do the best job for the most people when it comes to the most important thing in their lives, their health.  I will conclude and say that we can get this right. We can take advantage of the work product of the Republicans, who have been working on this draft by putting it in the HELP and Finance Committees and allowing the body to treat it as any other piece of legislation and improve it before we are forced to vote for it in a rush vote on the floor.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

741,topic-id,2366,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the bipartisan legislation that will reauthorize the National Flood Insurance I wish to speak a little bit about flood insurance first before I talk about our much needed legislation.  As most people know--but unfortunately some folks don't know or maybe they forget--if you have homeowners insurance on your home and you have a flood, you are not covered. Homeowners insurance does not cover flooding. In order to be covered for flooding, you have to have a separate policy, and about the only place you can go to get flood insurance is from the Federal program--the National Flood Insurance Now, that is a bit of an overstatement. It is possible to buy flood insurance from a private insurer--and certainly we want to encourage private insurers to participate more in the flood insurance market--but today, for the most part, if you want to carry flood insurance, you have to get it through the Federal program, and that is called the National Flood Insurance It is administered by  It is hard to overstate the importance of flood insurance to the American people. It is even harder to overstate the importance of flood insurance to the people of The gross domestic product in my State is about $220 billion to $230 billion a year. If you add up all the goods and services that we as Louisianans produce every year, it comes out to between $220 billion and $230 billion. Without flood insurance, you can cut that figure in half. We would have to, in effect, turn out the lights.  There are 450,000 flood insurance policies in my Many of those people have to have flood insurance; it is a condition of their mortgage. So the[[Page S3449]]Flood insurance program and, more specifically, the National Flood Insurance Program, is extraordinarily important to America, but it is even more extraordinarily important to the people of  We are introducing a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance The current program expires in If we don't reauthorize it, most Americans who have flood insurance at the present time will no longer be able to access it. It is critical that the U.Congress act and act immediately.  The bill we are introducing--and I will explain in a moment whom I mean by ``we''--is bipartisan legislation.  Now, there are a lot of issues that divide Congress today, and reasonable people are entitled to disagree over some of these very difficult issues, but there are also issues we can come together on, and I respectfully suggest that flood insurance is one of them.  We have put together a bipartisan coalition, including Senator Bob Menendez from New Jersey, who happens to be a Democrat; and Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey, who happens to be a Democrat; Senator Thad Cochran, chairman of our Appropriations Committee in the Senate, from Mississippi, who is a Republican; Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, who is a Republican; Senator Bill Nelson from Florida, who is a Democrat; Senator Van Hollen from Maryland, who happens to be a Democrat; and more Senators are coming on board.  We are introducing a bill called the SAFE National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization SAFE, of course, is an acronym. It refers to sustainable, affordable, fair, and efficient--SAFE--the SAFE National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization  Let me briefly tell my colleagues what it does. I will start with cost. It doesn't do a bit of good to offer someone insurance if they can't afford it, and too many times that has been the case with flood insurance. Right now, under the current program, the National Flood Insurance Program is allowed to raise a homeowner's flood insurance premium by 18 percent--not 10 percent, not 12 percent but by a staggering 18 percent--and to do that every year. If you are insuring a second home--let's suppose you have a vacation home--or if you are a businesswoman or a businessman and insuring a commercial establishment, the national program can raise your premiums every year by 25 percent. Nobody can pay those kinds of increases.  1, our bill would cap the amount the Flood Insurance Program can raise someone's premium at 10 percent annually. I wish we could tap it at zero percent annually, but 10 percent is certainly a lot better for our people than 18 percent and 25 percent, respectively. If FEMA properly implements some other provisions of our act, which I will talk about in a moment, there will not be any increases.  2, our bill, the SAFE National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, would extend the National Flood Insurance Program by 6 years. I wish we could extend it longer. I wish we could do 10 years or 15 years or 20 years, but it is necessary for us, as the Presiding Officer knows, to get unified, bipartisan support on this legislation, and we think 6 years--a 6-year authorization is probably the best we can do to pass this bill.  3, our bill will save about $750 million a year. Let me say that again. Our bill will save about $750 million each and every year to be used in the Flood Insurance Here is how our legislation would do it.  First, as we know, the Flood Insurance Program has a deficit. We have had a large number of natural disasters, including floods, over the past several years in our country, unfortunately. We had Hurricane We had Hurricane In my State in Louisiana, last year we had two horrible floods, both in the northern part of my State and in the southern part of my In a couple of instances, we had 23 inches of rain in 2 days. I don't care if you live on Mount Everest, if you get 23 inches of rain in 2 days, you are going to flood. Those floods were very expensive.  Those catastrophes and many others caused the National Flood Insurance Program to operate at a deficit. The deficit is $25 billion. Another way of stating that is, the program owes $25 billion in debt, but we owe it to ourselves. We don't owe it to a bank, we don't owe it to a foreign country, we don't owe it to any private entity; we owe it to ourselves, and we have been paying interest to ourselves out of the premiums--the cashflow, if you will--of the Flood Insurance Program every year. That 10 percent--10 cents out of every dollar that comes into the National Flood Insurance Program--is devoted to just paying the interest on this debt that we owe ourselves.  Our bill would suspend those interest payments for 6 years. That will free up about $400 million a year.  We are also saving money by asking those who work with us in implementing the National Flood Insurance Program to sharpen their pencils. Let me explain what I mean by that. FEMA is in charge of the National Flood Insurance Program, but FEMA doesn't run the program. It doesn't run the insurance company that administers the policies. FEMA hires private insurers in the private sector to actually run the program. We call that the ``write your own'' program.  For the most part, those private insurers that administer the program do a good job, but they don't have any risk. They have zero risk, none, nada. The risk is on the National Flood Insurance Program--the Federal government--and therefore the American taxpayer. We just hire the private insurers to administer the program--to collect the premiums, to sell the policies, to adjust the claims. So they have no risk. Yet we are paying them 31 cents out of every dollar that the program would take in.  Our bill respectfully suggests that is too much money. While we appreciate the cooperation we get and the good work we get from the private insurers who help us administer this program, we are going to ask them--actually, we are going to tell them--to reduce their compensation from 31 cents out of every dollar. That is going to save about $350 million a year. So we just saved about $750 million a year for the National Flood Insurance  What are we going to do with the money? First, mitigation. With flooding--and it is inevitable that we are going to have floods. I don't know why bad things happen to good people, but they do. You can pay a little bit up front or you can pay a whole lot later, and this is what I mean by that.  If we spend the money on mitigation to protect against the flooding that we know will inevitably happen, we will save money for the American taxpayer in the long run, and we will use a portion of that $750 million in savings to mitigate against flood risk. By mitigation, I mean offering low- or no-interest loans to homeowners to elevate their homes so they will not flood--building levees, building flood walls. Our bill does not say specifically what mitigation measures should be taken, and it does not say which mitigation projects will be built, but it does say that mitigation is the answer, not the complete answer but part of the answer. We haven't done enough of it. Now we are going to have the resources to do it.  The second way we are going to use that money is to try to do a better job with maps. We set rates in the National Flood Insurance Program based on the likelihood that someone will be flooded. We determine that likelihood by using maps drawn by experts using computer models. We are not using the most up-to-date, state-of-the-art technology to draw those maps, but if our bill passes, we will, including but not limited to a new technology called I confess, I don't understand the technology, but it is called LIDAR, Light Detection and Ranging technology. It can be used to draw more accurate flood maps to more accurately assess someone's propensity to flood.  Why is that important? You might be in a high-risk flood zone right now and paying a large premium. With state-of-the-art technology, you may be put into a lower risk flood zone and pay less. I am not guaranteeing that result, but it is certainly possible. In any event, we need to as accurately as possible assess the risk, and the only way to do that is through proper mapping.  Our bill would also include a provision that will allow Congress to provide better and greater oversight of FEMA in administering the program. Let me say specifically what it will do.[[Page S3450]]  The very able Administrator at FEMA who handles the Flood Insurance Program testified before the Banking Committee a few months ago that if one of these private insurance companies that administers the Flood Insurance Program for us has lawyers or consultants who are not doing their jobs, FEMA doesn't have the authority to fire them. This bill will give FEMA the authority to fire those consultants, and here is why this is important: Most of the lawyers, engineers, and other consultants private insurance companies hire to help them administer the program on behalf of the National Flood Insurance Program do a pretty good job, but some of them do not. There have been recorded instances both in New Jersey and in Louisiana where certain people, engineers and lawyers, have seen it as their mission to do anything they possibly can to keep a homeowner who has paid his or her hard-earned money to buy insurance from getting the money they deserve if they flood, and that is just wrong.  If you are trying to defraud the National Flood Insurance Program, we need to fight you like a tiger. But if you have paid your premiums and, unfortunately, you have flooded, you are entitled to get your money. You should not be required to fight some engineer or some lawyer who is throwing up obstacle after obstacle after obstacle. Our bill says that if there are consultants who do that and the private insurance companies don't want to fire them, then, by God, FEMA will, and we are going to hold FEMA accountable.  A couple more points I will mention: This bill will also extend coverage limits. Right now, the most flood insurance a homeowner can buy is $250,000. While that is a lot of money, that doesn't cover some homes, given the rate of inflation in America today, and our bill would expand coverage limits to $500,000 for homes and $1.5 million for commercial establishments.  I have talked to some of my colleagues in the Senate and in the House, and some of them, whom I am happy for, represent States that haven't had any major floods, and I hope they never do. But if we have learned anything in the last few years in terms of flooding, we have learned that just when men and women think they can control everything in this world and can control their destiny, they can't control God and Mother Flooding can happen at any time.  Let me say it again. You can live in a mountain You can live on top of a mountain. But if you get 23 inches of rain in 2 days, you are going to flood, and that is why you need flood insurance. That is why this bill is not just important to coastal States like Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, New Jersey, and Maryland; it is important to all  This is a bipartisan bill. Have I mentioned that? I think I did. This is a bipartisan bill. It is supported by many It is supported by many It is a bill that is not only important for our economy, but it is important for the peace of mind of the American people. I hope we will not let politics get in the way of doing what we know to be right.

I toured the Women's Center to get a better understanding of their important work and see what they do and how they would be impacted by President Trump's proposed budget cuts.  Two-thirds of the Women's Center's budget comes from Federal grants through the Violence Against Women Act, one of the first bills I cosponsored. I saw it signed into law by President  I am concerned that the cuts that President Trump has proposed would effectively eliminate the important lifesaving care and rescue this organization provides to women, children, and others facing domestic violence.

What kind of country are we if we don't provide this sort of support to our most vulnerable citizens at the moment of their need?

732,topic-id,1413,"Mr.President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Corker and Senator Cardin, for their fine work on the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act, of course, and then this Russia amendment that so many of us have been pushing for so long. I especially thank Senator Cardin for his leadership on that, as well as Senator Brown and Senator Crapo--and the work that Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer did, as well as a lot of members of the Foreign Relations Committee, who care a lot about this.  As I look at this, I look first at the Iranian part of the underlying bill. We have had many disagreements in the last few years on the Iranian nuclear agreement, but it is now critical. This is the time for those who opposed the agreement and those who supported it to come together to ensure that all of the parties to the agreement are upholding their obligations.  When the United States and our allies agreed to the Iranian nuclear agreement, we made it clear that we will continue to hold Iran accountable for its nefarious activities outside of the four corners of the agreement. We must hold Iran accountable for missile tests, for financing terrorism, and human rights violations. That is our job, and that is why I was an early cosponsor of the legislation before the Senate today.  The Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act of 2017 imposes mandatory sanctions on those involved with Iran's ballistic missile program, as well as those who fund terrorist organizations and commit human rights violations. Iran's ballistic missile program is a threat to regional and global security, and United Nations Security Council resolution 2231 makes it illegal for Iran to develop ballistic missiles that could carry a nuclear weapon. Any person or business involved in helping Iran obtain illegal weapons should be banned from doing business with the United States, have their assets immediately frozen, and their travel restricted.  Minimizing the threat Iran poses also means holding it accountable for funding terrorist groups that threaten Israel and seek to destabilize the region. We should be doing everything in our power to better track terrorist financing so we can stop the flow of money that funds suicide bombers and illicit weapons.  Our mission here is clear: We must protect our own citizens and our allies by enacting strong legislation to ensure that Iran does not cheat on its international commitment. Iran must know that if it violates the rules, it will be held accountable.  Democrats and Republicans have come together to get this done, and it is my hope that we can pass the legislation this week, including the amendment imposing strong sanctions against Russia, which is essential to protecting our democracy from foreign interference.  Seventeen United States intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election. That is not all. We know Russia is using covert cyber attacks, espionage, and harmful propaganda to try to undermine our democracy. They launched cyber attacks against local election systems, a U.voting systems software company, and the emails of more than 100 local election officials. Russian-backed criminals hacked into Yahoo and stole data from 500 million accounts. They repeatedly harassed American diplomats in  The former Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, recently testified that Russia will continue to interfere in our political system. This is what he said:       I believe [Russia is] now emboldened to continue such      activities in the future both here and around the world and      to do so even more intensely. If there has ever been a      clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the      very foundation of our democratic political system, this      episode is it.  Vigilance--that is what we need right now. That is why I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues to introduce the Countering Russian Hostilities Act, legislation that would impose strong sanctions against These sanctions would address Russia's cyber attacks, its human rights violations, and its illegal annexation of land in Ukraine and  I am also the cosponsor of the Russia Sanctions Review Act, bipartisan legislation that would require congressional review if sanctions against Russia are rolled back.  The Russia sanctions amendment offered today contains essential portions of both of these pieces of legislation.  After those 17 intelligence agencies confirmed that Russia interfered in our elections, President Obama enacted important sanctions against officials in the Russian Government and hackers conducting malicious cyber activity on behalf of the Russian The amendment before us today would codify those sanctions. The amendment also strengthens sanctions against Russia's energy sector, corrupt Russian officials, and those who supply weapons to the Assad regime.  The day the Obama administration was imposing these additional sanctions on Russia, I was actually with Senators McCain and Graham in Eastern The goal of our trip was to reinforce support for NATO and our allies in the face of increased Russian aggression. On the trip, we went to the Baltics, Ukraine, and Georgia, countries on the frontlines of these fights. They know Russia's playbook well.  In our meetings with Presidents and Prime Ministers of these countries, it was increasingly evident that if we don't stop Russia now, cyber attacks against governments, political parties, newspapers, and companies will only get worse. We heard about websites being shut down and internet access[[Page S3445]]limited when one government--the Government of Estonia--simply had the audacity to move a bronze statue from a public square to a cemetery. It was of a Russian fighter. The Russian Government didn't like it, so they cut down their internet access.  Also, there were members of the Ukrainian Parliament who were invited to What happened to the Lithuanians in the Parliament? They were hacked into. Ukraine itself was targeted by Russian hackers more than 6,500 times over a 2-month period.  Most recently, Russia tried to undermine elections in  For years, our allies have been subjected to Russian aggression and invasion. But they are undeterred, unwilling to give up on that which they fought so hard for--independence, freedom, democracy.  So this is not just about defending our own democracy, as we look at these Russia sanctions that are before us today, as we look at the investigation that is ongoing and looking into the interference into our election. It is about defending a democratic way of life and democracies across the world. It is not just about the simple word ``election'' or the simple word ``democracy.'' It is not just about one candidate or one political party. As Senator Rubio has noted, the next time it will be the other party.  No, this is about our It is about our own independence from foreign powers. It is about freedom and the rights guaranteed to us in our own If that is undermined, if foreign governments are allowed to come in and handpick who their candidate is based on either propaganda or cyber attacks, then we lose our constitutional rights because we the people are no longer determining who our representatives are. Other countries are.  The world continues to look to America for our steadfast leadership. The United States--a beacon for freedom and democracy--must continue to stand up against Russian aggression, not just in word but in deed. That is why it is so important that the Senate is coming together today to pass strong sanctions against the Russian We want the Russian people to be able to have a democracy. We want them to be able to have a democracy that doesn't do things like bring down planes in Ukraine, that doesn't do things like try to influence other countries' elections. That is why these sanctions are so important.  We know that the Russian Government today is actively working to undermine our democracy and hurt American businesses. This is part of the cyber war. We know that this unprecedented interference has been orchestrated by the Kremlin so that Americans actually lose faith in our own political system. Over time, Russia has grown more determined in its effort to weaken democracies in its expanded sphere of influence. Now, more than ever, Americans are looking to the Senate for leadership. We must stand strong and united so that Russia and other nations know that attacks against our democracy must not go unchecked. The amendment before us on the sanctions is an important step in doing just that.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Strange).

1009,topic-id,1437,"Mr.President, I rise today to join my colleagues to speak out and ask for a normal process, for hearings, and for debates.  The Presiding Officer and I have talked about this issue. I know the Presiding Officer has many good ideas to contribute, and I am hopeful that we can start over with a bill that would consist of a number of changes in our existing healthcare system. That is what I think we need to do, instead of this repeal bill that came to us without hearings. It is just not the right way to do this.  I have already gotten reactions from my Just to use some quotes from an article in the Minneapolis StarTribune that was just posted--we have our health plans saying that what matters is Medicaid, and they are the leaders in our healthcare community, calling this bill disappointing because of the continued insistence on significantly cutting Medicaid, the federally paid health insurance program for those who are the most vulnerable.  They have said things--the big story has been, What is it going to do to Medicaid? But, in fact, what our experts in our State are saying--our health plans--is that this is really more of the same from what we have seen in the House bill, but over a different time period. There is an argument that in the end, it involves even deeper cuts.  The Minnesota Hospital Association came out and has already, in just the last few hours, said that the last of the guaranteed benefits discourages preventive care and that this proposal ``creates a lot of chaos.''  One of the heads of one of our major hospitals said:       They are shortening up the money. But they're not giving us      the ability to manage the care.  I have long advocated for changes to the Affordable Care Act--significant changes. I think seniors should be given the ability to harness their marketing power and negotiate for lower prices under Medicare for prescription drugs. They are currently prohibited from doing that. I think that is wrong. I said that when the Affordable Care Act passed.  I think there are many good things we could do to help with the exchanges and with small business rates, including doing something federally on reinsurance. My State legislature, which is a Republican State legislature, joined with our Democratic Governor and worked out an agreement on insurance. We are currently awaiting word from the administration on a waiver, but we think that is a good idea, and there are things we can do to bring that out nationally. I don't see that happening with this bill.  In the end, what matters to me is how this bill affects individual people in my Laura from North Paul wrote to me about her concerns about the very similar House bill. Laura recently retired, but she will not be eligible for Medicare until next year. She has a daughter with several chronic health conditions. She is concerned that if these proposals get passed, she will end up paying far more for her health insurance, and her daughter might lose her coverage altogether.  Take Mike from Grand Marais--that is in the far corner of Minnesota, right up at the tip. He has been self-employed his whole life and is now approaching retirement. He told me that just as he is about to retire, he will not be able to afford health insurance because of the way this proposal works. Like the House bill, it would increase premiums for older  A woman from Andover, MN, wrote to me that she is worried about this slam dunk attempt to check off a box on a to-do list, when, in fact, she is squarely in the middle of that box. She asked me to put a face on the type of person who is affected by rushing through this checklist, and that would be her 28-year-old son. She said that Medicaid coverage has been a lifesaver for her son because it helps him afford the treatment he needs to strive for an independent, productive life.  I have heard from so many people from all of the corners of my State, from the old, the young, the middle-aged. I have heard from many people from the rural parts of my State about the House bill, which, of course, is very similar to the Senate bill that has been proposed here. They were especially worried about the billions in cuts to Medicaid, which is the lead part of the concern from the Minnesota Council of Health  The Senate proposal, as I mentioned, would make even deeper cuts over the long term to Medicaid covers more than 1.2 million Minnesotans, including more than one-fifth of the people in the rural part of our State--20 percent of our rural population. This funding is vital to the ability of our rural hospitals and healthcare providers in those parts of our State to stay open and serve their patients. Many people who work in rural hospitals and who are served by rural hospitals have deep concerns.  Even after seeing the Senate proposal for just these few hours, it is clear that this healthcare legislation would have massive life-changing implications for families all over the country.  We know the President of the United States is not known for mincing words, but we also know he used very direct language when he talked about the House bill. The reports are that he called it mean, and there has been no denial that he said that. He didn't need a poll or focus group. He didn't need to know every detail of the bill. But when you hear that millions and millions of people could lose their health insurance, the wealthiest would get tax cuts, and then the people who need help the most would be forced to pay more, you can see why that would be a good word to describe a bill like this--``mean.'' What we don't want to have come out of the Senate is the ``son of mean'' or ``mean 2.''  Most of us agree that we must make changes to the Affordable Care Act, as I said at the beginning of my remarks. I would love to see those changes to prescription drug prices, not only with the Medicare negotiation I just mentioned, getting rid of that prohibition that stops 41 million seniors from negotiating for lower prices for prescription drugs by passing the bill that I have led for years to allow for that negotiation, but I would like to see more competition in two other ways. One is bringing in safe drugs from other countries like Senator McCain and I have a bill that would allow that to happen.  The second is allowing for more generic competition and making it easier to have generic competition--again, not in the House or the Senate bill. Senator Grassley and I have a bill that would stop ``pay for delay.'' That is where companies pay generics to keep their products off the market. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has assessed that we would not only save billions of dollars for the government but also for taxpayers if this passed. I would like to have that bill come up for a vote, maybe in the form of an amendment, because I believe it would pass.  We could make improvements in the exchanges with the idea of reinsurance. There are many ways we could come together to make sensible changes to the Affordable Care We can never have a bill that big without making some changes, and I think the time has come.  Instead, we see a bill that was drafted behind closed doors. Yes, Democratic Senators were not a part of that; that is it the way it is. But I don't think those doors should be closed to the American people.  Last week I attended the men's baseball game between Democrats and It was an amazing event with over 25,000 people. At the end, when the Democratic team won, they took their trophy and gave it to the Republican team, and they asked them to put it in Representative Scalise's office. We should take the spirit that we saw at that congressional baseball game. We should take that spirit, and we should bring it into this Chamber, and we should start working on a bill together--not this bill. We should start working on a bill that makes some major changes to the Affordable Care We have ideas on both sides, and that is what I think we should do.  With that, I yield the floor.

That is why I am introducing the ``Presidential Pardon[[Page H6200]]Transparency Act.''

So I must today salute her for her tremendous leadership.  Our Nation has been so fortunate to benefit from countless individuals of Caribbean descent, including my personal mentor and friend, the late Honorable Shirley Chisholm, whose district now is so ably represented by our colleague of Jamaican descent, Congresswoman Yvette  Now, Shirley Chisholm was a woman of Bajan and Guyanese descent who never forgot her roots in the She was the first African-American woman elected to Congress, the first woman and the first African American to run for She was truly a trailblazer, and she convinced me that I needed to actually register to vote.

It will increase premiums and reduce benefits, and it would also make Americans pay more for less. It would end Medicaid as we know it, including long-term care for our seniors.  What is more, it will harm American families and really will present an environment now where it is a matter of life and death for so many who don't even need to worry about not having healthcare. They should have healthcare because, otherwise, many people who are going to be denied under this bill can lose their lives.  And for what? Why are we doing this, or why are they doing this? It is to pay for tax cuts for billionaires and for millionaires and for  Mr.Speaker, over the last few months, like all of us, I received thousands of letters from constituents in the East Bay who are terrified of losing their healthcare.

Her son received healthcare under the Affordable Care Under the Senate healthcare bill, children like Sam will be locked out of the care that they desperately need. They are terrified. The bill would force American families like Melissa's to choose between groceries and healthcare.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is cruel and, yes, it is mean.

But also as Representative Plaskett has indicated, when I think about the average, everyday person who came across to America from the Caribbean Islands--the schoolteachers, the plumbers, the lawyers, the doctors, the sanitation workers, and the individuals that come even just to cut grass--when you think about the contributions, what they have committed is those individuals have raised children who become Members of Congress, like Stacey Plaskett and Yvette Clarke, who continued that tradition of making this a much better place to live for all Americans, a shining example of what this great Nation is when it is so inclusive.

So, yes, if you are young and healthy, and, yes, if you are wealthy, then maybe this bill that they are looking at on the Senate side is for you. But if you are young and healthy today, believe me, tomorrow you won't be young if you are lucky.  And believe me, the human body gets sick. And when that happens, the question is: Will you have the ability to access the healthcare that you need to keep you healthy?  Well, under this bill, based upon the American Medical Association, hospitals, AARP, you can go to almost any health provider, they will tell you that, no. 22 million Americans, as the CBO score showed, would lose their access to healthcare, and many of those are in the middle, the middle class. They talk about healthcare. We are not just talking about healthcare; we are talking about adequate health coverage so that when you are sick, you can go to a doctor and receive the care that you need and know that you are covered, because my Republican colleagues have forgotten where we were before the Affordable Care  You see, before the Affordable Care Act, more Americans were going bankrupt in trying to stay alive, for healthcare. These are middle class, hardworking, everyday individuals who thought they had coverage. But when they were sick, they went to the doctor, then they found out that what they thought they were covered for, they were not, and so they had to take out loans and re-mortgage and refinance their homes, give up everything that they had to try to stay healthy and alive. We don't want to go back there.  Before the Affordable Care Act, we were not talking about making sure that those individuals with preexisting diseases were covered.  If you listen to my Republican colleagues, they will tell you that the Affordable Care Act is the worst thing in the world. But before the Affordable Care Act, we weren't talking about children being able to stay on their parents' health insurance until they were 27 years old.  Yes, indeed, before the Affordable Care Act, many seniors saw their coverage capped, and, after a certain amount of payout, they had to come out of their pockets, which were not deep, and just hang in there with their families and suffer and go bankrupt.  So what we are talking about now is saving the lives of individuals.  I want to thank my friend and sister from the Virgin Islands for leading this for the Congressional Black Caucus, because the camera of history is rolling and it is recording, and it will record her and the members of the Congressional Black Caucus standing on the right side of history.

939,topic-id,494,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor the legacy of a great New Jerseyan upon her retirement from a 40-year teaching career. As Mary Jo Codey wraps up her final school year at Gregory Elementary, a public school in West Orange, NJ, we congratulate her on a long and fruitful career inspiring and educating our children while putting them on the path to success. Even as the first lady of New Jersey under the administration of her husband, Richard Codey, Mary Jo refused to leave the children she loved so much, saying, ``When asked if I would resign my teaching responsibilities during my tenure as the First Lady, my response was consistently `no.' Teaching was and is my passion!'' Her dedication and service to her students and to her State will not soon be forgotten.  While teaching may have been Mary Jo's first passion, her drive to make life better for children and families extends well beyond the classroom. I have been honored over the years to work closely with Mary Jo on an issue near and dear to her heart. Ten to 20 percent of women across America are suffering from postpartum depression, and after the birth of her first son in 1984, Mary Jo was one of them. Then, after the birth of her second son, her depression returned, but this time she was able to recognize it and seek treatment for it. Instead of hiding her illness or being ashamed of it, Mary Jo's personal struggle became the motivation for her to raise awareness for postpartum depression and work tirelessly to improve diagnostic and treatment options on the State and Federal level.  Thanks to her leadership, New Jersey became the first State to provide resources to ensure that uninsured mothers can receive postpartum depression screening and treatment. I am proud to say that Mary Jo and I worked together to pass the Melanie Blocker Stokes Mom's Opportunity To Access Health, Education, Research, and Support for Postpartum Depression Act, or MOTHERS Act, as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. This legislation encourages better education, support services, and research for postpartum depression, and we owe its passage largely to advocates like Mary Jo Now, we still have a long way to go to ensure that postpartum depression and other aspects of maternal mental health are given the awareness and resources that they deserve. However, even as she closes the book on her teaching career, I know that Mary Jo's work is far from over, and she will not rest until we reach our goal. Whether it is her advocacy on behalf of postpartum depression or breast cancer, of which she is a survivor, her commitment to improving the lives of children, mothers, and families is unwavering.  With that, I look forward to continuing to work with Mary Jo in the coming years, thank her for her incredible service to New Jersey and all of us, and congratulate her on her retirement.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgS3856-2.txt,791,REAUTHORIZING THE HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HISTORIC,2017.0,29.0,May

704,topic-id,1713,"Mr.President, there is a Chinese curse that reads: ``May you live in interesting times.''  To call the times that we find ourselves in right now ``interesting'' would be certainly an understatement. The fact is, we find ourselves and our country in a moment that is profoundly testing the rule of law here in America, profoundly testing the strength of our democratic institutions. We have a President who has now engaged in a pattern of removing individuals from office who are executing their responsibilities under the law.  First, on January 30, just 11 days into the Trump administration, it was Sally Yates, the Acting Attorney General, who warned the administration that Michael Flynn had been compromised by his connections to Russia--an incredibly responsible act for her to take, but she was fired.  On March 10, it was Preet Bharara, the U.attorney in New York, who was reportedly investigating whether Secretary Price had profited from his position in He had been told he would be retained by this administration when suddenly he was fired.  Then this week, Tuesday, the President fired James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; James Comey, who was leading the FBI's investigation into the possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the Presidential election and who was scheduled to testify before the U.Senate this week; James Comey; who had just recently asked for more funding and resources in order to appropriately and substantially investigate Russian interference in our elections and possible connections to the Trump campaign; James Comey, whose investigation just handed down its first round of subpoenas.  The firing of James Comey has more than a passing resemblance to Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre, the infamous incident in October of 1973, when President Nixon ordered the Attorney General to fire the special prosecutor who was investigating Nixon wanted to derail that investigation. The Attorney General, Elliott Richardson, refused to do so and resigned. His deputy, William Ruckelshaus, refused to do so and resigned.  Day by day, we have seen more connections, bits and pieces, come to light--conversations involving Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and Attorney General  The President insists there is no ``there'' there, but we have seen a pattern of conversations that we don't fully understand. Was there coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians to interfere in the U.Presidential election? Was there collaboration? We don't know. We know there were a lot of conversations, but what was the substance of those conversations? And who instructed those meetings to take place? What is the full pattern of these events?  It is important that we get to the bottom of it because what every American understands is, if you conspire[[Page S2903]]with a foreign government to undermine the integrity of the American elections, you are conspiring to undermine the integrity of the American Government itself; that this is a terrible assault, a terrible crime against our country.  The President's team says this firing of Director Comey had nothing to do with the Russia investigation. They did so through a series of documents, including a letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions to the President, a memo to Jeff Sessions from Rod Rosenstein, and the President writing a letter to James Comey saying you are fired. So the memo from Rosenstein to the AG, the AG's letter to the President, the President's letter saying you are fired, and all of this claiming the basis of the investigation was because they were dissatisfied with the way James Comey had treated Secretary  Now, that doesn't really fit with the history we are familiar with. The President told audiences at a campaign rally in October: ``I tell you what, what he did, he brought back his reputation.''  He is referring to James  ``He brought it back.''  And then when the President talked to ``60 Minutes,'' he said: ``I respect him a lot,'' when he was asked about Director Comey in the context of the actions he had taken in regard to Secretary Hillary  We remember the chants at his rallies: ``Lock her up.''  I don't think there is a single American--not a single Member of this body of 100 Senators--who believes for a moment--not for a microsecond--that the reasoning in this memo from the Deputy AG to the AG and the letter from the AG to the President and the President's memo to James Comey, that the arguments made here were the basis of his firing.  If you believe the President woke up and said: I am so concerned about the way James Comey treated Hillary Clinton that he just has to be dismissed, then I have some oceanfront property in Arizona I would be happy to sell you.  We know from the reporting of the last few days that there is quite another story--an accurate story--about why the President fired James We now know the President had become increasingly frustrated with Director Comey because he wouldn't go along with the story line the President wanted. The President wanted him to support his claim that the Obama administration had wiretapped Trump Tower, but Director Comey, caring about the integrity of his team at the FBI and the office, refused to do so. In fact, he clarified that there is absolutely no information that corroborates the President's claim that Trump Tower had been wiretapped by President  We know the President was frustrated that the Director was doing his job to explore--that is, to investigate--Russia's actions in our campaign, in our Presidential campaign, and that he was frustrated that there was looking into potential ties between his campaign and the He didn't like a lot about the fact that Director Comey was asking for more resources to be able to do a thorough investigation.  Well, we know the result.  According to a report in the Washington Post this morning, President Trump made his final decision to fire the Director last weekend while he was golfing on his property in New He then tasked the AG and the Deputy Attorney General to come up with a cover story.  This is an astonishing chain of events. What we have here is the President making a decision based on the appropriate efforts of the FBI to investigate a potential crime against the United States of What we have here is a President determining he wanted to derail that investigation, and he went to the AG and the Deputy AG to say: Help me do this. Help me derail this investigation. Give me a cover story I can sell to the American public. And Attorney General Sessions complied and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein complied.  Now, that is quite different than what happened in the Saturday Night In the Saturday Night Massacre, when the President said to the Attorney General: Get rid of that special prosecutor so I can derail the investigation, the Attorney General stood up and said: No way, and resigned--the Deputy Attorney General resigned, but that is not what we have here. We have now our AG agreeing to develop a cover story for the  Now, this memo from Attorney General Sessions reads as follows: ``As Attorney General, I am committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law to the Department of Justice.''  Let me ask this question, Where is the integrity in collaborating in a false story in order to derail an investigation, an important investigation to the very heart of the integrity of our system of government? Where, I ask the Attorney General, is the integrity in developing a cover story--a false story to cover up the action of derailing an investigation. That is the opposite of integrity.  To the Deputy, who also agreed to conspire in this deception of the American public, where is your integrity? Where was your commitment to justice?  So here we have events that are deeply disturbing not only in terms of the President's decision to falsely mislead the American public but also to the Attorney General's decision to collaborate in that and the Deputy Attorney General's decision to support it. How is this not obstruction of justice?  If anyone here thinks for a moment that the President is going to nominate a new head of the FBI and ask that individual to conduct a robust investigation of Russia's entanglement in the U.elections, I have another thought for you: It is not going to happen. The President has deliberately, intentionally derailed this investigation, and the Justice Department has no intention of making it go forward again.  We need to hear from these top officials. We need to have these officials come to the U.Senate, to a committee of the whole, to tell us their story and answer these questions about what they have just done to violate the integrity of the Department of  We need to have a special prosecutor. We know the head of the FBI, when we have one again, is not going to be able to conduct a robust investigation. Therefore, we need a special prosecutor to get to the bottom of this. The American people deserve no less. The restoration of integrity of the U.Government deserves no less.  Lady Justice carries scales in her hands, and where is the blindfold? The whole point is that no one in America is above the law, no one--not Presidents or Vice Presidents, not AGs or Deputy Lady Justice is all about getting the facts, following the facts where they go, holding individuals accountable, when we get those facts, when we get that information.  That is what we need to do now. We need to get to the bottom of this. We need to have that special prosecutor. We need to make sure that if anyone did conspire with the Russians, they are held to the full account of the law because conspiring with a foreign country to undermine the integrity of U.elections is treasonous conduct. This is not a traffic ticket. This is a question of treasonous--conspiring with a foreign government, undermining the U.Presidential election.  I am deeply disturbed about this turn of events. I am deeply disturbed about the information we have. We need to get the full, full story, the complete story, and make sure justice is served.

722,topic-id,1799,"Mr.President, climate disruption is the seminal challenge of our generation. It is the most significant test that human civilization on our planet has faced, and there are a lot of questions about how we are going to be able to come together as a community of nations and community of cultures to address this very significant threat to our beautiful blue-green planet.  It affects everything from our farms to our forests to our fisheries. We see the impact in terms of disappearing glaciers, shrinking ice sheets, melting permafrost and dying coral. We see the impact on our farms, our trout streams, and our forests. We see the impact with migrating animals, migrating insects, and more powerful storms.  In response, communities across the globe are taking action. They are transforming their energy economies. They are developing aggressive strategies to save energy in their buildings, in their vehicles, and in their appliances. They are working to replace their fossil fuel energy supplies with clean and renewable energy.  How much do you know about the changes underway? Let's find out. Welcome to episode 3 of the Senate Climate Disruption The first question we have is, Why did American Airlines cancel 57 flights between June 20 and 22? Was it extreme temperatures? Was it a pilot strike? Was it severe storms? Was it a fuel shortage? The answer is A, extreme temperatures.  How is that the case?  When air gets hotter, it gets thinner. Thinner air provides less lift for planes to take off, and eventually the runway isn't long enough for the plane to go fast enough to get enough lift to clear the runway. Therefore, all of these flights got canceled.  It is not the first time it has happened. It happened in 2013 in Phoenix, with 18 flights canceled, but this was a pretty dramatic incident attributable to very extreme temperatures.  Let's turn to question 2. How long was the recent streak of record-setting monthly temperatures--meaning, for example, that a given month like May was the hottest May ever, June was the hottest June ever, and July was the hottest July ever? How many months in a row did this happen? Did it happen for 6 months in a row? Or for 12 months in a row? Is it conceivable that this streak extended beyond a year to 16 months or perhaps even for 2 years, to 24 months? Lock in your answer.  The correct answer is C, 16 months. From May 2015 through August 2016, each and every month was the hottest month on record. In September, 2016, the streak was broken, but only by a few hundredths of a degree. In fact, in September 2016, the temperature was still 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average.  I have a math question to put in here. If you had climate data and temperature data for 50 years, what are the odds that, by chance, 16 months in a row would be the hottest--each one the hottest among the 50 previous months? What are the odds of that? Pull out your calculators, and take 1 out of 50, and take it to the 16th power. What do you get? You get that the odds are less than 1 out of a trillion trillion. That is the odds. In other words, this didn't happen by chance.  Let's turn to question 3. Where in the world is the largest floating solar project? Maybe you have never even heard of a floating solar project. There is one. In fact, there are several. Where is the world's largest? Is it in China? Is it in Brazil? Is it in India? Or is it in Australia?  By the way, here is a hint. All four of these actually have floating solar projects. Lock in your answer. Here is the answer.  The answer is A,  India has a small floating solar project, and it generates about 100 kilowatts. Australia's is 40 times larger, at 4 megawatts, and it is roughly the equivalent of two wind turbines. Brazil's is yet larger, at 10 megawatts. The largest floating solar project by far is in Liulong, The 40-megawatt solar plant is able to provide enough energy to 15,000 homes. Because it floats, it uses less energy than most solar farms because the water acts as a natural coolant.  There is something very symbolic about this largest-in-the-world floating solar project, and that is that it sits on a lake caused by the collapse of abandoned coal mines. It is as if it is saying to us: Let's transition from a fossil fuel economy to a clean, renewable energy economy, like electrons produced by solar power.  Question 4, last year plug-in hybrids and fully electric vehicles made up less than 1 percent of global car sales. It is a very small amount. What was the percentage in Norway?  Was it half a percent behind the world average? Was it 15 percent? Was it 37 percent? Or, perhaps, was it even more than one out of two cars sold in Norway? Lock in your answer.  Here is the right answer. The answer is C, 37 percent. When the world average is under 1 percent, it is pretty impressive that Norway is at 37 percent.  In 2016, plug-in hybrids and fully electric cars made up 37 percent of the new car sales in That is a huge increase in just a couple of years. Three years earlier, the electric vehicles--the plug-in hybrids and fully electric vehicles--accounted for only 6 percent of Norway's sales. In a short 3 years, it went from 6 percent to 37 percent. This growth is a combination of fees on gas-powered and diesel-powered cars and subsidies for electric vehicles.  Let's look at what else is happening with cars in the world. Volvo has announced that all of its new models from 2019 forward will have some form of electric drive. Then you see the growth of companies like Tesla, which only produces electric cars. It is becoming increasingly clear that the future of the global auto industry is electric.  Let's turn to question 5, our final question. This one hits close to home for me as a Senator from What killed billions of baby oysters in Oregon in 2007 and 2008? Was it red tide? Red tide occurs when an algae blooms, and it is a red bloom. It discolors the water, turns it red, and releases toxins that are absorbed by the clams and[[Page S4020]]other sea life, so that we can't go out and dig up our clams and eat them for fear of getting poisoned.  Was it red tide that killed the oysters? Or was it the POMS virus, or the Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome virus, which affects Pacific oysters and can cause up to 100 percent mortality within days of initial detection? Was it sea lice--tiny jellyfish larvae that are tiny, almost invisible specks that are no larger than a grain of pepper? Or was it rising ocean acidity, caused by the emission of billions of tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air that get absorbed by the ocean through tidal action? Lock in your answer.  The correct answer is D, rising ocean acidity. How is this possible? How can you stand on the coast of Oregon and look out at the Pacific Ocean and envision that humankind has burned so much fossil fuel--so many fossil fuels--and that it has created so much carbon dioxide in the air and tidal action has absorbed that into the ocean and turned it into carbonic acid that it has changed the acidity of the ocean? It seems completely impossible. Yet over the last 150 years, the burning of fossil fuels by human civilization has increased the acidity of the ocean by 30 percent.  In 2007, when I was running for the U.Senate for the first time, the oysters started dying. The scientists got involved. They said: What is going on? They said: Is it a virus? Is it a bacterium?  It wasn't a virus. It wasn't a bacterium. After some time, they nailed it down simply to that the ocean water had become too acidic, that there was too much carbonic acid in the ocean from carbon dioxide pollution in the atmosphere. Where did that come from? From the burning of fossil fuels.  Now, the water comes into the Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery in a very large pipe, and then it has to be buffered; that is, the acidity has to be decreased before that water continues into the vats with the baby oysters. For all we know, they will have to do this forever more, until we can turn the clock back on global climate disruption.  If the oysters are being affected, what else is going to be affected in the sea chain? What is the impact on our coral reefs, which provide the foundation for many of the world's fisheries? That is something that we should rightly be very concerned about.  There you have it, folks, episode 3 of the Senate Climate Disruption How did you do? How many of those questions did you get right? The facts on the ground are changing very quickly as climate disruption increases and communities across the globe respond. Together we are racing the clock, and there is no time to spare. So stay engaged in the fight.  In the near future, I will bring you episode 4 of the Senate Climate Disruption In the meantime, if you have a good idea for a climate disruption question, please tweet that question to me at @SenJeffMerkley, using the hashtag Together, let's keep fighting to save our planet.  Henry David Thoreau said: What use is a home if you don't have a tolerable planet to put it on?  Let's work together to make sure we have a tolerable planet, a healthy planet, not just for this generation but for our children and our great-grandchildren and the generations to follow.

805,topic-id,4148,"Mr.President, yesterday we had a horrific tragedy here in the capital area. I know I speak for all of my colleagues who are holding the victims of that attack in their hearts and in their prayers: Congressman Steve Scalise, still in critical condition; Zack Barth, legislative correspondent who works for Congressman Williams of Texas, who was injured; Matt Mika of Tyson's Foods, who represents them here on the Hill; and two of our police officers, David Bailey and Crystal Griner of the U.Capitol Without those two police officers present, this could have been a much more tragic event.  We have to reinforce the understanding that we are blessed to have the opportunity to raise our voices in our democratic We are able to raise them by speaking to our members who are elected in local and State and Federal Government, by writing to them, by meeting with them in townhalls. In my State, you can call them up, and they will sit down with you in a cafe. We have an opportunity to weigh in through writing letters to the editor, by protesting in the streets, by overflowing the email lines and flooding the phone lines. We have all kinds of ways to weigh in, in America, but violence is absolutely unacceptable. We have to try to diminish and eliminate the hate speech, which so often becomes the foundation for hate violence.  We have had a very divisive 18 months here in America, where various folks have sought to increase the divisions between groups of Americans, to attack women, to attack African Americans, to attack Hispanics, to attack Muslims, to attack LGBT citizens. We need to eliminate that strategy of division.  Here, in America, we are a tapestry of talents from all over the world, of different cultural backgrounds who come together to make this Nation incredibly strong. Unless you are 100 percent Native American, you are either an immigrant yourself or the son or daughter of immigrants. We bring that diversity to bear and we make this Nation powerful in ways few other nations could even come close to having.  Let's take this as a moment in which we seek to encourage public participation in all the legitimate forms of free speech but put hate speech out of bounds and hate violence out of bounds.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, it is ironic that this conversation takes place at a moment where we really have a unique process underway designed to limit political discourse. Everything I am saying about participation assumes you will have a chance to weigh in, whether you are elected or whether you are a citizen.  We have a process in the Senate that is designed to prevent the citizens of America from weighing in and to prevent debate by the Members of the That is not acceptable. It is not acceptable that in a ``we the people'' constitutional republic, a democratic republic designed to facilitate conversation and dialogue to produce decisions that reflect the will of the people, that work for all Americans--instead, we have a secretive process, more the type of process you would expect in a kingdom where the King and the counselors hide themselves away, with no public input, and make decisions for the masses. That is not the design of our government. Our government is designed for public input.  Here is a phrase that should resonate: no public input, no vote; no hearing, no vote.  I am speaking specifically about the dialogue on TrumpCare, which was passed by just a few votes in the House and came to the Senate, doesn't reflect a process of the people, by the people, and for the people. In fact, it is by the privileged, for the privileged, and by the privileged.  The House deliberately excluded the public. They had their own consolidated, confined process to make sure it was difficult to have a full debate and an amendment process, for folks to weigh in and consider alternatives and improvements.  Here we are in the Senate, and it is even worse because we have the secret 13 crafting a plan, planning and plotting to bring it to the floor of the Senate probably 2 weeks from today in order to hold a vote, with only a few hours of debate and no committee process of any kind--not a single committee hearing, not a single committee opportunity to consider amendments--and no chance for the public to get a copy and read through it and weigh in with their Members of the There is no chance for healthcare stakeholders and experts to examine it and point out the difficulties and the flaws. What I think is most egregious[[Page S3534]]of all is the complete exclusion of the United States of It is unacceptable.  I was fascinated by the fact that the majority decided to have this secret 13 committee. Thirteen is considered to be an unlucky number by much of America--Friday the 13th or buildings that don't have a 13th floor. In this case, I hope that having 13 Members meet in secret is unlucky; that is, unlucky in terms of trying to fulfill their mission of passing a bill with no input by the public.  Last week, the majority leader started the process to make this happen without a committee. It is called the rule XIV process. It is a process designed to bring up a healthcare bill that would rip healthcare coverage from millions of Americans and, by the way, give away billions of dollars to the richest Americans, all in the same bill, straight to the Senate floor without a committee being involved--not the Finance Committee, which certainly has many elements related to the financing of healthcare in America, and not the HELP Committee, which has Members of both parties who have worked for years to develop expertise and consult with stakeholders to understand what works and what doesn't work, and they benefit from each other's input.  I was part of the HELP Committee in 2009. For 5 weeks we sat in a room with a television camera operating so the public could see what we were doing, and we proposed amendments and debated them around this big square set of tables. There was full public scrutiny. There was 5 weeks of bipartisan dialogue about what should go in healthcare. That was 2009. The Finance Committee had a very similar process.  But now we have a different objective by the majority leader wanting to bring this bill with no Finance Committee involvement, no HELP Committee involvement, and no citizen involvement. In fact, there is no chance for Senators who aren't in the secret circle to participate and see the bill and hold townhalls and ask people what they think of this.  I do a lot of townhalls. I am doing a couple more this weekend. I have had 20 townhalls this year. I have had a townhall an average of every 10 days since I was elected in 2000 and came to the Senate in 2009. I am going to keep holding these townhalls.  I know that my citizens would like to see this bill and be able to go through the elements and give me feedback on what makes sense and what doesn't. That is a ``we the people'' democratic republic. This secrecy strategy--that is not. That is not. That is a strategy for nonconstitutional governments. That is a strategy for dictators. That is a strategy for Kings and That is a strategy for people who hate democracy.  Let's not have that process in the United Let's have colleagues from both sides of the aisle go to the leadership and say: This is unacceptable. I want my citizens to have a chance to see this bill. I want to benefit from talking to the hospitals in my community and my State and get their feedback. I want to talk to the healthcare clinics and get their feedback. I want to talk to the doctors and find out what they think. I want to hear from the nurses because they are so respected in their understanding of the direct delivery of healthcare.  That is what every Member of the Senate should be saying to our majority leader. This process of secrecy, no debate, and the public being excluded is totally unacceptable.  Why is this process going on? In fact, earlier today, the secret 13 went into a room off a hallway where the press is not allowed so they couldn't be seen coming and going from the room. When they were coming and going from the room, they couldn't be talked to by the press. Why all this secrecy? It boils down to this: They know the American people don't like what is in this bill. They are terrified of getting that feedback. If they get that feedback, they might lose a majority in passing this bill.  How much public support is there for the TrumpCare bill? Just 21 percent, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll. That is not very much support for it.  Even President Trump said TrumpCare is terrible. He said it this way: That bill from the House is ``mean.'' That was his exact quote, that it is ``mean.'' Then he used another phrase, which I won't repeat on the floor of the Senate, to say just how absolutely awful that bill is.  Today in committee, I asked the Secretary of Health, Tom Price: Do you share, as Secretary of Health, the President's opinion that his own bill, his own TrumpCare bill passed out of the House, is an absolutely terrible bill, a mean bill?  He didn't want to answer the question. Certainly, I found that curious, that the Secretary of Health will not tell us whether he shares the President's opinion.  Then I asked him: Why did the President call it a mean bill? Is it because it throws 20 million people out of healthcare?  The Secretary didn't want to answer.  Did the President say it was a mean bill because it eliminates the guarantee of essential health benefits so that an insurance policy is, in fact, insuring you when you get sick rather than perhaps not even being worth the paper it is printed on?  There were a lot of healthcare insurance policies before we had an essential care package, essential benefits package. You paid the insurance company, but when you got sick, they didn't cover anything. Those policies weren't worth the paper they were printed on.  So I asked the Secretary of Health: Is that the reason the President said this is a mean process or a mean bill? Is that the reason he described this bill in terms that I won't repeat on the floor?  The Secretary of Health wasn't interested in relaying or giving insights into why the President said it was a mean bill.  I asked: Is it because the bill destroys the guarantee that if you have preexisting conditions, you can still get a policy at the same price as everyone else?  Again, there was no answer.  I said: Or is it a mean bill because if you are an older American, you have to pay perhaps up to eight times more for the same policy as you pay under current law?  You know, an individual who is 64 years old, a man who is earning $26,500 a year, currently that individual would pay about $140 a month for a policy under current law. The same policy under TrumpCare would cost $1,200 a month. Is there anyone in this Senate Chamber who thinks an individual earning $26,500 a year can afford a healthcare policy that costs $1,200 a month?  Let me translate this. If you are earning $26,000 a year, you are earning a little over $2,000 a month. Is there anyone in this Chamber who believes--please come to the floor and tell us if you do--that individual can buy a healthcare policy costing $1,200 a month? Is there anyone who thinks it is an egregious mistake to use high pricing to force older Americans out of our healthcare system? I believe in treating our citizens of all ages graciously, not forcing them out of healthcare through an eightfold increase in their premiums. Is that the reason the President said that this healthcare bill, this TrumpCare bill from the House, is a mean bill and spoke of it in derogatory terms?  The TrumpCare bill isn't even popular in the President's own party. Just 48 percent of Republicans surveyed in the same poll supported President Trump and Speaker Ryan's healthcare plan. But when asked if they like the current healthcare plan, 55 percent said they do.  Right now, regular order, the regular legislative, deliberative process that makes sure there is a full debate before a significant bill comes to a vote, that makes sure there is significant and substantial time for the citizens of America to weigh in, that regular order or regular process is being run over by a steamroller. It is being crushed. It is being demolished. Why would my colleagues support destroying the fundamental principles of legislative debate? I would love to hear the answer. Perhaps it is because, like President Trump said, the bill is mean. Perhaps it is because it is extremely unpopular with the American people, who believe there should be affordable, quality healthcare available to every single  We have heard that the secret 13 have a plan to sweeten the bill, a little spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down. What is that plan? Well, we are hearing that maybe they will put[[Page S3535]]in extra funds to help take on the opioid addiction epidemic. That is a good thing. Why have they fought so hard against supporting such programs to help Americans on this crucial question?  We have heard they want to slow down the process of throwing people off healthcare so it will not hurt them in the 2018 elections and maybe not even hurt them so much in the 2020 elections. But if you are destroying something piece by piece, you are still destroying it. If you are cooking a lobster and you turn up the heat fast or you turn up the heat slowly, you still kill the lobster. And this bill is still going to kill healthcare for millions of Doing it more slowly doesn't make it a good thing. Putting in a spoonful of sugar doesn't make a diabolical act better.  Franklin Roosevelt once said:       Let us never forget that government is ourselves.  And he continued:       The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President      and Senators and Congressmen and Government officials but the      voters of this country.  And isn't that what ``we the people'' means--government of, by, and for the people? But nowhere in the Republican secret 13 process can the voices of the people of the United States be heard. How about if one of the 13 comes to the floor now and distributes the bill? I mean we should have weeks to consider this. We should have maybe a month to consider it. We had a whole year of process in 2009.  Wouldn't that be the right thing to do, to clue in folks about what is in this bill so we can get the stakeholders engaged and the citizens engaged and hold those townhalls and get that feedback? Wouldn't that be the right thing to do?  Well, unfortunately, we are still waiting. We are still paused, saying: Please, bring the bill to the floor. Distribute it. Maybe it is not your final draft, but that is  We had draft after draft after draft of the healthcare bill in 2009. We had, in the Senate Finance Committee, 53 hearings on healthcare reform. They spent 8 days marking up their version of the ACA--the committee's longest markup in 22 years. During those 8 days, 135 amendments were considered--amendments from both Republicans and Then, there was the HELP Committee, which I served on, and it held 47 bipartisan hearings, roundtables, and walkthroughs. There were 300 amendments during a month-long markup--one of the longest in the history of More than 100 Republican amendments, minority amendments, were accepted into the committee's version of healthcare reform.  Right here in this Chamber, we spent 25 days considering the bill before we voted--25 days considering a lot of floor amendments, a lot of floor time. Is there a single member of the majority party who will commit to having at least 25 days of debate on the floor of the Senate so we can get a full vetting of the issues, so we can get full input by the citizens of the United States of America?  Well, I am concerned that we are not on the path that values the construction of our government, our constitutional ``we the people'' government. I am concerned and afraid we are on a path where powerful special interests meeting secretly with 13 Members of the Senate are crafting a bill that is great for the powerful and the privileged but in fact is terrible for Americans, and that is why they are so afraid to show us the bill.  So this is unacceptable, and we need the citizens of America to pay attention because why is this happening right now? Well, because the fact that this secret process is going on, it can be camouflaged by all the conversation about Russiagate--how much did the Russians interfere in our elections, and what about all those secret meetings by members of the campaign team, were they coordinating or collaborating? We don't know the answer, but that question is central to whether there was treasonous conduct undermining the integrity of our elections.  So let's do this now, the secret healthcare plan, with no debate while America is trying to fight for the fairness and integrity of our elections. Let's do it now when schools are out of session and we are in summer and people are on vacation. Let's sneak it through now, this act that strips healthcare for millions of  Here is the principle we should come back to: No hearing; no vote. No hearing; no vote. No vote on a piece of legislation that affects the lives of millions of American families if we haven't had due deliberation by the key committees. No vote on a bill that destroys healthcare for millions of families if we haven't had the chance to consult with the experts in healthcare--the nurses, doctors, hospitals, and clinics.  No hearing; no vote. No vote if we haven't had a full chance for the citizens of America to weigh in, to see the full details, and say what they like and what they don't like and share that with their respective On an issue of this magnitude, one that will affect the peace of mind and the health of millions of Americans, we need a full, thorough legislative process.  The choices that are made in this Chamber over the next few weeks will have a big impact on the quality of life of millions of American citizens. A provision that eliminates Medicaid expansion, the Oregon health plan expansion in my State, whether it is implemented slowly or implemented fast is going to rip healthcare from 400,000 That is enough Oregonians that if they were holding hands, they would stretch from the Pacific Ocean to Idaho, 400 miles across the That is a profound impact.  In addition, those folks who are going to the clinics and hospitals who don't have healthcare, they will not be able to pay for it. So the finances of the clinics and the hospitals will be dramatically hurt. I asked Secretary Price today: Is that the reason the President said the TrumpCare bill out of the House is a mean bill? Is that the reason he used a derogatory phrase to attack the TrumpCare bill out of the House? Is it because of the fact it will undermine the finances of the clinics and the hospitals.  He said: You know, I don't accept the premise that will happen.  Well, covering your eyes and covering your ears and pretending, on such an important issue, is not a responsible act by a Secretary of The clinics have been coming to us and saying this is how our finances improved when our citizens were able to pay for the services because our rate of uncompensated care dropped dramatically and, with that income, we hired a lot more people.  I have a clinic in the northeast corner of our State where the number of people employed, they told me, doubled from 20-something to 50-something. They are able to provide a lot more healthcare in that local, rural community, and that is true in clinic after clinic after clinic.  If one would take their hands off their ears or off from in front of their eyes and listen to the presidents or the executive directors of rural hospitals, they would hear them say: This will really hurt us. This will hurt, not just our ability to provide care to those who will not have insurance, it will hurt our finances. It will diminish our care for everyone in this rural community. Everyone will be hurt by  Is that what the President meant when he said this bill is mean? Well, if that is what he meant, if what he meant is it is mean because it rips healthcare from 20 million Americans, then I agree with the If when the President criticizes the TrumpCare bill as being mean, if he meant that because it was going to destroy the guarantee of access by folks with preexisting conditions, then I agree with him. If he said it because it will destroy essential benefits and allow there to be insurance policies that aren't worth the paper they are written on, then I agree with the  If it does, it is going to greatly increase the cost of insurance for older Americans, up to eightfold times. If that is why the President said it is mean, I agree with the  The President should weigh in and say: No secret process on a bill so important to the healthcare of millions of President Trump should weigh in and say: I don't want a bill that looks anything like that House bill because it is defective in this area, in this area, and in this area, hurting everybody in the communities, undermining the clinics, undermining the[[Page S3536]]hospitals, destroying insurance, destroying the opportunity of access for preexisting conditions, and ripping away the guarantee that essential benefits will be covered. That is what the President should do.  He thinks the bill is terrible because he finally looked at it. Well, he is going to think the bill crafted by the secret 13 is terrible too. He has a chance to stand up and fight for the American people and say: I will never sign a bill that goes through a secret process that excluded the insights from our rural hospitals, insights from our rural clinics, insights from our nurses, and insights from our doctors. I will never sign a bill in the Oval Office that excluded the American people from being allowed to weigh in on the conversation. I will never sign a major bill that hurts so many people in my Oval Office if it never had a committee hearing and never had amendments, never had a chance to go through the legislative process the way envisioned in our ``we the people'' That would be the right thing for President Trump to do.  He has recognized the bill is profoundly flawed. He has a chance to--not only a flawed bill but a profoundly, unacceptable process in our constitutional democratic  Former Chief Justice Hughes said: We are here not as masters but as servants, not to glory in power, but to attest our loyalty to the commands and restrictions laid down by the people of the United States in whose name and by whose will we exercise our brief authority.  Each one of us is here for a short period of time, but we take our constitutional roles as Senators from the foundation of the power of the American people, the ``we the people'' To exclude them from the process is to violate the very premise on which our Nation is founded.  So we have to stop this process. We have to stop it in its tracks. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, whether you come from a rural State or a highly populated State, it is a responsibility to stop this process, return to regular legislative deliberation so that we can, in fact, have a ``we the people'' conversation, fully honoring the experts and the feedback from ordinary citizens across our  No hearing, no legislative deliberation, no vote.

761,topic-id,3585,"Mr.Speaker, despite the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle, today is an exciting day for those of us who have been working and fighting to end ObamaCare's reign over this country.  It is race month in Indiana, and I want to remind my colleagues that, as exciting as today is, today's vote is a green flag, not a checkered flag. It is the beginning of the race, not the end.  Today, the House will vote to move legislation forward that will repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something far better. The bill will surely undergo more changes as we continue this process in the Senate, but it is on its way to the finish line.  There are some really strong policies in this bill. It cut taxes by a trillion dollars on the American people, and government spending by hundreds of billions, too. Despite the rhetoric, it keeps preexisting condition prohibitions. No one with a preexisting condition will be denied coverage because of the policies in this bill. Insurance companies cannot raise premiums on individuals with preexisting conditions as long as they maintain coverage.  The bill will also make sure 26-year-olds continue to stay on their parents' healthcare plans as they enter the workforce. Most importantly, though, the bill unshackles American families from the mandates, taxes, and penalties that are costing these families thousands of dollars each year.  Though ObamaCare helped some, we have to remember that ObamaCare made things worse for millions of America, and that is where the national anger has come from. I have heard from countless Hoosiers who tell me the stories of their premiums going from $500 a month to $1,500 a month, with deductibles that are through the roof, at $10,000-plus a month. They have to spend $30,000 out of pocket before they even get to their insurance. For a middle class family, that means they have no meaningful insurance at all.  We can do better, and we will. That starts today.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the National Rural Health Association opposed to this bill.              [From the National Rural Health Association]                Vote NO to the American Health Care Act       The National Rural Health Association urges a NO vote on      the American Health Care Act (AHCA).       Rural Americans are older, poorer and sicker than other      populations. In fact, a January 2017 CDC report pronounced      that life expectancies for rural Americans have declined and      the top five chronic diseases are worse in rural The      AHCA does nothing to improve the health care crisis in rural      America, and will lead to poorer rural health outcomes, more      uninsured and an increase in the rural hospital closure      crisis.       Though some provisions in the modified AHCA bill improve      the base bill, NRHA is concerned that the bill still falls      woefully short in making health care affordable and      accessible to rural For example, the modified bill      contains a decrease in the Medical Expense Deduction      threshold from 10% to 5.8% in an attempt to assist Americans      between the ages of 50 and 64 who would see their premiums      skyrocket under the current plan. However, this deduction is      not a credit and therefore would be of little use to low      income seniors that are in very low tax brackets or do not      pay income tax at all. Additionally, the new amendments to      freeze Medicaid expansion enrollment as of 1, 2018, and      reduce the Medicaid per-capita growth rate will      disproportionately harm rural       The AHCA will hurt vulnerable populations in rural      Americans, leaving millions of the sickest, most underserved      populations in our nation without coverage, and further      escalating the rural hospital closure crisis. According to      the Wall Street Journal, the ``GOP health plan would hit      rural areas hard . . . Poor, older Americans would see the      largest increase in insurance-coverage costs.'' The LA Times      reports ``Americans who swept President Trump to victory--     lower-income, older voters in conservative, rural parts of      the country--stand to lose the most in federal healthcare aid      under a Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable      Care Act.'' Let's be clear--many provisions in the ACA failed      rural The lack of plan competition in rural markets,      exorbitant premiums, deductibles and co-pays, the co-op      collapses, lack of Medicaid expansion, and devastating      Medicare cuts to rural providers--all collided to create a      health care crisis in rural However, it's beyond      frustrating that an opportunity to fix these problems is      squandered, and instead, a greater health care crisis will be      created in rural       Congress has long recognized the importance of the rural      health care safety net and has steadfastly worked to protect      it. And now, much of the protections created to maintain      access to care for the 62 million who live in rural America      are in jeopardy. We implore Congress to continue its fight to      protect rural patients' access to care. Three improvements      are critical for rural patients and providers:       1. Medicaid--Though most rural residents are in non-     expansion states, a higher proportion of rural residents are      covered by Medicaid (21% vs. 16%).       Congress and the states have long recognized that rural is      different and thus requires different programs to succeed.      Rural payment programs for hospitals and providers are not      `bonus' payments, but rather alternative, cost-effective and      targeted payment formulas that maintain access to care for      millions of rural patients and financial stability for      thousands of rural providers across the country. Any federal      health care reform must protect a state's ability to protect      its rural safety net providers. The federal government must      not abdicate its moral, legal, and financial responsibilities      to rural, Medicaid eligible populations by ensuring access to      care.       Any federal health care reform proposal must protect access      to care in Rural America, and must provide an option to a      state to receive an enhanced reimbursement included in a      matching rate or a per capita cap, specifically targeted to      create stability among rural providers to maintain access to      care for rural communities. Enhancements must be equivalent      to the cost of providing care for rural safety net providers,      a safeguard that ensures the enhanced reimbursement is      provided to the safety net provider to allow for continued      access to care. Rural safety net providers include, but not      limited to, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Prospective      Payment Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, Indian      Service providers, and individual rural providers.       2. Market Reform--Forty-one percent of rural marketplace      enrollees have only a single option of insurer, representing      70 percent of counties that have only one option. This lack      of competition in the marketplace means higher premiums.      Rural residents average per month cost exceeds urban ($569.34      for small town rural vs. $415.85 for metropolitan).       Rural Americans are more likely to have obesity, diabetes,      cancer, and traumatic injury; they are more likely to      participate in high risk health behaviors including smoking,      poor diet, physical inactivity, and substance abuse. Rural      Americans are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured and      less likely to receive employer sponsored health insurance.      Rural communities have fewer health care providers for      insurers to contract with to provide an adequate network to      serve the community.       Any federal health care reform proposal must address the      fact that insurance providers are withdrawing from rural      markets. Despite record profit levels, insurance companies      are permitted to cherry pick profitable markets for      participation and are currently not obliged to provide      service to markets with less advantageous risk pools.      Demographic realities of the rural population make the market      less profitable, and thus less desirable for an insurance      company with no incentive to take on such exposure. In the      same way that financial service institutions are required to      provide services to underserved neighborhoods, profitable      insurance companies should be required to provide services in      underserved communities.       3. Stop Bad Debt Cuts to Rural Hospitals--Rural hospitals      serve more Medicare patients (46% rural vs. 40.9% urban),      thus across-the-board Medicare cuts do not have across the      board impacts. A goal of the ACA was to have hospital bad      debt decrease significantly. However, because of unaffordable      health plans in rural areas, rural patients still cannot      afford health care. Bad debt among rural hospitals has      actually increased 50% since the ACA was passed. According to      MedPAC ``Average Medicare margins are negative, and under      current law they are expected to decline in 2016'' has led to      7% gains in median profit margins for urban providers while      rural providers have experienced a median loss of 6%.       If Congress does not act, all the decades of efforts to      protect rural patients' access to care, could rapidly be      undone. The National Rural Health Association implores      Congress to act now to protect rural health care across the      nation.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the American Thoracic Society opposed to this bill.                                    American Thoracic Society,                                                   April 27, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 16,000 members of the      American Thoracic Society (ATS), I want to voice my grave      concerns with the latest legislative proposal developed to      repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While CBO      estimates are not yet available for the most recent      legislation proposal being considered in the House, we remain      concerned that the bill, if enacted, will result in a loss of      health insurance for millions of Should the      proposal come up for a vote in the near future, we urge you      to vote ``NO'' on the American Health Care       The ATS opposes any legislation that does not ensure      affordable health insurance coverage for Americans currently      insured under[[Page H4131]]     the We are concerned that allowing states to waive      important insurance reforms in the Affordable Care Act will      lead to reduced coverage for many Americans and significant      price increases for patients with pre-existing conditions.      Further, we are concerned that reliance on ``high risk      pools'' will not adequately meet the health insurance needs      of many Americans with pre-existing conditions. We note that      previous attempts at implementing state-based high risk pools      have been largely unsuccessful. Members of the ATS serve a      large and diverse patient population, including patients with      respiratory diseases, critical illnesses and sleep disorders      such as asthma, COPD, pneumonia, sepsis and obstructive sleep      apnea. Our patients cannot afford to lose affordable health      insurance coverage for any period of time.       The ATS looks forward to working with Congress to improve      our health care system and ensure health insurance coverage      for all If you have questions or need additional      information, please contact Nuala Moore, Associate      Director of Government           Sincerely,                                             David Gozal, MD, MBA,                                                         Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics opposed to this bill.                                              Academy of Nutrition                                                and Dietetics,                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: Nutrition services      save money, improve chronic disease outcomes and save lives.      For this reason, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the      nation's largest organization of food and nutrition      professionals, remains opposed to H.1628, the American      Health Care Act (AHCA) as amended by the MacArthur amendment.       The Academy and our 75,000-plus members believe that all      Americans should have both coverage and access to high-     quality health care. The Academy urges Congress to support      measures that include nutrition services and prevention that      reduces the cost of health care and improve patients' lives.       The new proposal set forth in the AHCA not only fails to      improve the health of all Americans, but it will worsen      patient care and public health by removing vital resources      that are currently effective in improving health across the      country.       This legislation continues to eliminate investments in      prevention and public health, reverse advancements made in      disease prevention and chronic care management, and according      to the Congressional Budget Office, would result in the loss      of health care coverage for at least 24 million Americans      Allowing states to waive pre-existing conditions and      essential health benefits will lead to decreased coverage and      utilization of vital nutrition services.       Individuals with chronic disease such as diabetes and      hypertension benefit from medical nutrition therapy and      nutrition services to lower their blood sugar and blood      pressure, while reducing reliance on expensive medications.      The cost of these services is inexpensive and replaces more      costly interventions that are necessary as chronic disease      progresses with many complications.       The Academy holds five key tenets for analyzing any      legislation to reform health care:       1. The health of all Americans should improve as a result      of our health policy choices. Sufficient resources must be      made available to ensure optimal health.       2. Access to quality health care is a right that must be      extended to all       3. Nutrition services, from pre-conception through end of      life, are an essential component of comprehensive health      care.       4. Stable, sufficient and reliable funding is necessary for      our health care system to provide everyone access to a core      package of benefits.       5. Health care must be patient-centered.       Affordable access to care is an ongoing challenge that any      reform legislation should address. Although this legislation      purports to provide access, it fails to make coverage more      affordable; unaffordable access to coverage is really not      coverage at all. The proposal fails to maintain a core      package of benefits that improve the health of Americans, by      removing a basic floor of services that should be provided      without cost-sharing to the Medicaid population.       Additionally, the new proposal would allow states to opt      out of requiring that health plans cover the Essential Health      Benefits which help reduce longer term health care costs,      allow insurers to charge people higher premiums based on pre-     existing conditions like nutrition related diseases like      diabetes and heart disease and increase out-of-pocket costs      for vulnerable older adults.       By repealing the Prevention and Public Health Fund, the      proposal eliminates the sole federal investment in      prevention, which will harm our state and local communities      that depend on these effective public-private partnerships to      improve the health of their communities.       The AHCA as currently drafted fails to meet the Academy's      five tenets, and therefore we cannot support the passage of      these proposals.

The Jewish Federations                                             of North America,                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The Jewish Federations      of North America (JFNA) remains staunchly opposed to the      American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA), even with the      recently released amendment proposed by Representative Tom      MacArthur (R-NJ). We are disappointed that AHCA retains the      devastating cuts to Medicaid included in the earlier version      of the legislation, cuts which are the result of the      legislation's proposal to dramatically restructure Medicaid's      federal financing structure and roll back coverage for 14      million people covered by the state Medicaid expansions. The      amendment does nothing to alleviate these concerns.       JFNA represents 148 Jewish federations and 300 network      communities that together support 15 leading academic medical      centers/health systems, 100 Jewish nursing homes, and 125      Jewish family & children's agencies, providing health care      for more than one million clients, Jewish and non-Jewish      alike. Medicaid is a lifeline for more than 80 million      people, including low-income children, older adults, and      people with disabilities nationwide. Medicaid is a vital      program for Jewish federations throughout the country and      particularly for our communal health and long-term care      partners that care for the most vulnerable in our      communities.       JFNA is deeply troubled by the findings of the      Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that AHCA will cause $839      billion in reductions--about 25 percent--to federal Medicaid      funding and a loss in coverage for more than 14 million      Medicaid beneficiaries. We believe that converting Medicaid      to a block grant or per capita cap will cause irreparable      harm not only to the millions who depend on the program, but      also to our large network of providers who care for them.       AHCA would convert the long-standing and fundamental      federal-state partnership of the Medicaid program to a block      grant or per capita cap system. Under either approach, states      would receive a limited amount of federal money for their      Medicaid programs. As CBO found, even under a per capita cap      system, the federal share is lower than the average annual      increase in Medicaid spending and will not be sufficiently      flexible to address a variety of key factors affecting      Medicaid spending, including major disasters, economic      downturns, unexpected health care cost increases, and      demographic changes, such as the rapidly aging baby boomer      generation. CBO projected that AHCA's $839 billion cut in      federal Medicaid funding will shift substantial costs to      state and local governments, our providers, and our patients,      thus exacerbating the existing strain on the program. We      agree with CBO's conclusion that, due to these reductions in      funding, states will be left with no choice but to reduce      Medicaid enrollment, eligibility for Medicaid benefits, and      payment rates. Many people who now qualify for Medicaid could      end up uninsured or losing access to critical health and      long-term care services.       JFNA is concerned by many of the unintended consequences of      this legislation, such as:       People who desperately need Medicaid and who are currently      eligible will become uninsured;       States will be forced to cut back on crucial Medicaid      services, such as home and community-based services,      effectively forcing people who are capable of living in the      community with proper home and community-based services into      nursing homes;       States will be forced to reduce already low provider      payment rates, thus further decreasing the pool of providers      serving Medicaid beneficiaries and increasing waiting times      for services; and,       Health care providers and entities that care for these      vulnerable populations will suffer additional financial      strain. As a result, these agencies will be forced to lay off      staff or close their doors altogether, resulting in      significant job losses and further hurting state economies.       For these reasons, we must oppose the legislation as      currently written and urge the House of Representatives to      reconsider moving forward with it. We stand ready to work      with you, in tandem with our Jewish communal health and long-     term care providers, to promote more targeted ways to reduce      Medicaid spending and develop a new framework of policies to      improve Medicaid quality, efficiency, and sustainability.           Sincerely,     William Daroff,[[Page H4132]]       Senior Vice President for Public Policy & Director of the      Washington  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record an article in The Wall Street Journal today stating: ``. . . employers looking to lower their costs could impose lifetime limits and eliminate the out-of-pocket cost cap from their plans under the GOP legislation.''                     [From the Wall Street Journal]  Little-Noted Provision of GOP Health Bill Could Alter Employer Plans    Last-minute amendment would allow states to obtain waivers from                 certain Affordable Care Act requirements               (By Stephanie Armour and Michelle Hackman)       Many people who obtain health insurance through their      employers--about half of the country--could be at risk of      losing protections that limit out-of-pocket costs for      catastrophic illnesses, due to a little-noticed provision of      the House Republican health-care bill to be considered      Thursday, health-policy experts say.       The provision, part of a last-minute amendment, lets states      obtain waivers from certain Affordable Care Act insurance      regulations. Insurers in states that obtain the waivers could      be freed from a regulation mandating that they cover 10      particular types of health services, among them maternity      care, prescription drugs, mental health treatment and      hospitalization.       That could also affect plans offered by large employers,      health analysts said.       The ACA prevents employer plans from putting annual limits      on the amount of care they will cover, and it bars lifetime      limits on the 10 essential benefits. But in 2011, the Obama      administration issued guidance stating that employers aren't      bound by the benefits mandated by their state and can pick      from another state's list of required benefits. That guidance      was mostly meaningless because the ACA established a national      set of essential benefits.       Under the House bill, large employers could choose the      benefit requirements from any state--including those that are      allowed to lower their benchmarks under a waiver, health      analysts said. By choosing a waiver state, employers looking      to lower their costs could impose lifetime limits and      eliminate the out-of-pocket cost cap from their plans under      the GOP legislation.       The measure would give employers added flexibility to take      steps that could lower costs by limiting more-expensive      coverage areas. And it would lessen the federal regulation of      insurers, a goal of GOP lawmakers who believe the ACA is an      example of government overreach.       The impact on employer plans expands the scope of the      health bill to affect, potentially, everyone not insured by      Medicare or small-business plans, since the bill also      includes cuts to Medicaid and changes to the individual      market. Employer health plans are the single largest source      of health insurance in the country, with about 159 million      Americans receiving coverage through their jobs.       ``It's huge,'' said Andy Slavitt, former acting      administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid      Services under President Barack ``They're creating a      backdoor way to gut employer plans, too.''       But some experts say the impact could be less.       ``The real question is, would employers do this? Many      wouldn't,'' said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the      Kaiser Family ``Many employers offer quality      benefits to attract employees. But employers are always      looking for ways to lower costs.''       Fifty-nine percent of employers had a lifetime limit on how      much their insurance plans would cover before the ACA, ",CREC-2017-05-04-pt1-PgH4114-6.txt,2130,FOLLOW THE RULES ACT,2017.0,4.0,May
763,topic-id,1097,"Mr.Speaker, my question today is: How long will the opposition try to hold on to the failing Affordable Care Act? How long will they desperately try to hold on with their fingernails, screaming and thrashing at something that is failing so miserably?  Just this week, it was announced that 94 of 99 counties of Iowa will not have a carrier at all. In Michigan this year, individual policy premiums went up 20 percent, never mind deductibles and copays.  While currently 26 million Americans do not have coverage, 19.2 million either claim a waiver or pay a penalty that last year was $3 billion. Yet somehow the other side claims the Affordable Care Act is some form of nirvana.  The American Health Care Act guarantees issuance of coverage and targets assistance to those who have health challenges, in contrast to the Affordable Care Act that just thinks we should throw money at it. What amazes me, in my first few months here in Congress, if there is a problem, we will just throw money. The opposition wants a blank check, which will not work in this country. It is going to kill this country.  Let me suggest to my colleague from Michigan, my neighbor, that if he wants to schedule to go around the State and talk about the benefits of this program, the Affordable Care Act, I will go with him. We will go anywhere he would like to go.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from the Children's Hospital Association in opposition to this bill.                 [From Children's Hospital Association,                             27, 2017]      Children's Hospitals Urge House to Vote Against Amended AHCA               Lawmakers should know bill is bad for kids       Washington, DC.--On behalf of our nation's children's      hospitals and the patients and families they serve,      Children's Hospital Association (CHA) continues to oppose the      newly modified American Health Care Act (AHCA) and strongly      urges the House of Representatives to reject the bill.      Recently adopted changes only worsen the AHCA by putting      children with preexisting conditions at increased risk of      losing health care coverage and failing to correct the      Medicaid cuts that would impact over 30 million kids.       The legislation the House might consider for a vote as      early as the weekend would impose over $800 billion in cuts      on states by fundamentally changing Medicaid--a program over      40 percent of the children across the country depend on for      their health care coverage and access to medical care. Under[[Page H4133]]     the bill, Medicaid would no longer be able to flex with the      needs of enrollees, instead becoming a severely restricted      system of per capita caps or block grants.       The block grant option in particular would be devastating      to children as it eliminates Medicaid's EPSDT (Early and      Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment) benefit which      ensures children receive immunizations, mental health      assessments and vision, eye and hearing exams as well as      other medical services they might need. A block grant would      also remove cost-sharing protections for children,      essentially creating new barriers to care for low-income,      working families.       CHA urgently asks members of Congress to vote against the      Medicaid must be maintained to ensure children receive      the coverage and medical care that return lifelong benefits      into adulthood. Investing in children's health advances a      better future for our nation.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include a statement from Families USA in opposition to this bill.                           [From FAMILIESUSA]  Latest House GOP Proposal--``Upton Amendment''--Still Leaves People               with Pre-Existing Conditions Out in the Cold       Washington, DC.--Republicans in the House today are      discussing a so-called compromise that ostensibly adds $8      billion to their Affordable Care Act (ACA) repeal bill in an      attempt to appease members worried that the bill strips      coverage guarantees for people with pre-existing conditions.      Below is a statement from Families USA Executive Director      Frederick       ``Despite today's wheeling and dealing, the GOP repeal bill      still drops the coverage guarantee for people with pre-     existing conditions, strips coverage from millions, and      drives up costs for millions more. A measly $8 billion      handout isn't going to change that. The bill also decimates      Medicaid--more than $800 billion in cuts. That hurts seniors,      people with disabilities, and children like Jimmy Kimmel's      son who he so eloquently spoke of Monday night. Remember,      half of the births in America are reimbursed through            ``The Upton $8 billion is a non-solution--money thrown at      `high-risk pools' that experts on both sides of the aisle      have warned lead to higher costs, fewer benefits, and waiting      lists rationing care for those with pre-existing conditions.       ``Republicans in the House can do all the backroom vote-     trading they want; their bill will still harm millions and      millions of people in America and breaks President Trump's      promise to cover everybody and protect people with pre-     existing conditions. This isn't what people in America want.      It is time for the GOP to drop this deeply flawed legislation      and move on to efforts that will help, and not hurt,      America's families.''  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include a statement from the Association of American Medical Colleges in opposition to this bill.                        [From AAMC, May 2, 2017] AAMC Statement on the MacArthur Amendment to the American Health Care                                   Act       AAMC (Association of American Medical Colleges) President      and CEO Darrell Kirch, MD, issued the following statement      regarding the amendment to the American Health Care Act      (AHCA) introduced by Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.):       ``This week, the House could vote on a new version of the      American Health Care Act that includes the MacArthur      amendment. Unfortunately, the amendment does not address the      limitations in the original measure, such as making high-     quality, affordable health insurance available to all, and      maintaining programs to support the health care safety net--     at least at current levels--until other comparable coverage      expansions are available.       The amendment's treatment of essential health benefits and      health status underwriting dilutes protections for many      Americans and would leave individuals with preexisting      conditions facing higher premiums and reduced access to vital      care.       The shortcomings in the underlying bill remain the same.      The original analysis from the Congressional Budget Office      indicated that 14 million Americans would lose their health      insurance coverage as early as next year, and as many as 24      million by 2024. Nothing in the bill has changed that alters      the fact that this legislation would lead to fewer Americans      with quality insurance, less affordable coverage for those      who have it, and the destabilization of the current Medicaid      program.       We continue to urge members of Congress to engage with the      nation's medical schools and teaching hospitals and other      stakeholders to find ways to achieve high quality health care      for all Americans.''

835,topic-id,636,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands so very, very much for yielding to me.  I rise today to speak with you, Mr.Speaker, because we have gotten so many complaints about the messaging that Democrats have around this bill, and I just want to keep the main thing the main thing, and I just want to talk to you, Mr.Speaker, very directly.  We talked a lot about the 22 million, 23 million people who will lose their healthcare if we were to repeal and replace so-called But this goes deeper than that.  This undermines the Medicaid program, a program that will be 52 years old on July 30, if it survives. This takes away the eligibility, changes eligibility standards; and right now, Mr.Speaker, there are 70 million people who rely upon Let me tell you, Mr.Speaker, tomorrow it could be you.  The average age of a Member of the House of Representatives is 57. The average age of a Senator is 61. So, I mean, Mr.Speaker, you are one stroke away, one heart attack away from becoming disabled. And after they wipe out your IRA and your pension and your Social Security so they can care for you, long-term care, or allow you to stay home, you, too, Mr.Speaker, could end up relying on Medicaid to have a decent end-of-life experience or to be able to stay in your home.  You are one kidney failure away, one car accident away. Even though you make $179,000 a year, you don't have enough money, Mr.Speaker, were you to have a disabled child that would need extensive care. You would depend on the Medicaid program.  You know, so many people don't care about what is going on here because they think it couldn't happen to them, that those 70 million people who rely on Medicaid is someone other than them. But, no, Mr.Speaker, it is you.  And even if you don't, God willing, have a stroke or a heart attack, you are someone who is going to suffer from the cost shifting so that, when 22 million people lose their healthcare, your premiums are going to go up. Your deductibles are going to go up. And God forbid that you have arthritis or some other preexisting condition, because under this bill you will be left at the tender mercies of our insurance companies where they can charge five times as much for someone who has aged or has a preexisting condition.  Hospitals in your nice suburban rural area may find themselves being shut down because they don't get Medicaid payments, and community health centers--not just Planned Parenthood, Mr.Speaker, that you are ideologically opposed to, but those community health centers that serve rural communities.  And how cruel could a bill be where 50 percent of the children born in this country rely on Medicaid? How cruel could a bill be when 7 million people with disabilities, represented, you know, by those folks who were tossed out of here in their wheelchairs the other day? And we will find that after we end the entitlement to Medicaid, we will have disabled people and children and people who need skilled nursing care fighting with each other because they will have to win the lottery in order to be able to access the crumbs that fall from the master's table of the States in which they live.  Mr.Speaker, this bill will have an impact on you. It is not just poor people. It is everybody. And I would urge the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, for us to be mindful of the fact that all Americans, every American relies on decent, good healthcare. This is the largest healthcare program in our country that is about to be dismantled, and I would urge caution and tell everyone, especially you, Mr.Speaker, to beware.

700,topic-id,1163,"Madam President, I come from a State that in some ways is very similar to yours, the State of You get to see firsthand the impact of trade and exports on the people, on jobs, and on the economic opportunity of my communities. Our State economy relies on our ability to sell the products we grow and manufacture to people around the globe.  Strengthening our trade relationships and expanding market access for exports abroad creates a greater opportunity for Kansans today and those who follow us. One of my goals has always been to make certain that communities across Kansas remain a place in which the young men and women who grow up there find it to be a place to raise their families. Our ability to do that, especially in a small, rural community with agriculture and agricultural exports, is so important. It is a way that we can really put America first.  If our goal is to have an America that has strength and prosperity, we ought to continue to focus on improving our Nation's economy. That is one of the things that I appreciate--we seem to be focused in such a significant way on our ability to grow an economy. I think we are poised for much greater things economically.  ``Economics'' may sound like just one of those words, but what that means is more jobs, better jobs, more secure jobs, jobs for our children so that maybe they can pay back their student loans. This country desperately needs the jobs in the communities across Kansas and around the country, and it is really what we call the American dream.  Trade, including our ability to sell the food and fiber we grow in our State, is a key part that drives our economy forward. Almost half of the wheat grown in Kansas is exported to foreign markets. What that means is, if you weren't doing that, nearly half of the acres planted in our State would be idle. That means the communities those farmers and ranchers live in and around would have half of the amount of economic activity that currently is occurring. American ranchers ship over 1 million metric tons of beef to consumers abroad. Thousands of acres of corn, sorghum, and soybeans being planted this spring across Kansas and the Nation will ultimately be exported.  Approximately 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside America's borders. To reach those consumers, our Nation must produce a trade policy that grows the existing export markets while continuously building and developing new ones. Without export markets, both production and prices would fall for farmers and ranchers, and rural communities supported by agriculture would disappear. The revenue generated by exports not only keeps family farmers and ranchers afloat, it drives rural economies and supports small businesses.  The aerospace industry, which is so important in Kansas, also relies on an integrated supply chain and strong trade policy. Wichita, KS--appropriately labeled the ``Air Capital of the World''--manufactures more than half of the world's general aviation light aircraft and business jets. Without trade, aerospace and manufacturing facilities in Wichita and surrounding areas and Kansas City and surrounding areas would not exist and workers in those factories would be left without job opportunities.  It is critical that we protect these jobs, many of which depend upon the United States having a strong economic relationship with Canada and The North America Free-Trade Agreement, which went into effect in 1994, plays a significant role in supporting trade with those two neighboring nations.  Of course, the world and technology have changed since 1994 when that agreement was entered into. There are areas of the agreement that can be improved and modernized. Many of those changes have been discussed and are issues that the United States, Canada, and Mexico agreed to during TPP negotiations, such as strengthening our intellectual property rights and new provisions for e-commerce.  If we work collaboratively with Mexico and Canada to address the issues with NAFTA, including the issues on which we strongly disagree, I am confident we can improve the agreement for all parties. But efforts to pull out of NAFTA completely or to weaken our trading relationship with Canada and Mexico during renegotiations would cause significant damage to the American economy. We must have willing negotiators sitting across the table when discussing NAFTA, and that starts with treating our neighbors as trade partners and as friends. We need to treat these folks as friends, and we need to seize the opportunities we have.  Working together to improve NAFTA or building economic relations with other trading partners does not mean America should take a step back from enforcing the current rules. Oftentimes in the past, we have been too focused on striking trade deals and selling them to the public, but we haven't done enough to make sure other countries are playing by the rules that are negotiated. Nontariff barriers and unfair trading practices by foreign countries harm our producers, workers, and consumers.  We must make certain American producers are competing on a level playing field in a global market and that our jobs and wages are not being undermined by other countries' efforts to distort trade policies and trade agreements.  Many Americans have lost confidence in trade agreements, and I believe that is partly because the benefits of trade agreements have been oversold, while the enforcement of unfair trade practices have been insufficient. In promoting agreements, leaders had set expectations for increased jobs, higher wages, growth in exports, and many other metrics that were impossible to meet. When these exaggerated promises did not come to fruition, many people lost confidence in those trade agreements.  America should strengthen our commitment to holding other countries accountable in order to inspire greater confidence from the American public in our Nation's ability to reach a trade agreement that benefits us all.  Weakening our trade relations will cause Kansans to lose jobs. Farmers and ranchers will no longer be able to pursue their careers and lifestyle. But with strong leadership and smart negotiating, I am convinced that America can improve our trade relationships in the world and continue to build on the economic successes we have today.  A robust U.economy that provides market opportunities for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers, and job prospects for workers is an essential pillar of America's strength and well-being. Strong trade relationships, particularly with Canada and Mexico, are primary drivers of our Nation's economy. We must protect those relationships and carefully consider changes in our approach to trade to be certain that Americans continue to benefit from economic opportunities that are created by a strong trade policy.  Madam President, our relationships with Mexico and Canada are important and in many ways determine the economic future of the people of my State at home.[[Page S2902]]  Madam President, I yield the floor.

815,topic-id,1283,"Mr.President, I joined our colleagues today at lunch, and one of the conversations I had with one of my Democratic colleagues was how surprising, perhaps, but certainly how pleasing it was that today the Senate, in a bipartisan fashion, addressed some contentious issues related to sanctions in regard to Iran; issues related to sanctions in regard to Both of those issues, because of the political climate and because of past history, could be fraught with great opportunity for partisanship to be exhibited in full force. The conversation I had with my colleague was how surprising and, more importantly, how pleasing it was that didn't happen.[[Page S3545]]  I commend the Senate and its leadership for working together to resolve their potential differences and creating this opportunity for us to have a debate, a discussion, both on public policy--that I think is important to the security of the world--and the safety of Americans here in the United  I am here, in part, to express my support for the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act, the legislation we addressed today. It permits our government to target those individuals and institutions responsible for a foreign policy that puts American lives at risk and undermines the security, particularly in the Middle East, but really of the globe.  The theocratic, autocratic regime's survival in Iran depends currently on the human rights abuses and political oppression. Eight years after the Green Movement's protests, the group's leaders remain under house arrest. Members of that movement were tortured. Still, today, Iranian Americans are unreasonably detained without hope for release in The Iranian regime's survival depends further on its control of its economy. When it was brokered, proponents of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action argued it would provide economic benefit to the Iranian people.  So when President Obama negotiated--and this Congress, this Senate, failed to reject the JCPOA--one of the arguments about its benefits is that everyday Iranians would enjoy greater economic opportunity. Instead, a recent Reuters study shows businesses directly tied to the Supreme Leader and the IRGC are the main beneficiaries of those changes in our relationship with Despite renewed economic growth, Iran's unemployment rate is estimated to be as high as 12 percent, and that figure could be as high as almost 30 percent among Iranian youth.  Survival of Khamenei's regime depends on stoking hatred of America as a way to whip up support. Iran uses small boats to swarm American Navy ships protecting the free navigation of the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian This is disturbing for a number of reasons, but the importance of that Strait's role in global economy certainly is one of them. In addition, it is linked to scouting soft American targets for terrorism.  So we continue to see bad behavior, threatening behavior by the Iranian government toward the United States and our global interest in the Strait of Hormuz and the suggestion that Iran is preparing and looking for opportunities for terrorist attacks against the United States and its allies in the Middle  Last week, two Hezbollah operatives were arrested here in the United They were doing surveillance on targets in New York and on our embassies as well in Israel and Two terrorism specialists, Dan Byman of Georgetown and Scott Stewart of Stratfor, tweeted in reaction to this news that this could be a case of Iran sending us an ominous message; that Iran can play the terror card if it wants to. If that is indeed the signal Tehran is sending to us, it is important--it is imperative, in fact, that we send a message of our own that no civilized country resorts to planning to kill innocent civilians. The legislation we passed today informs that regime that the JCPOA does not provide impunity for Iran to make such plans.  Iran threatens its neighbors with its ongoing ballistic missile development, which was not part of the Hezbollah is armed with tens of thousands of rockets, threatening Israel's security. This is the same group which has been instrumental in propping up the Assad regime in Syria and which is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands. The head of the IRGC forces was seen on the Syria and Iraq border just this past weekend. We know Assad's regime would have not survived without Iran's continued financial and military support. Again, this legislation underscores the Senate's belief that the Iranian regime must not be allowed to continue conducting and destabilizing activities under the shield of the  I was an opponent to the JCPOA, but today's actions are unrelated to undermining that agreement, which is now in place. They are designed to hold back further activities by the Iranian regime against America and its interests. It is really a requirement that Iran act within the nation-states' Code of Conduct--the normal behavior of a country around the globe.  Previous administrations, in my view, failed to challenge Iran on way too many fronts. With this legislation, the Senate is intent on pushing back on Iran's adventurism in the Middle East and beyond. By imposing appropriate sanctions and requiring the Secretaries of State, Defense and Treasury, as well as Director of National Intelligence, to formulate a coherent strategy to counter Iran's influence in the region, we say to the regime that their activities will be countered every step of the way.  This legislation plays a part in doing what Dan Byman, the professor--the terrorism expert--testified to our House counterparts last month. His words were to ``highlight the costs of Iran's adventurism to ordinary Iranians to raise domestic awareness of, and discontent with, the regime's foreign policy.''  There remains more that can be done to challenge Iran and constrict its resources. Many amendments were filed to strengthen this legislation that were not ultimately considered. One of those was mine. Last year, the Obama administration announced it would pay $1.7 billion to Iran in an effort to settle a longstanding financial dispute. Transferring cash to a leading state sponsor of terror was a bad idea when the Senate considered the 2015 nuclear agreement, and it remains a bad idea, a terrible idea today.  The amendment I offered to today's legislation would limit the President's ability to transfer funds to This amendment directs that the U.Government puts justice for American victims of Iranian terrorism ahead of the payments to the Iranian's regime. No administration should transfer funds related to the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal without first requiring settlement of all damages already awarded in judgments made in the U.courts against Iran for their terrorism crimes against our own citizens. Paying our own citizens from that fund before any money is transferred to the Iranian regime makes sense, common sense, and it is surrounded by the sense of justice and right.  While my amendment was not one of those considered by the Senate yet, we will be introducing this concept as freestanding legislation in the near future.  I know sanctions alone will not change Iran's regime's behavior. Incidentally, we need our allies and friends to join us in this sanction effort. Yet we know the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act remains an important bill to impose costs on the regime in Iran and, hopefully, to encourage more of the discontent we saw during the recent elections. Perhaps there will rise an equivalent to the 2009 Green Movement that offers Iranians one more opportunity to throw off the yoke of theocratic rule of tyranny and get the government they deserve--one that respects their rights and has the desire to coexist peacefully with its neighbors.

901,topic-id,1307,"Mr.President, this week, our Nation observes National Police This year, during National Police Week, we pay tribute to 143 officers who died in the line of duty during 2016--among them, Sergeant Allen David Brandt of the Fairbanks Police I come to the floor to acknowledge not only Sergeant Brandt but all those officers who served us so honorably.  Sergeant Brandt's wife Natasha and children, Fritz, Kate, Claire, and Belle have traveled all the way from Fairbanks to participate in the events this week. They are accompanied by Allen's best friend, Officer Phil McBroom of the North Pole Police Department, as well as a large group of colleagues from the Fairbanks Police Department, led by Chief Eric  Chief Jewkes, joined by Sergeant Lockwood and Officer Werner, came into Washington for Police Week in a somewhat unique way. They joined 2,200 officers from around the Nation in a 4-day charity bike ride from Northern New Jersey to Washington, They call it the Police Unity Tour, and their motto is: ``We ride for those who died.''  Police Week begins with the dedication of names added this year to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial on Judiciary That dedication occurs during a very, very moving candlelight vigil at the beginning of Police The candlelight vigil was conducted on Saturday evening on the National Mall this year.  Chief Jewkes, in full uniform, read Allen's name before a crowd numbering 10,000 people or more. A bell was rung, acknowledging the loss of Allen David Allen's name was the only Alaska name added to the wall this year.  I wish to thank Craig Floyd, who is the president of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, for the courtesy in affording Chief Jewkes this special honor.  Allen's name is now inscribed in perpetuity on the memorial wall among the 21,000 officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice. His name appears on the bottom of Panel 21-This week, the shoulder patch of the Fairbanks Police Department is affixed at the top of that panel. Quite coincidentally, a few lines up on that same panel are the names of Officers Matt Tokuoka and Anthony Wallace of the Hoonah Police Department, who were brought down by an assailant's bullet in 2010.  During Police Week, we do not dwell on the circumstances under which law enforcement officers gave their lives. We rather focus on how they lived their exemplary lives, and, yes, we pay our respects to the fallen, but Police Week also looks forward. The annual survivor's seminar, sponsored by Concerns of Police Survivors, which helps those who have suffered a law enforcement tragedy grieve and ultimately recover, is an important part of this week as well.  While so much of Police Week is for the law enforcement family, those of us in Washington cannot help but notice what is going on around us--officers in uniform, honor guards, motorcycles, police cars from around the country, the entire law enforcement family--Federal, State, local, Tribal, and visiting officers from places like Canada, England, and  Many visiting officers bring their spouses. Some bring their children. We are able to truly see the faces behind those uniforms and those badges, and we can look into the eyes of the families.  Let me say a few words about the children who have come in for the observance. You see them on the Metro, sitting atop their father's shoulders. Daddy is wearing his dress uniform. At the candlelight vigil, one of my staff members witnessed a U.Park Police officer, in uniform, explaining to her young daughter the meaning of the ceremony. You experience the words of the children at the memorial wall itself, where Emma Moody, the 10-year-old daughter of a fallen California officer, left a hand-drawn memorial to her dad, and it reads:       When I get to heaven the first thing I am going to do is      find you. The second thing I will do is never ever let you go      again.  When you experience things like this, you cannot help but appreciate the humanity behind the uniforms--a father, a mother, an aunt, an uncle, a friend, a colleague, a neighbor. Law enforcement is no stranger to controversy. Yet it is so important that we see beyond controversy; that when we look at an officer we see the humanity that runs toward danger and not from it; the humanity that responds to every call for service, not knowing whether it will be the last; the humanity that kisses a child goodbye before beginning a shift, not knowing whether he will ever see those children again; the humanity that was Allen  The story I just recited is Allen's story. Allen was released from the hospital after being shot five times by an assailant. He died from complications associated with a second series of surgeries.  Allen lived long enough to appear before the Fairbanks City Council and thank the community for their support. He also offered some very cautionary words. He said:       Our officers do a very hard job, most of the time      thankless. Working weekends when their friends are with their      families. Working nights and sleeping during the day. We need      your support and not just when bad things happen.  A few weeks later, Anchorage Police Officer Arn Salao thought he was responding to a call involving a dispute between a cabdriver and his passenger. When he arrived at the scene, he was ambushed and shot four times. Miraculously, Officer Salao survived his injuries.  In spite of these tragedies, it is dispiriting that people continue to challenge law enforcement. Last week, Colonel James Cockrell, retired after 30 years with the Alaska State Troopers, and just prior to his retirement, reflected on the dangers troopers face. Assaults on Alaska State Troopers are up, from 52 in 2013 to 131 last year.  I wish to share with the Senate a few lines from an interview with KTUU in Colonel Cockrell said:       I think there's generally a little bit less respect for law      enforcement. I think a lot of that spurred from the Lower 48.      We're having troopers contact people in a one-on-one      situation. Individuals are more apt to fight with us if they      think they have an advantage, when we don't have backup. We      don't have two or three troopers responding to a high risk      crime in progress. The consequences are that people are more      apt to fight with our  All of this is deeply tragic. As I look across the Nation, we are not really seeing any signs of abatement. Some might be attributable to the opioid crisis, some to a loss of respect for law enforcement, and some simply because suspects challenge law enforcement in hopes of evading them.  This year, law enforcement has already suffered 48 line-of-duty deaths, 17 of those from gunfire. This fact is not lost on the officers from Interior Alaska who are in our Nation's Capital this week. It is not lost on those who are considering law enforcement careers but decide to perhaps take a pass, leaving critical vacancies in agencies throughout the country. Law enforcement remains very dangerous work, and for all the satisfaction that comes from serving people in their darkest[[Page S2960]]moments, there are no guarantees the officer will return home.  I hope that, during this National Police Week and throughout the year, we will reflect on Allen Brandt's final words: ``Law enforcement needs our support and not just when bad things happen.''  In these times, law enforcement needs that support now more than ever. On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I offer my continued condolences to Natasha Brandt and her family, to Allen Brandt's colleagues, and to survivors of law enforcement tragedies everywhere.

707,topic-id,1039,"Mr.President, I thank Senator Merkley for his remarks this week, as this body has been rightly focused on the firing of James Comey[[Page S2904]]and the imagined rationale that the President gave.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, secret meetings have been happening amongst our Republican colleagues to draft a healthcare bill that could have devastating consequences on the people we all represent. I know we are about to have a vote on the floor, but I wanted to come to the floor to simply remind all of my friends on both sides of the aisle of the promises that have been made about this process and this piece of legislation which emerged from the House last week with devastating consequences. Those consequences include 24 million people losing coverage and people with preexisting conditions being subjected to $200,000 premium increases, potentially.  I just reference the words of the President of the United States, who told us repeatedly over and over again, during the campaign and after the campaign, that the result of this healthcare reform debate was going to be a healthcare system that was better. President Trump outlined that in a number of different ways.  Here is what he said on April 30, just a few weeks ago. He said:       The healthcare plan is on its way. Will have much lower      premiums & deductibles, while at the same time taking care of      preexisting conditions!  That is not true. That is a lie. The healthcare bill that emerged from the House of Representatives did none of those things.  CBO has not come out with its final estimate. It is unbelievable that the House voted on a reordering of one-sixth of the American economy without a CBO estimate, but we can pretty much be sure that the first CBO estimate will hold, in that it will say that premiums are going to go up by 15 to 20 percent immediately for everybody, and then for the nonyoung healthy and wealthy, premiums are going to go up even higher.  It didn't take care of preexisting conditions. It did the opposite--allowed every State to be able to walk away from the protection of the Affordable Care Act, which makes sure people with preexisting conditions, which could be one-third of all Americans, can't be subject to higher rates, and it substituted that requirement with a high-risk pool which is dramatically underfunded to the point that it is laughable, in the opinion of many healthcare economists.  Here is what Donald Trump said earlier this year:       We're going to have insurance for everybody. People covered      under the law can expect to have great healthcare. . . . Much      less expensive and much better insurance for everybody.  CBO says 24 million people will lose their insurance, and that number might be higher when the new estimate comes out. This wasn't true. This was a lie.  Finally, the President said, during the campaign:       I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state      there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare &       No cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--this is a giant cut to This is an $880 billion cut to Medicaid being used to finance a giant tax cut for people making over $200,000 a year. This wasn't true. This was a lie as well.  A lot of Democrats will be willing to talk about making our healthcare system better, but we want our Republican colleagues, as they are having these behind-closed-door meetings, to remember the promises that were made. They said nobody would lose insurance, premiums would go down--not up--and your benefit package wouldn't become worse. If Republicans can deliver on those promises, then there is a discussion to be had. But if anything looking like the House product emerges, it is a violation of the promises this President and many Republicans made over and over again.  Finally, I also want all my colleagues to remember what is happening as we speak. Leader McConnell was on the floor talking about premium increases announced by Blue Cross Blue Shield in What he failed to mention was the head of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Maryland came out and specifically said that a big part of the reason they were asking for major premium increases was because of the actions President Trump is taking right now to sabotage the Affordable Care They were not sure the individual mandate was going to be enforced. Why? Because in an Executive order this President signed, he directed his agencies to undermine the Affordable Care Act and to withdraw many of the fees levied on Americans, such as that which comes if you don't get insurance. He stopped advertising for the exchanges for the last week. We were on target to have more people sign up this year than ever before; but then, in the last week, the President withdrew all the money for the exchanges. Right now, as we speak, this administration is bleeding out the money for insurers to help pay for cost sharing within the exchanges 1 month at a time, not telegraphing if there is going to be any certainty for that funding in the future.  The President is undermining and sabotaging the ACA every single day. The reason insurers are passing along premium increases or considering withdrawing from these exchanges is because of this sabotage the administration is undertaking of our entire healthcare system. I hope these behind-closed-door meetings take into account all of the promises this President and our Republican friends made that they would repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something better. Everything we hear is that the product that emerged out of the House of Representatives--the product that may emerge out of the Senate--violates every single one of these promises.  We await the ability to work together, Republicans and Democrats, to preserve what works in the healthcare system, to fix what doesn't work, and to hold our Republican friends and the President of the United States to their promises.

911,topic-id,619,"Mr.Speaker, we recently learned troubling details surrounding the terms of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran from early last year. As I have said before, the more details we learn about this deal, the more apparent it is that it was neither prudent nor transparent.  The safety and security of the American people and our allies around the world should remain a top priority for the United But we are learning, according to reports, as part of this prisoner swap with Iran in 2016, the Obama administration released seven prisoners and dropped charges and international arrest warrants of 14 fugitives, many of whom had been directly involved in supplying Iran with U.S.-built equipment or sensitive information that could be used for military systems, primarily Iran's nuclear program.  The administration downplayed the security threat that these men posed. In a variety of ways, these individuals deliberately worked to undermine the United States and smuggle American military technology to  In one instance, a man was allegedly part of a conspiracy to steal sensitive software information from a defense contractor in Another one of the men was in the middle of serving an 8-year prison sentence on charges related to a separate conspiracy to provide satellite technology and hardware to  Three of the fugitives were allegedly working to lease an aircraft from Boeing for an Iranian airline that authorities say supported Hezbollah, which the United States, of course, has designated as a terrorist organization.  And the list goes on as these are just a few of the cases. All of this poses a serious threat to our national security as sensitive military information and technology could be used to bolster Iran's weapons programs.  As you may recall, this comes after we learned last fall that, as a part of the deal, the United States paid $400 million that was contingent on Iran releasing four American hostages. This broke from longstanding United States policy to not pay ransoms to rogue nations because it encourages bad actors like Iran to take more hostages. Again, this was not made known to Congress or the American public. We only learned about it nearly a year after the deal was finalized.  What makes this most concerning or more disconcerting is the Obama administration's lack of transparency on the backgrounds of these prisoners. These are not merely civilians or businessmen, as the President and his officials referred to them on multiple occasions. The administration left the impression that these individuals were nothing more than violators of sanctions and not as dangerous as they truly were. Each of these men pose very real threats that the administration hid from the American people.  This isn't a partisan talking point, Mr.Even President Obama's own Justice Department had accused many of these men of being involved in terrorist activities.  I support diplomatic efforts with Iran, and I am hopeful that we can continue to engage in diplomacy and secure a good deal at some point, but this latest news continues to exemplify why both Republicans and Democrats could not and did not support this deal.  Iran continues to push every boundary, exploit every loophole, and avoid as much oversight as possible, all while it is antagonizing the rest of the world. It continues to reap the benefits of this deal at the expense of our national security and that of our allies, such as  We continue to learn something new and bad about this deal that wasn't shared with Congress or the public.

810,topic-id,2310,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about a train wreck that is coming to our country right before our very eyes.  Yesterday, the Federal Reserve, for the fourth time in the last year and a half, increased the Federal discount rate by one-quarter point--one-quarter point. That is a rounding error in most people's imaginations; yet, I think it is a very impactful number. That is the fourth increase in the last year and a half that amounts to 100 basis points or a 1 full percentage point increase in the discount rate. With a $20 trillion debt, that equates to about $200 billion of new interest that we will be required to pay out of the revenue we get off the backs of working men and women in  I have frequently come to this floor to speak about the $20 trillion debt, but, as we see what is happening now, we see the reality of what has been predicted over the last few years; that is, as we start talking about growth in the economy, we see a demand for capital and interest rates rising. We also see the Federal Reserve talking about adjusting their balance sheet--some $4.5 trillion on their balance sheet, the largest balance sheet they have had in history--they are now talking about unwinding that.  So these are dramatic impacts on what we are talking about right now; that is, how we fund what we are going to be doing not only in healthcare but also our military, as well as the domestic programs we are here to talk about.  What is even more disturbing about the debt we are talking about and the increases in interest is the structure of that debt. Over the last 8 years, the prior administration decided strategically to keep our bond portfolio that supports this debt, the bonds we issue that pay for this debt--the average duration, the length of those bonds, is under 3 years. Some 60 percent, almost, of all the government debt we have in the United States today matures in 3 years or less. That means these increases we are talking about are going to roll on us and the backs of the American taxpayer almost immediately. This is not something that is going to happen in 10 or 15 years; it is right here on us.  Let me put that in perspective. Most every other country in the world that has significant debt--and there are a lot of them; not to the percentage that we do--have already dealt with this duration problem. The UK, for example, over the last 8 years, instead of going short when interest rates were virtually zero, they went long. Forty-eight percent of the United Kingdom's debt is 20 years or longer in maturity. Again, 60 percent of our debt, because of the last administration's strategic decision to stay short--borrow short and spend long--that is a prescription for failure, in business and in government.  Sixty percent of our debt matures in less than 3 years. That is a formula for absolute disaster, and that is what I am talking about.  But even more important than the debt and the duration and the way these interest rate increases are going to impact us almost readily is the fact that we have about 43 days--I came to the floor last week and reported that we had 50 days left, and today we have 43 working days left in this fiscal year before September 30. That means we have to fund the Federal Government for fiscal year 2018 by the end of In the last 43 years, this body--Congress--has only done that four times in regular order; according to the 1974 Budget Act, only four times.  What is worse than that is that in the 43 days that we have, from an effective standpoint, we really only have 25 working days left in this I would argue that with the debt ceiling, with healthcare, with the tax package, with the appropriations process, and the funding of the government, I just don't see any way that is possible. I think that when we are talking to the American public, we need to come clean.  I believe that, like in most years in the past, we are going to be pressured in this body again, just like we have 178 times. We have been forced into a continuing resolution in this body in order to get past some arcade financing limitation we have had. So that means we have by the end of September to fund the Federal Historically, we have only done that four times, according to regular order. The other times of the 43 years, either a CR or an omnibus was done. But 178 continuing resolutions got us past the end of the fiscal year, moved on to an omnibus of some sort, and then the release valve in all of those occasions was more debt, more spending.  It is very difficult because the budget process itself is broken. And because of that, between now and the end of September, I personally--I am just a business guy, but I have no imagination of how we are going to fund this government by passing 12 appropriations bills. As a matter of fact, since 1974, this body has only averaged passing 2.5 appropriations bills a year out of the 12. Now, you tell me, in the next 43 days, are we going to pass 12 bills to fund this Federal Government? There is no way.  So my call on our colleagues here on both sides of the aisle is, let's get busy right now. I don't care what the structure is, as long as it is not a continuing resolution because that ties the hands of our military. They cannot deal with that. It limits their ability to move money from one department to another. If they wanted to move money from armor to infantry just in the Army alone, they cannot do that. And with the risks we face around the world today, that is an impossibility.  We are working feverishly right now to change the budget process. It will not affect us this year. This is something we have to get serious on right now.[[Page S3542]]  I believe we are poised to have a turnaround in this economy. Consumer confidence is up. It hasn't been higher than this level in 13 years. CEO confidence is higher than it has been in 15 years. Manufacturing confidence hasn't been this high in over 20 years. Why? Because they see some regulations being rolled back right now by this administration and this  We passed 13 bills out of 14 that we brought forward that pulled back onerous regulations. Just this week, we had the Secretary of Treasury tell us that some 70 percent of the limitations on our banks--not the controls that protect us against another 2008 and 2009 disaster but the controls that are unnecessary and keeping capital tied up in small and regional banks unnecessarily.  We have some $6 trillion not at work in this economy because of bad fiscal policy right here in What we are trying to do is unwind that, get it back into the economy.  By the way, if the Federal Reserve releases their $4.5 trillion and we don't find a way to unleash this $6 trillion, tell me where the capital is going to come from.  I am here to tell you that I believe we are on the brink of an economic turnaround if we can, in fact, effect a reasonable improvement in healthcare, get on and fund the government in a responsible way before September 30, and move on and get a tax package done this year.  People right now are working on their budgets for business for fiscal year 2018--right now. By the end of their Q3, they will have that done. Their capital budgets, which go out many years, are being done too. So they are handicapping right now whether we will in fact get that tax package done.  My argument is this: Let's get these things dealt with right now on a timely basis--the debt ceiling, funding the government--and move on to this tax package so we can, in fact, get that done so that business entities and our free enterprise system can, in fact, budget accordingly so that we can get some of these benefits into the economy as early as late next year. If we don't get that tax package done before Christmas, I don't believe we will have any impact in fiscal year 2018 from that.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, with the events this week, I would hope our body could find a way to lower the vitriol, to lower the hysteria when we have a difference of opinion and to find a way to look at what we might agree on, on an issue, as well as what we might disagree on. Yet, as I stand here today listening to some of the speeches, just today I am shocked because it is business as usual in this body. The vitriol is at a very high level. The misinformation is at an extremely high level.  Remember when then-President Obama said: If you like your insurance you can keep your insurance; if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor; premiums will go down under ObamaCare; deductibles will go down; everybody will have insurance. The CBO overestimated by 20 million the number of people who would sign up for ObamaCare, and, oh, by the way, we are going to institute a 30-hour workweek limitation to define ``full-time work'' and we are going to limit it so anybody with over 51 employees has to comply.  We now know--both sides even agree--that it is failing. What they are saying now, though, is that they are relying back on the argument: Let's move to regular order now; let's make sure we all get this done together. Where was that conversation in 2008 and 2009, when behind closed doors a supermajority crammed down the throat of the minority this thing called ObamaCare? Remember that in the House of Representatives then-Speaker Pelosi said: If you want to find out what is in the bill, you have to vote for the bill. I think it was a matter of hours that day before when the Senate got the bill. They had to look at the bill before they had to vote on it that night.  But let's look at the reality. ObamaCare is collapsing under its own weight. We know rates are up over 105 percent nationally. In my State alone, they have more than doubled in the last 3 years. Deductibles are up even more than that. Forty-five percent of the counties in the United States are down to one carrier. In my State alone, Georgia, we have 159 counties and 96 are down to one carrier. States like Ohio, Virginia, Iowa, Tennessee, and Missouri are told now that they are losing their last carrier in the individual market.  But let me highlight the reality here. Before the Affordable Care Act, 48 million people in the United States did not have insurance. That was a catastrophe. We all agree with that. Today, however, what nobody on the other side talks about is that 28 million people today in America--the richest country in the history of the world--still do not have healthcare coverage. I can't see how that is a success by any measure. Of the 20 million who got insurance over the last 6 years, 16 million of them did not got get it through It came through the Medicaid expansion. Of the remaining 4 million, 2 million are like me and my wife, who were canceled and then had to come back into the Affordable Care Act unwillingly. That was our only choice. Oh, by the way, we had to have a program that had so many other features in it that our rates doubled over that period of time.  It just seems to me that what we have before us today is an opportunity to clean up this mess and provide for the things that were broken in 2008. We know we have to cover preexisting conditions. We don't want people to have their insurance canceled just because they get sick. That is not the American way. That had to be fixed, and we are going to continue that.  People have to have access, though, and right now, with the cost, many people are coming off of healthcare in the individual market because they simply can't make the financial equation work. The premiums are too much. In my own family, one of my sons can't understand the deductibles. So the financial equation for the very people who need it doesn't make any sense.  We can do things to get premiums down by allowing the free market to provide the types of services inside insurance products that people actually want and not ask them to pay for products they don't need.  We have to make sure Medicaid can be sustained long term.  Lastly, I think we have to make sure that, as we deal with the preexisting conditions, we make sure that everybody in America has access to healthcare. Nobody is talking about taking away access from the American people in terms of healthcare.  Whether it is healthcare, the military, the VA, or any of our domestic programs, we have a serious funding problem. Our mechanism that funds the programs is broken. It has never worked since 1974, except for four times, and that was prior to 1980, and we have to fix it. But right now, in 43 days--between now and September 30--we have to fund this government, or all the other rhetoric will be idle chatter.  I yield the floor.

801,topic-id,980,"Mr.President, I rise today to reiterate my support for the resolution of disapproval related to the sale of certain defense articles to the Kingdom of Saudi While the resolution, unfortunately, did not pass the Senate in a recent vote, I believe its goals remain important.  The Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen is fueling a humanitarian disaster. Over 10,000 people have died, and over 3 million people have been displaced as the conflict has exacerbated poverty, famine, and disease. According to UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, a cholera outbreak in Yemen could quadruple to infect 300,000 people in the coming weeks. Half of the current cholera cases affect children, and the ongoing conflict leaves few hospitals to turn to and almost no medical supplies.  In addition to deaths related to famine and the outbreak of other diseases, we are seeing civilian casualties as a direct result of Saudi military action. Earlier this year at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, I asked General Votel, the commander of U.Central Command, which is responsible for the Middle East, to assess the cause of the large number of civilian casualties in General Votel responded: ``I attribute those type situations more to the competence of the forces that are operating there, and their ability to properly target.''  I am concerned that even with the precision munitions the United States[[Page S3530]]has sold to Saudi Arabia in the past, air strikes continue to hit civilian targets. The number of civilian injuries and deaths shows that there is simply not enough progress to reduce civilian casualties.  I could not in good conscience vote to support providing advanced precision munitions--bombs capable of hitting targets guided by laser targeting or GPS--to a campaign conducted by forces unable or unwilling to limit strikes to targets of military necessity.  Civilian casualties are a tragedy, and they threaten to make us less safe by radicalizing populations that otherwise would not be sympathetic to violent extremist groups like al-It is critical that the U.military is certainly able to hunt down terrorists wherever they operate or wherever they seek haven.  The deployment of remotely piloted aircraft has allowed for persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, which is used to minimize the risk of civilian casualties. When the U.military carries out air strikes, we know our men and women in uniform are the best trained in the world and are informed by the best available intelligence.  Precision-guided munitions alone do not avoid preventable tragedies. It takes capable and fully trained personnel. This is what we must expect from our partners for the sake of innocent civilians caught in conflict zones and for our own national security. Failing to do so sets back the potential for a political solution.  We simply should not send precision munitions or any weapons system to any partner with personnel who are not capable or trained to use them. That is why I supported the resolution of disapproval, which specifically objects to the sale of three specific types of precision-guided munitions and related technology. While this measure failed, I will continue to work as a member of the Armed Services Committee to provide oversight and hold the Saudi Government and military accountable.            Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Bill  Mr.President, I was proud to support the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities This is important legislation that I was also proud to cosponsor. It will require sanctions on those supporting Iran's ballistic missile program and imposes terrorism-related sanctions on Iran's Revolutionary Guard  For too long, Iran's state sponsorship of terrorism and their repeated ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.Security Council resolutions have destabilized the Middle East and threatened Israel, our strongest ally in the region. Their destabilizing actions are fueling the ongoing violence causing widespread humanitarian suffering in Iran provides weapons and troops that fuel conflicts, and Iran's military consistently behaves in an unprofessional manner, putting American troops at risk.  I believe most Iranian citizens want to play a productive role in the world. It is their government that is the problem. I believe that pressure provided by additional sanctions for destabilizing activity can improve the behavior of the Iranian regime, and we must send a clear signal to this regime that their actions are simply unacceptable.  This legislation also provided a vehicle to address another nation's leadership whose actions have warranted international condemnation--This bill includes an amendment that I supported to enhance sanctions on  This amendment ensures that sanctions imposed by President Obama are codified in law and cannot be removed without congressional review. It also imposes new sanctions on Russians who facilitate human rights violations, supply weapons to the Syrian Government, conduct cyber attacks on behalf of the Russian Government, and do business in the Russian intelligence and defense sectors.  Let me be clear: Russia is not our friend. The Russian Government has conducted an information warfare campaign against our own country and sought to undermine our democratic process.  This is not a one-time incident. Russia continues to attempt to disrupt democratic institutions and interfere with our allies.  Congress has supported imposing tough sanctions on Russia, and it is important that Congress has an opportunity to review any attempt to remove them. I am glad this amendment was adopted on a broadly bipartisan basis.  Finally, I am a cosponsor of an amendment offered by Senator Graham that reaffirms the importance of NATO, particularly article 5, the collective defense provision, which states that an attack on one is an attack on all. Article 5 has been invoked only once, in response to the September 11 attacks on the United With the inclusion of this amendment, the Senate sends a strong, clear signal that the United States stands by our commitment to security and stability throughout the world, and we always will.

674,topic-id,435,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong support of H.510, the Rapid DNA Act of 2017. I also want to salute Mr.Sensenbrenner for his hard work on it.  This bipartisan legislation would integrate Rapid DNA technology into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, popularly known as CODIS, to enable law enforcement to perform valuable investigative functions faster and more efficiently.  DNA technology is a valuable, dynamic, and rapidly unfolding element of our criminal justice system. DNA technology helps us to identify suspects, eliminate false suspects, exonerate the innocent, and ultimately to convict responsible perpetrators of crime. My State of Maryland is home to the first capital prisoner in the United States who was exonerated while in prison for a homicide with DNA technology.  CODIS and the National DNA Index System play a critical role across the country in criminal investigations by Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies. Rapid DNA involves a fully automated, hands-free process designed to produce a DNA profile within minutes at the booking stage outside of a crime lab.  Existing law does not provide for the inclusion of Rapid DNA analyses into H.510 would bridge the gap between Rapid DNA technology and CODIS by authorizing law enforcement to conduct Rapid DNA analyses and upload the results to the national index, as long as the Rapid DNA machines that are used are accredited. This adds a real-time layer to CODIS and saves us all significant time and resources, improving efficiency in the criminal justice process.  H.510 has significant practical and positive consequences for law enforcement and for public safety. For example, Detroit, as of this April, has tested approximately 10,000 backlogged sexual assault kits. As a result, there have been more than 2,600 DNA matches, including CODIS hits; the identification of nearly 800 potential serial rapists; 92 convictions obtained by the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office; and DNA crimes linked to 40 other States and the District of  The addition of Rapid DNA information to the CODIS database will help identify serial rapists if matches are made to the lab analyses of the sexual assault kit samples.  I hope that the use of Rapid DNA will allow other DNA labs to focus more of their resources on reducing the backlog[[Page H4205]]of untested sexual assault kits across the country. My home State of Maryland has 3,700 untested rape kits right now, according to a report done last year.  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join the chairman and those of us in the minority in supporting this important legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

The Rapid DNA Act is strongly supported by several organizations which know that the expanded use and availability of Rapid DNA will enhance public safety by reducing the DNA backlog, reducing violent crime, and allowing law enforcement to investigate crimes and identify suspects with greater efficiency and accuracy.

He begged his lawyer who is now the chief judge on the D.Superior Court, Judge Morin, to get the DNA test done.

903,topic-id,1256,"Mr.President, I have come to the floor today as part of my office's Expression NOT Oppression initiative, which highlights human rights abuses around the world and the plight of individuals imprisoned or oppressed for simply exercising their God-given rights.  Earlier this month, we observed World Press Freedom Day, which serves as a reminder that freedom of expression is a fundamental, universal human right and that a free press is vital to a free society.  We should never take for granted the freedom of the press we enjoy here in the United These rights are an integral part of the bedrock of any healthy democracy, and in too many parts of the world, they are nonexistent or under assault.  According to Reporters Without Borders' 2017 World Press Freedom Index, press freedom is threatened now more than ever. Governments around the world continue to crack down on their citizens' access to information. Out of 180 countries, Burundi dropped from 156 to 160. Most problematic for press freedom, Egypt dropped from 159 to 161, and Bahrain dropped from 162 to 164.  Additionally, Reporters Without Borders has reported that at least nine journalists have been killed already in 2017. Several were killed in Mexico, here in our own hemisphere. It is hard to believe that people are being thrown in jail or worse simply because government officials don't like what they write or publish, but that is what is happening, especially in countries like China, Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, just to name a few.  The case I come to the floor today to highlight is that of Huang Qi, who has long been targeted by the Chinese Government because of his advocacy for the rights of ordinary citizens and his coverage of the Chinese Government's violation of those rights. In November of last year, the police reportedly burst into his residence and ransacked his home and took him to detention. In December of last year, Chinese prosecutors authorized Huang's arrest for allegedly ``illegally providing state secrets overseas,'' a charge that can result in a sentence of life imprisonment. The Committee to Protect Journalists described his detention as part of ``an intensified crackdown on online journalists and bloggers who report on protests and human rights abuses.''  Huang founded the 64 Tianwang human rights website in 1998. The Chinese Government has blocked access to 64 Tianwang since 2003, according to Radio Free Asia, because the site covers issues deemed politically sensitive by authorities, such as protests and government corruption.  Authorities previously sentenced Huang to 3 years in prison in November 2009 for ``illegal possession of state secrets''--this in connection with his work assisting parents who lost children during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. In addition, Chinese authorities sentenced Huang to 5 years in prison in 2000 for ``subversion'' for his advocacy on behalf of the families of the 1989 Tiananmen protest victims--a solemn anniversary we will mark next month.  In short, Huang, a veteran activist, is no stranger to the Chinese Government's silencing of dissent. His life's work is a testament to fearless reporting regardless of what consequences may follow. While his own government views him as a threat, outside of China, his work is widely praised and recognized. Reporters Without Borders awarded the 2016 Press Freedom Award to his website. His case has been championed by Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, and others, including the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which I am proud to chair. His case is featured in the Commission's Political Prisoner Database, which presently contains more than 1,400 active prisoner records--a staggering but far from exhaustive number.  Huang is committed to reporting the facts--facts that describe the daily struggles of Chinese citizens. For this, he has suffered greatly, including reported torture and mistreatment in detention, unjust imprisonment, and deprivation of his most basic rights.  The Chinese Government should immediately and unconditionally release him. The United States should make this case and the cases of many others like him languishing unjustly behind bars in China or tortured into ``confessing'' to ``crimes'' they did not commit, priorities--we should make these priorities in our bilateral engagement with  It is the second point--the torture and mistreatment of rights defenders--that brings to mind another troubling case, that of prominent rights lawyer Xie His wife, who recently arrived in the United States with her two young children, will testify before the House Foreign Affairs Committee later this week. Xie has bravely taken on sensitive cases, including land grab victims and advocates for democratic reform. Chinese security agents detained him as part of the 709 Crackdown--a sweeping, nationwide campaign against Chinese rights lawyers and advocates that started on July 9, 2015.  The plight of 45-year-old Mr.Xie burst onto the international scene in January 2017 when his attorneys released transcripts of their meetings with him. The transcripts recount the threats of his inquisitors. They said: ``We'll torture you to death just like an ant.'' Another warned: ``I'm going to torment you until you go insane.'' He told his lawyers: ``I wanted to end their interrogation of me as quickly as I could, even if it meant death. . . . Later, I wrote down whatever they wanted.'' As if foreshadowing the fate that awaited him, he had earlier written a letter in detention in which he cautioned, ``If one day in the future I admit guilt . . . that will not be a true expression of my thoughts.''  Fast-forward to last week. He was charged with ``inciting subversion of state power and disrupting court order'' and pled guilty in a recorded video released by the court and widely reported in major media outlets. He said: ``I want to take this opportunity to express to other rights lawyers my view now that we should give up using contact with foreign media and independent media to hype sensitive news events, attack judicial institutions and smear the image of the nation's party organs while handling cases. . . . `'  He continued in that same coerced statement: ``Everyone should take me as a warning to certainly stay within the framework of the law and avoid being exploited by Western anti-China forces.''  Yet, despite these warnings and the Chinese Government's unyielding assault on human rights, there are still men and women committed to reporting on the government's abuses and steadfast in defending the powerless and the marginalized. Their courage is an inspiration, and it must summon our solidarity.  I look forward to the day when the Chinese Government upholds rather than tramples the rights of its own citizens, abides by the rule of law at home, and respects the international rules-based system globally. However, that day has not yet arrived. Until it does, we must signal to the Chinese people that whatever our broader diplomatic and strategic aims may be as it relates to North Korea or any other issue, America is under no illusions about the iron-fisted leadership of President Xi and his utter disregard for the rights and dignity of his own people.  As President Trump continues fulfilling his duty and appointing individuals to key positions, I will keep raising these issues with each and every relevant nominee whom I meet with[[Page S2961]]both privately, as I did with Governor Branstad, and publicly, as I did during his confirmation hearing. It is critical that the United States keep human rights for all people as a core pillar of our foreign policy.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1014,topic-id,2377,"Mr.President, there are two things Americans need to know about this Republican healthcare plan. The first is that it is going to make insurance more expensive, and the second is that it is going to make it harder to get healthcare in the first place. That is the bottom line of this bill: higher costs for less care--and all for a tax cut for the rich. That is what we are doing.  We are taking about $800 billion worth of revenue, eviscerating it, eliminating it. Those tax revenues were basically tax increases passed under the Affordable Care They were tax increases on the wealthiest among us. What we are doing is getting rid of all those tax increases in order to cut That is what this bill does. That is not what Americans had in mind when they said on a bipartisan basis, on a majority basis--when they asked Congress to fix healthcare. When you read the fine print, you see that it gets worse every moment, and you realize how bad this plan is.  The Senate version did something extraordinary: It actually moved to the right. And that is a real legislative achievement. Look at This is a program that helps one out of every five Americans, two out of every five children in the United It helps one out of every two families who have a newborn baby. And it covers three out of every four long-term nursing home residents.  This program literally saves lives--nursing home patients; people struggling with opioid addiction; people who are working two jobs but still don't make enough to cover their own healthcare insurance--but with this bill, Medicaid as we know it will be destroyed, all so that people at the top of the food chain can pay less in taxes.  This bill actually has a certain symmetry to it. There are at least $800 billion worth of cuts to Medicaid--probably more but at least $800 billion--and it just so happens that there are also around $800 billion worth of tax cuts for the wealthy. So insurance executives will be Don't worry about them. What we should worry about is women who need Medicaid for maternal health services. We should worry about seniors and people with disabilities.  Activists for disability rights are appropriately freaked out about this bill. People in wheelchairs protested outside of a Senate office earlier today,[[Page S3722]]and some of them said that they would literally die if this bill passes. It was an intense protest. And we hope everybody is OK, but it is intense because these are intense issues.  These are personal issues. These are healthcare issues. People are worried--not about some abstract public policy or political debate; they are worried about their own lives. And they are not wrong. Because of Medicaid, people now have access to physical therapy and immunizations. They can see a counselor for mental health problems and opioid addiction. They can afford the medication they need instead of relying on free samples from clinics. Medicaid has changed everything for them.  This is not just good for patients, it is also good for taxpayers. By giving preventive care, we save money. And if TrumpCare becomes law, those services will go away, thanks to $800 billion in cuts.  This bill also lets insurance companies opt out of covering essential health benefits. I want to be very clear about this. This is a term of art. It is a piece of jargon. I am going to go slowly here and not assume that if you are not in politics, you would understand what an essential health benefit is.  Basically, if you are getting a healthcare plan, there are 10 things that, under Federal law, a healthcare plan has to cover. It just makes sense. I will list them. They are ambulatory patient services; emergency services, so ER visits; hospitalization--if you have to stay overnight in the hospital, it has to be covered in your healthcare plan; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance abuse services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehab; laboratory services; preventive wellness and wellness services; chronic disease management; and pediatric services.  So I want you to imagine a world where you can get an insurance plan--a so-called insurance plan--but under the law, they can tell you: By the way, we don't cover hospitalization. By the way, we have this great insurance plan, but if you need any prescription drugs, those are out-of-pocket--not a copay; you have to pay all of it. By the way, we will give you an insurance plan, but if you have mental illness, you are on your own. By the way, if you get pregnant, we don't cover that.  It is a healthcare plan, which is why we have a statute, a Federal law, that says ambulatory patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance abuse services, prescription drugs, rehab, lab services, preventive and wellness services, and pediatric services have to be covered. Otherwise, it is not insurance. Every one of these benefits is covered full stop under the current law, but what the proposal does is it eviscerates essential health benefits.  I don't know what the CBO is going to say, because they got rid of the individual mandate, and it is going to be unclear. There is a real possibility that there will actually be an increase in the number of people who are covered, but that coverage is going to be nonsense. Can you imagine having a health insurance plan that doesn't cover maternity care? Can you imagine--especially nowadays, when half the time when you go to the doctor, they give you a prescription--so you go to the doctor, and they say you need this, and you say OK, and then you have to pay out-of-pocket? What is the point of insurance if none of the things you need are covered by the insurance? That is what this bill does.  I am also worried about the distractions in this bill. It defunds Planned Parenthood and doesn't provide nearly enough for opioid addiction programs. I want to be clear about what I mean by ``distraction.'' It is my supposition--I don't know for sure that these things were intentionally either omitted from the bill or put in the bill to allow some of my Republican colleagues to get well legislatively. What do I mean by that? Opioid treatment was tens of billions of dollars in the House version. They brought it down to less than $1 billion. That puts somebody on this side of the aisle in a position to say: Even though I am for $800 billion of Medicaid cuts, which will eviscerate opioid treatment across the country, I am going to introduce an amendment and we are going to increase opioid treatment. Once we get a ``yes'' vote, well, you know, I was really concerned, but with my amendment, we have more money for opioid treatment.  Don't fall for that trick. It is a trick. The way to fund opioid treatment is to fund opioid treatment. Medicaid is both the best way to do it clinically and the best way to do it fiscally. So I am afraid they intentionally left that out so somebody can go in and be the hero on the other side, while not actually solving the problem--likewise with Planned The way you fund opioid treatment is through  We had 13 men working in secret without input from any women or Democrats or experts or advocates.  Part of the thing about healthcare, as the President says, is nobody knew it was so complicated. But you really need hearings. You really need to understand how all of the parts of a system interact with each other. Let me give an example. You cut Medicaid, and somebody who is Medicaid-eligible but also a veteran--you don't know for sure whether, if Medicaid services are not available, they are going to go back into the VA system and cost the VA system more money. If you cut preventive treatment, you don't know if you are going to end up having to pay on the back end with more ER services. So the reason you have hearings is you have to have some rather technical expertise in the room to say: Hey, if you do this, this might happen. If do you that, this might happen. If you do this, we are not quite sure what might happen.  But the idea that 13 men with very little expertise in healthcare policy--they are not unintelligent, they are not unqualified to be public policy makers, but the whole thing about being in the Senate is that, for the most part, we are supposed to be, as they say--Jack or Jane--Jack of all trades, master of none. We are supposed to be pretty good at receiving information, kind of distilling it, asking the right kinds of questions, listening to our constituents, and then crystallizing all of that into a bill.  The problem with this process is they did about one-third of that. They talked to each other, and they talked to Republican lobbyists, but they didn't talk to the people back home. They didn't talk to people who run community health centers. They didn't talk to mental health advocates.  We have people who come from Hawaii and across the country who advocate for every specific disease treatment and disease research. These people usually are touched personally by their issues. They come in, and most of us receive them and talk to them and think about how to get them more funding or more reimbursements through NIH or CDC or the Department of Defense or wherever we can find resources for them.  That is the process of being in a legislative context if you are not personally an expert on healthcare policy. If you do it in the dark of night, if you do it literally without any women, if you do it literally without any people from the other party, you are going to get a bad product. They knew they were going to get a bad product, but they made a judgment. They made a judgment.  They decided that the longer this bill sees the light of day, the lower the chances it has of passing, and I think they are right. I mean, if this thing is subjected to real sunshine, it will just wither. That is just a fact. This is why they didn't have any hearings in the House, this is why they are not only not having any hearings in the Senate, but they are going to allow for I think it is 20 hours of debate under this silly vote-arama procedure.  What they will do is, I think, yield back a lot of their time. What does that mean? That means 20 hours will become 10 hours because they don't want to defend their bill.  They are absolutely happy to trash the Affordable Care Act and say it has a series of problems and all the rest of it. You know what, the Affordable Care Act has a series of problems. No doubt about it. I will tell you it is way better than this. I will also tell you it is way better than the situation we had before the act was passed.  The 1 cause of bankruptcy in the United States was getting sick. Think about that. Before this act, people[[Page S3723]]would not be just afraid for themselves when they got sick, when something catastrophic happened to them, either a chronic disease or something that imperiled their lives or an accident, but you would have dual anxieties, right? You wondered whether you were going to be OK, but you also wondered whether you were going to be able to make it financially.  So we are sort of beyond that, and now we have a law that has been on the books that does need fixing. I know the Presiding Officer and the Senator from Missouri, who is waiting to speak, would be pleased--really would be pleased to participate in a bipartisan process.  I think about the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, one of the best statesmen in the U.Senate, Lamar Alexander, a Republican with whom I disagree on a lot, but he and Patty Murray did a bill on public education that got--I don't know--84 votes or something. Liberal Patty Murray and conservative Lamar Alexander did a deal. Orrin Hatch, President pro tempore of the Senate, is someone who worked with my predecessor, who worked with Teddy Kennedy, who did bills and did deals.  So I understand we are kind of in this squabble about whether there is good faith or there was good faith. Our view of this is you went into the reconciliation process before even, in any serious way, pursuing bipartisan legislation. You decided you wanted 51 votes, not 60 votes, and that was sort of poisonous fruit from the tree. That is our view. Your view is that you serially tried to reach out to us, and we have rebuffed your overtures. I have my view; the Republicans have their view.  Right now, you are about to walk one-sixth of the American economy off a cliff, and you are also about to harm tens of millions of individuals in all of our home States--not Republicans or Democrats or Greens or Independents or Libertarians or people who don't vote or whoever it may be, but people are going to really be hurt by this bill. People are really going to be hurt by this bill.  Forgetting the politics, I think we have an opportunity to avert the harm. If this bill does come crashing down, then I think we have an opportunity to work together on healthcare. I, for one, pledge that if we are in a position to sit down on a bipartisan basis and come up with improvements to the existing statute, I will be the first person to say yes to that kind of process. It is not too late. All we need are three Republicans to say: Let's slow down. Let's have a hearing. Let's work with Let's do this the right way.  I yield the floor.

Yesterday, my friend the majority leader brought down the curtain on bipartisan tax reform before a discussion between our two parties could even start, dismissing the prospect of Democratic[[Page S4699]]input, promising the Republicans would again use reconciliation to lock us out of the process, repeating the same mistake they did with healthcare.  Leader McConnell's announcement just came a few hours after 45 Members of the Democratic caucus sent him a letter saying we were open to bipartisan discussions on tax reform. We had three simple, straightforward principles. Let me read the Democratic principles on tax reform: First, don't cut taxes for the 1 percent--the top 1 percent. They are doing fine. God bless them.  Second, don't increase the debt and deficit, something many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been talking about for a long time.  Third, negotiate in a fair and open process, not reconciliation but hearings, amendments, the things that have made America great and have brought this Senate the acclaim over the decades it has had.  Now, I would like to know which of these principles the majority leader does not agree with. I would like to know. Is he closing the door on bipartisanship because he so dearly wants to cut taxes on the top 1 percent? The wealthy are doing great right now--God bless them--but they don't need another tax break while middle-class families and working Americans are struggling just to make ends meet. Many of us on this side of the aisle suspect that to some, that is the 1 motivation--not tax reform, not close loopholes, not clean up the system but give that top 1 percent a huge tax break to please so many like the Koch brothers.  Again, I would ask the leader: Are you closing the door on bipartisanship simply because you want to cut taxes on the top 1 percent or maybe the leader is closing the door on bipartisanship because he has a fervent desire to blow up the deficit? That sure doesn't sound like something Republicans have been interested in over the years--they have been spending lots of time, with good reason, deficit scolding and debt scolding--or is my friend from Kentucky, our majority leader, closing the door on bipartisanship because he thinks reconciliation, which means you exclude the Democrats from the get-go, is a good process because he doesn't want to have hearings, because he doesn't want amendments, and maybe it is the same reason on healthcare? Maybe they are ashamed of their proposal. I would like to see somebody on the floor get up and say: We believe in tax cuts--on the Republican side get up on the floor and say: We believe in tax cuts for the top 1 percent. That is why we want to do this.  But, no, they want to hide it, cloak it, give a crumb to the middle class, and say: See, we are helping you.  We all know that what happens after we have a big deficit, they come back and say: Now, let's cut Social Security, now let's cut Medicare because we don't have the money. We don't have the money because they cut taxes on the rich, the very wealthy.  I don't know which of these three principles the majority leader is against, but when he closed the door on Democrats--when we sent him this letter which simply outlined our principles, that is all we wanted to do, give him notice we agree on these three things, at least on our side--which one or all of them made him close the door?  We Democrats hoped we could work together on tax reform, but the majority leader has drawn down the curtain before the play has even begun. Republicans will spend the entire first year of this Congress trying to pass their agenda on reconciliation, a process that deliberately excludes Democrats, excludes hearings, excludes amendments, with no shred of bipartisan input. Just like with healthcare, I believe it will be another dead-end road for  I tell my friend the majority leader--I quote his speech in 2014, entitled ``Restoring the Senate.'' I truly believe--I truly believe that Leader McConnell believes in the institution of the Senate, and he has shown examples of that most recently when he said we don't want to change the rules, despite President Trump pushing to do that, but here is what he said in 2014:       When the Senate is allowed to work the way it was designed      to, it arrives at a result acceptable to people all along the      political spectrum. But if it's an assembly line for one      party's partisan legislative agenda, [it creates] instability      and strife rather than good, stable law.  Those are the majority leader's words. Well, if you believe that, my dear friend from Kentucky, then why are you instituting reconciliation, the exclusionary process, before we even begin the debate? And why--might the American people ask--haven't you learned the lesson of healthcare that that process doesn't work?  The American people want to see us work together. We may not always succeed. It may not be easy. It is hard work, but we ought to try. This assembly line of partisan legislation--no Democratic input, no hearings, no amendments--is not what any of us want to see. It is not what the American people are calling out for, and it will not produce good, stable law.  Again, I would ask the majority leader to reconsider these three principles probably supported by 80 percent of the American people. Why aren't our Republicans supporting them? Why are they running away from them?                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4698-4.txt,1036,WEALTH CARE OVER HEALTHCARE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF CARIBBEAN AMERICANS,2017.0,2.0,June
676,topic-id,557,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Goodlatte) for yielding me this time.  Rapid DNA is a promising new technology that allows for the almost immediate DNA analysis of an arrestee. Unlike standard DNA practices, which require sending DNA samples from arrestees out to labs with a result taking weeks to ascertain, Rapid DNA results take only a few hours and can be done right at the booking station. Like fingerprinting, photographing, and other booking procedures which at the time were novel but now have become routine, Rapid DNA will soon be standard procedure in police stations throughout the country.  There is only one problem with Rapid DNA technology: Federal law. Our law, written in 1994 when DNA technology was still in its infancy, prohibits the use of Rapid DNA technology in booking stations. This is not because of any limitation in Rapid DNA technology, but simply because at that time Rapid DNA technology was not even contemplated. Similar to the transformation of musical devices--records leading to cassette tapes, cassette tapes leading to CDs, CDs leading to MP3, and now iPods and online music hosting services--technology moves quicker than we can legislate. Now is the time to change the law to permit Rapid DNA technology.  Rapid DNA machines are compact, approximately the size of copy machines, and can provide a DNA analysis from a cheek swab sample of an arrestee within 2 hours. This has two profound implications. First, arrestees may be exonerated of crimes in 2 hours rather than waiting for up to 72 hours for release, or months for more standard DNA testing. Second, those arrested for a crime can quickly be matched to other unsolved crimes where there was forensic evidence left at the crime scene but for which there was no identified suspect.  The Rapid DNA Act updates the current law to allow DNA samples to be processed using Rapid DNA instruments located in booking stations and other approved locations. The bill will require the FBI to issue standards and procedures for the use of such instruments and their resulting DNA analyses to ensure the integrity of such instruments and the accuracy of the results. It will permit those results to be included in the DNA index if criminal justice agencies taking the samples comply with the standards and procedures that the FBI approves. In this way, the bill would permit this new category of DNA samples to be uploaded into the index with the same protections and quality standards as current DNA samples.  Not only does Rapid DNA have the potential to reduce crime, help expeditiously exonerate the innocent, but also to positively impact the current backlogs for rape kits and other DNA sample analysis.  This committee has spent a great deal of time and significant work to try to reduce the forensic DNA backlog, especially in rape kits. Rapid DNA could not at this time be used for rape kits, but the implementation of Rapid DNA will allow forensic labs to focus on forensic samples, not on identification samples which can easily be handled by Rapid DNA machines. I hope this will reduce the rape kit backlog, which will also prevent future rapes from happening.  I am pleased that the House is taking a significant step in furthering the use of this technology. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  ",CREC-2017-05-16-pt1-PgH4204.txt,1041,WEALTH CARE OVER HEALTHCARE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF CARIBBEAN AMERICANS,2017.0,16.0,June
756,topic-id,600,"Mr.Speaker, I certainly thank my colleague for yielding to me.  Mr.Speaker, I was fortunate enough to bring the ACA to the floor after years of working on it and experts writing it. It had such incredible things in it. I think it would behoove us this morning to talk about what every one of us who has health insurance is going to lose because the benefits of the ACA accrued to all of us.  Now, you need to know first that we are going to lose the fact that 85 cents of every premium dollar will go for health care. It will go back to insurance profits. We are also going to lose the fact that families could no longer go bankrupt because of health care.  The largest cause of bankruptcy are families with medical bills, and the ACA took care of that. Nobody ever talks about that much, but if a single person spent $4,500 a year on health care, a family $12,500, the insurance companies picked up the rest of it.  How about that? That is a pretty good loss that we are going to face. So why in the world are we rushing into this thing?  Well, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, verified as recently as last Saturday evening in Pennsylvania that we have to do this first because $800 billion has to come out of health care so that they could do the tax bill with great corporate tax relief for the 1 percent. So as you lose your health care, your ability to go to the doctor, and your preexisting conditions because risk pools don't work, be comforted by the fact that we are in the hands of people who put the needs of corporations and wealthy people ahead of the citizens of the United  Just in case you think people aren't paying any attention, for the first time in my life, my office has 185 applications for six seats as interns in the summertime. It is unheard of. Calls in my office have gone from about 10 a day to 80, all of them talking about this. I have never seen political suicide in my life like I am seeing today. I think our leader put it so succinctly: you are tattooing that on your foreheads.  Now, those people out there who have really gotten sort of used to this, all we have heard all the way through is that this is going to fall apart. The problems going on with the ACA right now are that the insurance companies have uncertainty because of what has been going on here.  I need to bring up one of the greatest hoaxes in America in any institution that passes laws. For over 60 times, you brought to the floor of this House and we debated bills to do away with the health care. ``Repeal and replace,'' you shouted. Millions and millions of dollars' worth of time on this floor were spent on what was absolutely a hoax because you had no repeal-and-replace plan. It was simply all talk, and now you have got to rush through this so you can do your big tax bill.  I am sorry to see this happen. It is a sad day for the United  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I feel bad for the gentleman because it appears as if he only has one speaker supporting this rule and the bill, and nearly our entire caucus wants to speak on this against the Republican healthcare repeal bill. So I was wondering whether the gentleman might consider sharing some time with us?

684,topic-id,701,"Mr.Speaker, for more than 7 years, I have spoken out against the broken military justice system that allows commanders to decide how sexual assaults and other criminal offenses are prosecuted under the Uniform Code of Military Our servicemembers are stuck in a world where their fates rest within the chain of command, where bias is king and justice often a jester.  Today, I stand here sick at heart that, once again, a rape conviction has been overturned because of the broken military justice system. In this instance, the U.Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces threw out Airman Rodney Boyce's rape and assault conviction because of the involvement of Lieutenant General Craig Franklin, who referred the case to court-martial.  This all came about because, in 2013, General Franklin was admonished by his superiors for tossing out the aggravated sexual assault conviction of a fellow F-16 pilot, a unanimous decision by a jury of his peers. Certainly, a general should not have the power to overturn the findings of a court of law simply because he thinks his buddy could not possibly have committed the sexual assault.  But because Franklin was appropriately admonished for this abuse of power, the U.Court of Appeals found that his subsequent decision to move forward with an entirely separate Boyce case constituted unlawful command influence.  This is made more ridiculous by two facts: first, the military judge during the actual trial found no evidence of unlawful command influence; second, the appeals court that threw out the Boyce case also did not find evidence of unlawful command influence, just the ``appearance'' of it.  So, apparently, unlawful command influence is like pornography: there is no definition, but judges know it when they see it.  Colleagues, it is past time to reform this unjust system that ignores jury decisions on the whim of a convening authority. The military must remove the power to decide whether or not to prosecute sexual assault cases from the chain of command and give the authority to independent military prosecutors.  I have met with countless survivors who have suffered in unique and horrifying ways. There is a hauntingly clear pattern to nearly all of their experiences: the perpetrator was let off the hook and the victim fellow servicemember was revictimized by an unjust system, all at the hands of the chain of command that is supposed to be there to protect and defend them.  The sense of betrayal by their command is marrow deep and life altering. Many describe the feelings of this betrayal more akin to a violation at the hands of a family member rather than a boss or coworker.  All that we need to do is to allow trained and experienced lawyers in the military to make a legal judgment about a crime. This in no way impacts the commander's authority. It simply gives servicemembers what we civilians take for granted, which is relying on a trained prosecutor to decide whether to move forward with serious charges of sexual assault.  Our servicemembers deserve and need a system that they can trust to be fair and impartial. Letting a convicted rapist walk free because of a mere appearance of unlawful command influence--forget the fact that he was, in fact, convicted of the assault--shows just how deep the problem runs.  As this case shows, the perception and the reality is that commanders with a built-in conflict of interest and with little or no legal training are deciding whether to move forward to trial. They make this decision not solely based on legal reasoning, but a myriad of other factors--like how well they fly a jet or how well they are liked by others--that should not be injected into the decisionmaking.  Our servicemembers deserve and need a system that they can trust to be fair and impartial. We have the power and duty to fundamentally reform the system to ensure that they are treated with a level of fairness that befits their sacrifice and service.  Mr.Speaker, the words of one military servicemember still haunt me and ring in my ears, when she said to me:       I joined the military to fight the enemy. I never thought      that he would be right next to me.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgH4655-2.txt,1890,WEALTH CARE OVER HEALTHCARE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF CARIBBEAN AMERICANS,2017.0,7.0,June
720,topic-id,2319,"Mr.President, I want to talk a little bit about what is going on here on the Senate floor. We were just considering the nomination of the Deputy Secretary of Defense, trying to move him along--a very important job--and it has taken some time. As a matter of fact, it has taken a long time, as the Presiding Officer knows, to get nominees from the White House confirmed by this body to run the government.  Running the government is a very important job. We not only need Cabinet Secretaries--which, by the way, took months for this body to confirm. They slowed down the confirmation of the choices of the White House to run the Federal agencies--no real explanation why--and now, Under Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Federal judges--delay, delay, delay, delay.  We are supposed to be trying to put people in place to run the government, which is the job of the Senate, but it has taken a very long time to do it, and it shouldn't be this way. It shouldn't be this way.  When we look at U.history, typically, enabling a President to fill the key positions of government has not been a partisan issue. An election happens. Yes, there could be some debate on Cabinet officials, but you typically want to fill the government and start running the government on behalf of the American people. It has not been a partisan issue in Well, unfortunately, it is becoming a partisan issue due to what by any measure is historic obstruction on the nominations coming from the White House to run the Federal Government--historic obstruction.  The people did elect us, and they elected a new President, and implicit in the election was that they wanted us to get to work, to do things that, in my view, are very bipartisan. What are some of those things? Growing the economy. We haven't had 3 percent GDP growth in almost 15 years. That is a bipartisan issue--growing the economy. So are rebuilding our military, unleashing energy that we have in this great Nation in enormous abundance, investing in infrastructure, streamlining regulations that are strangling small businesses, and, yes, enacting policies to address the spiraling costs of health insurance and healthcare costs across the country.  Throughout history, the party in the minority understood this after an election and would vote to confirm new members of an administration--not just Cabinet Secretaries but Under Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, and judges. In fact, the current minority leader said the following in 2013: ``Who in America doesn't think a President, Democrat or Republican, deserves his or her picks for who should run the agencies? Nobody.''  ``Nobody,'' he said.  Those were wise words in 2013. I just wish he would remember them in 2017 because apparently he has forgotten those words. He has forgotten those words, because right now there is pure obstruction in terms of trying to seat the people to run the government.  Sometimes it is important to try to explain to the American people what is going on here on the Senate floor because it can be confusing. I still get confused sometimes. There are arcane rules. Let's give an example of what just happened here right now.  We had the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the 2 official at the Department of That is a pretty darn important job. After he came out of the Armed Services Committee, on which I sit, we voted to end debate on his nomination. The vote just happened, and I believe it was 88 to 6, so very bipartisan.  By the way, we need people at the Department of Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, regardless of whom you voted for in the November elections, most Americans want us to have good people running the Department of Defense right now. We have very few there--very few--because of this obstruction.  For the Deputy Secretary, the cloture vote just happened, 88 to 6. That is a very strong bipartisan vote. In previous times, in a Democratic or Republican administration, the Senate would normally say: Let's move him. He needs to get over there. Let's unanimously agree to moving that nomination more quickly so he can help run the Department of Defense--a pretty important job.  Well, unfortunately, we are not in that era right now. So what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been doing for every single nomination for this administration is now we will have an additional 2-day waiting period, an additional 30 hours of debate. Those are Senate rules, but normally on someone this noncontroversial, those rules get waived. But we have a minority leader who wants to drag out every single official from being seated. He really hasn't explained why. I haven't heard an explanation why. But it is happening for every single official--three to four days on one official. Someone did an estimation that if they keep this up, if they do this for every single Senate-confirmed job, it will take 11 years. It will take 11 years to seat the officials in the Trump administration. How is that helping the American people? It is not. Yet, nobody comes to the floor to explain why they are doing it. The press doesn't report on it.  Let me provide some other facts on this issue. Normally, when we waive these rules, we can have a voice vote. For a noncontroversial nomination like the Deputy Secretary of Defense, as we just had, normally that would be voice-voted.  At this point in President Obama's Presidency--so the first 6 months of his Presidency--the Senate had allowed more than 90 percent of his nominees to be confirmed by simple voice vote. The Senate asked for procedural votes only eight times on eight nominees--that was it--in the first 6 months of President Obama's administration. That was actually normal. Democrats or Republicans would do something along those lines.  For the Trump administration's first 6 months, the minority leader and his colleagues have demanded cloture votes for every single nominee, no matter what the position, no matter how noncontroversial, no matter how bipartisan. The courtesy extended to President Obama to get his team together so that he could run the country has not been extended here. That is just a fact.  Let me give another fact. According to the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, at about this point in President Obama's first term, he had 183 of his nominations confirmed--183. Getting people in their positions in government to run the country--it doesn't matter what party you are in; this is to run the country. But while President Trump's administration at this point has made 178 nominations to the Senate, only 46 have been confirmed. So for President Obama at this point, 183 nominations were confirmed; for this President, 46. This is historic obstruction.  No one comes here and says: Why? Why are you doing this? What is the point? What is the point?  This isn't by accident. The head of a leading Democratic think tank told the press recently that they intended to hold up, delay, tie up floor time for every single nomination for Senate-confirmed positions. But what they don't do--they don't say: And here is why.  Why do they want to do that? It is not going to help us grow the economy. It is not going to help us with infrastructure. It is not going to help us rebuild our military when we keep the Deputy Secretary from coming in to his position.  Just last week, we had a judge who was nominated from the State of Idaho, a district court judge who was confirmed unanimously, and it took almost the entire week to get him confirmed on the Senate floor because the minority leader was delaying, delaying, delaying--even someone who got 100 percent of the Senators to vote for him. Again, it is not clear why they are doing this.  Some of the other noncontroversial nominees that are being delayed are the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs and two nominees to review pipelines and other projects at the Federal Energy Regulatory Do you think we[[Page S4018]]need that for our country to grow the economy? We do.  These are important positions to do the work of the Federal Yet they are all delayed, and nobody in the press even asks any questions. This is historic obstruction right now, and no one is even asking: Why are you doing it?  It would be great to have the minority leader come to the Senate floor and tell us why. I want to know why. I want to grow the economy. We need these people in positions of authority to help us do the things--bipartisan things--that the American people sent us here to do, not delay, not obstruct.  Something else is happening on the Senate floor right now. It is not just the historic obstruction of nominees. The other side, for whatever reason, is now deciding they are going to shut down any movement of anything on the Senate floor. Let me give one example, which is actually quite important.  A lot of what we do here moves by what we call unanimous consent on the Senate floor. There are rules to move things. It can take a lot of time. But a lot of times the leadership of the Senate will get together and say: OK, we can have a unanimous consent agreement to move things faster. It is not just nominees. Sometimes it is actually legislation. As a matter of fact, a lot of things move on the Senate floor through unanimous consent, which is, essentially, a voice vote where everyone, all 100 Senators, say: We agree with that. It is a bill that is really important, very bipartisan. Let's move it. Let's move it fast. It came out of committee. It is not controversial, but maybe it is important, so let's move it.  For whatever reason, it still doesn't explain to the American people why the minority leader would say that we are not going to move anything by unanimous consent right now either. Not only will we hold up every nominee as long as possible--even the noncontroversial ones--nothing is going to move in the Senate by unanimous consent.  Again, why? How does that help the American people? How does that help the American people when you are just blocking things?                               POWER Act  Let me give one specific. It is an issue I feel very passionate about. I had a bill introduced last year. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent, and we are trying to pass it right now by unanimous consent this Unfortunately, it didn't pass out of the I think it will. It has passed out of committee again. It is called the Pro bono Work to Empower and Represent Act, the POWER It is very bipartisan. A number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, including Senators Heitkamp, Shaheen, Leahy, and Warren, are cosponsors.  Here is what it does: I come to the Senate floor every week to talk about what a great State I live in--One thing we actually aren't proud of in Alaska is that we have a real big problem with domestic violence and sexual assault in my One of the best ways to deal with that issue, one of the best ways to help victims and survivors break the cycle of violence that occurs with way too many families and way too many women and children in Alaska--and across the country--is to get attorneys to represent them.  Here is a startling fact. It is a little harsh when you say it, but it is true: If there is someone who commits a rape or is accused of committing a rape, that person gets a Sixth Amendment right to counsel. That is in our Bill of Guess what the victim gets in terms of legal representation: nothing. There is no right. But that is a really important way to help break the cycle of violence--to get survivors and victims an attorney and get the resources to do that. That is what the POWER Act does, and that is why it passed by unanimous consent last year.  We have a big problem in the country in terms of domestic violence and sexual assault. This would help. We are trying to move it right now by unanimous consent. It will pass. But it is not going to pass now because the minority leader is blocking every unanimous consent agreement on the Senate floor. Why? Why?  Does he think that women in America don't need the resources to represent themselves in these kind of horrendous crimes? They do. Trust me. Thousands of them--tens of thousands of them do. So why are we blocking this? Why don't we move it? We are shutting down the whole Senate, trying to shut down the Federal Government's ability to seat itself, to do the work of the American people. This is historic obstruction, and no one explains it. The press doesn't ask about it. I think the American people need to know about it.  We were elected to move this country forward. The election happened in Let's come together. There is a lot of bipartisan work to do. We have our differences on healthcare and other issues, but there are so many things about which we don't have differences--growing the economy, rebuilding our military, infrastructure. We need people in the Federal Government who can do that, and we need leaders in the Senate who can move things forward by unanimous consent--like the POWER Act--when they are not controversial. We don't have those leaders right now, and we need them. We need to get this country moving again. The way things are happening on the Senate floor, it is not happening that way at all.

806,topic-id,1626,"Mr.President, once again, we have more bad news about Last week, Anthem announced it will pull out of Ohio's health insurance exchange for 2018. That means that a minimum of 18 Ohio counties will be without an exchange insurer next year. Twenty-five Missouri counties are in the same boat, and more Americans are likely to find themselves in the same situation.  On June 2, the Omaha World-Herald announced that 100,000 Nebraskans could end up with zero options for individual coverage in 2018. Insurers have been pulling out of the exchanges right and left.  In February, Humana announced its decision to completely pull out of the exchanges for 2018. Three months later, Aetna, which had already sharply reduced its exchange participation in 2017, also confirmed it would pull out completely in 2018.  In 2016, 7 percent of U.counties had just one choice of insurer on their healthcare exchange. In 2017, this year, roughly one-third of U.counties have just one choice of insurer. Based upon the information available so far, the New York Times is currently estimating that about 45 percent of U.counties will have one or no insurer next year.  One thing is for sure, Mr.President, Americans are facing fewer and fewer health insurance choices, and the prices of those choices are going up.  Proposed rates, proposed rate increases for 2018 are emerging, and once again they are not looking good. Some of the average rate hikes facing Americans around the country include 17.2 percent, 33.8 percent, 30 percent, 45 percent, 38 percent, 58.8 percent.  Three weeks ago, the Department of Health and Human Services released a report comparing the average individual market insurance premium in 2013, which is the year that most of ObamaCare's regulations and mandates were implemented, with the average individual market exchange premium in 2017 in the 39 States that use healthcare.gov. What they found is that between 2013 and 2017, the average individual market monthly premium in the healthcare.gov States increased by 105 percent--105 percent.  In other words, on average, individual market premiums more than doubled in just 5 years. That is from HHS in their report that just came out in the last couple of weeks. Three States saw their premiums triple over the same period--triple in just 5 years.  I don't know too many families who can afford to have their premiums triple over 5 years. What we know is that the ObamaCare status quo is unacceptable, and it is unsustainable.  More than one insurance CEO has suggested that ObamaCare is in a death spiral, and it is pretty hard to disagree. Combine soaring premiums with a steady insurer exodus, and sooner or later we get a partial or complete exchange collapse, which is what we are facing today, not to mention all the other ObamaCare problems, such as the deductibles that are so high that sometimes people can't actually afford to use their healthcare plans or narrow plan networks with few provider choices. We have higher premiums, higher deductibles, higher costs, fewer options, fewer choices.  Republicans are currently working on legislation to help Americans struggling under My colleagues in the House made a good start, and in the Senate we are working to build on the bill they passed.  We are committed to helping Americans trapped on the ObamaCare exchanges. We are committed to addressing ObamaCare's skyrocketing premium increases. We are committed to preserving access to care for Americans with preexisting conditions, and we are committed to making Medicaid more sustainable by giving States greater flexibility while ensuring those who rely on this program don't have the rug pulled out from under them. We need to make healthcare more affordable, more personal, more flexible, and less bureaucratic.  My colleague from Oregon was just talking about the complaints they have about the healthcare process, the discussions that are going on, and how much pain, if this passes, it is going to cause the American people. I can tell you one thing: Today, it is pretty darn painful for families I have talked to in my State of South Dakota, hard-working farm and ranch families who are having to pay $2,000 a month, $24,000 a year for insurance coverage--in some cases with $5,000 deductibles, assuming they can even afford to use that expensive policy by being able to cover the deductible. There are people across this country who are hurting because of this failed healthcare insurance program. It is high time for us to fix it.  I believe the American people want to see Congress act in a way that will make healthcare insurance more affordable to them, more personal, so that they will have more choices, greater options, and more competition that will help bring those premiums down to a more reasonable level. They need to have more than one choice. When 45 percent of the counties in America have one choice or no options on the exchanges, that is an unacceptable situation and one that we have to fix.            Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Bill  Mr.President, I also want to take a few minutes today to discuss the national security bill the Senate just passed, the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities  I hardly need to recite the long list of Iranian activities that make this country a clear and present danger to peace and stability in the Middle East and outside it. Iran remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. It engages in systematic human rights abuses from torture to the targeting of religious minorities. Of course, Iran has long provided critical support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is perhaps most notable for the repeated use of chemical weapons on his own people. The fact that Assad still remains in power after the long list of atrocities his regime has committed is due in no small part to the support that Iran has provided.[[Page S3537]]  In addition to propping up Assad's reign of terror, Iran also provides support to the Houthi rebels in Secretary of Defense James Mattis recently noted: ``We see Iranian-supplied missiles being fired by the Houthis into Saudi Arabia.''  Well, providing these missiles puts Iran in violation of at least two U.Security Council resolutions--not that Iran appears to care. In fact, violating U.Security Council resolutions and international law is common practice for the Iranian Government, whether it involves supplying missiles to the Houthis or increasing Iran's own stockpiles.  When it is not violating the letter of the law, Iran is also happy to violate the spirit of international agreements. After the misguided Iran deal went into effect, Iran resumed ballistic missile testing, even though the U.Security Council resolution endorsing the nuclear deal called upon Iran not to engage in these activities.  Most recently, Iran unsuccessfully tested a submarine missile in the Strait of Hormuz in May, following ground-based missile testing in January and Many of those missiles have a range to reach targets, not only throughout the Middle East but outside it.  Under the last administration, Iranian belligerence was too often ignored or even rewarded. That needs to end now. We cannot afford to let Iran continue to destabilize the Middle We need to make it clear that the United States and its new leadership will not tolerate Iranian aggression and the terrible human suffering that has resulted.  We need to assure our allies--especially Israel, our closest and most reliable ally in the Middle East--that we are committed to standing with them against Iranian threats. The Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act will send a clear signal to Iran that the United States and its new leadership are serious about cracking down on Iranian misconduct.  This bill will sanction individuals involved in Iran's ballistic missile program or any other program designed to deliver weapons of mass destruction. It will sanction individuals who contribute to Iranian violations of arms embargoes. It will allow the President to impose sanctions on individuals who have perpetrated human rights violations against human rights crusaders in Perhaps most importantly, this legislation identifies and will hold accountable the entire Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, not just the Quds Force, for its role in implementing Iran's destabilizing agenda.  There is no easy solution to the unrest and violence in the Middle East, but this bill offers one commonsense step forward.  Yesterday the Senate passed an amendment to this bill imposing additional sanctions against another country stirring up unrest in the Middle East, and that is Russia's increasing boldness on the international stage is a natural consequence of the Obama administration's passive foreign policy. From annexing Crimea to supporting the murderous Assad regime in Syria, to meddling in elections, we cannot allow this level of Russian aggression to go unchallenged.  The Russia sanctions amendment codifies and strengthens existing Russia sanctions and imposes a number of new ones. Human rights abusers, individuals supplying weapons to Assad's regime, hackers acting on behalf of the Russian Government, and Russians involved in corruption are all sanctioned in this amendment.  I am grateful to Senators Corker and Crapo, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the chairman of the Banking Committee, for all the work they have done on this bill and on the Russia sanctions amendment. It was a bipartisan bill. Our colleagues on the other side, the Senator from Maryland and others, were involved in crafting this legislation, and it is a demonstration that this body can come together and do consequential things. These are two big national security and foreign policy measures that we have moved today.  There have to be consequences for Iranian and Russian aggression, and this legislation makes sure there will be. I am pleased that it moved today with largely bipartisan support in the U.Senate because it will send a clear message.  I yield the floor.

690,topic-id,361,"Mr.President, I will be brief. I think the Senator from Oklahoma is going to go into some additional details, and the Senator from Wyoming did a great job of summarizing some of the positive results that have come from our actions. I want to refer to his resolutions of disapproval for regulations that we feel were an overreach.  When we went through the 14 votes--we actually had 15, but we were not able to succeed in 1 last regulation of disapproval yesterday--there were arguments put forth against our disapproving these regulations. It was as if we were completely deregulating the subject matter area that we were focused on, but that was not the case. What we were trying to do is eliminate the duplication and the costs associated with layering regulations on top of regulations.  We have a lot of discussion around here about tax reform, and we need to do that, but if we look at the regulatory burden on businesses and homeowners and State and local governments, there is a smart, right-size way to implement regulations, and there is a costly, complex, wrong way to implement regulations.  So I am proud we were able to get 14 resolutions of disapproval completed. I think they were regulations that were not necessary. They are obviously areas that if Congress ever needed to act, we could go back and implement regulations, if necessary.  What we ended up doing through this action over the past couple of months with the administration is reduce regulatory burdens by $67 billion, and we have eliminated some 56 million paperwork hours. We are eliminating, we are cutting redtape, and that is a good thing.  I appreciate all the Members who worked hard on getting this together. I particularly appreciate my staff--Bill Bode and Torie Ness in particular--who worked hard with the other Senate offices to see what kind of support we could get for moving these regulatory disapprovals forward. I thank my fellow Members and the administration for working with us to fulfill our promise, which is to right-size government and get our economy going again.  With that, I yield the floor.

734,topic-id,1311,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon to express my considerable disappointment with the U.S.-Mexico sugar agreement that was announced just last week. This deal was concluded recently. The fact is that this is a bad deal for the United I am completely mystified as to why our Commerce Department would agree to it. It is a bad deal for U.consumers, and we are all consumers. It is a bad deal for American workers.  It completely fails to address the high price of sugar that we have in America today. In fact, it makes the problem worse. It increases the price that we all have to pay for sugar. It reduces choices for consumers, and it absolutely threatens jobs in the many food-producing industries that we have across our country. What it does is that it continues the protectionist policies that favor a handful of big sugar producers and refiners.  These are large, agribusiness companies, generally, already subsidized by domestic agricultural policies that force American consumers to pay artificially inflated prices for their products. It also limits imports, and the fact is that the agreement should be doing just the opposite. It should be giving us a free market in sugar so that American consumers can shop for the best deal available in the world, and that is exactly what it does not do.  Unfortunately, what they did at the Commerce Department is they failed to prioritize the concerns of ordinary American consumers, ordinary American workers. The fact is that the United States is a significant net importer of sugar. We are a huge country, and we don't produce as much sugar as we consume. So we import the difference. Mexico happens to be the 1 source of imported sugar. We get about 35 percent of our imported sugar from The NAFTA trade agreement provided for free trade in sugar. It took a long time to get there, but it contemplated an arrangement where Mexico could sell to American consumers--like my wife, when she goes shopping at the store, and all of our families--without duties, without tariffs, without taxes, without obstacles.  But that didn't work out so well for some of the sugar producers. So they went to court, and they accused Mexico of dumping sugar.  In order to avoid tariffs, the Mexican Government agreed to what they call the suspension agreement. It is an agreement that basically sets a minimum price.  So that is what we do. That is our sugar policy. The government dictates it, essentially, in conjunction with foreign governments. It is the American Government that has all the leverage here. We set prices. We fix prices. We don't have a free market. We establish, by central government fiat, what the price will be.  We also establish import quotas. We decide how much of foreign sugar an American will be permitted to buy, reminiscent of ``Moscow on the Mississippi.'' This is not how you have a free market that allows consumers to have the choices and the benefits from lower competition.  I was concerned about where this negotiation was heading. So Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic Senator from New Hampshire, and I sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Ross to urge him to consider the impact on consumers--which is all of us, I will reiterate--in negotiating this deal. There was a similar letter from House Unfortunately, it apparently did not persuade our Commerce In fact, this new agreement--as I think I mentioned--leaves us with a policy that is worse than it was before. This new so-called suspension agreement increases the already-inflated price of sugar--2 percent higher for raw sugar and 8 percent higher for refined sugar if it is imported from  How does it help the 320 million Americans? How does it help ordinary Americans to be forced to pay more for the sugar that we all have to buy? It is a staple in our food. The answer is that it doesn't help. It hurts the single mom who is going to the grocery store to buy cereal for her kids when she has to pay approximately twice the price of the global price for sugar. Where does that money go? It goes straight out of her pocket and straight into the pockets of this handful of wealthy sugar producers in So it is absolutely bad policy for American consumers.  Make no mistake about it. Higher prices for Mexican sugar mean higher prices for American consumers--all of us. The Coalition for Sugar Reform estimates that the new agreement--just the new agreement--will cost U.consumers an additional billion dollars a year. That goes straight to the growers, the producers. As I said, U.sugar prices are already almost double the world prices, generally, because of the ridiculous agricultural policy we have with respect to sugar. The American Enterprise Institute reports that they believe that the current policy already costs U.consumers $3 billion a year. So you have the $3 billion a year from this flawed policy we used to have. Now we just added another billion dollars a[[Page S3446]]year in costs to our consumers by virtue of this suspension agreement. What the Commerce Department should be doing in these contexts is described as to reduce and eliminate this mandatory price fixing, eliminate these barriers to trade, and put U.consumers as the first priority.  I will point out that it is not only Americans as consumers who are harmed by this, but it is also Americans as workers. There are industries that use sugar as a component in their food products. My State of Pennsylvania, in particular, has a lot of these companies--200 confectioners. We have the most in any Our sugar-using industries employ nearly 40,000 workers across our We have 600,000 workers across the country in the various food and beverage industries that make products that we all consume that use sugar. Guess what. Higher sugar prices jeopardize those well-paying food manufacturing jobs. About 120,000 such jobs have been lost over the last 2 decades because what happens is that American food producers just can't compete. American food producers are forced to buy artificially expensive sugar. Their foreign competitors don't have to do that. Their foreign competitors can buy sugar on the world market at about half the price. So guess what? An American candy maker or cereal maker or other food maker is at a huge competitive disadvantage. We have been losing them, in part, because we force them to pay these artificially high prices.  Our own Commerce Department--the very same Commerce Department that negotiated this deal--did a study. This is their work, not mine. They estimate that when you artificially prop up the price of sugar, you might save some jobs in the sugar-growing industry, but for every job you save there, you lose three jobs in the food processing and manufacturing industry--in the sugar consumption industry. What a terrible trade. What a terrible arrangement.  I am very disappointed to learn about this. The Commerce Department clearly failed to negotiate an agreement that would put consumers first and consumers' pocketbooks first. Instead, we have increased prices above the already artificially high levels. We have restrictions on sugar trade, and, apparently, we have decided to pursue protectionist policies that advance the interests of a small handful of wealthy growers at the expense of several hundred million American consumers. This strikes me as crony capitalism, and it is a huge mistake.  I hope that this is not a sign of what is to come in trade negotiations. We are told that the administration is going to be reevaluating and renegotiating various agreements, including NAFTA and others. As they are being reconsidered, I hope we will not go down this protectionist road of favoring a handful of the privileged few at the expense of the many, as we apparently did in this agreement.

1017,topic-id,2090,"Thank you, Mr.President, and thank you for the recognition.  All across my home State of New Mexico, thousands of hard-working people owe their healthcare and in some cases their lives to the Affordable Care Since early January, I have received over 10,000 letters, emails, and calls from New Mexicans pleading with me to help save their access to healthcare. Over 96 percent of my constituents who have contacted me about healthcare oppose  Let me say that again because I think it is a very important number. Over 96 percent of New Mexicans who have contacted me about healthcare over the past 6 months are opposed to TrumpCare, and they are opposed to the effort to repeal the Affordable Care  The TrumpCare bill is a disgrace and a disaster. It is a disgrace that Senate Republicans are trying to force an extremely unpopular bill on the country in 1 week, and they are doing this even though this bill affects one-sixth of our economy and even though it would cost hundreds of thousands of people in New Mexico and millions of Americans to lose access to healthcare, prescription drugs, drug addiction counseling, and other lifesaving services.  The Republican plan raids Medicaid, it strips away protections that prevent insurance companies from canceling your policy for getting sick, and it reduces the services your insurer has to provide. It does all this to pay for massive tax cuts for the wealthy.  This bill is a disaster because it would be devastating for older New Mexicans, families who are struggling to make ends meet, women, people with preexisting conditions, and New Mexicans in rural areas.  Our rural areas would be particularly hard hit. In some cases, it would do very severe damage to healthcare in rural areas. Hospital administrators in rural counties like Guadalupe County and Socorro County in my home State have told me that losing Medicaid reimbursements could break their budgets, and that could force the small, rural hospitals to limit services or even to close. You know, the last thing you want to have happen in a small, rural community is to have the hospital close. We all know what happens after that: The hospital closes, and then a diminution in services takes place, and it is very hard for communities to stay alive in that situation.  It is no wonder the American people don't want this bill. They don't want  I suppose it is no surprise that the Republicans have kept it hidden--without letting anyone see it. I want to talk about that for a moment. That is not just a talking point for If this bill passes and becomes law, many people will suffer, and it has been kept a total secret.  I wish I could read on the Senate floor every story I have gotten from my constituents who are concerned. If I could, I could hold the record for the longest floor speech. I have shared several in the past, but today I would like to read just one, which is from Elena from  This is a picture of Elena from Albuquerque, She has a very moving story that she wrote me about. In this story, I think you see the story of the Affordable Care Act and the good it does.  Elena is 31 years old.  Earlier this week, I told some of Elena's story in a speech on the Senate floor, but today I want to tell Elena's full story.  Elena graduated last year from the University of New Mexico Law School--my alma mater--and she is quite determined and motivated, as you will hear. She wrote her story in a Facebook post to friends and gave me permission to share it with the American people and with my colleagues here in the Here is her story. This is Elena's story in Elena's words:       For the past 18 months, I have been carrying around a big      secret. I felt really guilty for not sharing it, yet, try as      I might, I could not work up the nerve to tell you all. Lucky      for me, Senator Udall has helped me to rip off the Band-      In the spring of 2016, I found out that I have a BRCA-1      mutation, which puts me at a very high risk of developing      breast and ovarian cancer. Women with a BRCA-1 mutation tend      to get breast and/or ovarian cancer very young, sometimes      even in their 20s or 30s.       When you have a BRCA-1 mutation, you have two options: One,      you can get breast screenings every six months and yearly      ovarian screenings and keep your fingers crossed that nothing      pops up. Or two, you can get your breasts and ovaries removed      and significantly decrease the odds of getting cancer.       Needless to say, there's not really a ``right'' decision. A      woman's choice just comes down to what she feels is right for      her body and life.       In the past 18 months, I've gotten to check a whole lot of      things off my ``absolutely not on my bucket list'' bucket      list.       In April 2016, I had my first breast MRI, which revealed a      lump that my doctor thought might be breast cancer. I then      had my first mammogram, my first breast ultrasound, and my      first breast biopsy. These tests thankfully revealed that I      didn't have breast cancer. They also helped me to make the      difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy and      significantly reduce my chances of getting breast cancer.       In August 2016, I had a prophylactic mastectomy. And in      October and February of this year, I had follow-up surgeries      to have my breasts reconstructed.       Since February, I've been focusing on healing, and I feel      great. Obviously, this isn't the end of the road. Doctors      suggest that women with a BRCA-1 mutation get their ovaries      removed around age 40. And of course screening will continue      to be important. But for now, I feel at peace knowing that      I'm doing what I can to protect myself.       As Senator Udall mentioned, at the time that all of this      health stuff came up, I had health insurance thanks to      Medicaid Expansion through the ACA/      I first enrolled in Medicaid about three years ago when I      was a law student at UNM School of UNM had just given      qualifying students the opportunity to enroll in Medicaid      under the Affordable Care I was a healthy 29-year-old      with no preexisting conditions, and doubted I would ever use      my health insurance. Little did I know, completing the      Medicaid application would be one of the most important      decisions I ever made.       So, a truly genuine #thanksObama to President Obama, his      staff and all our elected leaders who worked to make the ACA      happen and are fighting to keep it alive.       I am so grateful that I qualified for Medicaid at a time in      my life when I unexpectedly needed health insurance more than      I could have ever anticipated. I am so thankful the drafters      of the ACA understood that allowing me to get the preventive      care I needed was better for my health, and also[[Page S3725]]     more financially sound. The ease with which I have received      my medical coverage has allowed me to focus on my recovery.       While it has been a challenging year and a half, knowing      that I could trust my health insurance made it so much easier      than I'd imagined it would be.       I am so relieved that now I can focus on my future instead      of figuring out how to pay off insurmountable medical debt.       I am fully recovered from my surgeries and am working on      moving my life and career forward. I look forward to paying      taxes (I swear, I really do) to support programs like      Medicaid so that I can do my part to assist other Americans      in staying healthy. If you had told me when I signed up for      Medicaid that I would make such extensive use of it, I      wouldn't have believed it. At times, I have felt guilty for      having to utilize Medicaid at a time in my life that has      proven to be so medically and financially complicated.       Friends and family have been good enough to remind me that      this is what Medicaid is about: ensuring that Americans can      afford to take care of their health, regardless of their      financial state, when an issue strikes. The Affordable Care      Act has made this a reality for more people than ever before;      I am so grateful to be one of them.       I am very scared for what the future will bring for those      many individuals who have received insurance thanks to the      I worry that if the [Affordable Care Act] is destroyed,      my preexisting condition will make it financially impossible      for me and many others to get health insurance.       I worry for people who couldn't get insurance through their      work and were finally able to get it through the I      worry that those who suffer from ailments that constantly      affect their health won't be able to afford the care they      need. I worry about the millions of Americans who are about      to lose so much.       I understand that the ACA is not perfect. It needs some      work, especially for people on the exchange who are paying      premiums that are way too high. But the replacement plan that      is being proposed is going to make it incredibly difficult      for all of us to get quality, affordable coverage.       There are no words to adequately express my gratitude to      all those who worked so tirelessly to make the Affordable      Care Act happen. I am so hopeful that instead of destroying      the ACA, our leaders will work to make it stronger so that      all Americans can get the healthcare that they deserve.  Those are the words Elena posted on her Facebook page, very, very moving words. Before her surgery, Elena had an 87-percent chance of developing breast cancer, and now it is less than 10 percent, less than that of the average woman.  I commit to Elena and to every New Mexican and American that I will work to make the ACA stronger so that all Americans will get the healthcare they rightly deserve. But the Senate Republicans cannot claim the same. Their bill, drafted in secret behind closed doors, hurts people like Elena who have preexisting conditions. It hurts people in her situation who have complicated healthcare needs with high medical costs and those who benefit from Medicaid, from the Medicaid expansion.  Americans support the Medicaid They understand that even if they don't need Medicaid, neighbors, friends, family may need it. And they understand that they may need it unexpectedly in the future, as Elena did.  Medicaid expansion has meant that over 265,000 New Mexicans have healthcare coverage that they didn't have before. It is a pretty remarkable thing. In 6 short years in New Mexico, after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, we had people who didn't have any healthcare, and now 265,000 have Medicaid coverage. They could be in a situation just like Elena's. Many of these are hard-working families--families living in rural New Mexico and Native American families living in New  The Senate Republican bill, like the House Republican bill, will end Medicaid expansion in New Mexico for people like  I want everyone listening to hear: This bill cuts Medicaid overall more deeply--more deeply--than the House version. And when President Trump said that the House version was a mean bill, this is a meaner bill. They are not necessary; these cuts are meaner, and they are not necessary to repeal the Affordable Care They will hurt millions of  They are also devastating to our State economies. New Mexico can't afford to pick up the tab for those cuts, so the State will be forced to cut services and reduce payments to doctors. Hospitals might close, and that would mean healthcare jobs will dry up.  Elena's story is one of millions. Every Senator has hundreds of thousands of constituents with these stories. We all need healthcare at some point in our lives.  I urge, I implore my fellow Senators across the aisle to reject the McConnell TrumpCare bill. Work with Democrats on a bipartisan basis to improve America's healthcare system so that every American has access to affordable healthcare.  Don't do this. Don't gut our healthcare system.

823,topic-id,1002,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative Plaskett for yielding. I really do appreciate the gentlewoman heading up tonight and coanchoring and talking about the contributions of Caribbean Americans, and also talking about this health-scare bill that is going on right now, because it seems to be what everybody is talking about.  Of course, the CBO score came out today: 22 million Americans will lose their insurance, many of them that were able to get insurance for the first time under the So that should be very frightening and concerning to us.  The Senate is supposed to vote on this bill, Mr.Speaker, that will have a health-scare effect on so many millions of It is going to be much less affordable and it is going to be a lower-quality healthcare.

Because of this Senate Republican healthcare bill, they are going to be locked out. They are going to be trying to figure out how they are going to get themselves from under that addiction with absolutely no help from It is going to be a very sad day for them.  Many of these losses will come as States are forced to phase out Medicaid over the coming years. That will hurt the African-American population in particular.  Medicaid expansion under the ACA helped 15 million of the nearly 40 million African Americans in the U.gain healthcare insurance, and many of those were for the first time--many of those were for the very first time.  In addition to stripping our most vulnerable of healthcare, Senate Republicans want to defund Planned Parenthood and block lifesaving preventive care for hundreds of thousands of women in the district that I represent and nationwide.  Let me tell you something about Planned Oftentimes, when we start talking about Planned Parenthood, Representative Plaskett, the issue revolves around abortion. But let me tell you something: you cannot have a serious discussion in this country. You absolutely cannot have a serious discussion about social service programs, about Medicaid, and trying to reduce those programs unless you have a serious discussion about family planning.                              {time}  1945  Family planning is something that people don't want to talk about. Maybe in some circles, particularly Republican circles, it is a very taboo subject, but it is something that needs to be discussed more often and we don't talk about enough. We don't talk about it enough with our kids, with our families.  When you do something like defund Planned Parenthood, it is going to make that situation even worse. It is going to make people even more needy and more in a situation to where they cannot be self-dependent.  Instead of supporting smart public health initiatives, Republicans in the higher Chamber would rather repeal the ACA as another opportunity to demonize one of the country's leading reproductive health organizations, and that is Planned Parenthood that I talked about earlier.  We need to be doing everything that we can to make sure that Americans everywhere can lead a healthier life, but the Senate's cruel and heartless bill will cause unnecessary suffering.  The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for many in the Black community, and a full repeal will snatch that safety net out from under our community. The Black community has a lot to lose under the Republican healthcare plan, and we will not take an assault on healthcare lying down.  We have got to fight this thing. We need to fight for every grandmother out there. We need to fight for every aunt out there, every mother out there, all of our loved ones out there who may be forced to make the choice between whether or not they are going to have healthcare or whether or not they are going to be able to pay for groceries; and that is just not right.  We need to fight for all the single dads out there who are trying to make ends meet, the single moms out there who are trying to make ends meet, because we know that, if you take away Medicaid expansion, it is going to force individuals like that to have to make some really tough choices.  We need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to make sure that we have access to quality healthcare, and that it is not reserved for a few of the wealthy in our country. And when you look at the Republican bill, Representative Plaskett, that is exactly what it does.  This is a vehicle that will deliver tax breaks to the very rich and will leave individuals like we have been talking about in the Black community, and not just in the African-American communities, but in all communities out there that are out there working hard, suffering, in a situation where they need Medicaid and they need insurance, it is going to leave them locked out.  It is going to be a sad day in America when people who thought that they were going to get insurance for the first time, or people who had insurance for the first time, they were going to get those wellness checkups, they were meeting with their family care physician on a regular basis, and they have that stolen from them because of this monstrous plan.

736,topic-id,1097,"Mr.President, however loud, persistent, and powerful the climate denial operation has been, we have to remember that it has always been built on lies. It is a huge fortress of lies stacked upon lies--lies about the science, lies about the scientists, lies about doubt, lies about costs, lies through phony front groups, and lies about where the money comes from and who is pulling the strings.  This fortress of lies protects a subsidy to the fossil fuel industry that the International Monetary Fund puts at $700 billion per year. For big, big money, you can do big, big lies, and they do. These have been the biggest lies of our generation. But to paraphrase the great reggae singer Jimmy Cliff: ``The bigger you lie, the harder you fall.'' To paraphrase the ``Game of Thrones,'' ``The fall is coming.'' In the last few weeks, there has been news that has shaken this fortress of lies and moves us toward that fall. Shareholders are rising up.  For as long as there have been shareholder resolutions to fossil fuel companies about climate change, there has been resolute opposition from management to every vote. Hundreds of shareholder resolutions went down to defeat until now.  Occidental Petroleum shareholders last month won the first victory against management, and a week later mighty ExxonMobil was defeated by its shareholders. This new reporting that shareholders have demanded will help clear away the lies. The fall is coming.  There are even lies within the lies. To fend off this latest shareholder resolution to try to make the company look less irresponsible, ExxonMobil's CEO repeated the company's claim that it knows climate change is real and supports a carbon fee--but it doesn't.  As everyone in this building knows, ExxonMobil maintains a massive lobbying apparatus in Washington, and that massive apparatus is and always has been resolutely opposed to any such thing as a carbon fee or any serious climate action whatsoever, for that matter, unless maybe ExxonMobil doesn't know what its own vast lobbying apparatus is doing. Maybe ExxonMobil spends that enormous amount of money to exert its influence in Washington to stop any climate action, and the CEO is unaware of that going on. I doubt that. You be the judge of whether that is credible.  It is not just shareholders rising up; attorneys general are starting to win. The attorney general of New York has just filed pleadings in State court in New York asserting that ExxonMobil's climate reporting has been a ``sham''--to use the word from his filing; that, in the oldest of accounting tricks, ExxonMobil kept two sets of books assessing carbon pollution risk. After fierce opposition by ExxonMobil lawyers using every trick in the book to delay and snarl the New York attorney general, it looks now as if ExxonMobil may have lied to its investors and its shareholders. If ExxonMobil has lied to its shareholders, that is a violation of law, and that fall comes hard indeed.  Secretary of State Tillerson evidently knew of and approved the two sets of carbon pollution books when he was CEO of We will see where this goes, but of all the people around Trump who might be indicted, now we might add the Secretary of  The Attorney General of Massachusetts is also pursuing ExxonMobil against equally fierce tactics by ExxonMobil lawyers. To try to get away from the Massachusetts attorney general, the lawyers even went so far as to claim--get this--that ExxonMobil was not doing business in Massachusetts; that it didn't have the minimum contacts with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts necessary for the State even to assert jurisdiction. Well, the judge virtually laughed that argument out of court, but it shows how desperate ExxonMobil must be feeling as it tries to wriggle away from having to answer questions under oath.  Nothing turns a big lie into a hard fall better than having to put that right hand up and give truthful testimony and face cross-examination under penalty of perjury.  Will the Securities and Exchange Commission take a look at this sham reporting, too, or has the Federal government, under Trump, degenerated into such a fossil fuel banana republic that no Federal agency will do its job against that industry or might it even chime in on the side of industry Pruitt-style?  Do you remember the question of whether the fossil fuel climate denial operation merits investigation under Federal civil racketeering laws? The tobacco industry was sued under Federal civil racketeering laws by the U.Department of Justice so there is a model. You may remember that the question as to the fossil fuel climate denial operation was referred by Attorney General Lynch to the FBI--or so she testified.  One wonders, did the FBI ever take an honest look? What was the outcome? Was there ever a report? Are they still looking at it?  Remember that the Department of Justice won its civil racketeering case against the tobacco industry, they won it at trial, and they won again on appeal. The woman who won that case for the Department of Justice, the lead trial attorney for the Department, has said publicly that this climate denial operation also merits investigation as fraud. That would seem to be a knowledgeable opinion from the woman who[[Page S3447]]won the last case, an opinion perhaps worth heeding, but did anything happen? Will anything happen?  Forget too big to fail or too big to jail. Is the power of the fossil fuel industry now so great that it is too big even to investigate, even by the Department of Justice? Does it now take State attorneys general to do the job because the Federal government is so owned now by the fossil fuel industry?  Think about it. What if the FBI reported to the Attorney General that there was a meritorious fraud case arising out of all the lies propping up climate denial? Who believes Attorney General Sessions would allow that case to go forward against his party's biggest backer?  Well, the bigger the lie, ultimately, the harder the fall. One way or the other, this fact remains constant and true. There always will come a day of reckoning. With these shareholder victories and with these attorneys general victories, that day of reckoning is closing in--the day when they have to put that right hand up and testify truthfully and under oath, not just send out spin through front groups and operatives but testify truthfully under penalty of perjury.  It is long overdue for truth to have its day.  I yield the floor.

803,topic-id,1727,"Mr.President, I rise to continue my discussion about the case for a bigger Navy, a bigger fleet, and to endorse the requirement of the experts in the Department of Defense that we move to a 355-ship  When a crisis strikes around the world, the President asks his national security team: Where are the carriers? Where are the aircraft carriers?  Each of our carriers is a 100,000-ton giant, accompanied by an entire carrier group that consists of mighty warships and aircraft. The carrier, itself, represents 4.5 acres of sovereign U.territory.  In early January of this year--and Senators do not know this--a strange and profoundly disturbing thing happened. The answer to the Commander in Chief's question, had it been asked at that point--where are the carriers?--would have been that none of them had been deployed--not a single one. For the first time since World War II, the United States had no carriers deployed anywhere--not in the Persian Gulf, not in the Mediterranean, not in the Western  There is a gap in our global carrier presence, and there is a gap in our fleet. This comes from years of complacency. Also, it comes from a different set of facts that we are faced with and a different set of challenges that we are faced with in our quest to make our presence known and to protect our national security interests on the open seas. We have ignored the great naval competition that is taking place elsewhere--the fact that it is accelerating. We have taken our Navy and our sailors and marines for granted.  Simply put, the Navy we have today is too small. We cannot accomplish the critical missions that we have by preserving the status quo. Right now, we have 277 ships, and we need to get to 355 ships. That was reiterated today by the Chief of Naval Operations and the Secretary of the Navy in a hearing before the full Armed Services  I will reiterate to my colleagues and to the American people what the Navy does for America and why the current fleet is too small to meet current and emerging challenges.  First, the global presence of the Navy ship matters to American prosperity--to the quality of life of Ninety percent of global trade is seaborne. Maritime traffic has increased by 400 percent over the past quarter century. In addition to commerce, nearly all intercontinental telecommunications transit via a web of undersea cables. Undersea cables are responsible for nearly all of our intercontinental telecommunications.  Second, a strong Navy deters aggressive behavior and reassures our allies as the Nation's first-on-the-scene force. A strong Navy can help keep bad situations from spiraling out of control and getting worse. For example, the President recently dispatched multiple carrier strike groups to the Sea of Japan following North Korea's missile tests. The President asked where the carriers were, and he dispatched them to a place of crisis. A mix of ships gives our Commander in Chief a range of military options, and their deployments to areas of instability can send a message of resolve to our friends and foes alike.[[Page S3531]]  Third, if deterrence fails, our naval forces can provide a decisive response to aggression. Surface ships, submarines, and the aircraft on the carriers can launch missile strikes, control air and sea traffic, and intercept missile threats. The recent U.action in Syria is a good example, as the Presiding Officer knows. In using destroyers in the Mediterranean, the Commander in Chief delivered precision strikes against Syrian airfields. He enforced the redline against outlawed chemical weapons, and President Assad has not crossed that redline again.  Accomplishing these missions as the Nation's sentinel and first responder requires a big Admiral John Richardson, the Chief of Naval Operations, put it best in ``The Future Navy'' white paper that was released last month. He said:       Numbers matter. The number of ships in the Navy's fleet      determines where we can be, and being there is a key to naval      power.  Again, the current fleet of about 277 ships is way too small. It is important to remember that not all ships are deployed or deployable. In fact, only about 100 ships out of the 277 are currently deployed. The other two-thirds are undergoing heavy maintenance, routine sustainment, or are training to deploy. The Navy recently validated its requirement for 355 ships--a 47-ship increase over the previous requirement.  The lack of ships has created coverage gaps all over the world. I will give two examples.  First, the commander of Pacific Command, ADM Harry Harris, recently told Congress he has only half the submarines he needs. Admiral Harris is responsible for deterring China and North Korea, but he is missing half of the submarines he needs. Closer to home, the commander of Southern Command, ADM Kurt Tidd, has zero Navy ships permanently assigned to his area of operations. These are just two of the many alarming instances where the lack of ships is having major consequences.  While we watch our edge erode, America's real and potential adversaries are building the size and capability of their fleets. They are on the field competing while, in America, many of our players are still in the locker room.  China is building a modern navy capable of projecting global power. China is modernizing every type of ship and submarine in its fleet. China commissioned 18 ships last year. In April, China launched its first domestically built carrier and plans to build at least six more carriers. By 2030, China will have more than twice as many attack submarines and four times as many small surface ships as the United Beijing is developing its first overseas naval base in the Horn of China's naval buildup may attempt to push the United States first out of the Western Pacific, away from critical trade chokepoints and our allies in South Korea and  I would call the attention of Members to the poster that I have, and I hope it is printed large enough for my colleagues to see. In terms of five types of ships, it compares where we were in 2000, where we are today, and where we are projected to be if current trends continue.  For example, on the farthest column shown on the chart, in attack submarines--and the black portion of each circle represents China's capability, and the blue represents our capability in the United States of In 2000, it was 64 to 55 in favor of the In 2016, as we can see, 56 to 57. But under current projections, by the year 2030, when it comes to attack submarines, the Chinese will have 87 and the United States will have only 42--a disturbing trend which the Navy would like to reverse if we have the ability and the wisdom to give them the requirement they have said they need.  With regard to ballistic missile submarines, in 2000, quite a mismatch--only 1 for China as compared to 18 for the United States; then, only last year, 4 for China and 14 for the U.Navy; and then projected for 2030--and really that is in only 13 short years, which is hard to believe--there will be more Chinese ballistic missile submarines than American ballistic missile submarines unless we take the Navy's requirement to heart and take action beginning this year to rectify that situation.  With regard to small surface ships, as we can see, there was a 79-to-62 advantage in sheer numbers in 2000 and a 103-to-23 advantage of the Chinese in 2016. In 2030, there will still be a mismatch, in terms of numbers, of 123 small surface ships compared to only 40 for the United States of  With large surface ships, it was 20 to 79, then 19 to 84, and by the year 2030, as we can see, the Chinese are projected to have 34 large surface ships.  With regard to aircraft carriers, as I pointed out, they were not in that game at all in 2000. They delivered their first last year, and they are projected to go to four by the year 2013.  It all adds up to 260--a 260-ship fleet for China and only 199 for the United States unless we act, and act responsibly, in response to what the Navy and the Marine Corps and the best military minds in the Pentagon are telling us, and I hope we will do that.  An increasingly aggressive Russia is also modernizing. The Kremlin is pouring money into new attack and nuclear ballistic missile submarines. Russian submarine patrols have doubled, and those patrols are stretching closer to the U.homeland. The Russian Navy's operating areas have expanded to include regular operations in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and Caspian Russia is also exploiting new opportunities in the Arctic by building naval bases in the High  So both China and Russia are investing heavily in their fleets and in new ballistic and cruise missiles that can target U.naval forces.  And, of course, we need to turn to the subject matter of North Kim Jong Un will stop at nothing to develop a nuclear weapon that can strike our allies and that can strike deployed U.forces and eventually our homeland. A nuclear ballistic submarine would essentially make North Korea impervious to threats of preemption. North Korea is building fortified submarine bunkers and began testing submarine-launched ballistic missiles within the last year.  Iran is another rogue state developing a massive fleet of fast attack boats and mini-submarines to deny the free passage of ships through the vital Strait of  Naval competition is a fact. China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran have clearly been building up the size and the sophistication of their fleets. The Chief of Naval Operations has a word to describe the pace of competition, and that word is ``exponential.'' The CNO puts it this way:       Time is an unforgiving characteristic of the maritime      [environment]. Things are moving faster, including our      competitors.  So let's start competing again. Building a larger fleet is a national project. It will require sustained commitment by the President, the Congress, and the Department of As chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, I intend to begin laying a firm foundation this year for a significant buildup in the future, and I hope my colleagues will join me.

708,topic-id,1794,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague and good friend, Chairman Hatch, for his courtesies. We have worked very closely together on this nomination. This was a challenging task, and I thank Chairman Hatch for his cooperation.  Mr.Lighthizer needed a waiver because he had represented foreign interests. It was extremely important that we work with Senator Manchin and other colleagues to address the enormous needs of the miners, and we had a whole host of Members with a variety of extremely important trade issues--matters like steel, aluminum, and digital goods in our part of the world; we also care about softwood lumber tremendously.  Chairman Hatch and I worked with all the members of the Finance It was a unanimous vote, and I thank him for his cooperation.  We have talked a little bit about trade and what a modern trade policy is going to look like. The Lighthizer discussion is the beginning of the debate on trade in this Congress, and I have tried to be clear about my agenda. My agenda is to create more red, white, and blue jobs in America--high-skilled, high-waged jobs. Very often, the trade jobs pay better than do the nontrade jobs because there is more value added in them; there is a higher level of productivity. So my view is, as we set out on this journey to get more high-skilled, high-waged jobs, look to Asia where there are going to be 1 billion middle-class people there in a few years. What we ought to do is focus on growing them in the United States, making them in the United States, adding value to them in the United States, and then shipping them somewhere. That is my idea of a modern trade agenda.  So far, the administration's trade agenda amounts to a muddle of 140-character tweets, mixed messages, and overhyped announcements that seem to be backed by not much substance. I think we are going to have to put together a coherent strategy quickly to promote our exports and fight back against trade cheats. That is not exactly what we have seen from the administration to date.  We can almost suffer whiplash from the reports about what happens with various trade deals. Late at night, it was reported that the President is about to pull the United States out of NAFTA; then suddenly there is another[[Page S2905]]report saying he has changed his mind after a conversation with the Next, at a moment of extreme tension on the Korean Peninsula, it is reported that the President is threatening to pull out of the U.S.-Korea trade agreement. Then suddenly that threat is walked back. So the President has made some major statements with respect to trade deals on the books, but he has yet to give us much in the way of specifics on how he would like to bring that about.  If one is trying to run a business in Oregon or around the United States that exports to foreign markets, it is pretty hard not to feel rattled and confused by some of the President's statements and tweets about trade. One might even make the decision not to invest and not to hire additional workers. I hope the President will soon see that some of the uncertainty and confusion that has been stoked as a negotiating tactic is not a recipe for creating red, white, and blue jobs.  I do think Robert Lighthizer knows what the challenge is really all about, and I want to tell him I have appreciated our conversations. He is a real pro at this. I have appreciated his views, particularly on digital goods, which I think are so important to our burgeoning technology sector, and his views on Canadian lumber.  I would also like to state at this time that I think very highly of Secretary He has been very constructive in our conversations, particularly on Canadian softwood lumber.  Obviously, the U.Trade Representative will lead our country in trade negotiations, and that will be Mr.Lighthizer's role. The bulk of the expertise of trade does reside within his office. When Mr.Lighthizer is confirmed, as I hope he will be and expect he will be, this expertise will no longer be silent.  I will wrap up simply by way of saying that the United States may be the world's largest economy, but it represents only 4 percent of the world's consumers. Red, white, and blue jobs in the United States depend on our ability to sell to the other 96 percent. The number of middle-class households around the world is going to double over the next decade. This represents a lot of potential buying power for the American brand, the Oregon brand. The fact is, people all over the world love buying the goods and the services we make. It is going to take a lot of hard work to smash through the barriers that block American-made goods and fight back against trade cheats.  Lastly, the trade rules in many particulars are out of date, so we have a lot of work to do to promote labor rights, combat human trafficking, crack down on trade in illegally taking wildlife and endangered species, and get the trade system updated so it includes things like digital goods and small businesses that now have an international reach, which is especially important. The trading system has to respond more quickly to countries that break the rules or are unfairly producing basic commodities, such as steel and aluminum. This is especially true with respect to  As policymakers, we must continue to take an honest look at the trade rules and fix what doesn't work so that American workers aren't left behind. It is long past time to invest more resources in monitoring, litigating, and enforcing our trading partners' obligations, including China's. The United States must respond more aggressively and more rapidly to threats to U.workers and businesses.  There was a recent example of how this is done right when the Commerce Department said ``enough'' to Canada's unfairly traded softwood lumber. The steps the Commerce Department took were undeniably warranted after mill towns in Oregon and many other States have been clobbered over the last few decades. My first preference is a long-term agreement with Canada, but if they are not going to come to the table, I will keep fighting for our mills and mill jobs, and I will insist the administration do the same.  The U.needs to carry that same steadfast approach across the board--getting trade enforcement right is not just a lumber issue. That means more resources for boots on the ground: investigators and enforcers. Not just at the office of the USTR but also at Customs and Border Protection and the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Labor, State, and Interior, where investigators are tasked with stopping trade in illegally taken wildlife. Bottom line, trade enforcement requires all hands on deck. If you boost trade enforcers at one agency only to wipe out the trade enforcers at another, you will fail to protect American workers from unfair or illegal imports.  So I will be looking closely at the budget that the President submits to determine whether he is serious about delivering real results on trade enforcement or whether the campaign rhetoric and dramatic tweets are just a bunch of hot air,  In recognition of the need for a new approach on trade enforcement, Congress recently passed new laws that give the President better tools to respond when trading partners don't follow the rules. It also passed legislation to strengthen domestic laws that enable the U.to unilaterally respond when American jobs are under threat, and it provided new direction should the President wish to negotiate new trade agreements or renegotiate past ones. In the coming months, I expect that those tools will not just sit and gather dust while the administration talks tough with respect to trade.  It takes consistency, strategy and a lot of hard work to get trade done right. I have confidence that Robert Lighthizer will work to pursue a trade agenda that is coherent, constructive, and will deliver for American workers, and I will support his nomination.  However, I want to express reservation on one issue pertaining to this nominee. During his confirmation hearing, Senator Stabenow asked Mr.Lighthizer how he would deal with situations in which he was conducting trade negotiations with a country in which the President has business interests. Senator Stabenow wanted to make sure that the President's personal financial interests wouldn't take precedence over the public interest. Mr.Lighthizer seemed surprised by the question, saying, quote, ``the idea that this President would do anything untoward is . . . far out of the realm of possibility.''  I would like to put Mr.Lighthizer on notice. This is a legitimate issue, and I share Senator Stabenow's concern. Never before has this country faced a circumstance in which our trade representative will be negotiating trade agreements with countries in which the President or his family have active business interests, whether it is trademarks, golf courses, or construction deals. I have introduced a bill requiring the President, when initiating trade negotiations, to disclose whether he has business interests in the country that we will be negotiating with. I intend to press this issue as trade negotiations move forward. Trade should be about fighting on behalf of American workers and businesses. It is not about the President's bottom line.  Finally, on an issue that has been closely related to this nomination, I want to commend several of my colleagues for working together to provide relief to retired mineworkers regarding their healthcare costs. Senator Manchin has been a crusader on behalf of the mineworkers. Hardly a week went by over the last several months when I didn't hear from Joe Manchin about how important it was to get the mineworkers the healthcare benefits they have earned. And he has worked hand-in-hand with Senators Brown, Casey, and Warner, all of whom serve on the Finance Chairman Hatch deserves thanks for working with us to get this across the finish line as well.  I see that my good friend, Chairman Hatch, is here to make his remarks. I thank him for the cooperation he has shown. I think the interests of both sides in processing this nomination have been advanced.  A lot could have gone awry here. We had challenges with getting the waiver Mr.Lighthizer needed. We needed the space to make sure the miners were protected. Members had strong views.  I thank Chairman Hatch for the diplomacy and cooperation he showed me and our side. I think that is why there was a very large vote for Mr.Lighthizer in the committee.  I will be voting aye this afternoon and look forward to the Chairman's wrap-up remarks.

817,topic-id,3007,"Mr.President, I want to start my remarks on healthcare and what is ahead over the next couple of weeks in this way.  For almost 7 years before I got elected to the Congress, I was the director of the Oregon Gray Panthers, which is a senior citizens group, and I ran a legal aid office for the elderly.

I made that judgment because I have always felt that if you and your loved ones do not have their health, then pretty much everything else does not matter.  The Presiding Officer of the Senate, of course, is a skilled healthcare provider and knows a lot about these issues, and I am really going to use that as my reference point today in making the judgment that having quality, affordable healthcare for your families and yourselves is paramount to everything else.[[Page S3546]]  My view is that the proposal being considered here in the Senate of cutting hundreds of billions of dollars in funds from the social safety net--the Medicaid Program, which is the lifeline for seniors and kids with special needs and for the disabled--is going to put at risk the health and well-being of millions of Americans if it is passed.  It is why I want to take some time to explain what it actually does so that people all across this country will be in a position to make their voices heard--to speak up, to do their part--so that when this debate comes to the floor of the U.Senate, as I believe it will in the next couple of weeks--and it moves very quickly--every Member of this body will have heard, loud and clear, what Americans think of this proposal, and I do not think that that assessment is going to be too kind.  Now, the House passed their version of TrumpCare by a razor's edge, and to put it in a pleasant way, over here, Senators looked at it and said: No way. No thanks. My colleagues in the Senate majority said: We are throwing this bill out, starting fresh, and we are going to do it right. So I am going to start with where that process got lost.  The majority convened a special working group made up of 13 Republican Senators, all of them men, and it turns out, based on comments that have been reported, the Senate bill isn't going to be all that different from what the House was talking about. So Republicans in the Senate are pretty much picking up where the House left off on TrumpCare, and the legislation that is being crafted stays hidden--stays behind closed doors and in a position where, for example, if you are a Democrat on the Finance Committee, you don't even know what is in it. It is not going before committees. It will not be put forward for amendment in a markup. With barely any public notice, the bill will hit this floor for 28 hours of debate--that is that.  I will just briefly describe a session we had in the Finance Committee this week where there was discussion from the other side of the aisle that maybe there was a big partisan divide with respect to healthcare. I listened a bit. Finally, I said: I don't know how you can have a partisan divide about a bill that you can't read.  I am the senior Democrat on the Finance The Finance Committee is the committee that has jurisdiction over hundreds of billions of dollars in payments for Medicare and Medicaid and the various tax credits that are part of the Affordable Care This is the committee with the authority to address the management of hundreds of billions of dollars for those programs--Medicare, Medicaid, tax credits--and we see nothing. Not only have there been no hearings, we haven't seen anything. Something has been sent to the Congressional Budget Who knows the answer to that. We haven't seen that either.  So that is the process that would dictate a radical transformation of one-sixth of the American economy--the American healthcare system--affecting millions and millions of  That is what we are looking at right now for the next couple of weeks, and it is pretty different than what happened during the Affordable Care  I want to focus on a few points just with respect to that. The first is especially important, as I have said, to the Finance Committee that deals with Medicare and Medicaid and these crucial aspects of healthcare in The Senate Finance Committee has been cut out of this process. The chairman, Senator Hatch, I, and 24 other committee members--there has been nothing for us to examine as a group to do what the Finance Committee tries to do best, which is to work in a bipartisan way. That is what we have done so often in the past, which is to sit down and try to take the good ideas that come from both sides, from the staff who knows healthcare inside and out, with years of experience working on healthcare matters.  I have a little bit of a special interest in this because I wrote something called the Healthy Americans Act before the Presiding Officer was here in this body. Eight Democratic Senators and eight Republican Senators joined together in comprehensive healthcare reform for the first time--for the first time ever before.  We have done a lot of good work on issues that represent the big challenges ahead. We know, for example, Medicare today isn't the Medicare of 1965, when it was about broken ankles, Part A or Part B, a bad case of the flu. Today Medicare is about chronic illness--diabetes and heart disease and strokes and cancer. We have worked on that in a bipartisan way. Bipartisanship is what the Finance Committee is all about.  So in the runup to the Affordable Care Act, we held more than 50 hearings, roundtables, walk-through sessions. It wasn't exactly exciting. We always used to say: If you are having trouble sleeping, come by for a while and you will be knocked out in a matter of minutes. But that is where you do the hard work of legislating.  When the Finance Committee finished the drafting process, the legislation sat online for 6 days before we went through the formal committee consideration--what we know up here as a markup. A total of 564 amendments were posted online before the markup began for all to read. The markup lasted 8 days. There were 130 amendments in the longest markup in 22 years. Two dozen Republican amendments were adopted, and the bill passed with a bipartisan vote.  We all got pretty sick of the hearing room by the time it was over. I will just read a quote from Senator Grassley with respect to the Finance Committee markup of the Affordable Care Senator Grassley is the chairman, of course, of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the former committee chairman of the Finance Committee, and a very careful, thoughtful legislator. He said: ``This was the most open and inclusive process the committee has undertaken in its history. . . . ''  He went on to say: `` . . . I believe, since I have been on the committee.''  So that is not a That is Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary I am sure Senator Murray has similar accounts of the process under the late Senator That legislation was online for days as well.  That is what the legislative process is supposed to look like. It is a process that starts from the bottom up, and it is out in the open. Sunlight has always been the best disinfectant. You get hearings. You get study. You get debate. You marry the best ideas of both sides.  I have always felt that bipartisanship is not about taking each other's lousy ideas; bipartisanship is about taking each other's good ideas, but because of the process the Republican leader is insisting on, that is not what the majority has on offer. What is in the works is hidden away so the public and Americans across this country who might be sitting in a coffee shop and would like to pull up a proposal on their laptop, they can't do it, and there aren't any hearings on what might be going in the bill as well. That, in my view, is the wrong way to build a sweeping, massive proposal like this, which, for so many of those who are walking on an economic tightrope, balancing their food against their fuel and their fuel against their medical care, this isn't some abstract issue for them. It is a matter of life and death.  This proposal is built around an attack on The last version of the bill that anybody has been allowed to see cut the program by more than $800 billion, but there haven't been any hearings on what that would mean for the 74 million Americans who get their healthcare coverage through Nobody has been brought before the Finance Committee to talk about how you would not endanger the Medicaid nursing home benefit with this proposal, and that benefit pays for two out of three nursing home beds in There hasn't been a hearing examining the effect of the staggering implications of Medicaid cuts on 37 million kids enrolled in the program, particularly what it means for kids with disabilities and kids in special education classes.  At home in Oregon, when we had town meetings and roundtables on it, I just brought up--just raised the issue very gently--about the prospect of those special needs kids being hurt with this proposal, and the room just broke out in sobs.  There haven't been any hearings on how much worse the opioid epidemic will get in States across the country when people enrolled in Medicaid lose access to treatment for mental health and substance abuse disorders. Just this morning, I talked about a[[Page S3547]]brandnew idea that seems to be picking up some interest in the majority about basically coming up with kind of a separate way to fund the coverage for opioids. Instead of it being a guarantee of being able to get access to services, it would sort of be a separate program, which also is not in line with sensible healthcare policy. As the Presiding Officer knows, so often those addicted to opioids have multiple conditions. In other words, if you are a young person who is addicted to opioids, you might well need mental health services. If you are an older person who is addicted to opioids, you might need services relating to chronic illness.  So I want everybody in those States across the country--particularly in the Midwest and in the industrial Northeast--although opioid addiction has hit this country like a wrecking ball from Portland, OR, to Portland, There are a lot of people paying attention to what is going to happen with respect to coverage for those addicted to opioids, and based on this proposal I have been reading about that is being floated, this is a prescription for trouble for those trying to come back from opioid addiction.  Then, I want to mention the bill's provisions on preexisting conditions. When the Affordable Care Act was written in committee, the bedrock guarantee of protection against discrimination for those who have preexisting conditions and protecting those who have preexisting conditions with airtight, loophole-free protection--that was at the heart of the Affordable Care My view is TrumpCare takes a jackhammer to that bedrock protection, cracking open loopholes that benefit insurance companies. Americans are aghast that their elected representatives would support the idea. I know that because I have had 46 townhall meetings in my State this year, and I hear about it at nearly every one.  So one would think this would generate a lot of interest in the Senate Finance Committee--the committee with jurisdiction over Medicaid, for example--because there are a lot of those folks who have preexisting conditions. No discussion. Zero discussion--zero--of any proposal that the Senate could be considering over the next couple of weeks that rolls back protections on preexisting conditions.  I gather the House bill just basically takes the waiver process, which in the Affordable Care Act was designed to let States do better; in the House, they let States do worse--considerably worse--and one of the most objectionable features is the States can get a waiver and unravel some of those strong protections for people with preexisting conditions.  Now, if the healthcare changes I have mentioned aren't bad enough, TrumpCare also takes hundreds of billions of dollars of healthcare from needy and vulnerable people and, in effect, hands it in tax breaks to the most fortunate. Nobody has come before the Senate Finance Committee with authority over taxes to explain why the Congress ought to raid healthcare programs for the vulnerable to fund tax cuts for the fortunate few.  Our committee--the chairman and I, along with all the Democrats and several of the Republicans--has been prevented from legislating out in the open on this proposal because the Senate TrumpCare plan has essentially been pushed out of view. It is clear that this isn't just sidestepping the Finance The public--the American people--have been cut out of the process when healthcare policy that will affect millions for years to come is being written here.  The majority leader has said he pretty much is not interested in input from The Republican healthcare plan is going to move by reconciliation. That is a Washington word, folks--when you are at a coffee shop, nobody is talking about reconciliation, but it is basically our way or the highway. We are going to do it our way, and that is that. It is the most partisan road you can go down in the It relies on moving as quickly as possible with the least possible sunlight.  As far as I can tell, the Senate bill is going to be hidden until virtually the last minute, at which point it will come straight to the floor for a very short, abbreviated debate.  That is not what happened when the Affordable Care Act came up. The Senate spent 25 consecutive days in session on healthcare reform, the second longest consecutive session in history--week after week, spirited debate, mid-November into late December, vote after vote after vote. In total, the Senate debated the Affordable Care Act for nearly 220 hours. That kind of extended give-and-take from both political parties you just can't have under this partisan ``our way or the highway'' approach known as reconciliation.  When the Senate plan hits the floor, there will be 20 hours of debate before time expires and the final votes are cast. That is it. That is it. We won't have seen a bill until the last minute, and then one-sixth of our economy is going to be handled and framed for decades to come in a short and regrettably partisan debate.  I have said from day one that the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. No major piece of legislation ever is. For major legislation to work and for it to last, it has to be bipartisan. That is why I mentioned that I put in a bipartisan bill--eight Democrats and eight But you don't get it exactly your way. So I was very glad when the Affordable Care Act took that portion of our bill--the portion of the bill that had airtight, guaranteed protection for Americans from discrimination when they had preexisting conditions.  The reason we felt it was so important--the 16 of us, eight Democrats and eight Republicans--is that if we open up the opportunity for discriminating against people with preexisting conditions again, we take America back to the days when healthcare was for the healthy and the wealthy. That is what happens if you allow that discrimination. If you are healthy, there is no problem. If you are wealthy, there is no problem, either. You can just write out the checks if you have preexisting conditions.  The process the Senate is headed down now is as partisan as it gets. Unfortunately, what Senate Republicans are doing now makes what the House was up to almost transparent.  I am going to close here with just one last comment. Now is the time for the American people to get loud about healthcare--really loud--because the well-being and health of millions of Americans is at stake here in the Senate over the next 2 weeks. For older people who could need nursing home care, for seniors who aren't yet eligible for Medicare who are between 55 and 65 and who could face huge premium hikes, for the millions who work for employers who thought they were safe, the House bill removes the caps on the out-of-pocket expenses they have. If somebody gets cancer in America, they bust those caps in a hurry. Yet that is what the House is willing to do, and I don't see any evidence the Senate is willing to change.  This debate didn't end when the theatrical production on the South Lawn of the White House took place a few weeks after the vote in the House of My hope is--and I sure heard about it from Oregonians last week when we had townhall meetings across the State; there is concern, there is fear, and there is frustration about why they can't be told what is in this bill--that there is still time for Americans to make a difference because political change doesn't start from the top and go down. It is bottom up. It is not top down. It is bottom up. There is still time for the American people to be heard and to make sure their Senator understands how they feel about this, what is at stake, and, in particular, to get an explanation about why they can't be told now what is in this bill.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Blunt). The Senator from Texas, the majority whip.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-15-pt1-PgS3528-4.txt,1247,ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT,2017.0,15.0,June
