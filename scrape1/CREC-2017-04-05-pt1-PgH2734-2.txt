                           THE LORD'S PRAYER

  (Mr. RUSH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I want to recite this prayer:
  Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name; Thy kingdom 
come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day 
our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who 
trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from 
evil. For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever 
and ever.
  In Jesus' name, Amen.
