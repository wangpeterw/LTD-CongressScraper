                   COMMONSENSE GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION

  (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)

[[Page H1203]]

  

  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Madam Speaker, a person sends their child to 
school and expects that they are going to come home safely.
  I am so sad for the grieving families of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High School in Parkland. Innocent children--gone in a blink. I am 
thankful for the first responders, but foremost, my thoughts are with 
the grieving families, the students, and the teachers affected by this 
horrific shooting.
  We see this carnage over and over again. We know there is no magic 
solution, but that doesn't mean that there are no solutions. We need 
more resources for mental health, not tax cuts for billionaires. And, 
yes, Mr. President, are you listening? We need commonsense gun safety 
legislation, not these idiotic bills that expand gun usage.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Handel). Members are reminded to please 
address their remarks to the Chair and not to a viewing audience.
