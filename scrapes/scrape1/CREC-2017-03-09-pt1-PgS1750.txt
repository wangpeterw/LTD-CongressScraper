Ms. Baldwin, Ms. Hassan, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Duckworth, Mr.

Ms. Warren, Mr. Peters, Mr. Van Hollen, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. McCain, 
Mr. Moran, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Manchin, and Mr. Casey) submitted the 
following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                               S. Res. 86

       Whereas, since its inception in 1994, the AmeriCorps 
     national service program has proven to be a highly effective 
     way to engage the people of the United States in meeting a 
     wide range of local and national needs and promote the ethics 
     of service and volunteerism;
       Whereas, since 1994, more than 1,000,000 individuals have 
     taken the AmeriCorps pledge to ``get things done for 
     America'' by becoming AmeriCorps members;
       Whereas, each year, AmeriCorps, in coordination with State 
     service commissions, provides opportunities for approximately 
     80,000 individuals across the United States to give back in 
     an intensive way to communities, States, and the United 
     States;
       Whereas AmeriCorps members have served more than 
     1,400,000,000 hours nationwide, helping to--
       (1) improve the lives of the most vulnerable people of the 
     United States;
       (2) protect the environment;
       (3) contribute to public safety;
       (4) respond to disasters; and
       (5) strengthen the educational system of the United States;
       Whereas, since 1994, more than $8,700,000,000 in AmeriCorps 
     funds have been invested in nonprofit, community, 
     educational, and faith-based groups and those funds leverage 
     hundreds of millions of dollars in outside funding and in-
     kind donations each year;
       Whereas, in 2016, AmeriCorps members recruited and 
     supervised more than 2,300,000 community volunteers, 
     demonstrating the value of AmeriCorps as a powerful force for 
     encouraging people to become involved in volunteering and 
     community service;
       Whereas, in 2016, AmeriCorps members served at 
     approximately 21,000 locations across the United States, 
     including at nonprofit organizations, schools, and faith-
     based and community organizations;
       Whereas AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps 
     campuses in Mississippi, Maryland, Iowa, California, and 
     Colorado strengthen communities and develop future leaders 
     through team-based service;
       Whereas AmeriCorps members nationwide, in return for the 
     service of those members, have earned more than 
     $3,300,000,000 to use to further their own educational 
     advancement at colleges and universities across the United 
     States;
       Whereas AmeriCorps members, after their terms of service 
     with AmeriCorps end, have been more likely to remain engaged 
     in their communities as volunteers, teachers, and nonprofit 
     professionals than the average individual;
       Whereas, in 2009, Congress passed the bipartisan Serve 
     America Act (Public Law 111-13; 123 Stat. 1460), which 
     authorized the expansion of national service, expanded 
     opportunities to serve, increased efficiency and 
     accountability, and strengthened the capacity of 
     organizations and communities to solve problems;
       Whereas national service programs have engaged millions of 
     people in the United States in results-driven service in the 
     most vulnerable communities of the United States, providing 
     hope and help to individuals with economic and social needs;
       Whereas national service and volunteerism demonstrate the 
     best of the spirit of the United States, with people turning 
     toward problems and working together to find community 
     solutions; and
       Whereas AmeriCorps Week, observed in 2017 from March 4 
     through March 11, is an appropriate time for the people of 
     the United States to salute current and former AmeriCorps 
     members for their positive impact on the lives of people in 
     the United States, to thank the community partners of 
     AmeriCorps for making the program possible, and to encourage 
     more people in the United States to become involved in 
     service and volunteering: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) encourages the people of the United States to join in a 
     national effort to--
       (A) salute AmeriCorps members and alumni; and
       (B) raise awareness about the importance of national and 
     community service;
       (2) acknowledges the significant accomplishments of the 
     members, alumni, and community partners of AmeriCorps;
       (3) recognizes the important contributions made by 
     AmeriCorps members and alumni to the lives of the people of 
     the United States; and
       (4) encourages individuals of all ages to consider 
     opportunities to serve in AmeriCorps.
