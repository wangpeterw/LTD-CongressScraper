  At 1 p.m., the Sergeant at Arms, Paul D. Irving, announced the Vice 
President and the Senate of the United States.
  The Senate entered the Hall of the House of Representatives, headed 
by the Vice President and the Secretary of the Senate, the Members and

as prescribed by law.
  The joint session was called to order.

the Constitution and laws of the United States, the Senate and House of 
Representatives are meeting in joint session to verify the certificates 
and count the votes of the electors of the several States for President 
and Vice President of the United States.
  After ascertainment has been had that the certificates are authentic

votes cast by the electors of the several States.

  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, I object to the certificate from the 
State of Alabama on the grounds that the electoral votes were not, 
under all of the known circumstances, regularly given and that the 
electors were not lawfully certified, especially given the confirmed 
and illegal activities engaged in by the Government of Russia that were 
designed to interfere with our election and the widespread violations 
of the Voting Rights Act that unlawfully suppressed thousands of votes 
in the State of Alabama.

States Code require that any objection be presented in writing, signed 
by a Member of the House of Representatives and a Senator.
  Is the objection in writing and signed not only by a Member of the 
House of Representatives but also by a Senator?
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, the objection is in writing and is

  The VICE PRESIDENT. For what purpose does the gentleman from Maryland
