                                 PRAYER

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today's opening prayer will be offered by our 
guest Chaplain, the Reverend Bruce Scott, pastor of Pentecostals of 
South Lake, from Merrillville, IN.
  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Precious Lord, Creator of the heavens and the Earth, and all that 
dwells therein, we honor You from a grateful heart, knowing all of our 
blessings that we enjoy every day come from You.
  Heavenly Father, as the Senators assemble in this Chamber today, let 
them come together in unity to build a stronger and better America. 
Thank You for their dedication and commitment, as they labor together 
with You for what is right and acceptable in Your sight. This Nation 
was founded on biblical principles. Lord, I pray that You would grant 
to them wisdom to make right decisions. The Old Testament prophet 
declares it is not by might, nor by power but by My Spirit, saith the 
Lord. Bless their families at home with peace and safety.
  Lord, bless our military all over this world. Just as You paid the 
ultimate price for our freedom on Calvary, our brave military men and 
women are willing to give their all so we may live in freedom today. 
Strengthen and encourage each family as they wait for the safe return 
of their loved one. Bless and protect our first responders, police, 
fire, and EMS personnel.
  It is true that God has shed His Grace on us. Lord, surround this 
Chamber with Your presence.
  We pray in Jesus's Name. Amen.
