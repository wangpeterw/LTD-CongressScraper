                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 1865

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at 
the desk, and I ask for its first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader is correct.
  The clerk will read the bill by title for the first time.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 1865) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 
     to clarify that section 230 of such Act does not prohibit the 
     enforcement against providers and users of interactive 
     computer services of Federal and State criminal and civil law 
     relating to sexual exploitation of children or sex 
     trafficking, and for other purposes.

  Mr. McCONNELL. I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place 
the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to 
my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will be 
read for the second time on the next legislative day.

                          ____________________
