                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, we find rest in the shadow of Your protection and 
providence. Shield our lawmakers in their labors with Your Divine favor 
so that they may grow in wisdom. Lord, show them how to use today's 
fleeting minutes for Your glory, becoming Your instruments to permit 
Your Kingdom to thrive on Earth. Sanctify their thoughts, words, and 
deeds as they remember that because of You, they live and move and 
breathe and have their being.
  We praise You this day, O God, for You are the Alpha and Omega--the 
beginning and the ending.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
