                  RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF SHAW CARTER

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
life of Mr. Shaw Carter, who passed away on August 9, 2017, at the age 
of 24.
  Shaw was a rare individual who touched the hearts of many people in 
his life. He was a recent graduate of Young Harris College in north 
Georgia, and was a graduate assistant at the University of Georgia, 
where he was working on his master's degree in public administration.
  Born with a heart defect, he underwent three open heart surgeries 
before his third birthday and had a heart transplant before his 21st 
birthday.
  Through the obstacles with his illnesses, he preserved and selflessly 
volunteered his time to uplift other kids who had other severe medical 
issues. For example, he volunteered over 200 hours for Mended Hearts at 
Northeast Georgia Medical Center.
  When he was awarded the Young Harris Spirit Award, he was described 
as the ``indefatigable Shaw Carter.'' There is no better way to 
describe him. He will truly be missed.
