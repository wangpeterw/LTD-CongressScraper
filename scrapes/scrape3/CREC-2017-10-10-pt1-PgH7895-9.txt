                   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, domestic violence is a 
scourge. Its physical and psychological effects have lifelong 
consequences for survivors, their families, and their children.

  I appreciate South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster and Attorney 
General Alan Wilson, both of whom who are working hard to stop domestic 
violence in our State, encouraged by Laura Hudson of the Crime Victims' 
Council. The Governor issued a statewide proclamation that designates 
October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month.
  Attorney General Wilson's 20th annual Silent Witness ceremony, which 
he held last week, honored the past year's victims of domestic violence 
at the statehouse. Specifically, the South Carolina Office of the 
Attorney General works to combat domestic violence through the STOP 
Violence Against Women program, dedicated to providing representation 
to victims of domestic violence and raising awareness of the issue; 
also, with the Pro Bono program, dedicated to providing pro bono legal 
representation in prosecution of domestic violence cases.
  Eliminating domestic violence should be something we fight for during 
the month of October and every day of the year.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
