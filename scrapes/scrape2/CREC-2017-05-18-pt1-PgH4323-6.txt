Department of Defense laboratories. I am pleased to introduce a 
bipartisan resolution to designate May 18 as Department of Defense

innovations that have enhanced and strengthened our national security. 
Defense-supported research and development has yielded many game-

that we never send our men and women in uniform into a fair fight.
  Our Defense labs also contribute to American economic growth by
