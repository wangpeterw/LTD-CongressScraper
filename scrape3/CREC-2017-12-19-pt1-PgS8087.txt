                      OUR 58TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY

  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there is one last thing I want to say that 
is on a little different subject. Today is a very special day. Today, a 
little girl named Kay and I got married a long time ago. These are our 
kids and grandkids. Today is December 19, which is our 58th wedding 
anniversary. I want to say to Kay: I love you.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.
  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first to my friend from Oklahoma, happy 
58th anniversary. That is wonderful. You have a beautiful family. Every 
year, I enjoy getting the Christmas card with the picture of your 
beautiful family on it. It is a wonderful milestone to celebrate today.
