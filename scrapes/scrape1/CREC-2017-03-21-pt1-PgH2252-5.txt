                       TRUMPCARE MISSES THE MARK

  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, there is kind of a rather ridiculous 
healthcare bill that this body may or may not be considering soon.
  First of all, it creates an entirely new entitlement program at the 
State level rather than the Federal level.
  Second of all, in an unrelated matter, it provides huge tax cuts to 
millionaires and billionaires--mostly in New York and California--which 
has nothing to do with making health care affordable. I mean, it is 
fine. Republicans want to do that. We get that. They always want to cut 
taxes for millionaires, but don't put it in the same bill as we are 
here trying to provide health care for people and bring down our 
insurance rates.
  Third of all, this bill that is supposed to somehow help is going to 
increase insurance costs to American families by 15 to 20 percent. Most 
families can't afford that, and 24 million people will lose their 
insurance.
  So there is just no way, shape, or form that this bill makes any 
sense.
  There are a lot of positive improvements and suggestions that we can 
make to the Affordable Care Act. There are a lot of great ideas with us 
providing a public option, more pricing transparency, a lot of great 
ideas that probably Democrats and Republicans support; but, frankly, 
they missed the mark on this bill.
  These aren't ideas that Democrats or Republicans support, because 
they are bad ideas that cost families money.
