               THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE A BETTER DEAL

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve a better 
deal. They deserve better jobs, better wages, and a better future. That 
is what Democrats are committed to doing, and it starts with creating 
millions of full-time, good-paying jobs that give more Americans the 
opportunity to get ahead. That is why we have proposed doubling Federal 
support for apprenticeship programs.
  Apprenticeship training is one of the most cost-effective ways for 
getting workers started on a successful career path. Over their 
lifetimes, folks who completed an apprenticeship will earn $300,000 
more than folks who don't.
  Now, you would think that a President who once hosted a game show 
called ``The Apprentice'' would see the wisdom of this approach, but 
that is not the case. Earlier this year, President Trump actually 
proposed a budget that cuts job training by nearly 40 percent. That is 
not a better deal. It is not even a good deal. It is a raw deal.
  We can do better. Let's make the expansion of apprenticeship programs 
a national priority. Let's give young people and folks who are changing 
careers the tools they need to get ahead. Let's give the American 
people a better deal.
