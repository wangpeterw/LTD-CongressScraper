                  CONDITION OF REPRESENTATIVE SCALISE

  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, before I begin, I want to express how 
glad we all are to hear that Representative Scalise is doing better. 
Over the weekend, his condition changed from critical to serious. It 
seems he has a ways to go, but we are all very happy to hear that the 
signs are more positive and moving in the right direction.
