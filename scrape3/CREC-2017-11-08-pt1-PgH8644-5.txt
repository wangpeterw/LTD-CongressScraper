  RECOGNIZING COLONEL BEN MARGOLIUS AND MR. AL EATON, FOUNDERS OF THE 
                  SOUTHERN TIER VETERANS SUPPORT GROUP

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel Ben 
Margolius and Mr. Al Eaton, founders of the Southern Tier Veterans 
Support Group.
  Ben is a veteran of the Army, serving as the chief of joint 
operations for the U.S. Transportation Command and holding leadership 
positions at USCENTCOM, USEUCOM, and USTRANSCOM.
  Al is a veteran of the Navy and, like my son, a graduate of the U.S. 
Naval Academy, having served as a naval flight officer on P-3 Orions, 
performing antisubmarine warfare and surface surveillance missions.
  After their military service, Ben and Al saw a great need to provide 
help to veterans where other agencies could not. This started 
informally, with Ben and Al getting donations and support where they 
could, until the Southern Tier Veterans Support Group was formed 
officially in August of 2011.
  Today, Ben and Al's work has brought over 70 community partners 
together to assist veterans and their families, with 425 veterans 
receiving $65,000 in assistance since 2016.
  Thank you, Ben and Al, for your service and for all that your 
organization has done to help our veterans.
  Go Navy.
