                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  Send Your spirit of peace, honesty, and fairness to all Members 
during this week of constituent visits. May their ears and hearts be 
open to listen to the hopes and needs of those whom they represent--
those who voted for them and those who did not.
  Bless the people of this great Nation with wisdom, knowledge, and 
understanding that they might responsibly participate in our American 
democracy.
  Please keep all who work for the people's House in good health that 
they might faithfully fulfill the great responsibility given them in 
their service to the work of the Capitol.
  Bless us this day and every day. May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
