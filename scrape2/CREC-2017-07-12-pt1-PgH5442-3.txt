                      SENATE BILL HURTS AMERICANS

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, once again, 
tomorrow, Senate Republicans will take another shot at passing the most 
widely hated and totally disastrous bill in modern American history--
their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  Once again, 22 million Americans will stand to lose their health 
insurance. Once again, Republicans will propose to send premiums and 
out-of-pocket costs soaring. Once again, Republicans would allow 
insurance companies to discriminate against the sick. Once again, they 
will try to pass a law that hurts children, veterans, seniors, and 
Americans with disabilities.
  They seem desperately determined to pass something instead of doing 
the right thing--which would be working on a bill that treats 
healthcare as a fundamental American right--and that is as wrong as 
wrong can be.
