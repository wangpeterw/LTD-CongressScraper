                 PUTTING ACCOUNTABILITY BACK ON THE EPA

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, tonight I rise to commend the House for 
passing H.R. 1430, what is known as the HONEST Act. This would put more 
of the onus on to the Environmental Protection Agency, sometimes known 
as the employment prevention agency, to disclose where they get their 
science or where they get their reasoning when they are going to make a 
regulation upon the people that produce in this country.
  My own constituents have suffered from that in my district in 
northern California, where arbitrary rules are put in place without 
even the opportunity to face their accuser of what kind of science they 
are using or what kind of reasoning they are using to put a regulation 
in place that they have to fight, and fight sometimes for many years, 
in order to have the opportunity just to use their land, just to use 
their land for planting crops or for grazing or for other things that 
would help them with their livelihood, with their economy, like they 
have been using for so many years, even decades, in their families.
  The HONEST Act will put accountability back on the EPA to say you 
have to come forward with reasoning, with logic, and with science that 
is publicly available and not hidden from the public so that we can see 
what you are using to regulate the people.
