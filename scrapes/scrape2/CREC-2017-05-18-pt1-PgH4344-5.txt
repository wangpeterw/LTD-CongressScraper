                     NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WEEK

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week, it is a 
privilege to honor the men and women of law enforcement who put their 
lives on the line every single day to keep us safe.
  In my hometown of Philadelphia and across the Nation, police officers 
serve our communities with immeasurable courage. Every police officer 
goes to work knowing that any day could be their last. In Philadelphia 
alone, more than 260 police officers throughout our city's history have 
lost their lives.
  One thing in Congress that we could do to show just how much we honor 
their sacrifice is to enact the legislation that myself, along with 
Congressman Fitzpatrick, Senators  Casey and Toomey, have introduced. 
It would provide a boost of education aid, up to the maximum Pell grant 
award, for the children of fallen law enforcement and first responders 
who have died in the line of duty. The bipartisan Children of Fallen 
Heroes Scholarship Act is widely supported by the law enforcement 
community.
  Although we can never fully repay our debt to those families who have 
made the ultimate sacrifice, I believe this would be an important step 
in the right direction.
