                         OUR NATIONAL SECURITY

  (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on an issue that is 
of critical importance to every person in this room, every father, 
mother, every family in our Nation. That issue is our national 
security.
  While the resignation of General Flynn was appropriate, it has led to 
more questions than answers. One of the most important, who directed 
General Flynn to do what he did?
  In my 27 years as a law enforcement officer, I have conducted both 
internal and criminal investigations at the highest level of law 
enforcement. I understand the importance of seeking the truth through 
such investigations.
  In a time of confusion and uncertainty, the American people deserve 
answers and transparency. That can only come through a thorough, 
bipartisan, independent investigation.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to join me in calling 
for a thorough investigation. I know they understand the gravity of 
this issue and believe it is our duty to work together to keep our 
Nation safe.
