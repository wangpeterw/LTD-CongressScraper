                       KIM JONG-UN IS A TERRORIST

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, incorrigible little Kim and his 
minions are rattling their sabers once again.
  While U.S.-South Korean exercises were underway, North Korea launched 
four land-based missiles. The missiles traveled over 600 miles. North 
Korean Army bases are purposely positioned to strike U.S. bases in 
Japan and South Korea.
  It is time to put an end to North Korea's mischiefmaking. The United 
States' hopeless appeasement policy with North Korea has not worked.
  In 2008, the administration removed the warmonger from the State 
Sponsors of Terrorism list with little Kim's promise to stop their 
nuclear weapons program. Well, guess what? Kim Jong-un lied.
  We must return North Korea to where it belongs: the State Sponsors of 
Terrorism list. Senator Cruz and I have filed legislation to do just 
that. Then real sanctions and blocking of financial transactions are 
necessary.
  The United States cannot underestimate the war-prone lunacy of Kim 
Jong-un. He needs a clear message from America to leave us alone and 
leave our allies alone.
  And that is just the way it is.
