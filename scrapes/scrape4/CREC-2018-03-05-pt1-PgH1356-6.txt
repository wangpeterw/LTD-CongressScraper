                  APPOINTING JUDGES TO THE FISA COURT

  (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States should 
have the power to appoint judges to the FISA Court. This would lead to 
a more ideologically diverse court, more transparency in oversight, and 
better FISA outcomes.
  Mr. Speaker, this isn't just my argument. It is the argument of the 
gentleman from California, the ranking

member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; and this is 
the gentleman from California making that very argument on Russia 
Today.
  Here, YouTube has actually had to say:

       Russia Today is funded in whole or in part by the Russian 
     Government.

  So my question is this, Mr. Speaker: If it is good enough for a bill 
to be filed by the gentleman from California in 2013, and if it is good 
enough to talk about it on Russia Today, why is it not good enough to 
give President Trump the very same powers that he wanted to give to 
President Obama?
  That is my question. I am waiting for an answer.
