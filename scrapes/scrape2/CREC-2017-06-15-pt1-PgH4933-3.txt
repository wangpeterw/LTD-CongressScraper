               WELCOMING PENNSYLVANIA FARM BUREAU INTERNS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week, I had the 
opportunity to meet with students interning with the Pennsylvania Farm 
Bureau.
  The Pennsylvania Farm Bureau is the Commonwealth's largest farm 
organization, with a volunteer membership of more than 60,000 members. 
Since 1950, it has provided legislative support, information, and 
services to Pennsylvania's farmers and rural families.
  The Farm Bureau provides its members with representation, both in 
Washington and their State Capitol of Harrisburg concerning legislation 
and rulemaking. Its grassroots structure allows county farm bureaus and 
their leaders to develop and implement policies which are then 
determined at an annual meeting.
  I am always pleased to meet with our farm leaders of tomorrow. 
Through this internship, students interested in pursuing a career in 
the agriculture sector are afforded a firsthand experience to further 
understand farmland preservation, commodity pricing, property rights, 
land management, and much more.
  Mr. Speaker, agriculture is Pennsylvania's number one industry. As 
vice chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and chairman of the 
Nutrition Subcommittee, it gives me great hope for the future to see 
our youth engaging in policy issues that impact our farmers. I look 
forward to them pursuing their own careers in the agriculture sector.
