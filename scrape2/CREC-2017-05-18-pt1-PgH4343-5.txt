                         HONORING BUDDY LaROSA

  (Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Buddy LaRosa for his 
countless years of service to the city of Cincinnati, having touched 
the lives of so many. Recently, West Elder Street near Findlay Market 
in Cincinnati was renamed Buddy LaRosa Way.
  The exact spot was picked because, according to Buddy, that is the 
exact spot where he sold shopping bags for 3 cents when he was 10 years 
old. This was the beginning of his successful pizza empire, LaRosa's 
Pizza, a Cincinnati favorite. But great pizza isn't Buddy's only 
contribution to the Cincinnati area, not by a long shot.
  Buddy is one of the most generous people I have had the pleasure of 
knowing through my life. He has dedicated

his time and energy, making many contributions supporting the people of 
our community and changing their lives. Naming Buddy LaRosa Way is a 
reminder of how the city of Cincinnati has been forever positively 
changed by Buddy LaRosa's heart and soul. Thank you, Buddy.
