               SUPPORTING CONCEALED CARRY RECIPROCITY ACT

  (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the Concealed 
Carry Reciprocity Act.
  The constitutional rights of law-abiding gun owners in my north Texas 
district do not end when they cross State lines. The Second Amendment 
protects the right of my constituents--and of all Texans and people 
throughout our country--to keep and bear arms.
  This week the House will vote on legislation allowing gun owners with 
a State-issued concealed carry license to freely travel between State 
lines.
  Many States already acknowledge the concealed carry permit of another 
State. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act simply ensures the rights of 
private citizens be upheld regardless of the State that they are in.
  I cosponsored this legislation, and I will continue to stand up for 
it. I urge the passage of this bill that will protect our 
constitutional rights.
