                   CONGRATULATING WAYZATA HIGH SCHOOL

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Wayzata High 
School on being named Minnesota's best public school by USA Today.
  Strong public schools are the foundation of our community, and while 
Minnesota has many great public and private schools, Wayzata does stand 
out among them. The schools are evaluated on standardized test scores, 
student-teacher ratios, graduation rates, Advanced Placement 
enrollment, and more. Wayzata High School has over 3,200 students, a 
student ratio of 17 to 1, and an average SAT score of 1420.
  Across the Nation, 80 percent of students graduate from high school. 
In Minnesota, 88 percent graduate, and in Wayzata, 93 percent of their 
students graduate. Their Advanced Placement enrollment is high, Mr. 
Speaker. Over 25 percent of 10th graders, 36 percent of 11th graders, 
and 34 percent of seniors are enrolled in AP classes at Wayzata.
  Mr. Speaker, Principal Scott Gengler, all of the teachers and staff, 
students and parents, and the Spartan community deserve this 
recognition. Congratulations to Wayzata High School.
