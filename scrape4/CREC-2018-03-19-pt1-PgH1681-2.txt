         CONGRATULATIONS TO BLOOMINGTON CHEERLEADING CHAMPIONS

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate the 
Bloomington Jefferson High School cheerleaders for their national 
championship victory. This season the team looked to replicate their 
historic success, having won five State titles and two national 
championships in just the past five seasons.
  The team qualified for the national championship at the Universal 
Cheerleaders Association Ten Thousand Lakes Regional competition back 
in October, and in February, they made the trip down to the 2018 UCA 
National High School Cheerleading Championship in Orlando, Florida.
  At the national championship, they competed against 28 other teams 
from across the country. They placed first in the preliminary rounds 
and then advanced to the final round. In the final round, they were 
able to best seven other teams and emerged with their third national 
title in 5 years.
  Mr. Speaker, the consistent hard work and skills of these student 
athletes is impressive, and it is a credit to their dedication, their 
perseverance, their coaches, and all of the families that offered them 
support.
  Congratulations again to Bloomington Jefferson on their national 
championship.
  Go Jaguars.
