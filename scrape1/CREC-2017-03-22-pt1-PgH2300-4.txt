                       REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL

  (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, Republicans rushed their pay 
more for less healthcare bill through committees before CBO even had a 
chance to score it. And then, once they realized that 24 million people 
would lose coverage, they made late night additions just 2 days before 
the House is scheduled to vote.
  Americans' health care is too important to be done on an artificial 
deadline. It is too important for people in my district like Rachel. 
Rachel is a hairdresser in her midthirties, who was finally able to get 
health coverage for her husband and three children, thanks to the ACA. 
But under the Republican plan, their coverage will be replaced by tax 
credits that don't even come close to meeting the healthcare costs for 
a family of five.
  And there are millions just like her struggling to make ends meet. 
Instead of abandoning people like Rachel to give tax breaks to the 
wealthiest few, I urge Republicans to do what even Trump promised--
provide health insurance for everybody. That starts with rejecting this 
bill.
