                   HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

  (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is National Police Week, and 
I rise to honor law enforcement officials who protect our communities. 
I also pay tribute to the thousands of men and women who have died in 
the line of duty. There are few jobs more important or more perilous 
than that of a police officer.
  Since I took office in January, there have been at least four 
incidents in or near my central Florida district where a police office 
was shot. In one of those cases, an officer, Orlando Police Lieutenant 
Debra Clayton, lost her life.
  Because they run towards danger, police officers face unimaginable 
challenges. Last June, an armed attacker entered the Pulse nightclub in 
Orlando and opened fire, killing 49 people. Showing no regard for their 
own safety, Orlando officers charged into the club, eventually bringing 
that long, dark night to an end.
  Mr. Speaker, despite the risks, they put on their uniforms every day. 
So to all the brave officers around this country, I say: Thank you.
