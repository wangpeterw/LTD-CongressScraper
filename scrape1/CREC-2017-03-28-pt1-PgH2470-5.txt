                   HONORING THE LIFE OF NEYLE WILSON

  (Mr. RICE of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my 
friend and an outstanding man from my home in Horry County, South 
Carolina, who has dedicated his entire life to education and public 
service. Mr. Neyle Wilson retired last month after 14 years of serving 
as the president of Horry Georgetown Technical College and leaves 
behind a great legacy of selflessness and devotion to education in the 
community.
  Under Mr. Wilson's direction, Horry County Technical College added 
nine new buildings, 40 new programs of study, and saw enrollment 
double. He never failed to go above and beyond to complete the task at 
hand. Often he was called on at the last minute to provide education or 
skilled workplace training to fill spots at existing local businesses 
or businesses looking to move to Horry County to employ South 
Carolinians, and he always came through.
  Mr. Wilson was a credit to Horry County Technical College and the 
entire Grand Strand community. He led thousands of South Carolinians to 
meaningful jobs. Through these and his many other meaningful 
contributions, he will always be remembered.
