                        RECOGNIZING LEACY BURKE

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, it is with sincere 
gratitude and appreciation that I have the opportunity to recognize 
Leacy Burke, former communications director for South Carolina's Second 
Congressional District. I will always appreciate Leacy for her years of 
service on behalf of the people of South Carolina.
  A native of South Carolina, Leacy is an esteemed alumna of the 
University of South Carolina, where she graduated with both a bachelor 
of arts degree in political science and criminal justice, as well as a 
master's degree in mass communications, integrated communications. 
Beginning as a deputy press secretary for the office in 2015, it has 
been an honor to work with such a dedicated public servant making 
meaningful provisions for our office.
  It is with mixed feelings, but great happiness, that our office bids 
Leacy farewell. She is now doing amazing work in her new role as 
communications director for Senator Jim Inhofe, Republican, of 
Oklahoma. I know her parents, Greg and Denise Burke, and family members 
join me in recognizing her achievements.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our prayers are for 
all persons threatened by Hurricane Irma, from the Caribbean Islands to 
South Carolina.
