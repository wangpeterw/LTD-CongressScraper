                      IN HONOR OF STEPHANIE WILLS

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks, I have joined 
many of our colleagues to rise in honor of Dr. Billy Graham.
  Today, I rise in honor of one of the quiet heroes who helped make his 
worldwide ministry possible. Ms. Stephanie Wills served as Billy 
Graham's secretary--she always refused fancier titles--for over 45 
years, traveling the world to help Dr. Graham at each crusade and at 
countless meetings.
  My first conversations with Stephanie were in the early 1970s, when I 
served for 10 years as the assistant to Dr. Bill Bright, the founder of 
Campus Crusade for Christ.
  It was a blessing to see Stephanie at Dr. Graham's funeral, as she 
was still faithfully serving him.
  Stephanie is legendary. She is highly competent, fiercely loyal, and 
unflappable.
  I have said several times that Dr. Graham was a great man because he 
was faithful to the mission that God had given to him. The same can be 
said of Stephanie Wills. She has been a faithful servant of Jesus 
Christ, playing a quiet yet enormous role in sharing the Gospel around 
the world through her dedicated and tireless support of God's servant, 
Dr. Billy Graham.
  Well done, Stephanie, a wonderful servant of God.
