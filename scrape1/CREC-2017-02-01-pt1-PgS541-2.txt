                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Merciful God, enthroned above all other powers, thank You for the 
opportunity to be called Your children.
  Lord, our heart aches because of the pain and pessimism in our world, 
so use our lawmakers to bring hope where there is despair. Remind our 
Senators that Your power is far above any conceivable command, 
authority, or control. Empower them to protect and defend the 
Constitution of this great land against all enemies foreign and 
domestic. Our Father, inspire our Senators through the decisions they 
make to build monuments of courage and moral excellence.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
