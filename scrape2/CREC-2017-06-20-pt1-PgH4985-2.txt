      RECOGNIZING THE PROFESSIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF PAUL LYSKAVA

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the professional accomplishments of Paul Lyskava, who has served 
diligently as the executive director of the Pennsylvania Forest 
Products Association since 2002.
  Paul has been instrumental in working closely with members of the 
forest products industry. Even through a recession, Paul worked to put 
the Commonwealth in a good position. Today, Pennsylvania is the leading 
hardwood lumber producing State in the Nation.
  In 2015, Paul was the recipient of the Joseph T. Rothrock 
Conservationist of the Year Award, which recognizes actions and service 
that contribute to the continued conservation of Pennsylvania's forest 
resources in the spirit of Pennsylvania Forestry Association founder, 
Joseph T. Rothrock.
  Never before has the award been presented to an individual that 
served in a capacity at all similar to Paul's. For the 4 years before 
he took the helm at the Pennsylvania Forest Products Association, Paul 
served as the executive director of the Pennsylvania Hardwoods 
Development Council.
  On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, I want to recognize Paul for 
all he has done for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
  We are deeply grateful for your dedication and knowledge, Paul. Thank 
you, my friend.
