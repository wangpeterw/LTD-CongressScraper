 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 

       Whereas 6 European countries signed the Treaty of Rome on 
     March 25, 1957, creating the European Economic Community, 
     which established a customs union and common market among the 
     signatory countries in order to foster economic cooperation 
     and interdependence;
       Whereas the United States welcomed and supported this 
     European economic integration, recognizing that this kind of 
     union would promote interdependence and therefore prevent 
     future war and conflict;
       Whereas this economic integration has broadened and evolved 
     into the European

     Union, a unique political and economic union covering much of 
     the European continent and based on the principles of rule of 
     law and representative democracy, which has pursued common 
     policies in economic, security, diplomatic, and political 
     areas and has helped bring unprecedented peace and stability 
     to Europe and its neighbors;
       Whereas European integration has been essential in opening 
     and expanding markets, strengthening the rule of law and 
     respect for basic freedoms, and fostering democracy in Europe 
     itself, both in European Union members and aspiring nations;
       Whereas, since World War II, the United States has firmly 
     supported and been an active partner in the European 
     integration project, working with Europe to rebuild its war-
     torn continent through the Marshall Plan and to create an 
     Atlantic security alliance built on shared values and ideals, 
     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), to permanently 
     prevent the kind of conflict we had just endured;
       Whereas the United States and Europe have since engaged in 
     a close and robust Transatlantic partnership, constructed on 
     a strong foundation of shared values and commitment to 
     democracy, freedom and the rule of law, to the benefit of the 
     United States, Europe, and the rest of the world;
       Whereas a strong United States-European Union partnership 
     has helped build our mutual economies, ensured unprecedented 
     peace in Europe, and remains essential to creating a freer, 
     safer, and more prosperous and more interconnected world;
       Whereas the Transatlantic economy is the world's largest 
     and wealthiest market and the single most important driver of 
     global economic growth and prosperity, with the United States 
     and European Union together accounting for over half of the 
     world's gross domestic product (GDP), generating 
     $5,500,000,000,000 in yearly commercial sales and employing 
     up to 15,000,000 workers in domestic jobs on both sides of 
     the Atlantic;
       Whereas mutual investment is the backbone of the 
     Transatlantic economy, and the United States and Europe are 
     each other's primary source and destination for Foreign 
     Direct Investment (FDI);
       Whereas the United States and the European Union are each 
     other's largest trading partners, and United States-European 
     Union trade totaled approximately $687,000,000,000 during 
     2016, almost double the level at the beginning of the 
     century;
       Whereas the Transatlantic economy drives innovation, with 
     the United States and European Union investing more in mutual 
     Research and Development than any other 2 international 
     partners and collaborating across areas of science and 
     technology, including marine and Arctic science, 
     transportation and energy technologies, and health research;
       Whereas this historic partnership goes far beyond economic 
     and commercial ties, and the United States and the European 
     Union work together to promote peace and stability, protect 
     human rights, foster democracy and sustainable development, 
     combat global threats like terrorism, and eradicate disease 
     and poverty;
       Whereas the United States and the European Union have 
     developed numerous mechanisms to strengthen the Transatlantic 
     relationship and to improve communication and collaboration 
     among our respective governments, including annual European 
     Union-United States Summit meetings and the Transatlantic 
     Legislators' Dialogue, which facilitates meetings between 
     members of the European Parliament and the United States 
     Congress on issues of mutual concern;
       Whereas, despite representing approximately 12 percent of 
     the world's population, the United States and the European 
     Union together provide more than three-quarters of official 
     development assistance worldwide and have established an 
     ongoing Development Dialogue to improve the quality and 
     effectiveness of development aid;
       Whereas the United States and the European Union 
     collaborate to promote peace and stability and prevent 
     conflict around the world, working together to address 
     conflicts including those in Syria and Ukraine and confront 
     global security challenges like terrorism, nuclear weapons 
     proliferation, transnational crime, and cybercrime;
       Whereas, in pursuit of an integrated, free, and peaceful 
     Europe, the United States and the European Union have worked 
     together to promote peace, stability, and prosperity in the 
     Balkans and to advance their cooperation with and integration 
     into institutions like NATO and the European Union.
       Whereas, in response to its annexation of Crimea and 
     continued aggression in the sovereign nation of Ukraine, the 
     United States and the European Union imposed and have 
     maintained sanctions to increase the diplomatic and financial 
     costs on the Russian Federation for its illegal actions;
       Whereas, in the face of ongoing threats from terrorism, the 
     United States and the European Union cooperate closely to 
     target terrorist financing, secure transportation and 
     borders, provide mutual assistance with cross-border 
     investigations and extraditions, and share information; and
       Whereas leaders on both sides of the Atlantic have long 
     recognized the value of and expressed their commitment to the 
     Transatlantic partnership, including--
       (1) President John F. Kennedy, who said in 1962 that ``we 
     do not regard a strong and united Europe as a rival but as a 
     partner,'' and asserted that the United States believed 
     ``that a united Europe will be capable of playing a greater 
     role in the common defense, of responding more generously to 
     the needs of poorer nations, of joining with the United 
     States and others in lowering trade barriers, resolving 
     problems of commerce, commodities, and currency, and 
     developing coordinated policies in all economic, political, 
     and diplomatic areas'';
       (2) President Ronald Reagan, who addressed the European 
     Parliament in 1985 ``to reaffirm to the people of Europe the 
     constancy of the American purpose'' and to state that 
     ``America remains . . . dedicated to the unity of Europe'' 
     and ``is at your side today, because, like you, we have not 
     veered from the ideals of the West--the ideals of freedom, 
     liberty, and peace'';
       (3) President Barack Obama, who stated in a 2016 address in 
     Germany that ``the United States, and the entire world, needs 
     a strong and prosperous and democratic and united Europe. . 
     .because Europe's security and prosperity is inherently 
     indivisible from our own'' and recognized that ``Europe helps 
     to uphold the norms and rules that can maintain peace and 
     promote prosperity around the world''; and
       (4) Vice President Mike Pence, who asserted that ``our two 
     continents share the same heritage, the same values and above 
     all, the same purpose to promote peace and prosperity through 
     freedom, democracy and the rule of law'' and reiterated that 
     the United States ``will stand with Europe, today and every 
     day,'' while traveling in Europe in February 2017: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) congratulates the European Union and its member states 
     on the 60th anniversary of the historic signing of the Treaty 
     of Rome;
       (2) commends the European Union for its critical role in 
     spreading peace, prosperity, and stability throughout Europe 
     and worldwide, as well as its close and enduring partnership 
     with the United States;
       (3) recognizes the challenges the European Union, its 
     Transatlantic partners, and the broader global community 
     continue to face, including an unprecedented migration and 
     refugee crisis, increased Russian aggression and 
     interference, violent extremism, and the rise of nationalist 
     and populist sentiment; and
       (4) affirms the desire of the United States Government to 
     strengthen the Transatlantic partnership with the European 
     Union and its member states.
