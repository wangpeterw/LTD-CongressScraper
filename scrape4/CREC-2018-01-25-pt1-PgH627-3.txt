                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We ask Your special blessing upon the Members of this people's House.
  In these days of a constituent workweek, give wisdom to all the 
Members, that they might execute their responsibilities to the benefit 
of all Americans.
  Bless them, O God, and be with them and with us all this day and 
every day to come. May all that is done be for Your greater honor and 
glory.
  Amen.
