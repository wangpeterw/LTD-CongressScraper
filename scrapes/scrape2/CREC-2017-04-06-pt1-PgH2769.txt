                  RETURN STABILITY AND PEACE TO SYRIA

  (Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my 
outrage at the chemical attack in Syria on April 4, 2017, that killed 
upwards of 70 civilians, including children.
  I am proud to represent many Syrian Americans in my congressional 
district in Charleston, West Virginia. They share their concerns with 
me on a regular basis.
  This type of violence is a regular occurrence in Syria. Hospitals, 
markets, schools, bus stations, warehouses--none of these places are 
off limits for bombing and destruction by Bashar al-Assad and his 
allies. The slaughter of innocent life will not end unless the United 
States of America takes the lead.
  Peace in Syria is impossible while Bashar al-Assad remains in 
control. He has proven this time and again by his reckless and evil use 
of chemical weapons and other cruel tools of war on his own people. We 
must establish safe zones for innocent civilians.
  I call upon President Trump and other world leaders to do whatever 
they reasonably can to end these atrocious attacks on the innocent, and 
return stability and peace to Syria.
