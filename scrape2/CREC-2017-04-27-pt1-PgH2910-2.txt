                        BIGGER AND BIGGER SWAMP

  (Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump promised 
American voters he would drain the swamp of special interests in 
Washington. Instead, he is swimming in it.
  He has filled his administration with billionaires, Wall Street 
operatives, special interest lobbyists, lawyers, and consultants who 
are drafting policies for the very industries they came from, and he 
refuses to release the White House visitor log so we have no idea what 
special interest lobbyists he is meeting with.
  Trump has refused to release his tax returns or divest his business 
interests.
  Can you believe the State Department posted a blog advertising his 
exclusive Mar-a-Lago resort? Since becoming President, he increased the 
fees for that resort from $100,000 to $200,000.
  He has both close allies, Cabinet appointees, and other appointees 
with questionable ties to Putin and Russia.
  His swamp is getting bigger and bigger.
