                    HONORING OFFICER SCOTTY HAMILTON

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, hearts are heavy in Pikeville, KY, this 
morning. Last night, Officer Scotty Hamilton, a 12-year veteran of the 
Pikeville Police Department, was shot and killed in the line of duty.
  The investigation is ongoing. My Kentucky staff and I are monitoring 
the situation closely.
  For now, our sincere condolences go out to his family, friends, and 
colleagues at the Pikeville Police Department.
  Officer Hamilton leaves behind a wife, a young daughter, and a 
community that is safer for his service.
