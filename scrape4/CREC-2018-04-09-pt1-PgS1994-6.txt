                      WELCOMING SENATOR HYDE-SMITH

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, let me welcome back my fellow 
Senators after a productive State work period. Let me welcome our 
newest Senator, Cindy Hyde-Smith, the junior Senator from Mississippi. 
She is the first woman to represent the State of Mississippi, and I 
welcome her warmly to this Chamber.
