                    REMEMBERING ROBERT JOSEPH BURKE

 Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the memory 
of the late Robert Joseph Burke of Hoboken, NJ, who passed away last 
month. On this day, March 21, 2018, Mr. Burke would have celebrated his 
85th birthday. I had the pleasure of knowing Robert Burke personally, 
and I know that his legacy will continue to be celebrated through the 
times he shared with us.
  Mr. Burke was born in Yonkers, NY in 1933. He served our Nation in 
the U.S. Army during the Korean war. After his military service, Robert 
led a successful business career as the chief executive officer of 
Union Dry Dock & Repair and the chairman of the Board of Hudson United 
Bancorp. Burke was also active within the Irish-American community 
through the Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in New York 
City.
  Robert was a beloved husband to his wife, Mariella, and a dedicated 
father to his five children Mary Lou Kenny, Robert P. Burke, Laureen 
Flock, Susan Quinn, and Claudia Cytrynbaum. Robert had 15 
grandchildren, and I have no doubt that his memory lives on through 
each and every one of them.
