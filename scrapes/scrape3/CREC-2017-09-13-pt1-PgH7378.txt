          RECOGNIZING NATIONAL TRUCK DRIVER APPRECIATION WEEK

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
a great career and technical education or skills-based education 
profession because I rise today during National Truck Driver 
Appreciation Week to celebrate America's 3.5 million professional truck 
drivers.
  Trucking is the lifeblood of the American economy. More than 80 
percent of the U.S. communities rely exclusively on truck drivers to 
deliver their goods and commodities, including the most remote towns 
and territories that aren't reachable by other modes of transportation.
  One out of every 16 people working in the United States is a 
professional truck driver. The impact the trucking industry has on our 
economy is clear. Trucking brings roughly $726 billion in revenue to 
the Nation.
  Truck drivers are hardworking men and women who deliver critical 
goods like medicine, foods, building supplies, clothing, and more. 
These professionals safely move our economy each day. They deliver our 
goods safely, securely, and on time. They keep our highways safe.
  Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the men and women who deliver America's 
goods and honor all professional truck drivers for their hard work and 
commitment in tackling one of our economy's most demanding and 
important jobs.
  Trucking moves America forward.
