                            BORDER SECURITY

  (Ms. SANCHEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. SANCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, after more than 6 months of failing to pass 
any major legislative bills, House Republicans are becoming desperate 
for a win. So desperate, they decided to sneak in $1.6 billion into a 
funding bill to start construction on an unworkable wall along our 
border. While I support real border security, this stunt is a far cry 
from that.
  I believe in investing our Federal dollars wisely. Instead of 
building a medieval solution that will not work, why don't we use those 
billions of dollars for a big, beautiful jobs package? Or big, 
beautiful bridges, roads, and infrastructure throughout this country? 
Or to ensure that our children can access higher education and job 
training, healthcare, and housing?
  Instead, my Republican colleagues are attempting to distract us from 
their failures by passing this bill. You would think that with their 
back against a wall, they wouldn't be this eager to start building 
another one.
