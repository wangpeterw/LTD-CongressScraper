              EDUCATION FUNDING IN THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET

  (Mrs. TORRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, our children are this Nation's greatest 
asset. Our future is in their hands. We have to make sure that they 
have the tools they need to lead our country and tackle whatever 
challenges the future holds.
  This is why I was shocked the President's budget makes drastic cuts 
to education--cuts that will have the biggest impact on kids who need 
our help the most.
  In my district, a quarter of our kids live in poverty, with parents 
working long hours and multiple jobs just to make ends meet. Yet 
President Trump wants to cut before- and afterschool programs, as well 
as over $4 million in programs to hire and train teachers and reduce 
class size.
  As this Congress crafts our budget, I ask my Republican colleagues to 
reject these cuts and to truly invest in our future. We will never make 
America great if we leave our kids behind.
