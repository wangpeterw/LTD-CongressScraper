                  RECOGNIZING BEATRICE AND FRED SORKIN

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to rise today to honor 
two remarkable constituents and their extraordinary achievement that 
should stand as a model for us all.
  Last month, Beatrice and Fred Sorkin of Lincolnshire, Illinois, 
celebrated their 77th wedding anniversary--77 years of love, family, 
and commitment.
  Bea and Fred met as teenagers in Brooklyn, New York. Fred was a sheet 
metal worker by trade and in 1950 started his own business that he ran 
for over 40 years. Bea worked in a bank. She began selling savings 
bonds and rose to become a bank teller and eventually assistant vice 
president.
  Their family has been blessed with two children, Rae and Herbert; 
their spouses, Michael and Gloria; four grandchildren: Jeffrey, Andrew, 
Alyse, and Sharon; and, now, seven great-grandchildren.
  According to the data collected by the Worldwide Marriage Encounter 
Organization, Bea and Fred are the longest married couple in all of 
Illinois. Bea and Fred Sorkin's enduring lifelong connection is an 
inspiring example for us all.
  On behalf of Illinois' 10th District, it is my privilege to 
congratulate Bea and Fred on their 77th wedding anniversary. I wish 
them and their family many more years of health and happiness together.
