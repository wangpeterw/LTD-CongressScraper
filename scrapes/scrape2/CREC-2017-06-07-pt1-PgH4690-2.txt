                        JAMES COMEY WILL TESTIFY

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow morning James Comey will address the 
Senate Intelligence Committee. I read his testimony today.
  It is obvious to me that the President leaned on James Comey to try 
to get him to take actions in the Michael Flynn situation that were 
contrary to what Mr. Comey and I think justice would require, and that 
is an open investigation for the benefit of the American people and for 
the independence of the American Government in dealing with its 
relations with Russia.
  I commend James Comey for being strong after being looked down on and 
at by the President, trying to get him to ask for his job or pledge 
loyalty or commit to derail that investigation.
  I thank him for his integrity. I thank him for his service to the 
FBI. And I certainly hope that no one will try to disparage his 
integrity or his honesty tomorrow.
