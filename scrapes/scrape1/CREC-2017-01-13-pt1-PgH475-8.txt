                  ACA AND AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES

  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I absolutely disagree with the previous 
speaker. He is wrong. He is wrong on the facts. The fact is,the 
Affordable Care Act was on the table longer than any bill since I have 
been in Congress--which is 36 years--to read, toreview, to analyze, and 
to make a decision.

  Every American will be adversely affected if we repeal the Affordable 
Care Act. Millions of Americans with disabilitiesdepend on access to 
quality, affordable health care and deserve to have their voices heard 
in the debate over our healthcaresystem.
  In fact, only one in five Americans, when polled, think we ought to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act without having areplacement. There is no 
replacement. Sixty-four times they voted to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act. They still do not have areplacement.
  According to the CDC, 53 million Americans live with some form of 
disability. Were the Affordable Care Act to be repealed,insurers would 
again be permitted to discriminate against them, denying coverage for 
increasing premiums based on theirdisabilities. Repeal would also allow 
insurance companies again to impose annual and lifetime limits on 
coverage for everyAmerican.
  Do not repeal the Affordable Care Act. Show us the beef. Show us the 
alternative.
