    NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN AN EXPENSIVE WALL

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, while the President continues 
to drone on about his southern border wall, a wall that he told America 
Mexico would pay for--which, of course, they will not--a wall that the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology reports will cost Americans $40 
billion, there is no discussion of a promised $1 trillion 
infrastructure bill.
  This week, a Reuters report named my hometown of Buffalo, New York, 
as among the most dangerous lead hotspots in America. The lead 
waterlines in places like Buffalo, New York, and Flint, Michigan, are 
more than 100 years old, and they need to be replaced. Forty percent of 
kids in lead hotspots could suffer from cognitive delays and other 
neurological problems.
  Mr. Speaker, the President needs to stop talking about an expensive 
and ineffective wall and start taking action on removing the toxic 
levels of lead from our Nation's drinking water systems, particularly 
in places like Buffalo, New York, and Flint, Michigan.
