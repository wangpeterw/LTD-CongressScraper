     Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (2 U.S.C. 933(g)).

  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.

                              {time}  1700


                             General Leave

  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous material on the bill currently under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Florida?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, since Hurricane Irma hit south Florida earlier this 
month, my staff and I have been on the ground in the Florida Keys and 
South Dade helping our district with immediate recovery efforts and 
listening to what our constituents need going forward.
  In the lower and middle Florida Keys, it is hard to find someone who 
hasn't been affected financially by this storm's devastation. From 
restaurant workers who have been without a paycheck to fishermen whose 
boats or traps were damaged, small businesses and the families that 
depend on them are really struggling.
  In South Dade, crops and agricultural structures critical to daily 
operations were devastated by wind. Some small farms that were already 
struggling to make ends meet have now exhausted their cash on hand to 
pay for cleanup, leaving them little to pay workers or keep up with 
their planting schedule.
  Mr. Speaker, my district and similar communities throughout Florida, 
Louisiana, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands need relief, 
and this bill is a great start.
  Through the business tax credit for wages, small-business owners like 
Owen, a lobster and crab fisherman whose traps in the middle Keys were 
destroyed by Hurricane Irma, will be able to claim a tax credit for 40 
percent of employee wages. That is money Owen can use to get his 
employees back to work as soon as possible.
  The bill will also allow taxpayers to refer to earned income from the 
immediately preceding year for purposes of determining the earned 
income tax credit. That is over 415,000 hurricane survivors in Miami-
Dade, and nearly 7,500 in Monroe County, who will be able to keep more 
of their paycheck when the time comes to pay taxes next year.
  We are also going to make it easier for individuals and businesses, 
like farmers struggling in South Dade and fishermen in the Keys, to 
deduct more of the costs from the extensive property damage these 
storms left behind.
  This legislation would also give anyone struggling with initial 
recovery immediate access to their retirement savings, without 
penalties, so they can make ends meet and take care of their families.
  Lastly, this legislation will lift caps on charitable giving to 
qualified hurricane relief organizations, encouraging more American 
businesses and individuals to continue generously supporting their 
fellow citizens.
  Mr. Speaker, Americans in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, and Puerto Rico need Congress to act. My constituents and 
those in other communities like my district don't have time to wait. 
They certainly don't have time to play political games. The Disaster 
Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 will give them 
the means to recover faster and rebuild their communities better and 
stronger than before. This tax relief package we are considering 
deserves bipartisan support from my colleagues.
  I thank Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means Committee for allowing 
me to shape this legislation for the benefit of south Florida 
residents, especially those in Monroe County who were hardest hit by 
Hurricane Irma. I hope we can get this done today.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I stand in opposition to H.R. 3823, the Disaster Tax 
Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act, for one simple reason. 
This is an anemic response to these disasters, whether they occur on 
the mainland of the United States or within American possessions.
  This should have been done on Friday afternoon with the two parties 
working together. Instead, once again, this was put together by one 
party, with minimal input from our side. These are all

[[Page H7464]]

members of the American family that have been impacted by what has 
happened with this terrible weather.
  The chance here for us to work together to make this an expanded 
package, where we could be talking about a host of opportunities for 
these folks who have been put in such a precarious situation, is now 
being missed. There are 90 Members of this Congress who actually voted 
against direct aid in the past for relief for members of the American 
family, where we should have taken the position here, clearly: Let's 
try to figure out what we can do for a robust tax package, what we can 
do for immediate aid, and highlight the role that FEMA plays. And I 
certainly have expressed to Mr. Curbelo time and again I am there on 
board. I just think this needs to be more, and I think that is the 
position that we are offering today.
  Furthermore, a partisan position had to be taken in terms of many 
priorities that we should have been consulted on, and even those could 
have been turned into bipartisan moments. I support the disaster relief 
that is in this bill, but it is clear that the package is woefully 
inadequate. I would hope that we could work together on these 
provisions.
  The disaster relief package included in this bill does not provide 
the comprehensive package of incentives and relief that will drive 
investment and speed up recovery in the American communities that 
include Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. 
Without the fix that we want on this side, the effect of lost revenue 
is going to mean that money is lost that otherwise would be needed for 
normal operations and the response effort. It is going to take years to 
adequately respond to what has happened and the devastation that these 
folks are up against. We need to be sitting here, both parties working 
together, to say: They are all members of the American family. Let's 
get it done.

  I consider this a missed opportunity, and I hope that we can do more 
in the next few days to get back on track to help them bounce back from 
these, indeed, tragedies. We should be sitting down here in the next 48 
hours and putting together a massive package of relief for these States 
and for these possessions and making sure that they have what is 
necessary, rather than doing a piecemeal fix on what is sure to be a 
very tormented time for members of these communities and these States 
and these possessions.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, briefly, I want to first convey 
my gratitude to the gentleman from Massachusetts because, indeed, the 
first day I returned after being back home helping my community 
recover, the gentleman expressed his disposition to work together. That 
really meant a lot to me, and I know it meant a lot to all of our 
colleagues who represent areas that were hit hard by the storm. We 
should work more closely together. We can always do better. However, 
let's not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
  The bottom line is that there are a lot of provisions in this 
legislation that are supported by Members of both parties, and there 
are millions of Americans who are suffering, especially in south 
Florida and especially in Puerto Rico that was hit hard by Maria just a 
few days ago, and they are counting on us to deliver something. We can 
always do more later, but this is a good package that will help people 
get back up on their feet.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the House Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure.
  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for 
yielding me time.
  I rise today in support of the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and 
Airway Extension Act of 2017.
  This extension provides stability to our aviation system and extends 
the funding to the FAA over the next 6 months while Congress continues 
to make progress on a full FAA reauthorization bill. This extension is 
absolutely necessary to prevent a shutdown in FAA programs, delays in 
airport construction projects, and the possible furlough of thousands 
of FAA employees across the country. I will be the first to admit I am 
disappointed we have not passed a long-term bill yet.
  Unfortunately, this is not a new problem for Congress. Between 2007 
and 2012, Congress passed 23 extensions before approving a full 
reauthorization. These short-term stopgaps, while necessary, create 
long-term budget instability, and they contribute to the FAA's overall 
inability to effectively manage the modernization of our antiquated air 
traffic control system.
  Congress has passed numerous piecemeal reforms over the years to try 
to help the FAA act more like a business and efficiently modernize the 
system. These reforms have not worked, and passing the same kind of 
reforms again is not going to change the simple fact that the Federal 
Government is not an innovative, high-tech service business.
  It is time to face the truth that, without transformational reform, 
the American people will not get the most modern and efficient air 
traffic control system that they have been promised and deserve. For 
too long, we have been trying to manage the symptoms of the problem 
instead of finding a cure.
  Thankfully, we now have that cure. H.R. 2997, the 21st Century AIRR 
Act, and progress is being made every day on this bill to provide long-
overdue reform of the FAA.
  While we have made progress, I believe we will move this bipartisan 
bill through the House in the next few weeks. In the meantime, we have 
to pass this extension today to provide 6 months' worth of certainty 
and stability to the FAA, the aviation community, and the flying 
public.
  Without it, starting this Sunday, October 1, the FAA programs will 
face a shutdown, thousands of FAA employees could be furloughed, 
airport projects across the country will come to a halt, and 
approximately $40 million a day in aviation trust fund revenue will go 
uncollected. That is funding for air traffic control, airport 
development, and other safety and modernization programs that will 
never be recovered.
  I want to remind my colleagues again that the very fact that we have 
to pass this bill today is one of the many reasons we need fundamental, 
comprehensive FAA reform.
  In order to ensure America remains the world leader in aviation, I 
look forward to bringing the bipartisan 21st Century AIRR Act to the 
floor in the coming weeks. Until then, I urge my colleagues to support 
today's bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady and Chairman Hensarling for their 
work on this bill, and I thank my friend for yielding.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, we have a problem here. My record is very, 
very clear. I am providing assistance to any place in this country. In 
fact, my record is 100 percent. So I have some credibility to come to 
the floor to discuss this with my friend from Florida, and I hope he 
will listen.
  My heart goes out to those impacted my Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and 
Maria the past several weeks. I am committed to providing for Federal 
response and recovery.
  I was pleased to support aid to those affected by Harvey and Irma, 
and I will continue to do so. We urgently need to deliver relief and 
assistance to those currently impacted by Hurricane Maria in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, where the entire island has lost power 
or many are without water. However, this bill today does not provide 
that needed relief.
  Let's be clear: we in New Jersey are not some Johnny-come-lately on 
disaster tax relief. This is not a question of you got yours and I want 
mine.
  We have been working on disaster tax issues since 2012, based, in 
part, on how we addressed helping victims of Hurricane Katrina more 
than a decade ago. Let me remind you: Hurricane Sandy devastated the 
northeastern United States in 2012, cost 233 lives, and caused $75 
billion in damage. At the time, it was the costliest storm after 
Hurricane Katrina.
  While Congress, until then, had routinely provided tax relief to 
communities in the wake of our worst storms--tax relief, I am talking 
about--Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, victims of Hurricane Sandy 
did not receive the same treatment. In fact, we had to wait 3 months. 
We just

[[Page H7465]]

did it in 3 days. We seem to have short memories.
  179 Republicans in this body and 36 Senators voted against aid to 
victims of Hurricane Sandy in 2013--that many. And today, those same 
Members asked us to support not only aid for Hurricanes Harvey and 
Irma, but tax relief provisions, which they never even considered after 
Hurricane Sandy.
  I was a ``yes'' vote a week before last for your aid, unequivocally. 
Why should I take out on your citizens the foolishness that happened in 
2013? That would be wrong. And I think you feel the same way, through 
the Chair.
  This whole debate smacks of a certain hypocrisy, and I know I am not 
the first to point it out. In the weeks after Sandy, I worked in a 
bipartisan manner to draft a tax relief bill that would make permanent 
the most commonsense tax relief provisions to take politics out of the 
equation when it comes to disaster relief.

                              {time}  1715

  Over the years, I worked with many of my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle and from both Chambers of the Capitol.
  Our bill, the National Disaster Tax Relief Act, led also by 
Congressman Tom Reed from New York----
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding 
additional time.
  The bill provides tax relief to victims of Hurricane Sandy and puts 
in place permanent provisions for all disaster areas going forward.
  I am ready and waiting to debate these provisions and go through 
regular order. Let's have hearings, let's have a markup, let's have 
regular order on something that should be as noncontroversial as 
helping those in need.
  Instead of taking a bipartisan approach, some in the majority have 
chosen to sneak in a few provisions taken from our bill and tack them 
onto an unrelated aviation bill and apply them to only this year's 
hurricane victims, leaving out all of the disaster victims that been 
have waiting for support over the years.
  A front-page story in the papers in New Jersey today says people are 
still not back in their homes from Sandy, 2013. That is not fair. It is 
not the American way.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding 
additional time.
  The specific provisions Republican leadership put in from our bill 
include bigger-than-usual property casualty loss deductions, penalty-
free retirement withdrawals.
  He may smile, but think about those people who are out of their homes 
since 2013. That is no laughing matter, Mr. Speaker.
  An increased threshold for charitable giving, a tax credit for 
impacted employers, and flexibility in applying for the earned income 
tax credit and child tax credit.
  I would note that Puerto Ricans, despite being American citizens, are 
ineligible for the earned income tax credit, and I have a bill to 
correct this.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, no one was laughing at anything 
that the gentleman said. We were listening intently.
  The reason that we are all here is because the people of Florida, the 
people of Texas, the people of Louisiana, the people of Puerto Rico, 
and the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands need our help. They were hit 
in the last few weeks, and they need our help. There are people 
struggling in all of these communities.
  Is this bill perfect?
  No. I have never seen one.
  Can we do more?
  Yes. We must do more, but this is an important first step.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Hensarling), the distinguished chairman of the House Financial Services 
Committee.
  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, it is so obvious to all as we have looked in horror on 
our television screens to see the devastation of Harvey, Irma, and 
Maria. There have been lots of tragic stories, harrowing tales of 
survival.
  I have been to Houston. I have met with a number of the victims. Mr. 
Speaker, let me tell you about one tragic story. One tragic story is 
that there are people who are living in homes that repeatedly flood 
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, even twenty times.
  Something is fundamentally wrong in America and something is 
fundamentally dangerous in America when people are living in harm's 
way. Many of these people are ready to move.
  Mr. Speaker, last week I made a comment about these repeatedly 
flooded properties that was clearly inartful. It was not meant to be 
taken literally, but it was. I regret the comment because it diverted 
from a very important point that needs to be made, and the point is 
this: if we care about our fellow citizens, if we wish to be 
compassionate, then Federal aid and Federal policy will help move these 
people to safer ground.
  It is time to either help mitigate these homes or to help move these 
homes. For this small set of properties, we must help. Otherwise, I 
fear that the fatalities and the economic carnage will continue.
  If we simply rebuild the same properties in the same manner, in the 
same place, and expect a different result, we are not helping our 
fellow citizens, we are not helping our first responders, and we are 
certainly not helping the taxpayer.
  Mr. Speaker, another tragedy of these storms is how many people 
needed flood insurance but didn't have it. Many of them had no idea 
that they actually needed it. In Houston, by some reports, 80 percent 
of the damaged homes didn't have flood insurance.
  Why?
  One of the reasons, Mr. Speaker, is because we have a government 
monopoly in flood insurance. Many people don't understand that flood is 
not included in their typical homeowner's insurance policy. Many 
people, unfortunately, took false security from living outside the 
government-designated 100-year flood plain. Many have seen no options.
  But help is on the way. Bipartisan help is on the way with the Flood 
Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act, known as the Ross-Castor 
bill. It is a critical piece of legislation to give more people more 
affordable options for flood insurance.
  In the small part of the national market where we have competition, 
particularly in Pennsylvania and in Florida, people are saving hundreds 
of dollars, if not thousands of dollars, in many cases on their 
flood insurance premiums.

  The very respected firm of Millman, which studies insurance matters, 
said that half of policy owners in Florida, two-thirds in Louisiana, 
and 75 percent in Texas--my native State--could all save with private 
flood insurance.
  Think about it, Mr. Speaker. If we had a real competitive market with 
multiple companies advertising and selling multiple policies, more 
people would become educated about the need for flood insurance and 
have that rolled into their normal homeowner's policy. This is vital.
  Mr. Speaker, last year this bill passed this House 419-0. You can't 
get any more bipartisan. It recently passed the Financial Services 
Committee 58-0.
  If there is one thing that we need to do--and it is urgent that we do 
it now, with the National Flood Insurance Program, which is in debt, 
facing another bailout and an uncertain future, which we must remedy--
as folks begin to rebuild, let's get them more affordable flood 
insurance policies.
  I appreciate the bill included in this package, and for the sake of 
all the victims of the hurricanes, I urge its adoption.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I think that there is a sufficient opportunity 
here going forward, as the previous gentlemen has spoken, to discuss 
the whole issue of flood insurance. I just don't think this is the 
moment to be discussing the flood insurance initiatives. Instead, I 
think that ought to be subject to a full-throttled debate in this

[[Page H7466]]

institution about getting those things done. This is not, I think, the 
appropriate forum for accomplishing that.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. 
DeFazio), the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee.
  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, this is purportedly an absolutely essential 
extension of authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration to 
continue to operate after October 1. Unfortunately, it has devolved 
into other issues because it has turned into a Christmas tree on the 
Republican side of the aisle.
  We need to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. The last 
time Congress failed to do this--and the ticket tax, which is what pays 
for air traffic control in America, expired--almost every airline in 
America raised their rates 7.5 percent, got a $400 million windfall, 
which the government lost, with the exception of two: I understand, 
Alaska and Spirit.
  So if we fail to reauthorize, we can expect that that will happen 
again.
  Actually, their long-term plan is to privatize the FAA, do away with 
the ticket tax, reap a $10 billion windfall, and then impose a new per-
head fee to use our national airspace, which, by the way, Congress will 
have nothing to say about that. No elected official will have any 
authority over what new fees they charge. That is extraordinary.
  That came out of the Republican side of the Ways and Means Committee. 
What a bunch of losers. Come on. Give me a break. You are going to 
allow the airlines to have the authority, a private corporation, to tax 
people in America, and then say: Oh, it is not a tax; it is a user fee.
  It sure feels like a tax to me, and it is going to feel like that to 
your constituents. But when they complain, you will say: Oh, go talk to 
the private corporation.
  That is why we are here today, because the chairman of the committee 
has stubbornly persisted in attempting to privatize the air traffic 
organization of the United States of America, the most complex, the 
most efficient, and the safest system in the world.
  Yes, there are a few reforms that are needed there. Most of them have 
to do with us. Congress sequesters their money. Even though there is 
enough money raised in the ticket tax and other taxes to pay for the 
system, we sequester their money, we shut them down. We do dumb things 
like that.
  So I introduced a bill to take care of those problems, to exempt them 
from sequestration; to exempt them from budget shutdowns; and to 
require reforms in their personnel procedures, their policy procedures 
in terms of acquisitions; and to enhance the role of their coordinating 
committee, which has been doing a great job coordinating between the 
government and the airlines and all the people who use the system, not 
just the commercial airlines; and authorize funds to rebuild some of 
the major air traffic control centers, which are falling apart.
  Instead, the chairman has insisted that we must privatize because 
Canada did it, which is kind of a tiny fraction of what we are.
  Then the airlines have this fake group called the Citizens for On 
Time Flights, who say:

       We have to fly zigzag routes, which are World War II radar.

  No. Actually, we have deployed a system where you could fly all the 
planes in America closer together with GPS, but the airlines haven't 
bought the equipment, so they are blaming the FAA. That kind of stinks. 
So that is why we are here today.
  We have a bill that otherwise is totally agreed upon. If we were 
voting today on an FAA bill to give them a 6-year extension without 
privatization, with the reforms we need, we would be pressuring the 
Senate to get something done.
  Now, the Senate is hung up over whether or not you should have 1,500 
hours of experience to sit in the copilot's seat. After the tragic 
Colgan accident, reforms were adopted that made these requirements. So 
they are hung up on that. On this side, we are hung up on privatizing 
the system.
  So it is sad that we have come to this point today. My hope is that 
we will move forward soon in the bipartisan tradition of my committee, 
and we will move an FAA bill and any amendments that are allowed, or 
any riders or anything that is in it will have only to do with 
aviation, not to do with flood insurance, not to do with any of all 
these other miscellaneous things that are being thrown in here today. 
We are here with the Ways and Means Committee on a bill that should be 
a transportation bill.

  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).
  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise and want to make 
comments actually echoing a lot of the comments that were made already.
  The gentleman from Massachusetts talked about this needing to be a 
bipartisan bill, and I agree. The gentleman from New Jersey talked 
about Hurricane Sandy tax relief, and I agree. The gentleman from 
Florida talked about the need to ensure that we are responding quickly 
and appropriately in response to the devastating disasters that have 
affected his State of Florida and the State of Texas. I also support 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania's comments regarding a short-term 
reauthorization to the FAA so we can continue to move forward on 
reform.
  But you may be wondering why, Mr. Speaker, groups like the 
Association of State Floodplain Managers and the Consumer Federation of 
America have expressed opposition to this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I include these letters in the Record.

                                              Association of State


                                    Floodplain Managers, Inc.,

                                               September 24, 2017.
     Re Private flood insurance in H.R. 3823, Disaster Tax Relief 
         and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017.

       Dear Leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives: Early 
     this week, the House will consider legislation promoting 
     development of private flood insurance as part of a bill to 
     reauthorize the FAA for 6 months and provide hurricane tax 
     relief. The bill is scheduled to be taken up under suspension 
     this week. ASFPM strongly objects to consideration of private 
     flood outside the reauthorization of the NFIP. The proposed 
     bill does not insert HR 2901 from the 114th Congress as 
     mentioned in press reports, but inserts HR 1422, the Ross-
     Castor bill from the 115th Congress as Title 4, with 
     provisions that as written could substantially weaken and 
     undermine the critical functioning of the National Flood 
     Insurance Program,. The NFIP not only provides flood 
     insurance, but is a comprehensive flood risk management 
     program.
       Although we understand the potential benefits of more flood 
     insurance options, we point out that the private market has 
     been readily expanding since Biggert-Waters 2012 was passed 
     authorizing private flood insurance. ASFPM cannot support 
     authorization for private flood insurance as written in HR 
     1422. The temporary extension and reauthorization of the NFIP 
     expires on 8 Dec 2017, giving Congress ample time to consider 
     the full scope of the NFIP, into which private flood must 
     integrate, without causing irreparable damage to the other 3 
     fundamental elements of this comprehensive flood risk 
     management program. Those are floodplain mapping, 
     implementation of local floodplain ordinances to protect new 
     development, and hazard mitigation grants to reduce damage 
     and loss of life from flooding.
       ASFPM has stated that three modifications of that HR 1422 
     language must be made to ensure continuity of the 
     comprehensive flood risk reduction aspects of the NFIP that 
     exist today. A federal policy fee on all NFIP policies pays 
     for almost half the cost of floodplain mapping and all of the 
     costs of floodplain management including technical assistance 
     to over 22,000 communities that have joined the NFIP. Hazard 
     mitigation grants are funded by premium income to the 
     program. None of these functions are provided by private 
     flood insurance policies.
       Yet private insurance companies acknowledge that mapping 
     (i.e. identification of flood risk areas and areas of 
     mandatory purchase of flood insurance) and floodplain 
     management (i.e. reduced risk due to local requirements for 
     hazard-resistant construction) help them to target their 
     marketing and to price premiums lower where floodplain 
     ordinances exist.
       First, private policies must also carry the federal policy 
     user fee to support the mapping and floodplain management 
     functions. Private flood policy holders, private insurance 
     companies, as well as the NFIP and its policy holders, 
     benefit from these functions by identifying at-risk areas, 
     ensuring building construction standards which facilitate 
     lower flood insurance premiums, and targeting areas and 
     structures which could benefit from mitigation actions 
     leading to lower premiums. As policies migrate to the private 
     sector, millions of dollars in revenue to support those 
     floodplain management and mapping functions will be lost 
     unless there is an equivalent policy user fee on private 
     policies.
       Second, private policies to satisfy the mandatory purchase 
     requirement for properties in floodplains must only be sold 
     in communities that participate in the NFIP (meaning

[[Page H7467]]

     they have adopted floodplain management ordinances to guide 
     safer development). In smaller communities with only a 
     handful of properties required to purchase flood insurance, 
     if that requirement can be met with private policies, those 
     communities may drop out of the NFIP and no longer maintain 
     floodplain management ordinances to reduce future losses. 
     This could result in lack of abililty to reduce future flood 
     losses and in taxpayers picking up disaster costs.
       Third, several provisions of the existing definition of 
     private flood insurance must be retained. The Biggert-Waters 
     2012 legislation (42 USC 4012a(b)(7)) defines private flood 
     insurance, among other things, as providing coverage ``at 
     least as broad as'' that provided by the NFIP. The language 
     provides consumer protections to ensure policies would not 
     have excessive deductibles, exclusions, or eliminate some 
     essential coverages like Increased Cost of Compliance, which 
     provides assistance to policyholders to rebuild in a manner 
     that reduces flood damage in the future. Without these 
     important provisions in place, policyholders could face 
     unaffordable deductibles when they have a claim; communities 
     would find it much harder to help homeowners become eligible 
     for mitigation funding; and there would be a greater chance 
     that claim payments would not be applied to building repairs 
     resulting in increased community blight. ASFPM further notes 
     that with this language in place, the private market has 
     already been growing. The private flood insurance bill 
     strikes this language.
       The nation's floodplain managers strongly urge adoption of 
     these elements if private flood language is added to the 
     House NFIP reauthorization bill. This would preserve the 
     flood risk mapping and floodplain management functions that 
     the NFIP provides and would protect consumers from purchasing 
     low-cost policies that provide less than adequate coverage 
     and/or higher deductibles they could not pay. This would not 
     happen if insureds had an NFIP policy.
       The Association of State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM) and 
     its 36 chapters represent more than 17,000 state and local 
     officials, as well as other professionals engaged in all 
     aspects of floodplain management and flood hazard mitigation 
     including management of local floodplain ordinances, flood 
     risk mapping, engineering, planning, community development, 
     hydrology, forecasting, emergency response, water resources 
     development and flood insurance. All ASFPM members are 
     concerned with reducing our nation's flood-related losses.
       Again we urge you to oppose inclusion of these ill-advised 
     private flood provisions outside of the context of 
     comprehensive NFIP reauthorization legislation. The 
     suspension package makes it impossible to properly address 
     these issues. Thank you for seriously considering these 
     recommendations from the Association of State Floodplain 
     Managers.
           Very sincerely,
                                                   Chad Berginnis,
     ASFPM Executive Director.

                                               September 25, 2017.
     Re Oppose adding flood insurance provisions of H.R. 1422 to 
         the FAA extension bill.

       Dear Representative: Today, the House will consider 
     legislation promoting development of private flood insurance 
     as part of a bill to reauthorize the FAA for six months and 
     provide hurricane tax relief. The bill is scheduled to be 
     taken up under suspension this week. CFA strongly objects to 
     consideration of private flood insurance outside the 
     reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program 
     (NFIP). The proposed bill does not include H.R. 2901 from the 
     114th Congress as mentioned in press reports, but rather, 
     includes H.R. 1422, the Ross-Castor bill from the 115th 
     Congress as Title 4, with provisions that as written could 
     substantially weaken and undermine the critical functioning 
     of the NFIP.
       We oppose the inclusion of H.R. 1422 for numerous reasons:
       First, several provisions of the existing definition of 
     private flood insurance must be retained. The Biggert-Waters 
     2012 legislation (42 USC 4012a(b)(7)) defines private flood 
     insurance, among other things, as providing coverage ``at 
     least as broad as'' that provided by the NFIP. The language 
     provides consumer protections to ensure policies would not 
     have excessive deductibles, exclusions, or eliminate some 
     essential coverages like ``increased cost of compliance,'' 
     which provides assistance to policyholders to rebuild in a 
     manner that reduces flood damage in the future. Without these 
     important consumer protective provisions in place, 
     policyholders could face unaffordable deductibles when they 
     have a claim; communities would find it much harder to help 
     homeowners become eligible for mitigation funding; and there 
     would be a greater chance that claim payments would not be 
     applied to building repairs resulting in increased community 
     blight. The Association of State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM) 
     further notes that with this language in place, the private 
     market has already been growing. The private flood insurance 
     bill strikes this language which significantly eliminates 
     important consumer protections.
       Second, the 45 day notice of cancellation provision must be 
     maintained or private insurers could cancel coverage when a 
     storm is approaching and not leave consumers with enough time 
     to get NFIP coverage, which has a 30-day waiting period for 
     coverage attachment. H.R. 1422 as included in this bill 
     problematically removes this notice provision.
       Third, surplus line insurers should not be authorized to 
     sell flood insurance since they are not covered by state 
     guarantee funds should they fail after a big storm, and they 
     are not regulated by the states and should not be allowed to 
     offer flood insurance unless the policy provisions are at 
     least equal to the NFIP coverage and the Federal Emergency 
     Management Agency (FEMA) is given some authority to regulate 
     claims practices. H.R. 1422, as included in this bill, 
     permits surplus line insurers to sell flood insurance, 
     placing consumers at risk.
       Fourth, private policies must also carry the federal policy 
     user fee to support the mapping and floodplain management 
     functions. Private flood policy holders, private insurance 
     companies, as well as the NFIP and its policy holders, 
     benefit from these functions by identifying at-risk areas, 
     ensuring building construction standards which facilitate 
     lower flood insurance premiums, and targeting areas and 
     structures which could benefit from mitigation actions 
     leading to lower premiums. As policies migrate to the private 
     sector, millions of dollars in revenue to support those 
     floodplain management and mapping functions will be lost 
     unless there is an equivalent policy user fee on private 
     policies. H.R. 1422 would diminish flood mapping resources 
     and increase risk to consumers.
       Fifth, private policies to satisfy the mandatory purchase 
     requirement for properties in floodplains must only be sold 
     in communities that participate in the NFIP (meaning they 
     have adopted floodplain management ordinances to guide safer 
     development). In smaller communities with only a handful of 
     properties required to purchase flood insurance, if that 
     requirement can be met with private policies, those 
     communities may drop out of the NFIP and no longer maintain 
     floodplain management ordinances to reduce future losses. 
     This could result in a lack of ability to reduce future flood 
     losses and in taxpayers picking up disaster costs.
       We strongly urge you to oppose the inclusion of H.R. 1422 
     in the FAA extension bill.
           Sincerely,
                                                 J. Robert Hunter,
                                           Director of Insurances.

  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, extraneous provisions on flood 
insurance that should not be pasted into this legislation were 
included. These provisions actually undermine the very solvency of the 
program. They are establishing a private market at a time when the 
National Flood Insurance Program--the Federal program--is going to need 
the resources to pay claims. Establishing a private market within 60 
days is going to divert resources from the Federal program to private 
insurers. It is going to divert these dollars to where they don't have 
the resources to make the payments.
  Private insurance companies are already involved in flood insurance, 
and once we authorize them to step into these markets, they are going 
to be able to cherry-pick low- and moderate-risk policies, leaving the 
National Flood Insurance Program with only high-risk policies, leaving 
them with the burden of flood mapping and leaving them with the burden 
of a $24.6 billion debt. I don't understand how the program is going to 
have the resources to pay the claims it underwrites.
  Next, Mr. Speaker, one of the other big problems we have is that this 
shows floods in Texas, floods in Louisiana, and gutting homes in 
Louisiana here and in Texas there.

                              {time}  1730

  These were both 1,000-year flood events. I don't understand the 
difference on why we choose these folks get tax relief and these don't. 
We introduced nearly identical legislation to address this.
  We shouldn't be discriminating against folks in New Jersey and New 
York and Louisiana in exchange for the others.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster).
  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Curbelo for yielding me this 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, I just heard the ranking member get on the floor and 
call me stubborn. I am pretty committed to what we are doing here 
because this week will be the second year anniversary of this quote by 
the ranking member in debate on the floor on H.R. 3614. ``The FAA is 
the only agency in government worse at procurement than the Pentagon. 
Congress has tried to reform it; it didn't stick. We have got to try 
something different to get it more agile, to give us the 21st century 
equipment and software that we need.''
  That is exactly what we are trying to do in the 21st Century AIRR 
Act. We

[[Page H7468]]

have tried for the last 40 years to get it modernized. We spent 
somewhere around 40 to $50 billion, and we haven't been able to get it 
done. This is a true transformational reform.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Denham).
  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I support the 21st Century AIRR Act, H.R. 
2997. This is something that needs to get done. We need to solve our 
problems for America's airlines and our passengers who are traveling 
across the country.
  This is a short-term extension, but we have got to get our job done. 
As well, we have got to get our job done on teaching hospitals. While 
we continue to debate the healthcare of this Nation, we have got areas 
like mine that have a lack of access. If you can't see a doctor today, 
you have no healthcare.
  I think it is important that our Teaching Health Center Graduate 
Medical Education program gets extended long term. We have a bill to do 
that. Just expanding it 3 months, if you are graduating from medical 
school right now, you want to be able to have the certainty that you 
are going to have a residency program long term.
  I support this extension, but we have got to do a lot more. It is 
time for both Houses to come together. More importantly, it is time for 
both parties to come together to solve our issues for the FAA, for 
modernization, making sure that we actually have an aviation system 
that works. It is ridiculous that I can look at the Waze app on my 
phone, yet we have got the airlines getting stalled across the entire 
country. We can do better. We have got to come together to do that.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, let me reassure the gentleman from California that when 
you talk about graduate medical education, believe me, in 
Massachusetts, we are for graduate medical education. Be assured of 
that.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me say that we all support 
reauthorization of the FAA. What has happened here again is a breakdown 
in the conversation that used to meld this institution together.
  There was a chance on Friday for Republicans to consult with us in 
the minority, put together a bipartisan package of many very important 
provisions that are important to Mr. Curbelo, important to certainly 
Texas, important to the Virgin Islands. It is certainly important to 
Puerto Rico.
  Let me give you a quick example of how this institution used to work. 
We used to call this the national principle. The national principle 
essentially said if there was an earthquake in California, we all rose 
to the support of California. If there were forest fires in Alabama, 
which there were, we would all come to the aid of the people of 
Alabama. If there was a horrific, torrential downpour in Texas, we 
simply said: We don't ask if it is a red State or a blue State, or if 
they are Libertarians or Socialists or Democrats or Republicans. We 
said: They are members of the American family. We said: Do what has to 
be done and then send us the bill. We believe that there will be ample 
opportunity to debate and discuss the size of the portionality at that 
moment.
  Instead, where we had this opportunity right here to provide a robust 
package to the people of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and 
Texas, we decide to come back with an anemic proposal.
  We are coming up short on our responsibility. We had a tornado in my 
hometown 5 years ago. Those Federal employees did a spectacular job 
everywhere in eight communities, and nobody said: Too much government. 
They said: Let's fix this for, again, the American family to get this 
straightened out.
  I have said to Mr. Curbelo, and I will repeat it, we will put up 195 
Democrats immediately for a bigger package for the people of Florida, 
Texas, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, not to piecemeal this 
together.
  By the way, let me use this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, for those of us 
from the Northeast, the idea that 90 Members of this institution voted 
against direct relief just a couple of weeks ago looking for a pay-for, 
I wonder if they are going to use that same application of consistency 
when we get to the tax proposals that are about to consume our time.
  We want to provide adequate relief to these families and the 
communities that need it. We could do this in the next 48 hours without 
any problem whatsoever.
  Mr. Speaker, at this time, because this is not big enough and not 
supportive enough of the American family, I am going to urge my 
colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.
  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means 
Committee staff for their work on this legislation. It has been a tough 
couple weeks in the State of Florida, especially down in my 
community. Again, I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts, Mr. 
Neal. As I said earlier, when I came back here, the first conversation 
we had was about helping south Florida, and he said he was willing and 
certainly able to do it.

  Here today, we are trying to take that first step to help the people 
of Florida, to help the people of Texas, of Louisiana, of the Virgin 
Islands, of Puerto Rico. But as often happens in the House, if 
something isn't perfect, then we get nothing. That is wrong. That is 
wrong, because there are people out there who need the help, people who 
don't have a roof, people who don't have a home, people who have been 
without power.
  I visited the Marathon Emergency Operations Center, Mr. Speaker. It 
was replete with people buzzing, everyone working hard, full of energy, 
even though they hadn't slept in days. The emergency operations manager 
there told me that a third of the employees there who were helping 
their fellow residents, conchs in the Florida Keys, had lost their 
homes.
  This is about them, and we can help improve their lives today, and we 
can work together to do more later, and we should. But why should the 
perfect be the enemy of the good? Why, when we have the opportunity to 
help people, because some think we should be doing even more, we are 
going to give them absolutely nothing? I think that is a major mistake, 
and it sends the wrong message.
  Throughout this debate, we have seen everything from posturing to 
name calling, and we wonder why so many Americans reject this 
institution and are disappointed by it. We have to do better, and we 
can do better. It would send a strong message if we all voted for this 
legislation to take this first step to helping the people of the 
Florida Keys, of south Florida, of Texas, of Louisiana, of the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, of Puerto Rico, help them get back up on their feet.
  Mr. Speaker, this is very important, and on behalf of my community 
and a lot of people who have, quite frankly, lost their lives, I ask 
all of my colleagues to join together and to support this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the funding 
authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is 
currently set to expire on Saturday, September 30. The FAA depends 
heavily on reliable and long-term funding provided through the Airport 
and Airway Trust Fund and the spending levels set in a corresponding 
authorization bill. This consistent and reliable funding is the 
mainstay of the FAA's success in managing the safest and most complex 
airspace in the world. Absent access to this funding through a long-
term authorization for FAA programs, we are threatening the safety, 
reliability, and effectiveness of our airspace.
  Sadly, Congress is yet again backed into a corner of taking up a 
short-term, six-month measure that would extend this funding 
authorization through March 31, 2018. This is simply unacceptable. 
Congress needs to pass a long-term authorization bill so that the FAA 
can focus on the important tasks of maintaining public safety, staffing 
air traffic controllers, and bolstering our airport infrastructure 
through the timely distribution of Airport Improvement Program (AIP) 
dollars. A six-month extension poses new challenges for each of these 
important aspects of managing our airspace.
  The extension being debated today also adds several extraneous 
provisions that run counter to regular order in the House and threatens 
the success of passing an ever-important reauthorization. The bill 
selectively extends the authorization for certain public health 
programs, while leaving out other critical programs such as the State 
Children's

[[Page H7469]]

Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The bill also includes language that 
would encourage the creation of private flood insurance markets, while 
stripping important consumer protections such as the 45 day of 
cancellation provision that prevents private insurers from cancelling 
cover Just moments before a devastating storm.
  Mr. Speaker, allow me to be clear: I suppose a clean, long-term 
reauthorization of the FAA's funding authority. However, the underlying 
bill not only includes a host of extraneous provisions that I could not 
support, but it was done so without the input of me or any of my 
Democratic colleagues. If Republicans are serious about maintaining the 
safest and most complex airspace in the world, they will pass a clean 
reauthorization that authorizes FAA programs for several years, not 
several months. We cannot politicize this issue with provisions related 
to healthcare, or flood insurance, or privatizing our air traffic 
control services. It is far too important and time is quickly running 
out.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 3823.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this motion will be postponed.
