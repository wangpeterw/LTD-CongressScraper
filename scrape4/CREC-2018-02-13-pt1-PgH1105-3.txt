                  CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the bipartisan Career and 
Technical Education Caucus, I rise in recognition of National CTE 
Month.
  CTE programs train students of all ages for jobs in high-skill, high-
demand, and high-paying fields. By establishing partnerships between 
educators and industry leaders, CTE helps build a well-educated and 
skilled workforce ready to meet local business needs.
  In Rhode Island, the Westerly Education Center, by way of example, 
collaborates with Electric Boat to train pipefitting students like 
Stephanie and Richard to build our Nation's next generation submarines.
  The Genesis Center partners with CVS, Building Futures, and 
Apprenticeship Rhode Island to train workers, including Kathia, Jidma, 
and Lim, to become pharmacy technicians. Cindy was recently offered a 
job by CVS soon after she finished an apprenticeship.
  CTE is good for students, businesses, the Rhode Island economy, and 
economies everywhere because it narrows that gap between what we are 
teaching in schools and what the needs of businesses really are.
  I am proud to introduce a resolution celebrating CTE Month with my 
friend, colleague, and caucus co-chair, Representative G.T. Thompson.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring H. Res. 
730.
