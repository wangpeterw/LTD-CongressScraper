                        RECOGNIZING ERIN HAMLIN

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Erin Hamlin, a 
hardworking and outstanding constituent of the 22nd Congressional 
District, who has just qualified for her fourth consecutive Winter 
Olympic Games.
  Erin hails from a beautiful hamlet in Oneida County, known as Remsen, 
New York.
  Erin started her career in luge in 2005. Her first major 
international victory was achieved in 2009, in Lake Placid, at the 
World Luge Championships, where Erin earned a remarkable gold medal.
  At the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, Erin became the first American 
ever--both male and female--to medal in a singles luge competition when 
she brought home the bronze for Team USA.
  Next year, Erin will represent Team USA in South Korea by again 
competing in the singles luge competition.
  Please join me in wishing the best of luck to our hometown rock star 
Erin Hamlin and all of Team USA in next year's Winter Olympic Games in 
Pyeongchang, South Korea.
