                       TRIBUTE TO CRADDOCK MORRIS

 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, today, I would like to honor and 
thank Mr. Craddock Morris of St. Matthews, SC for 87 years of valuable 
reporting in Calhoun County. The Calhoun Times, a small weekly paper in 
our great state, has decided to cease publication after a truly amazing 
run of nearly nine decades of providing town residents with community 
news.
  The Times was created by Craddock Morris's father in 1929. John 
Bunyan Morris, Sr., a 1950 graduate of The Citadel, ran it until his 
retirement in 1956, when Craddock took over. Although this local 
newspaper, based in St. Matthews, will no longer be published, I am 
sure the Morris family's legacy of good work will remain with residents 
all over Calhoun County.
  I would like to recognize Mr. Craddock Morris, and his son Edwin C. 
Morris who joined the Times after serving in the Armed Forces, and 
their families for 87 years of delivering essential news to the people 
of Calhoun County.
