                         REMEMBERING ROSA PARKS

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Rosa 
Parks, who, 62 years ago today, changed the face of the United States.
  On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks refused a bus driver's orders to give 
up her seat on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama. This simple act 
led to a bus boycott that helped to energize the civil rights movement.
  Reflecting on that day, Rosa Parks once said: ``The only tired I was, 
was tired of giving in.''
  She didn't give up. She didn't give in. Rosa Parks reminds us that we 
all must never, never give in when faced with injustice. Her brave 
actions have inspired all of us. Each and every one of us have an 
opportunity to stand up, sit down, or kneel for what is right.
  It is because of civil rights champions like Rosa Parks that future 
generations can grow up in a nation that is free and fair for all.
