                   EXTRAORDINARY MILITARY LEADERSHIP

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I was grateful to 
participate in a congressional delegation last week to Japan, the 
Republic of Korea, Guam, and Hawaii. We visited troops on the front 
line who are defending American families and promoting peace through 
strength.
  In the shadow of North Korea's latest missile launch over Japan, it 
was reassuring to meet with leadership of the highest competence and 
integrity.
  We were inspired by the leadership from Vice Admiral Phil Sawyer, 
Commander U.S. 7th Fleet; General Vincent Brooks, Commander, U.S. 
Forces Korea; Lieutenant General Tom Bergeson, Commander, 7th Air 
Force; Lieutenant General Tom Vandal, Commanding General, 8th Army; 
Rear Admiral Shoshana Chatfield, Commander, Joint Region Marianas; 
Lieutenant General Bryan Fenton, Deputy Commander, U.S. Pacific 
Command; Admiral Scott Swift, Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet; General 
Terrence O'Shaughnessy, Commander, Pacific Air Forces; General Robert 
Brown, Commander, U.S. Army Pacific.
  The delegation was professionally coordinated by Captain Scott Farr 
and Lieutenant Commander Victoria Marum. Many thanks to staff Craig 
Collier and Brian Garrett for accompanying the delegation.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our prayers are with 
those in Mexico City, Puerto Rico, and all in the path of Hurricane 
Maria.
