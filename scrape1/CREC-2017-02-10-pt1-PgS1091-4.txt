  Ms. WARREN (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Markey, Mr. King, Mrs.

resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                               S. Res. 58

       Whereas, on Sunday, February 5, 2017, the New England 
     Patriots (in this preamble referred to as the ``Patriots'') 
     won Super Bowl LI by a score of 34 to 28, defeating the 
     Atlanta Falcons in Houston, Texas;
       Whereas, during the second half of Super Bowl LI, the 
     Patriots scored 31 consecutive points, overcoming the largest 
     deficit that any team has overcome in Super Bowl history;
       Whereas the victory in Super Bowl LI earned the Patriots 
     their fifth Super Bowl championship;
       Whereas Tom Brady--
       (1) broke, tied, or extended several Super Bowl records in 
     leading the Patriots to their fifth Super Bowl victory; and
       (2) was named the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player for a 
     record fourth time;
       Whereas James White set new Super Bowl records by catching 
     14 passes and scoring 20 points, including the game-winning 
     touchdown run in overtime;
       Whereas Bill Belichick won an unprecedented fifth Super 
     Bowl title as a head coach;
       Whereas the performance of the defense in the second half 
     was critical to the Patriots' victory in Super Bowl LI, and 
     key plays by Trey Flowers, Dont'a Hightower, and Alan Branch 
     contributed to shutting out the Atlanta Falcons for the final 
     23 minutes and 36 seconds of regulation;
       Whereas Julian Edelman hauled in a miracle catch for the 
     ages to continue a fourth quarter drive by the Patriots, 
     helping to send the game to overtime;
       Whereas Robert Kraft, the owner of the Patriots, eloquently 
     stated, ``Two years ago, we won our fourth Super Bowl down in 
     Arizona and I told our fans that was the sweetest one of all. 
     . . . But I want to say to our fans, to our brilliant 
     coaching staff, our amazing players who were so spectacular, 
     this is unequivocally the sweetest''; and
       Whereas the Patriots ``did their job'' again and took ``no 
     days off'', delivering a fifth Lombardi Trophy to New 
     England: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the New England 
     Patriots on their dramatic victory in Super Bowl LI.
