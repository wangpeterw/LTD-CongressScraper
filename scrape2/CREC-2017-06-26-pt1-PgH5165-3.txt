  Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the 
gentlewoman from Georgia, the Honorable Karen C. Handel, be permitted 
to the oath of office today.
  Her certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest 
and no question has been raised with regard to her election.
  The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from 
Georgia?
  There was no objection.
