   SENATE RESOLUTION 447--DESIGNATING MARCH 22, 2018, AS ``NATIONAL 
              REHABILITATION COUNSELORS APPRECIATION DAY''

  Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Isakson) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 447

       Whereas rehabilitation counselors support individuals with 
     disabilities by--
       (1) conducting assessments;
       (2) providing counseling;
       (3) supporting families; and
       (4) assisting in the development of individualized plans 
     for employment for individuals with disabilities who are in 
     need of rehabilitation;

       Whereas the purpose of professional organizations for 
     rehabilitation counseling and education is to promote the 
     improvement of rehabilitation services available to 
     individuals with disabilities through quality education for 
     counselors and rehabilitation research;
       Whereas various professional organizations have vigorously 
     advocated for up-to-date education and training and the 
     maintenance of professional standards in the field of 
     rehabilitation counseling and education, including--
       (1) the National Rehabilitation Association;
       (2) the Rehabilitation Counselors and Educators 
     Association;
       (3) the National Council on Rehabilitation Education;
       (4) the National Rehabilitation Counseling Association;
       (5) the American Rehabilitation Counseling Association;
       (6) the Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor 
     Certification;
       (7) the Council of State Administrators of Vocational 
     Rehabilitation; and
       (8) the Council on Rehabilitation Education;

       Whereas, in March of 1983, the president of the National 
     Council on Rehabilitation Education testified before the 
     Subcommittee on Select Education of the Committee on 
     Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and was 
     instrumental in bringing to the attention of Congress the 
     need for qualified rehabilitation counselors; and
       Whereas credentialed rehabilitation counselors provide a 
     higher quality of service to individuals in need of 
     rehabilitation and the development of an accreditation system 
     for rehabilitation counselors supports the continued 
     education of rehabilitation counselors: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates March 22, 2018, as ``National Rehabilitation 
     Counselors Appreciation Day''; and
       (2) commends--
       (A) rehabilitation counselors for their dedication and hard 
     work in providing counseling to individuals with disabilities 
     who are in need of rehabilitation; and
       (B) professional organizations for their efforts in 
     assisting individuals with disabilities who are in need of 
     rehabilitation.
