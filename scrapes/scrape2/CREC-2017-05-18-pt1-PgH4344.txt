                  PLEASE READ THE NEW HEALTHCARE BILL

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I am privileged and honored to be a Member 
of this House, and it is very frustrating for us to come here week 
after week and to not do the business of the people of the United 
States of America. One of those impediments is that we have a President 
of the United States who is trying to force and push this Congress, and 
many others in his administration, to do things that are not right for 
the people and this country.
  I think it is important for us to understand that when and if you get 
an opportunity to read the legislation called TrumpCare, you will 
realize that really what it is about is Trump doesn't care about your 
healthcare. Please, just read it. I apologize for talking about the 24 
million-plus Americans who will lose their healthcare if this bill were 
to become law. I apologize because I need to remind each individual 
that they will likely lose the ability to see a doctor if this bill 
becomes law. Please, please, help us. Please, focus on what is going on 
here in Washington and what is not going on here in Washington for 
everyone's sake.
