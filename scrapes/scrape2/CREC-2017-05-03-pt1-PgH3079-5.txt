                          SMALL BUSINESS WEEK

  (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, today, as we celebrate Small Business 
Week, I rise to recognize, commend, and stress the importance of small 
businesses of this country.
  I have the honor of serving on the House Small Business Committee 
every day, and I am reminded that small businesses are the pillars and 
the cornerstones of the American economy.
  The National Small Business Association recently met in our Nation's 
Capital. They communicated to me their biggest concerns were health 
care and government overregulation. That is why we believe doing 
nothing with health care is not an option. That is why this Congress 
must strive to end the overburdensome regulation this government does 
to kill jobs.
  All across Kansas, and this country, small businesses are driving 
economic opportunity, innovation, and growth. This week, and every 
week, we must keep their contributions at the forefront of our 
decisionmaking.
