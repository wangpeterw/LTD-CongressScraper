                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, our hope for years to come, we worship You. Your Name is 
great, and we offer You our adoration and praise.
  Bless our Senators. Open their eyes so that they can discern Your 
involvement in human affairs. Prepare their hearts and minds for 
today's challenges, inspiring them to conduct themselves with courtesy 
and honor. Keep their motives pure, their words true, and their actions 
constructive.
  Almighty God, we acknowledge that our lives are in Your hands. So 
please keep our feet from stumbling.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
