  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from California (Mr.

  There was no objection.
  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor today to introduce to 
the House our guest chaplain, Glen Berteau of Modesto, California.
  Glen is the senior pastor of The House in Modesto, a church of more 
than 8,000.
  Supporting his community is a priority, and, under Glen's leadership, 
The House Modesto has established programs to fight against human 
trafficking, provided groceries on a weekly basis to those in need, 
repaired bicycles for the homeless, and developed mobile medical and 
dental clinics that provide services free of charge.
  The House was also recently recognized by the city of Modesto for 
their annual event, Unity Matters, which honors law enforcement and 
first responders.
  Glen is originally from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and has called 
California his home for over 24 years. He and his wife, Deborah, have 
been in ministry for over 40 years, have been married for 42 years, and 
they have 3 children, 5 grandchildren.
  Glen is a gifted speaker, teacher, and evangelist and has ministered 
at conferences, churches, and conventions all over the world.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming Pastor Glen 
Berteau. We thank him for offering today's opening prayer in the United 
States House of Representatives.
