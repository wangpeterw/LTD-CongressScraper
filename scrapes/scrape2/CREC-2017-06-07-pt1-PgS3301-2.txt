                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Father of love, whose presence and power is revealed to the hearts 
that long for Your guidance, we thank You for the gift of this day. May 
we use this borrowed time for Your glory.
  As our lawmakers strive to honor You, may they work with commendable 
zeal, knowing that life's evening is coming when their labor will be 
done. Lord, give them the wisdom to keep Your words in their hearts, 
providing them with a lamp for their feet and a light for their paths.
  Continue to be our strength and shield. May we think of You 
consistently and trust You constantly.
  We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.
