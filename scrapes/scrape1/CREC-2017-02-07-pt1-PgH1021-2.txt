                         NORTH KOREA RESOLUTION

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last night, I introduced 
bipartisan resolution H. Res. 92, condemning North Korea's development 
of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles and calling for an 
application of all available sanctions. Sadly, the dictatorship in 
North Korea has been testing nuclear weapons, threatening the people of 
South Korea.
  This resolution clearly outlines the progression of North Korea's 
recent aggression--nuclear tests, ballistic missile tests, and their 
willingness to share weapons technology with state sponsors of 
terrorism like Iran and Syria. It is time to stand up to North Korea's 
aggression. An ICBM with a nuclear warhead is a direct threat to the 
United States and our allies, especially South Korea.
  Along with Congressman Eliot Engel, we are the only two Members of 
Congress to have visited North Korea. I believe this resolution is a 
crucial first step to achieving peace through strength, especially 
following Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis' positive visit to South 
Korea last week.
  I am grateful this resolution is bipartisan, cosponsored by 
colleagues, Representatives Mike Rogers, Seth Moulton, Ted Yoho, and 
Brad Sherman, along with the Korea Caucus co-chair Gerry Connolly.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
