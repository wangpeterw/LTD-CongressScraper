                 REMEMBER MOTHER LULA MAE LOLLAR BELTON

 Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, today I would like to take a 
moment to recognize and honor the life of a great South Carolinian, 
Mother Lula Mae Lollar Belton, ``Mom-mo,'' who departed this life on 
September 20, 2017.
  Mother Belton was a spiritual, humble, and loving woman who loved the 
Lord and her community. She worked for the Colleton County Food Service 
for 31 years, as well as many positions within Buckhead UMC Church, 
where she was a faithful member. She most notably served as Mother of 
the Church. Mother Belton always had an open heart to her many 
children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, great-great-
grandchildren, as well as many others in the community and church. She 
will be greatly missed by the family and community she leaves behind, 
and I would like to add her name to our October 23, 2017, Congressional 
Record.
