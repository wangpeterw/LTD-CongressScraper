              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WAYSIDE RESTAURANT

  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my wife, Marcelle, and I thoroughly enjoyed 
reading about the Wayside's 100th anniversary.
  I remember when my sister, Mary, brother, John, and I would go with 
my parents, Howard and Alba Leahy, for a special treat: Sunday after 
church, we would go to the Wayside for lunch.
  I remember my mother speaking Italian with some of the people there, 
but it was particularly special because of the fact that we would see 
everybody we knew from Montpelier and Barre, where my father was born.
  Even today, I hold those memories from when I was a child, and I have 
thought of them every time Marcelle and I have brought our children, 
and now our grandchildren, for lunch at the Wayside. This is one of the 
institutions that makes Vermont the most special place in our country.
  I ask unanimous consent that a press release commemorating the 100th 
anniversary of the Wayside Restaurant be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                            [Feb. 16, 2018]

      2018 Marks Vermont's Wayside Restaurant's 100th Anniversary

       Montpelier.--In 1918, the Allies declared victory in World 
     War 1, Babe Ruth pitched 29\1/3\ scoreless innings for the 
     Red Sox in the World Series, Woodrow Wilson was President, 
     color movies were invented, and Effie Ballou opened the 
     Wayside on the Barre-Montpelier Road.
       Originally just a roadside eatery, the Wayside Restaurant 
     has withstood the test of time and is ready to celebrate its 
     100th Anniversary this year! In an industry where 70 percent 
     of all restaurants fail after 10 years, the Wayside has 
     defied the odds.
       Throughout the year, there will be meal and dessert 
     specials. In July, the actual month the Wayside opened; there 
     will be a Customer Appreciation Party on July 29th from 6:30 
     p.m. to 9:30 p.m. The Wayside Creamery will host a free Ice 
     Cream Social and at sundown all guests will be treated to a 
     special fireworks display! Be sure to save the date.
       For those who want to learn more about the Wayside and its 
     long history go to www.WaysideRestaurant.com. There is also a 
     new book on sale at the restaurant commemorating their 100th 
     Anniversary titled, It's Worth The Ride To The Wayside: 
     Celebrating 100 Years with Anniversary Ale, Yankee Cooking 
     and Ice Cream. And yes, the book includes several of the 
     Wayside's delicious comfort food recipes!
