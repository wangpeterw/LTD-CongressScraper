                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today, Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard 
Sessions spoke in Memphis, Tennessee. I felt like I was listening to 
something out of the fifties or sixties. He put out all the platitudes 
about being tough on crime and locking people up and thinking that was 
going to help solve the crime problem.
  He didn't talk at all about the cost of crime and the Bernie Madoff-
like budget that we have been presented by the Trump administration, 
cutting minority business centers, cutting SNAP funding, cutting LIHEAP 
funding, and cutting opportunities for Medicaid, healthcare, and 
education.
  There are causes to crime that should be attacked. There is a smart 
way to attack crime, and there is a dumb way to attack crime. The dumb 
way is to return to the era where we failed because we locked up so 
many people at $30,000 a year that the only people who are happy about 
his approach are the private prison industry who make money out of 
people's misery and crime.
