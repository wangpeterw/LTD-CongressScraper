11294,topic-id,257,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, small businesses are the backbone of our economy. This is particularly true in my home State of North According to a recent report, North Carolina is the number one State in the country for starting a small business. As such, I will support programs that allow them to flourish.  Today, as vice ranking member of the Small Business Committee, I rise to express my full support for H.2364, the Investing in Main Street  The number one concern raised by small businesses is the lack of access to capital; and because of this access problem, small businesses tend to rely more on personal credit cards, often with higher interest rates, than on more affordable small business loans.  The Investing in Main Street Act helps free up affordable capital, and this bill increases access to capital for small businesses by raising the percentage capital banks and savings associations may invest in small businesses up to 15 percent. With increased opportunity, entrepreneurs will be able to grow and expand their businesses as well as hire more employees, allowing them to reach their full potential.  The Investing in Main Street Act is good for business, it is good for small business, and it is good for our economy.  I want to thank Chairman Chabot and Ranking Member Velazquez and all of my colleagues for supporting this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill as we may continue to give small businesses opportunities to thrive and employ American workers.

Mr.Speaker, the bill before us today, H.1073, authorizes the National Park Service to construct a visitor services facility that includes a restroom at the U.Marine Corps Memorial, also known as the Iwo Jima The memorial is located in Arlington, Virginia, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery, and a short drive from the Pentagon and from here.

The letter is written by Sullivan Ballou to his wife on July 14, 1861.  Sullivan was a major in the Union Army, 32 years old, and about to enter the first battle of Bull A little more than a week later, almost 3,000 Union soldiers had perished, including  Major Sullivan's letter reads as follows: ``My very dear Sarah: The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days--perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write again, I feel impelled to write a few lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more. . . .  ``I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American civilization now leans on the triumph of the government and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and sufferings of the And I am willing--perfectly willing--to lay down all my joys in this life to help maintain this government and to pay that debt. . . .  ``Sarah, my love for you is deathless. It seems to bind me with mighty cables that nothing but omnipotence could break; and yet my love of country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me unresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield. The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them for so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when, God willing, we might still have lived and loved together, and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us.  ``I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me--perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar--that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed.

11342,topic-id,585,"Mr.Speaker, I am going to take a moment to give recognition to a special veteran from my district who is 90 years old and is a World War II veteran, who worked in the U.Navy during World War II and saw many trips across the Pacific Ocean and endured the life of a sailor, sometimes monotonous and sometimes under very perilous circumstances, including at least one attack by kamikazes of his ship and convoy.  I pay special tribute at this time to Wayne Whitlock, who has persevered for many years after service to his country in that great war.  Mr.Speaker, I am also reminded tonight of President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg As President Lincoln looked out on a battlefield that had experienced almost 50,000 casualties, he said: ``The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--that this Nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth.''[[Page H4563]]  Mr.Speaker, very few of us in this Chamber will be remembered long after we leave Washington, D.Almost no one will remember my speech tonight, and it will soon become lost in the Congressional Yet we are here in this body because of the heroic efforts of men and women who have given their lives for this country for over 200 years. We can never forget their sacrifices.  The only reason we can participate in the activities of this Chamber is because of the sacrifices of our Armed Forces, particularly those who have paid the ultimate price. They have nobly defended our freedoms and our way of life up to their last measure of devotion. They left behind fathers, mothers, wives, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, friends, and communities to ensure that future generations walk in the light of liberty.  President Lincoln was resolved that those soldiers shall not have died in vain. They and all the soldiers who have died defending American wars and conflicts still deserve that respect and dignity.  Mr.Speaker, we should govern every day with our heroes in mind. We should strive to make them proud of our speech, our actions, and our commitment to our promises. The American Dream, spirit, and Constitution that they fought for should be our charge.  I would be remiss tonight if I did not mention the loved ones these patriots left behind, who are also patriotic. Countless men, women, and children have watched their American soldiers walk away from home, hoping that they will return safely, unaffected physically, mentally, and emotionally. Sadly, many of those heroes never make it home. Knowing that no words can do justice to their sacrifices, I can only say: Thank you. A grateful nation mourns with your loss.

11448,topic-id,553,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize the distinguished public service career of Cynthia Cindy served the U.Fish and Wildlife Service with distinction and honor for more than 24 years and will leave the Service on August 30, 2017.  Cindy's passion for the outdoors began at an early age while fishing and hunting with her father. These experiences encouraged her to pursue an education to ensure the outdoor way of life she enjoyed would continue to be available for future generations.  She earned a bachelor's degree in marine biology, a master's degree in fisheries and aquaculture, and led a long career protecting fish and wildlife and their habitats.  Cindy worked for a private environmental consulting firm and held positions in several State and Federal agencies before joining the U.Fish and Wildlife Service in 1993. Prior to her time in the Southeast Region, Cindy worked with the Service's Division of Fish Hatcheries and as the branch chief for Recovery and Consultation in Washington, She moved to Atlanta in 1999 to serve as the assistant regional director for Ecological Services and later served as deputy regional director.  For the the last 7 years, Cindy led the Southeast Region in its mission to make a difference for fish, wildlife, plants, and the people who live and work in communities across the region. As regional director, she has provided vision and leadership to more than 1,300 employees in 10 southeastern States, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin Islands and has positively influenced conservation successes and solutions nationally.  In Arkansas and throughout the Southeast, Cindy is recognized as an honest partner and innovative leader. She has worked alongside Arkansas' fish farmers, cattemen, and local elected officials, including the Association of Arkansas Counties, to solve complex conservation challenges in a way that keeps working lands working, reduces regulatory burden, and helps local economies to thrive. Her responsiveness to private-sector concerns and willingness to find creative ways to conserve fish and wildlife resources has made a difference to wildlife and people alike.  Under her leadership, the Southeast Region has joined forces with States, private landowners, the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies, and several sectors of industry and business including energy, timber and finance among others to find creative ways to conserve fish and wildlife resources. This collaboration resulted in notable conservation successes including removing Arkansas Magazine Mountain shagreen snail and the Louisiana black bear from the endangered species list and precluding the need to list more than 100 fish, wildlife, and plants petitioned for Federal protection in the past several years. She and her team worked closely with many partners to restore more than 1 million acres of bottomland hardwood habitat in the South that is critical for migratory waterfowl and other wildlife in decline. Cindy was remarkably effective in large part because she recognized and emphasized the little things while building relationships that often had big implications and made conservation successes possible on larger scales.  I applaud Cindy for her dedication to public service and the lasting difference that she has made at the U.Fish and Wildlife I am hopeful FWS will continue to build on her cooperative conservation legacy. I ask that my colleagues join me in expressing our sincere appreciation and gratitude for her public service and wishing Cindy success and happiness in her future endeavors.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgS4419.txt,1687,FANNIE AND FREDDIE OPEN RECORDS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,27.0,May

As members of the Small Business Committee, we hear day in and day out how access to capital continues to challenge job creation and job growth. We must continue to work in a bipartisan fashion to create an environment for small businesses to flourish and grow.  One resource available to small employers is the Small Business Investment Company program, or the SBIC program, which currently runs on a zero cost subsidy to the American taxpayer.  The program enhances access to capital for small business throughout the Nation by utilizing a private sector-owned and SBA-licensed formula to increase equity capital.  Within the SBIC program, banks and Federal savings associations are limited to the amount of capital or surplus they can invest in an Under current statute, the limit prevents no more than a 5 percent investment.  The legislation we have before us today, H.2364, the Investing in Main Street Act of 2017, increases this investment threshold to 15 percent and requires any investment above the 5 percent mark to be subject to approval by the bank's regulator.

Many Ohioans and Cantonians remember him for his staunch support of Stark County's park system, the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and the Towpath  While many around the Nation will remember Ralph Regula as an important figure on the Appropriations Committee, a role he served in for many, many years, I will remember him as a respected colleague and someone I was proud to call a friend.  Ralph was a soft-spoken, old-school gentleman. By the time I was elected to Congress back in 1994, Ralph Regula was the dean of the Ohio delegation. A few years after Congressman Regula retired, I became the dean of the Ohio Republican delegation, and I tried to model my approach to the role that he set. He set a great example for all of us who serve here in the House because he truly was a gentleman.  Tonight, as we remember our former dean, I hope that we also remember his ability to work across the aisle. Ralph always treated everyone with respect and genuinely listened to the viewpoints of others. He believed that bipartisanship was a virtue and would work tirelessly to find common ground. I think we can all learn from his example.  I would note that Marcy Kaptur, who is one of our more respected Democratic colleagues in the House, is here this evening.

And in seven States, including my home State of Rhode Island, we are still working to recover jobs that were lost in this Great That is why it was so important 2 years later when Congress passed and President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.  This law was a landmark victory for the American people, especially the American consumer. That is why it is so disturbing that Republicans now want to take us back to the days of too big to fail, a time when powerful Wall Street special interests exploited consumers and small investors, and our entire economy was put at risk.  The bill before us today, which I call the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act, will turn Wall Street into the Wild West again and it will empower the big banks to do what they want at the expense of honest, hardworking families. This bill takes us back to an era when financial institutions could wipe out someone's retirement and foreclose on innocent homeowners completely unchecked. This bill repeals commonsense requirements that require financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients. It will allow bad actors to push bad products on working people and seniors in exchange for paybacks.  This bill protects forced arbitration clauses and allows companies to require their customers to waive their right to a jury trial, and deny them their day in court when their rights are violated.  By the way, that includes servicemembers, brave men and women who have worn the uniform of the American Armed Unfortunately, servicemembers and veterans are often targeted for financial fraud and unscrupulous creditors because they are held to a higher standard of debt repayment. In addition, their frequent time away from home makes it harder for our servicemembers to identify scams.  The CFPB has already taken at least 12 major enforcement actions directly protecting servicemembers and their families. In 2016, the CFPB fined Navy Federal Credit Union $28 million for illegal debt collection tactics. The CFPB took action against two for-profit colleges, ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges, both of which have been linked to predatory treatment of servicemembers and veterans. The now-defunct Corinthian was ordered to provide $480 million in debt relief to defrauded students, including servicemembers.  In 2013, the CFPB ordered high-cost, small-dollar lender Cash America to pay up to $14 million in restitution and a $5 million penalty for violations of the Military Lending  Just 2 months ago, CFPB sanctioned an auto lender that harassed and[[Page H4707]]preyed on servicemembers. Security National Automotive Acceptance Company threatened that they would contact commanding officers about debts that our veterans incurred, and lied to our brave men and women in uniform about their obligations, and they have been held accountable because of the  The CFPB was created to protect families and small businesses, and since 2010, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million consumers in all 50 More than 1 million consumers have used the CFPB's complaint database, and nearly all of them have received a timely resolution to their issues.                              {time}  1015  The CFPB held Wells Fargo accountable to the tune of $100 million after they opened millions of fraudulent accounts for customers without telling them. Wells Fargo surreptitiously collected fees from these victims, and every dime was returned to consumers because the CFPB was on the job.  The sole purpose of CFPB's existence is to ensure that bank loans, mortgages, and credit cards are fair, affordable, understandable, and transparent. That is exactly what it is doing. Republicans want nothing more than to kill it.  No honest, hardworking American should be exploited when they are taking out a mortgage, trying to pay off their college debt, buying a car, or opening a bank account, but that is what is going to happen if Republicans get their way today. Passage of this bill will confirm what so many Americans believe: that Washington works for big business, the very rich, and powerful special interests, but not for them.  Let's remind ourselves that the American people sent us to Washington to work for them. They didn't send us here to fight for the big banks and credit card companies that already have too much power here in  Reject this bad bill. Vote for the American people. Protect consumers, and very strongly vote ``no.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-08-pt1-PgH4706-2.txt,2055,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,8.0,April
11457,topic-id,615,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, I rise in support of this bill, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017.  I want to start by thanking the sponsor of this bill, Chairman Chaffetz, for working with the Democratic members of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to address concerns that we raised as well as concerns raised by the Federal Housing Finance The bipartisan cooperation that was demonstrated on this bill should be a model for this body.  This bill would apply the Freedom of Information Act to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac while they are in conservatorship or receivership. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are stockholder-owned, government-sponsored enterprises chartered by Congress to purchase mortgages and pool them into mortgage-backed securities to create liquidity in the mortgage market.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were brought into Federal conservatorship under the control of FHFA in September 2008. According to the CBO, during the financial crisis, Treasury purchased $187 billion of senior preferred stock from the two entities to ensure that they could continue to operate. Neither entity has drawn on Treasury support since 2012, both have returned to profitability, and the dividends they generate are paid to the  There are some practical concerns with the underlying bill because it would apply FOIA to these private companies for the first time. The amendment Chairman Chaffetz will offer addresses some of those concerns, which I will discuss when we consider this amendment.  I would like to discuss some concerns with language that was added in this bill at the Rules Committee to address the estimated cost of the bill.  CBO estimates that this bill would increase the administrative costs of Fannie and Freddie by $310 million, with $10 million of that resulting in direct spending. This bill would address those costs by requiring commercial requesters to pay for processing FOIA requests made to Fannie and This would be a significant change from the way FOIA typically works.  It is unclear how Fannie and Freddie could reasonably estimate how many FOIA requests they would receive or to know how to distribute administrative costs equitably among commercial requesters.  The bill would allow Fannie and Freddie to determine how much they[[Page H2921]]would charge commercial requesters. Whatever cost estimation methodologies Fannie and Freddie choose to use, the methodologies will almost certainly be challenged, potentially leading to litigation, which would be handled by the Department of  It is highly likely that banks would file FOIA requests to obtain information about the business practices and holdings of Fannie and The costs charged to them for their requests would then be passed on to consumers.  I believe this language was intended to be helpful, but it is one result of applying to private companies a statute designed to apply to government agencies. We should carefully analyze this provision and its likely consequences as this bill moves forward in the legislative process. There may be a better way to address this issue.  I also hope that the chairman will continue to seek ways of expanding transparency in government, and that the committee's next step will be to require the disclosure of White House visitor logs.  The White House recently reversed what had been the Obama administration's policy of disclosing the records of who comes and goes from the White The president of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton, said:  ``This new secrecy policy undermines the rule of law and suggests this White House doesn't want to be accountable to the American people.''  I look forward to working with the chairman to address this very troubling reversal of a critical government transparency policy.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

11318,topic-id,345,"Mr.President, I am pleased to introduce, along with the senior Senator from California, . . . ========================= END NOTE =========================   American women have made invaluable contributions to our Country in diverse fields such as government, business, medicine, law, literature, sports, entertainment, the arts, and the military. Telling the history of American women matters, and a museum recognizing these achievements and experiences is long overdue.  In 1999, a Presidential commission on commemorating women in American history concluded that an ``appropriate celebration of women's history in the next millennium should include the designation of a focal point for women's history in our Nation's capital.'' In 2014, Congress took an important step toward realizing this goal when it passed legislation creating an independent, bipartisan Commission to study the potential for establishing such a museum in Washington, Following 18 months of study, the bipartisan Commission unanimously concluded, ``America needs and deserves a physical national museum dedicated to showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in the country.'' Mr.President, I could not agree more.  The bill we are introducing today is the next step toward creating this national museum. Incorporating the recommendations of the bipartisan Commission, the bill would establish a national museum to collect, study, and create programs incorporating and exhibiting a wide spectrum of American women's experiences, contributions, and history. Although the Smithsonian Institution would be the governing body, the bill requires that the construction of the museum be financed entirely with private funds.  Mr.President, nearly 100 years ago, American women won the right to vote after a decades-long fight for suffrage. The story, leaders, and lessons of women's suffrage are among the most powerful in our Nation's history. As the centennial celebration of that historic moment nears, I can think of few better ways to honor those women and that momentous achievement than by passing this legislation. A museum dedicated to women's history would help ensure that future generations understand what we owe to those American women who have helped build, sustain, and advance our society. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgS3860.txt,2121,STRENGTHENING STATE AND LOCAL CYBER CRIME FIGHTING ACT OF 2017,2017.0,29.0,May
11252,topic-id,754,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today also in strong support of 419, the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act, a bill which was just passed by the Senate yesterday.  Each day, public safety officers put their lives on the line for the greater good of those whom they have taken an oath to serve and protect. Unfortunately, for some of these brave men and women, the ultimate sacrifice is made, and they will die while in the line of duty.  The Public Safety Officers' Benefits program, which is administered by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Assistance, was established in 1976 to provide certain benefits to the families of these officers as well as to officers who are disabled as a result of their service.  The death benefit is provided to eligible survivors of public safety officers whose deaths are a direct and proximate result of a traumatic injury sustained in the line of duty or death from certain heart attacks, strokes, and vascular ruptures sustained while on duty.  An education benefit is provided to spouses and children of public safety officers killed or disabled while on duty. The program provides disability benefits to officers catastrophically injured in the line of duty.  Mr.Speaker, I support 419 because it will significantly improve in several respects how benefits claims of fallen and injured officers are processed under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program. To begin with, the bill responds to the fact that, all too often, these officers and their families, after experiencing a loss of life or traumatic injury, must then endure months, sometimes years, of uncertainty and delay concerning their benefit claims.  419 requires the Bureau to give substantial weight to evidence and facts presented by a Federal, State, or local agency when determining eligibility for death or disability benefits. In addition, the measure authorizes the Bureau of Justice Assistance to establish rules based on standards for the Benefits program. These two requirements will help facilitate and expedite the Benefits program claims processed and, thereby, reduce the backlog of families awaiting a decision on their benefit claims.  419 also increases transparency of the Bureau's claims processing. It requires, for example, the Bureau to publish and update a report with information on the status of pending claims regarding death, disability, and educational claims submitted, which will increase transparency.  As we all know, transparency often leads to accountability, and this bill will make the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Department of Justice more accountable to the families of fallen and traumatically injured officers, Congress, and the public as well. By requiring that updates or pending benefit claims be posted on public websites, Congress and the public will be able to evaluate the performance of the Bureau in timely processing pending claims.  Finally, 419 will help ensure that families, who are the ultimate victims of those who sacrifice their lives for our protection, are not deprived of benefits they are due under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program.  We all have a responsibility to take care of surviving family members when a first responder is tragically killed or injured in the line of duty. This bill is a step in the right direction of ensuring that families are not overly burdened and that the public is aware of how the Bureau and the Justice Department are handling claims submitted by family members.  Mr.Speaker, the sacrifice of these first responders should not be taken for granted, and their families should not be unduly burdened when applying for benefits under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program. Accordingly, I support 419. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.Speaker, it is particularly significant to note that 419 is being considered in the midst of National Police Week, a period dedicated to honor our Nation's fallen law enforcement heroes.  President John Kennedy, by proclamation signed in 1962, designated May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which that date falls as National Police  419 memorializes our commitment to public safety officers, who daily risk their lives for us, by removing barriers that prevent beneficiaries under the Benefits program from obtaining the benefits they so justly deserve. Families of our first responders deserve timely consideration of benefit claims when their loved ones give the ultimate sacrifice.  Mr.Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this measure so that it may be sent to the President for signature.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                              {time}  1430  ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgH4248.txt,229,STRENGTHENING STATE AND LOCAL CYBER CRIME FIGHTING ACT OF 2017,2017.0,17.0,May

11316,topic-id,697,"Mr.President, as a father of four and a traveling family, I know how important and challenging it is for nursing mothers to find a space to care for and feed their children. As our society and economy becomes ever more transient, we need to provide spaces for mothers on the go and ease their return to the workforce. Last Congress, I helped ensure the Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Act became law, which eased the burden traveling mothers experienced. We need to continue easing this burden and expand facilities in public buildings.  Federal agencies, under current law, are required to provide space for nursing mothers to pump breastmilk for their newborns. Additionally, General Services Administration requires installation of these spaces for all newly constructed federal buildings, as well as those undergoing modernizations. These rooms are a simple hygienic place, other than a bathroom, that are shielded from view, free from intrusion, contain a chair, a table surface, and an electrical outlet. This is good policy and should be extended to the public when visiting Federal facilities for business or other purposes.  That is why I am introducing the Fairness For Breastfeeding Mothers This legislation would simply extend the use of these facilities in public buildings to visitors, ensuring all mothers can continue to care for their children.  I want to thank Senator Merkley for being the Democrat lead as well as Congresswoman Norton's lead in the House of I ask my Senate colleagues to join us in support of this important legislation.                                1497       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

11497,topic-id,816,"Mr.Speaker, last weekend I had the pleasure of visiting Bridges Academy, a charter school in State Road, North The school was celebrating the decision by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction unanimously to renew its charter for an additional 10 years.  Bridges Academy opened in 1997 as one of the first charter schools in North Established by a local community group, it is overseen by a grassroots, local board of directors. It serves a rural population from surrounding systems in Alleghany, Surry, Wilkes, and Yadkin counties, and Elkin city.[[Page H2779]]  The mission of Bridges Academy is to provide all students with the opportunity to develop an academic foundation that empowers students to reach their full potential. It has focused on students that are struggling in the traditional school setting.  The school is doing great work, especially in regard to serving students with disabilities who, on average, make up 45 percent of the student body. There is a teacher assistant in each class providing accommodations and modifications to all students. End-of-grade proficiency among the subgroup of students with disabilities is in the top 3 percent of the  Bridges Academy is fairly unique for a charter school in that it provides transportation for students in three counties. When nearly 90 percent of the student population is considered economically disadvantaged, the school offers free breakfast and lunch for all students through the Community Eligibility Provision, and a food backpack program is offered to the neediest students each  All lead teachers at Bridges Academy are highly qualified, while 50 percent of the regular education teachers also hold licensure in special education. New leadership in both governing board members and administration several years ago has led to growth in accountability, student population, and campus construction.  We have always known what makes a great school: it is a great principal who attracts great teachers and parental involvement. That is what you see at Bridges Don't take my word for it, though. Listen to this testimonial from a parent who wrote:  ``As the new school year approaches, I wanted to take a moment to write. I can't thank you enough for being there for my daughter.  ``You and the Bridges staff have made such a difference in her life. Before we moved here and found this wonderful school, my daughter was struggling. She was isolated and bullied by her classmates and so depressed that she didn't fit in with the other children because of her emotional and learning disabilities.  ``At Bridges, she was welcomed with open arms and she knows that everyone on staff is working for her best interests. Finding her teacher, who is from our home State, was truly a blessing. She understood that my daughter needed to learn in a different way, and you helped her adjust to our new community.  ``Always remember that you and the school that has done so much for my daughter will continue to have my support.''  The power of an excellent education is truly life-changing. I know because it changed mine. As a child, I attended public school. It was a very poor school, but it provided some very positive experiences. The lessons learned and encouragement provided there have helped me go further in life and achieve more than I ever dreamed.  There are countless stories just like mine. Every day, students take classes, hear lectures, or receive advice that will have long and lasting impacts on their lives. That is why it is so important we continue working to improve K-12 education and ensure all students are able to benefit from those opportunities.  Every student in every school deserves an excellent education, but, unfortunately, we are falling far short of that goal as a nation. Thankfully, innovative charter schools like Bridges Academy are providing thousands of families with new hope and opportunity.  School choice provides real hope to moms and dads, and school choice has provided the students at Bridges Academy with a high-quality education and a greater chance to succeed in life.                              {time}  1230  School choice is a powerful tool to help children succeed, and I am encouraged by the momentum that is building. The challenge we face is extending the promise of school choice to more students and families.  As chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, that is a challenge I take seriously and one I am committed to tackling head-on.  The bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act includes a number of reforms to expand school choice; and across the country, efforts are underway to empower families with more educational options, including charter schools, home schooling, scholarship programs, and education savings accounts.  We must ensure Federal policies support--rather than discourage--innovative school choice and explore additional opportunities to expand the promise of school choice.  I look forward to the work ahead and exploring additional opportunities to provide parents more choices for their children's education.

This is actually etched in the marble at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial here in Washington, D.I think it is instructive as we talk about rural America and what is going on in rural America today, and really across all of  During the height of the Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said these words:  ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.''  During those days of the Depression, rural America was hurting, it was devastated, and many of the programs that we just heard about from our Republican colleagues were put in place at that time.  In 2010, the Congress of the United States, together with President Obama, put in place another program that significantly helped rural Today--in fact, just a couple of hours ago--the United States Senate moved to remove from rural America the pillar of healthcare that has provided millions of those 46 million Americans in rural America with healthcare.                              {time}  1830  Through the expansion of the Medicaid program, the Medi-Cal program in California, many of my constituents in rural America were able to get healthcare for the first time, and they were also able to get insurance because of the cost share reduction program where their insurance premiums on the exchanges were reduced to a level that they could afford.  A significant program for rural America is now in jeopardy as a result of the Congress of the United States passing legislation a couple of months ago that would repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with whole cloth, ripping apart the Medicaid Expansion program so that across this Nation some 16 million Americans would lose their Medicaid coverage immediately, and more beyond that.  So in the initial year, 2018, 10 million Americans, many of them in rural America, would lose their health coverage. Across this Nation in the out-years, by 2025, 24 million Americans would lose their health coverage as a result of the actions of the Republicans here in  Today, just a couple of hours ago, the Senate decided to move forward to make it even worse, to repeal and maybe not even replace, so that 32 million people would lose their coverage if that were to happen. Eighteen million in 2018 and 2019 would lose their health coverage under the program that was proposed by the U.Senate last week.  Unbelievable that, here on the floor, we heard a discussion about rural America and the needs of rural  I am here to tell you, as the son of rural America, I grew up on a ranch 2 miles from a community that had 500 people in it, that had a three-room schoolhouse and just five of us in the eighth grade class. I have raised my children in a community twice as large, a thousand people in rural America, and I know that the people in my community today depend upon the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, for the healthcare coverage that they now have.  In California, over 5 million Californians gained coverage. The uninsured rate dropped by 50 percent, from 18 to just over 9 percent.  Why? Why on Earth would we neglect this, these statements, this moral imperative set down by Franklin Delano It is not what we are going to do for the wealthy.  And keep this in mind, that the legislation that passed this House and repeated over in the Senate would be the largest transfer of wealth of any legislation ever--ever--by the Congress of the United States, transferring more than a trillion dollars from the men and women who have been able to gain coverage in their healthcare.  This is real money taken out of their pockets as these programs disappear because of the repeal and the replacement: a trillion dollars taken from the working men and women and the poor in America and transferred to the wealthy. That is what the legislation did that passed this House; that is what is being considered in the Senate at this moment: a monumental transfer of wealth, the largest transfer of wealth in any single piece of legislation.  How can it be, if this is the test, not what we are doing for the wealthy, not for those who have much, but, rather, for those in rural America and urban America who have so little?  America ought to be upset. America ought to be outraged at what is happening today.  We need to build We need a better We need better jobs. We need better wages. We need better healthcare, better education.  That is what we need, but where is this Congress going? It is going in exactly the opposite direction. It is taking money out of the pockets of Americans, rural and urban and everybody in between, transferring a trillion dollars from their pockets to the superwealthy.  Who are they? Five members, including the President, in the Cabinet of the United States are among the superwealthy, the 400 wealthiest families in They are there in the Cabinet, in the President's office.  What do they stand to gain? A $4 million, $5 million, $6 million, $7 million reduction in their taxes.  What do the working men and women of America stand to gain? Their healthcare is going to be taken away from them, not just in the reduction of the cost sharing, but also in the fact that, as we know it today, the insurance market itself will be so destabilized, so destabilized by the proposed action of the Senate and the House, that it will really enter a death spiral, because the proposed laws allow the healthy to opt out, and those who need insurance would continue to try to get their insurance in an ever-increasing market of people who have high health expenses. That is called a death spiral.  I know this. I was the insurance commissioner in California for 8 years, and we fought all those 8 years, from 1991 until I left that office in 2006, we fought to try to put in place laws that are now in place as a result of The insurance companies cannot discriminate on the basis of preexisting conditions. The fact that you are a woman, the fact that you are older, they cannot discriminate. But the bill that is now being debated in the Senate and will be back here in the House allows for a return to those days of discrimination.  So if you happen to need healthcare, if you happen to have a preexisting condition, if you happen to have high blood pressure, diabetes, or you happen to be 60 years or 50 years of age, you will be hit with a heavy increase in your premiums, perhaps two- to threefold increases. That is what they are promising  We can't let it happen. And interestingly enough, America is pushing back. They say: No more. No more. What we want is better healthcare. We don't want to lose our healthcare policy. What we want is better education. We want you in Congress to work on the education systems, on the skills that my children need, your children need to be able to get a decent job.  Americans want higher wages. They don't want their healthcare ripped away as is happening here. They want us to focus on infrastructure. They want us to focus on the well-paying jobs that occur from infrastructure. Better jobs, better wages, better healthcare, better education--that is where we are going.  And by God, we are going to protect the Affordable Care Act and we are going to stand with We are going to stand with Americans all across this Nation that say: No, we are not going to let it happen.  Mr.Trump, I know that you promised a repeal, but you are wrong, Mr.President, you are wrong.  Mr.Speaker, I pass that message on to the You should not take away from working men and women[[Page H6288]]who, for the first time, are able to get their healthcare and are able to afford the private sector market or are able to get on the Medicaid programs. You should not take it away so that you can give, to the superwealthy, a trillion dollars. It is outrageous.  I need to take a deep breath. I am a bit riled up. I am a bit riled up when I hear my colleagues come in and talk about rural America, where I know, from my experience in my district, there is an opioid epidemic and methamphetamines, and I know that those people are dependent upon the Medicaid program that they intend to rip away.  Calm down, Don't get too excited. Don't get too mad. Take a deep breath and turn it over to my colleague from the East  Congressman Tonko, you and I have been on this floor many times talking about making it in America, about jobs, about making it better for education. Give me a chance to take a deep breath.  ",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgH6286.txt,1973,ESTABLISHING A VISITOR SERVICES FACILITY ON THE ARLINGTON RIDGE TRACT,2017.0,25.0,July

11308,topic-id,477,"I thank Mr.Tonko so very much for his comments. He covered the issues very well.  I want to go to two issues really quickly that need to, I think, be wrapped up here.  First of all, the President talks about the Affordable Care Act dying, and it is not going to make it. That could happen because of actions that he is specifically telling the administration to take.  There are three different areas, one of which is being very late in providing the cost-sharing funding programs for those people who are purchasing insurance. It is discretionary right now. We ought to make that mandatory and not given the President the option of not providing those funds. If those funds are not provided, then, yes, the exchanges will collapse.  Secondly, we know that there is the cross subsidization from one insurance company to another called reinsurance that tries to balance out the risk pool of each individual insurance company. Some insurance companies, for many different reasons, wind up with a very high risk, high cost population. Others are able to have a very low risk. The risk needs to be balanced out between those two. If that is not done, then there will be a death spiral amongst the insurance companies.  Thirdly, under the Affordable Care Act, people are mandated to buy insurance or else pay a penalty. That penalty is enforced by the Internal Revenue Service, which has been specifically given instructions by the President not to enforce the law. That will lead to those young and healthy invincibles not buying insurance because there is no penalty. That will cause the insurance pool to become more risky and, again, start that death spiral that is so much talked about.  The death spiral can be avoided, and the Affordable Care Act is drafted and written in such a way as to avoid it. So my plea to the President is: Use the law. Do not cause the Affordable Care Act to collapse.  Mr.Speaker, please pass on to the President that the President has within his power to maintain the Affordable Care He also has within his power to cause the Affordable Care Act to collapse.  Now, the final point--and help me with this, Mr.Tonko--is that the Democrats have known for 5 years that there are improvements that need to take place within the Affordable Care Act, and we have pleaded with our Republican colleagues to allow those improvements to take place. We have had a deaf ear from our Republican colleagues. So as we go into this possible crisis, let it be known that the Democrats are seeking improvements in a variety of areas. We heard about the drug prices. I know, Mr.Tonko, you were talking in your earlier presentation about some of the improvements that can be made. So jump in here. Interrupt me, if you will.

11322,topic-id,1416,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a good friend who passed away last week: the former Congressman from Ohio, Ralph  Ralph Regula served in this body for 36 years, from 1973 to 2009. He ran in 1972 to replace former Congressman Frank He got on the Appropriations Committee in 1975, and I remember him telling the story of how that happened. When Gerald Ford was in the leadership here in the House, he praised former President Gerald Ford for getting him on the Appropriations Committee, in which he became a cardinal, in all the many years he was on the Appropriations  Some major things that he helped do in his time here in Congress were: he found funding for the Cuyahoga Valley National Park; he formed the Ohio and Erie Canal National Heritage Corridor; and he worked with his wife to create the National First Ladies' Library in  Having had many conversations with him over the years, I know all the work he did to support the National Institutes of Health, medical research, and also National Parks around the country that he so treasured.  Last week, when Congressman Regula passed away, he left his wife, Mary, and three grown children: Martha, Richard, and  Congressman Regula was born December 3, 1924, in Beach City,  From 1944 to 1946, he served in the United States He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Mount Union in 1948, where The Ralph and Mary Regula Center of Public Service and Civic Engagement is housed.  He earned his law degree in 1952, and went to law school at night while working as a teacher.                              {time}  1930  He also served on the Ohio State Board of Education from 1960 to 1964. He served in the Ohio senate. He was elected in 1966, and he served in the Ohio house one term when he was elected in 1964.  During his time in the State house, he created the Northeast Ohio Medical University complex and Stark State College, which is paying many dividends to the residents of northeast  Ralph was a good friend, and he always made sure that the staff knew that constituents came first. He even had a lapel pin button made up to remind his staff. He truly did. So my little memento that I remember was when I came here in the early 1980s, representing as a farmer in the Ohio Farm Bureau, we had an appointment at that time, and Ralph was my Ralph was a farmer, too, and loved his beef cattle. He was an early riser. We had an early meeting well before 8 a.m. Another county Farm Bureau president from Wayne County and I got there in his office, Steve Grimes, and Ralph Regula said to us: Did you guys eat breakfast yet?  We said:  He said: Come with me.  I guess he took us down to the Members' dining room. I remember this because I brought this picture. How I got this picture was one of the agricultural media reporters tagged along and took this picture. It was in one of the local agricultural papers back in My parents were so proud of the fact that our Congressman--my Congressman--would meet with us and take us to breakfast in the Capitol that they called the paper and got the print, and they framed it.  A few years ago, I had the privilege to speak at the McKinley Day Dinner in Stark County when I was redistricted in that area. Ralph and Mary were there. I brought this picture and passed it around to show them. Of course, this picture is 33 years old. What is really neat about it is we both had brown hair. I remember Ralph and Mary got a big kick out of that.  Another time that I remember that was really a treasure is he had Senator Thad Cochran come to his house one weekend, and he invited all the agricultural leaders from the district to have breakfast there one Saturday morning. I remember that quite well as a great experience.  A lot people said that Ralph Regula cared. He really did care. He really cared about the constituents he represented. He was a true public servant.  Another issue is he had a relationship at the time with President They hit it off really good because they got talking about their farms. Of course, Ralph Regula had a beef cattle farm outside of Navarre, Ohio, in Stark They were talking about how to build fence. Ralph used to tell that story, and you can tell that he held that dear to him.  I first met Congressman Regula in 1974. He was the commencement speaker at the first graduating class which I was in at the Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute in Wooster, and Ralph was a fairly new Congressman at the time. But he came and spoke. I remember that. That was my first chance to get to know Congressman Regula at the time.  I do have here some notes from his former staff. I just want to read them because I think words say a lot. Ralph left an impression not just on his constituents but also on his staff.  Susan Ross, who worked for Congressman Regula, offered some insight and stories about  Ralph's motto was ``Constituents First,'' according to One day, Ralph got a frantic call from a woman whose daughter was gravely ill in She needed help immediately, as she didn't have a passport and couldn't find her birth certificate. By the next day, she was on her way to Mexico to help her daughter return to the U.Ralph made sure that his constituent could get a copy of her birth certificate and called the State Department to get her a passport within just a few hours. Considering the bureaucracy of government, this is a minor miracle. That is how committed he was to the people of  Ralph would go out of his way to help people. Ralph had a red pickup truck, and after the September 11 attack in 2001, he drove it home with the luggage of several constituents who were stranded here because of the attacks and no way to rent a car and obviously the planes were not flying.  A former schoolteacher himself, he would say to the teachers: The lower the grade, the more you should be paid; and when you look out at your class, you have 30 little mirrors looking back at you.  Susan wrote: We are so grateful for the chance to work alongside and learn from this giant of a man. His accomplishments are legendary, and his legacy can be seen across all of It was an honor and privilege to call him our boss.  When former staff members say those kinds of things about their former boss, that says a lot.  I had the privilege to know Ralph for three decades. Two of those decades he was my Congressman, and then the last decade he wasn't because of redistricting. I had a different Congressman and a different congressional district. Then 4 or 5 years ago now, redistricting, they moved me into the Stark County, Ohio, area, and Ralph became a constituent of mine. There were a few times here a few years ago that Ralph came in and visited me in the office, and we had some great conversations.  It seemed a little strange because I can remember, in the 1980s and the 1990s, I would be visiting Ralph here in the Rayburn Building for pork producers in the Farm Bureau talking about agricultural policy and talking to another farmer who is also a Congressman, too. Those are fond memories that I will treasure for the rest of my life.  I think that we are so glad that so many are standing out here tonight to pay tribute to Congressman Ralph Regula because he was a true public servant and loved his constituents, loved Stark County, Ohio, and loved his farm. So it is a privilege to make a few remarks tonight to pay tribute to him for his 36 years of service in this Chamber and this body and all the service he did throughout his life to help the people of Stark County, Ohio, the 16th Congressional District in the State of Ohio, and the United  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.Tiberi) who is from the[[Page H6294]]Columbia area and who served some of the time here when Congressman Regula was here.

11251,topic-id,428,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, in 1976 Congress passed and the President signed into law the Public Safety Officers' Benefits The act was designed to offer peace of mind to men and women seeking careers as public safety officers, namely, that if something happened to them in their dangerous roles, their families would have support.  It shows that America places enormous value on those in our communities who protect and serve, those whose response to danger is to face it head-on and who put others before themselves daily.  The PSOB program, administered by the Department of Justice, provides death benefits in the form of a one-time financial payment to eligible survivors of public safety officers who have died in the line of duty.  The program also provides benefits to public safety officers who are permanently and totally disabled because of injuries sustained in the line of duty.  Finally, the PSOB program provides financial assistance to help pay higher education costs for the spouses and children of public safety officers who have died or been injured in the line of duty.[[Page H4250]]  It is a program that is meant to help the loved ones of fallen officers move forward in the aftermath of tragedies.  Unfortunately, in recent years, the PSOB program has had some incidents of delay, and some families were left in the dark about the status of applications. These families were unable to move forward after their tragic losses, and we recognize that is not acceptable for a family that has sacrificed so much for their communities.  Legislation was introduced in the last Congress, and again this Congress as 419, to address these regrettable failings. This bill provides for transparency in the processing of claims in the PSOB program and codifies measures to ensure the system is streamlined and operates in a fair manner.  Mr.Speaker, I commend my colleagues for their work and strong support of these law enforcement families. I would especially like to commend the gentleman from New York (Mr.King) for his unwavering support of the families of law enforcement.  In his second inaugural address, President Lincoln reminded the American people: ``To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.'' This legislation is designed to do exactly that for the brave men and women in blue who protect and serve all of us every day.  Mr.Speaker, yesterday this bill passed the Senate unanimously. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation today.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgH4248.txt,446,MEMORIAL DAY,2017.0,17.0,May

11431,topic-id,821,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the National Computer Forensics Institute serves a vital purpose in preparing State and local law enforcement to combat computer and cybercrime.  Last Congress, the House passed this legislation by voice vote under suspension of the rules. I am pleased to support this legislation once again, and I am confident that this bill will once again receive bipartisan support.  The United States Department of Justice has declared that cybercrime is one of the greatest threats facing our country and that it has enormous implications for our national security, economic prosperity, and public safety. We have seen this just in the past few days after cyber vulnerabilities led to widespread computer disruptions around the world.  With this in mind, the National Computer Forensics Institute serves the vital purpose of providing legal and judicial professionals a free, comprehensive education on current cybercrime trends, investigative methods, and prosecutorial and judicial challenges.  The National Computer Forensics Institute is a 32,000-square-foot facility located in Hoover, The institute boasts three multipurpose classrooms, two network investigations classrooms, a mock courtroom, and a forensics lab.  The special agents of the United States Secret Service staff the institute and work diligently training attendees in modern counter-cybercrime procedures and evidence collection.  When the attendees leave, they take with them the critical knowledge and equipment required to conduct autonomous and thorough cybercrime investigations at their home agencies.  Since its creation in 2008, the institute has earned praise for its work in preparing America's local law enforcement in how to deal with these important technology issues.  Over the last 7 years, the institute has instructed law enforcement professionals from every State in the country and from over 500 different law enforcement agencies.  In fact, law enforcement in my own district has benefited from NCFI training, including Lynchburg Commonwealth Attorney Mike Doucette and his staff.  Each professional educated at the institute is a force multiplier for the Secret The institute itself is a force multiplier for other law enforcement cyber forensic efforts, complementing vital training offered by entities like the National White Collar Crime Center, otherwise known as After successful completion of the NCFI and the NW3C programs, the students can bring their new knowledge back to their local agency to inform their colleagues how to properly conduct computer forensic investigations.  Mr.Speaker, I firmly believe that for our Nation to successfully combat the cybercrime threat, we must support legislation such as H.1616.  I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Ratcliffe), a member of the Judiciary Committee, for sponsoring this important legislation.  Authorizing the existing National Computer Forensics Institute in Federal law will cement its position as a high-tech cybercrime training facility and will help law enforcement professionals nationwide in their efforts to combat cyber-related crimes.

11264,topic-id,717,"Mr.President, I would like to take the opportunity to submit to the Record of the U.Senate a statement to celebrate the career of public service of Lynne Corn, offer my heartfelt congratulations on the occasion of her retirement from the Congressional Research Service, and wish her happiness and prosperity in the next chapter of her life.  For over three decades, Corn dedicated the better portion of her professional career to serving the Congress of the United States from within the halls of the Library of As a specialist in the study of natural resources, Federal land management, earth sciences, agriculture, and endangered, species recovery, she has guided and informed the decisionmaking of countless Members of Congress and Senators, and their staffs, on the major, related issues of her time.  As a Senator representing the State of Utah and as a Westerner, her policy acumen has on countless occasions aided legislative efforts that have had a substantial impact on my constituency. She has served as an invaluable guide in the drafting of legislation and helped inform some of the most difficult votes I have cast, and I can say without question that she has helped guide the process of passing some of the most difficult pieces of legislation into law. As well, as some of my most senior staff can attest, she leaves her position with a reputation of being among the most informed and insightful research and policy advisors on Capitol  Let the record show that Corn began working at the Congressional Research Service in 1985, after having served for almost 6 years in a congressional office, including as an AAAS--American Association for the Advancement of Science--congressional science fellow from 1979 to 1980. Corn came to Capitol Hill after sharing her enthusiasm for the ecology of all types of animals and plants with students at Middlebury College, VT; Stockton State College, NJ; and Arizona State  Corn adeptly transitioned from pedagogy to informing congressional deliberations on policy development, especially related to the Endangered Species Although her doctoral research at Harvard University was related to a tropical ant species, Congress put her biological expertise to work researching and writing on the Pacific Northwest's spotted owl and the species and habitat of the Arctic National Wildlife Corn also became an expert in various conservation related trust funds, as well as the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, which is critical to the rural inhabitants of my home state of Corn excelled in the use of visual aids, such as maps, to explain complex issues to congressional audiences.  But the work of a congressional researcher can sometimes be more light-hearted. I will share one incident, as it has been told to me, when it was the staff that provided the visual aid. Corn was asked to come to a Senate office to identify a dead snake coiled in a coffee tin. Upon examination, she identified the snake, a corn snake, just as the Senator walked into the office. As a country-raised man, he knew well the species that was native to his region, and a memorable conversation with the Senator followed, about the quiddities of that particular species, which both the Senator and Corn[[Page S3606]]had caught on multiple occasions. When I learned of this incident, it struck me uniquely because, as it turns out, this incident occurred in the office of a former President Pro Tempore of the Senate, Senator Robert I can say that those are the types of moments that make our jobs worthwhile.  I will conclude with what is perhaps most important: Corn has served her country and worked with her colleagues in Congress with a unique charisma that has so often breathed life into the absolutely critical, but sometimes tedious task of researching policy decisions and legislation. By way of an example, there is something revealing about the word ``critters''--which she so often used--that reflects not only the authentic passion that she held for her subject area, but also her flare for artfully transforming arcane concepts into digestible and actionable information, which is a distinguished trait that Members of Congress so appreciably rely upon.  Again I reiterate my gratitude for Corn's service, and I wish her a blessed and relaxing future, with her dearly beloved dogs, as she departs from her career in the Congressional Research                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-19-pt1-PgS3605-2.txt,1351,INVESTING IN MAIN STREET ACT OF 2017,2017.0,19.0,July

Over the past four decades, we have seen the waste and largess exhibited by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac embedded in their everyday operations. And while they got their start during the height of the Depression and performed an able task of setting high standards for the liquidity for mortgage credit, they have long outlived their original charter.  Oakley Hunter, the president and chairman of Fannie Mae back in the 1970s, described Fannie Mae as the world's largest floating crap game. Nothing has changed.                              {time}  1430  In the early 1980s, we found Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dominating, as they do today, 9 out of 10 mortgages in the United States, and yet they were highly unprofitable and highly suspect in their management. During that time, Senator William Proxmire led the charge in the United States Senate seeking answers about the enterprises' executive compensation.  Flash-forward to the 1990s, we saw executive compensation at Fannie Mae run amok.  During the 2000s, their imprudence and desire for growth paved the way for the U.housing crisis and global economic collapse.  More recently, we have discovered that Fannie Mae is spending $171 million in taxpayer funds on a new Taj Mahal office in Washington, D.C., to replace their already extraordinarily luxurious campus on Wisconsin Avenue, which one Washingtonian, Mr.Chairman, described as what Versailles would look like if Louis XIV had any money. According to the inspector general's report from last June, this 15-year cost of relocating Fannie Mae's headquarters and the construction of the new building now topped $770 million.

11383,topic-id,3798,"Mr.President, there has been a lot of discussion in the media over the last couple of weeks about what President Trump is going to do and should do with the Paris climate agreement. We know all about this agreement. It was entered into by President Obama in December of 2015 at the U.annual party that they hold, the 21st annual Conference of Parties meeting.  Let me explain what this is. It was 21 years ago they decided--the United Nations had always been quite offended every time something happened that they were doing in the United Nations that was not in the best interest of the United Several of us would call and threaten to withhold some of our funds supporting the United Of course, the United Nations has always wanted to be independent. They wanted to not be accountable to anyone so consequently they put together these parties. The best way for them to do that is if they could somehow be funded independently and not be accountable to the various countries--not just the United States but any of the rest of them.  So they hold this meeting in December of every year, and they hold it in very exotic places. Everybody gets really excited. They have 192 countries come in. What they are trying to do is get them all to limit their CO2 emissions. Of course, they all come in because 99 percent of the 192 countries are ones who want to get money out of this deal. I ran into a friend of mine from Benin, West This was several years ago. I said: Why are you here? You are not really going to agree with this stuff. He said: No, this is where the money is. This is the biggest party of the year.  One of the worst things that ever happened at their big party was--they headed to South America someplace, I don't remember where--when they ran out of caviar. They have these big meetings every year.  Well, the last one I went to was December 2009. It was in You might remember that was just after President Obama was elected. He and his administration were pledging to the 192 countries that we were going to pass a form of cap and trade. Well, they all went to Copenhagen--Nancy Pelosi, Hillary, John Kerry, Barack Obama--they all went there and told them we were going to pass cap and trade here in the United States so they all needed to follow form. This is interesting because of the 192 countries he was talking to, most of them didn't even know our form of government. They didn't know that we had a Senate that had to confirm these things or that we even had a legislature. They assumed that was going to happen.  I remember, right after they left, I went to I had to go in the morning and get back in time for votes all in 1 day. I did that. At that time, they termed me as the ``one-man truth squad.'' I told them under no circumstances--this is 2009--were we going to pass any kind of cap and trade in this country. I was right. They were shocked over there because they assumed if the President said we are going to do it, that we are going to do it. The legislation was estimated at that time to cost between $300 and $400 billion--that is per year--to implement. It never came to a vote because the Democrats knew they had at that time--keep in mind this is 2009--they had control of the White House, they had control of the House and Senate, and they had, at that time, 60 votes in the Senate, but they couldn't get the votes because it was too expensive.  So many people thought it was the first time we would consider cap and trade, but it wasn't. We had been working on that for years. They first tried it in 2003. In 2003, we had a bill for the U.I remember being down here--because at that time I was chairman of the Subcommittee on the Environment and Public They had that jurisdiction. So I was down here to try to make sure that thing wasn't going to pass. Sure enough, it didn't. We defeated it, 43 to 55. Then the same group tried it again in 2005. At that time, they only got 38 votes, and that failed. Then, in 2008, Senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman tried it again. Of course, at that time, it failed again. Now, that is a far cry from the 60 votes necessary in order to get something like that to pass. We have been looking at that with various forms of legislation for quite a number of years.  After suffering those embarrassing defeats in the Senate, President Obama[[Page S3197]]sought to do by regulation what he couldn't do through legislation. That is how we got the Clean Power I think it is important to think back where we got to this point. There has also been an implementation cost, by their own admission, some $300 billion a year, and it made it impossible at that time for us in the United States to build a new coal-fired powerplant.  It is interesting. Some people say: Why do you go back so often to Oklahoma? I said: Well, I like to talk to real people. I can remember being at Shattuck, I bet the Chair doesn't know where Shattuck is. It is in Western  A guy said: Now, explain this to me.  This was actually during the Obama administration.  He said: If we in the United States are dependent upon fossil fuels--that is, coal, oil and gas, and nuclear--to produce 89 percent of the power it takes to run this machine called America, and if President Obama is successful in doing away with coal, oil and gas, and nuclear, then how do we run this machine called America?  For that reason, the President decided he was going to do this with regulations.  I ask unanimous consent that this list of all of the regulations--47 of them--we have been able to do away with in the first 100 days be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  A few weeks ago, he signed an Executive order instructing the EPA to unwind the United States from this regulation. That is exactly what my friend, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, is working to accomplish right now.  While the President has disavowed the Paris Agreement, he has not pulled out as of this time. He has been kind of busy doing other things.  I understand there are a lot of competing voices on this front. Many people don't believe the Paris Agreement is binding. While that is true, to a certain degree, it is kind of shortsighted.  I am speaking today because I believe the President should make a clean exit from the Paris Agreement and avoid a lot of confusion. There are two key reasons I want to do that.  The first one, reason 1, is that if we remain in the agreement, we are putting ourselves at significant litigation risk.  The Paris Agreement commits the United States to lowering its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025. This is interesting because in the Paris Agreement that took place, the President at that time, President Obama, was getting just a little bit panicky. He had already gone to seven of these and had been unable to pass any kind of an agreement that would accomplish his goal of putting coal, oil, and gas out of existence. So this agreement that he made, he made unilaterally, saying: I agree on behalf of the United States of America that we will reduce our emissions of CO2 by between 26 and 28 percent by 2025.  Well, we all know that the environmental community wants to do whatever it possibly can to regulate carbon. There is a reason for this. You might wonder why this is. There is a professor named Richard Richard Lindzen is a professor at MIT and is one of the top professors in this discipline. He said: If you control carbon, you control life.  It makes it a bureaucrat's dream. So yes, in fact, that is what he was trying to do. That is all they want. So if we stay in the Paris Agreement, environmentalist groups--radical groups--would be able to sue the EPA to force it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under section 115 of the Clean Air Section 115 of the Clean Air Act is entitled ``International Air Pollution.'' This section is triggered when a country asserts that our pollution is harming them, establishing an endangerment finding, and when there is a reciprocal agreement between our countries and those countries that have such a regulation.  It is not difficult to imagine that if we remain in the Paris Agreement, the environmentalists, NGOs, led by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Sierra Club, and others, will file lawsuits against the EPA as it takes legal steps to deregulate the Clean Power  While there has not been an internal endangerment finding, the environmentalists would be working to force the issue. Further, they would make the case that the reciprocal requirements of section 115 of the Clean Air Act are met by the Paris climate agreement. Even though it is not binding at the international level, the environmentalists could, with a sympathetic judge, make a case that the administration has made the reciprocal agreement by staying in It would sound good. It is not too hard to find a sympathetic judge nowadays. This is something they have been planning to do all along. They built this back door into the agreement as the Obama administration was actually writing it.  You ask, why would certain lawsuits be filed? A former general counsel at the Sierra Club, David Bookbinder, said that section 115 of the Clean Air Act is--these are his words--``the silver bullet de jour of the enviros, and they are dead serious about this,'' meaning that they believe the Paris Agreement clearly states that it meets the reciprocity test established by section 115 of the Clean Air  If you have noticed, the environmental groups have been very silent about whether the administration should stay in the agreement. We all know they want us to stay in the agreement, but why be so quiet at this time? Because we have not heard from them. Well, the reason is, I think the environmental groups who are trying to accomplish this see that there is real progress being made to convince the President to stay in the Paris Agreement, which means they could have their wish of greenhouse gas regulations. If we stay in the agreement, they could sue the EPA and force regulations under section 115. So they have been very quiet. They don't want President Trump to know they will also benefit if we stay in the agreement. Because of this, they are allowing people to believe that nothing will happen by staying in the agreement. I have heard this from Republicans and  It really does not make too much difference, because for ratification, the votes are not there, and everybody knows it. In the meantime, you are subject to the lawsuits. So they just don't want us to know it as well. Could it be that a Republican President would give them the tools they need to force greenhouse gas regulations even without meaning to? It is a possibility. This is why the President needs to make a clean exit from the agreement.  If the President stays in the Paris agreement, he will be putting at risk our ability to accomplish his campaign goals; namely, ending the war on fossil fuels and rescinding the Clean Power He has already taken the Executive steps he needs on this front. The EPA is currently on solid legal footing. But we must not limit the effectiveness of these key steps by remaining in the Paris  So that is reason 1. Reason 1 is that if we remain in the agreement, we are subjecting ourselves to all of the lawsuits that will be out there.  The other reason, the second reason I will mention, is that even if we pull out of the agreement, we will still have a seat at the table.  I have heard the statement quite often, in fact, by some people in the Trump administration--they say: We don't want to pull out of it because we want to maintain a seat at the table. As they have these meetings every December, we want to be there so we can express what America really is planning to do and is not planning to do.  But let's keep in mind that the seat at the table was established way back in 1992. That was when they had the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the This is the 1992 treaty that supports all the big parties that meet every December that are held in the exotic locations I mentioned. That group was the foundation of the Paris Agreement and the foundation of the Copenhagen discussion in 2009.  Now, 2009 is when they had the event in That is the one where all the people went and told them that we were going to pass cap and trade, which we were not going to pass cap and trade, and we didn't. Further, it was the foundation of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, which was the first agreement that sought to set binding international greenhouse regulations.  The Senate demonstrated its intent to defeat that with the Byrd-Hagel resolution. Let's remember what that was. The Berg-Hagel resolution--by[[Page S3198]]Senators Byrd and Hagel--was right here in this They said they were going to oppose the ratification of any treaty that does one of two things--either it is harmful economically to the United States of America, or that countries that are developing countries, such as China, are not a part of it.  Well, that was the case. So the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 was a natural follow-on from that decision that was made. So even if President Trump removes the United States as a signatory to the Paris Agreement, we will continue to have a seat at the table and the President will have the ability to negotiate further deals. That is already done. That was the done, and it is inescapable. It was done back in 1992. We have been a party to that protocol. We have been ever since then and we will continue to be regardless of whether the President pulls out of the Paris  In the event the President does decide to stay in the Paris Agreement, he will need the Senate for ratification because the Paris Agreement meets seven out of eight criteria established by the State Department to determine what constitutes a treaty. An agreement need meet only one of these, and this meets seven. So it would have to come in for ratification. If the President does not exit, the Paris Agreement will be considered as a treaty.  It is in the best interests of the Nation and the President's agenda to make a clean exit from this agreement. That is why we sent a letter, which was sent out this morning by about 25 Members of the Senate, encouraging the President to pull out of the agreement. It is the best way to get everything he wants: a complete end to the war on fossil fuels--which has been ongoing since the day Barrack Obama went into power--without the risk of any further future litigation mandating that the EPA establish new greenhouse gas regulations, and a decent seat at the table for the United States, which we all agree that we want. If for some reason he decides not to withdraw, he will have to submit it to the Senate as a treaty, and it would be defeated.  Let me mention two other things which I think are important and which I want to include in the Record at this time.  You know, we have been talking about the Paris The far left has been trying to get a forum of cap and trade ever since Kyoto in 1997. They have tried to do it through legislation, tried over and over again, as I mentioned. They could not do it, so they tried to do it through regulation.  You might wonder, what was it way back in the beginning--what were the motives for this in the very first place? I carry this. I think it is very important to realize what people were saying about it.  The former Minister of the European Union--her name was Margot She said: ``Kyoto is about the economy, about leveling the playing field for big business worldwide.''  Then along came Jacques He said during a speech at the Hague in November of 2000 that Kyoto represents ``the first component of an authentic global governance.''  Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper once dismissed UN's Kyoto Protocol as a ``socialist scheme.''  Then Christiana Figueres, who was actually at Paris at the time this thing was put together, said that ``the real goal is to change the economic development model for redistribution of wealth among nations.''  Those are some of the original comments people have forgotten about.  The last thing I will mention, because I think it is significant, is that I remember going to At that time, the person who was the head of the EPA--an appointment by the President at that time--was Lisa Lisa Jackson--actually, we became pretty good friends at that time. She had one problem: She had a hard time saying things that were not true. I asked her a question right before we left. I said: I have a feeling that once I leave town, once I go to Copenhagen, you are going to come up with an endangerment finding.  This was live on the record, by the way, in the committee I was chairing. She kind of smiled, so I knew it was true.  I said: Now, if you come up with an endangerment finding, it has to be based on science. What science would you rely on?  She said: Well, on the  That is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Now, I wouldn't say as luck would have it, but it is kind of coincidental that right after she made that statement was when the big scandal that was referred to as ``Climategate'' came along. They discovered that the scientists who were with IPCC were not getting the results they wanted. So they rigged the science, and they were caught doing it with emails. So there wasn't any question as to what they were trying to do. So that totally diffused the effectiveness and the legitimacy of the  In fact, Christopher Booker of the UK Telegraph said: ``This is the worst scientific scandal of our generation.''  So when people keep saying that science is settled, that is where it all came from--the  Clive Crook of the Financial Times said:       The closed-mindedness of these supposed men of science,      their willingness to go to any length to defend a      preconceived message, is surprising even to me. The stink of      intellectual corruption is overpowering.  Well, I assumed at the time that that would end their providing the science and justification for passing what would have been the largest tax increase in the history of this country.  So, anyway, back to the issue here, several of us feel that to avoid all of this from happening, the best way to do it is to have this President, when he gets back from his trip, do what he campaigned on and pull out of the Paris Agreement, and I anticipate that he will do that.

It is a pleasure to be with them tonight, and also Congresswoman Michelle Lujan She really has been such a leader, not just for New Mexico, but for the whole issue of health across our country. I am really pleased to join all of them.  And I will just say, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, the American people should know, this past week we tried very hard to pass an amendment that would simply ask the executive branch to report back to us on how much money we were spending as a country in Medicare, Medicaid, at the VA, the Department of Defense, for certain classes of drugs in our country.[[Page H6290]]  Now, don't you think it would be right for us to know, since we are spending tax dollars, that if we are spending more money on, let's say, a diabetic medicine than a heart medicine, whatever medicine it is, it would be good for us to do cost accounting to go back and look at what we are paying?  Do you know we were not able to get that simple reporting-back amendment on how much pharmaceuticals are costing the people of the United States, because the Republican members of our committee blocked it.                              {time}  1900  ",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgH6286.txt,616,ESTABLISHING A VISITOR SERVICES FACILITY ON THE ARLINGTON RIDGE TRACT,2017.0,25.0,July
11306,topic-id,1176,"They voted ``no.'' They don't want to know how much the American people are spending through their tax dollars at the Federal level because the goal is to figure out how this money was being spent and to hold those companies responsible to look at what costs were over time and so forth.  It is amazing and it is really wrong what the pharmaceutical industry is doing to the people of this country. They are killing people. People cannot afford the medicine that they need.  Yesterday, and I give this as homework, in The New York Times, there was a great story titled, ``When Health Law Isn't Enough, the Desperate Line Up at Tents.'' It was written by what must be a brilliant young reporter named Trip Gabriel, and it reported about a charity group in our country called the Remote Area Medical They were in Wise, Virginia, somewhere south of here.  What it is is a group of charitable citizens who are in optometry. They are doctors. They are dentists. They donate their time over a weekend, and they go to places in our country that don't have medical care.  So no American should assume that everybody has care and that everybody has insurance, even with the current system.  I will tell you, if you want your eyes opened, read that story.  Over one weekend, over 2,000 people came. There were people there who were diabetic who had no medication. One woman, they reported in the story, came with a dispenser for insulin, but the needle was broken. Her glucose reading was over 500.  They talked about people who were there for glasses. They couldn't afford glasses. One woman was diagnosed with vision of 20/100 in one eye, and they were looking for glasses that would fit her.  They had a gentleman who was coughing, and he thought he had black lung disease. It turned out what he really had was sleep apnea. Finally somebody diagnosed what his problem was.  They start out with the story about a gentleman who showed up at that event, and he took them to the trunk of his car and showed them the pliers he was using to rip out his teeth because he had so many decayed teeth and he hadn't been to the dentist in years. They had dentists. They had all kinds of physicians. They had nurses trying to help people.  I read that article and I thought: This is America? This is America?  Here are just the first few sentences, if I might. It says: ``Anthony Marino, 54, reached into his car trunk to show a pair of needle-nosed pliers like the ones he used to yank out a rotting tooth.  ``Shirley Akers, 58, clutched a list of 20 medications she takes, before settling down to a sleepless night in the cab of a pickup truck.  ``Robin Neal, 40, tried to inject herself with a used-up insulin pen, but it broke, and her blood sugar began to skyrocket.  ``As the sun set in the mountains of southwest Virginia, hundreds of hurting souls were camped out or huddled in vehicles, eager for an early place in line when the gates swung open at 5 a.m. for the Nation's largest pop-up free clinic.''  That free clinic is called the Remote Area Medical I just read that. There were several photos in the paper. This is  So, for the Senate, particularly the leader of Senate who comes from Kentucky, a State that is noted to have very poor medical care, where there are large rural areas where many people, including those who are single who get none of this coverage--right? The single are especially discriminated against--how that could be pushed forward by someone from the State of Kentucky, I simply don't understand it.  And here in this House, where we tried so hard to save the Affordable Care Act and to make necessary changes to it, a lot of those changes are needed in these rural States that don't have enough people to really set up a large enough exchange. We need to lump two or three States together so you get a pool that is insurable. We know how to fix this. But we don't need to take more people off health insurance, millions and millions and millions, because we have millions who still are uninsured, and we have industries like the pharmaceutical industry fighting us against trying to get affordable medications to our constituents.  I want to thank you for being here tonight and for fighting the good fight for the American people. Really, to have almost a trillion dollars of money given away over the next 10, 15 years to the wealthiest people in our country? You know what? They have doctors. They can afford insurance. Frankly, they don't need more money. They might benefit by a little less money, actually. Their heirs certainly would. We need a little rigor out there, even among the wealthy in our country, to help us to heal this Nation and to deal with its real medical problems.  I will just say this. We were checking today on the diabetic costs across our country. One facility in Ohio, just one veterans facility, over 30,000 veterans in that facility have been diagnosed with diabetes. Many, many of those veterans go for the treatment of dialysis in order to help them to deal with their condition. For 1 year, that treatment costs $100,000. Over a 10-year period, it costs $1 million per person who goes through dialysis.  Imagine if we were able to prescribe food as medicine, which hospitals are doing in many places, and help people learn how to not become so severely diabetic. We would save so much money across this country, including with our veterans. And more important than money, we would save their lives. We would save the amputations. We would save all of the costs that diabetes incurs over the years. So people would learn how to be healthier.  I want to thank you for being here. I am proud of you two gentlemen, Congressman Garamendi and Congressman You are honorable gentlemen. You have come here from both ends of the country, New York and We are here tonight because we know what the American people want. They want affordable healthcare. They want affordable medicine. They are willing to do their part, and nobody should be left out.  We can find that answer as the United States of We don't have to accept this set of death panels that they are figuring out over there in the Senate: who is going to die, who is not going to have health insurance, who is going to be shortchanged. Because when that wheel of fortune turns, you never know who in your family is going to get sick. You simply don't know, and no one should be without coverage.  I thank you for being here on the floor tonight and for doing what the American people expect us to do, and that is to defend and protect them.

I thank Congressman Chabot for his kind words and all the Members who have come to pay tribute to our beloved colleague, Ralph  Mr.Speaker, I rise tonight to honor my late friend and respected colleague who served 18 terms and was a gentleman farmer, the very Honorable Congressman Ralph Regula of Ralph passed away earlier this month in Bethlehem Township, He was 92.  To his beloved wife, Mary, for whom we all hold deep affection, and their family--Martha, Richard, David, and their children--please let me extend heartfelt sympathy and deepest affection.  I had the privilege of serving with Ralph for 26 years, many of those on the Appropriations  As others have mentioned, Ralph Straus Regula was born in Beach City, Ohio, on December 3, 1924, right before the Great  In 1948, he graduated from Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio, and went on to receive a degree in law as a night student from William McKinley School of Law in Canton, and then went on to serve in the United States Navy during World War  Some of my memories of Ralph include him pulling into the congressional garage on so many occasions in his spiffy red pickup truck, always thinking about what was happening back in Ohio on his farm. That truck had many purposes.  So many evenings we were in the same building and I could see him walking down the hall with Mary, his wife, well after 9 p.m. in the evening after having put in a very long day here in  The press never reports about the Members who are dutiful and do their work. They generally focus on those who run into a little bit of trouble or get into a fracas, but Ralph Regula was the type of citizen who holds this Republic together.  He was first elected in 1972 and was a longstanding, prominent figure in our body, serving 36 years in the House by the time of his retirement. At the time he retired, he was dean of the Ohio delegation and number three in seniority on the Republican side of the powerful Appropriations His service embraced the tenure of seven U. As a lawmaker, Ralph was a champion of cross-party collaboration, as others have referenced, and he was a moral compass in an era of personal enrichment. Ralph is remembered as a hardworking, constructive, affable, intelligent, and effective He set a very high standard.  I tried to write words that remind me of Ralph--certainly ``talented,'' ``honest,'' ``hardworking,'' ``sensible,'' ``understated,'' ``straightforward,'' and ``even-tempered.''  If you never met him, he was sort of a cross between Andy Griffith and Robert He was even-tempered and not vindictive--and he had reason to be vindictive. He described himself as a conservative in spending but a progressive in programs.  A proud Canton resident, he worked tirelessly to honor the legacy of his hometown hero, President William Regula sought to preserve the fellow Ohioan's memory by fighting to keep the name Mount McKinley for the summit in Alaska, homage to the man who represented his same district.  During my time in the House, I have had the pleasure of serving alongside Ralph on the Appropriations Committee, where he was distinguished for sensible solutions that worked for Americans and for  When he served on the Labor, Health, and Human Services Subcommittee, he instructed me, when I got to Congress: This is where you really help people.  Ralph was dedicated to that. He had such a heart, but he didn't wear it on his sleeve. He supported working people. There are many votes he cast in favor of the minimum wage. His father was a coal miner. He understood what it was to do that kind of work for a living.  On the centennial of the Metro Parks' creation, we remember his adoration and commitment to our public lands, founding one of northeast Ohio's proudest landmarks, the Cuyahoga National Valley He dedicated so many of his years to creating that park, the Ohio and Erie Canal system, and expanding that park to among the top 10 most visited in the United States of  He attended to Ohio while he attended to the He had the guts to pass new user fees for all national parks to raise money to improve them, so he was thinking of the future.  He was the founder and leader of the Steel Caucus in this House--that was one of the first places that I met him--and an early and effective voice about foreign dumping and about the importance of manufacturing in America, the importance of that steel industry and having fair trade among nations.  With his wife, Mary, he was instrumental in creating the National First Ladies' Library in Canton, Ohio, a most amazing place, with important untold stories about valorous women in our country that, for years, had been largely hidden from the public.  I recommend that the public go to the website of that library and just read about the First Ladies of this country--not just who they were, but[[Page H6296]]what they endured. I learned so much that I didn't know.  Ralph brought phenomenal experience to his public service. Others talked about how he had practiced law, serving in the Navy, held a degree in business administration, served as a school administrator, a teacher, a principal, State legislator, and served on the Ohio Board of He was so level-headed.  An article in the The Washington Post reported that he introduced language in appropriations bills and procedural maneuvers to fight efforts to change Alaska's Mount McKinley name. Obviously, he held the seat that was once occupied by President McKinley, the 25th President, who, sadly, was assassinated in 1901.  As a graduate of the old William McKinley School of Law in Canton, Mr.Regula did not want to see the name of his fellow Buckeye erased from the tallest peak in North Ralph said: The law says it is Mount McKinley, and no President can change the law by the flick of a pen.  When he set his mind to it, he prevailed. His vast experience on the legislative front led him and drove his successful efforts to invest millions and millions of dollars in the improvement of healthcare for the American people, as well as Ohio institutions such as the Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and  He championed the Great Lakes and fought mightily to find a way to clean up coal. I can remember being on the Republican side of the aisle. He said: Congresswoman Kaptur, you have got to help me clean up coal.  He was always looking for a way to try to make life better. He advocated for the National Endowment for the He worked to clean up Florida's Everglades and led the construction of the popular children's farm here in Washington at the National  When people come to public service at the national level, they learn that it is very hard to accomplish things over a brief period of time. It takes a long time. It takes decades to do something of merit. Ralph certainly achieved that.  In 2010, the Cleveland Plain Dealer quoted him. I will end my tribute to him this evening with a quote that he gave to the Plain He said: ``Inflammatory rhetoric may satisfy the partisans, but it does little or nothing to move the legislative ball to the goal line.'' He was talking about the necessity of breaking legislative gridlock and advocating bipartisan compromise.  I think by Congressman Bob Gibbs being on floor tonight, by my being on the floor tonight, in a bipartisan spirit, giving tribute to Ralph Regula, this is a life that Members of Congress can learn from: real achievement, real merit, real honor. He brought real meaning to the word the ``Honorable'' Ralph Straus  May God let him rest in peace and bless his spirit.

11327,topic-id,333,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I, too, would like to express my sympathies to Mary and all the Regula family on Ralph's passing.  I got to know Ralph a long time ago because my dad served here for 30 years. Dad was elected in 1958, Ralph was elected in 1972, and toward the end of their terms that they were here together--of course, Ralph served on for 36 years--their offices were very close to one another. I know that in those days sometimes you had a little more time than we seem to have today, but folks could actually go to one another's office and sit down and chat. I know that Dad and Ralph were very good friends.  What has been said by my other colleagues is true; Ralph worked hard. He served his district well, he worked hard, he did his job, he served the people of his district, and he served the people of this country.  At all times, though, he always was a gentleman. I know that for a fact because I know that when I was younger, I always liked to be able to come here with my dad, I was able to sit in a lot of meetings, and Ralph was an incredible individual.  One of the things that my dad always said was that there was always a difference in life between people who wanted to be politicians and public servants. Dad said that it was very simple: A politician is a person who sees how much they can take from the people they represent for their own benefit, while public servants see how much they can give of themselves to the people they represent. Ralph did this over and over and over again, giving of himself.  Marcia and I do want to express our regret to Mary and all of Ralph's family on his passing because, again, we have lost a great friend, a great colleague, and it is tough to say goodbye.

11279,topic-id,2212,"Mr.President, last night in the Kennedy Caucus Room, the U.Capitol Historical Society honored the Senate Appropriations Committee with a celebration of its 150th anniversary. Past and present committee members and staff gathered to reflect on the history of the committee, and Senate Historian Betty Koed gave a wonderful keynote address.  Established on March 6, 1867, the committee's powers are rooted in article 1, section 9, of our Constitution which states, ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.'' The Founders recognized the power of the purse as one of the most important tools Congress has to ensure our system of checks and balances and to conduct oversight of the executive and judicial branch--but it is much more than that. The Appropriations Committee is where we translate the priorities of a nation into the realities of the people.  Our country is not a business, where we allocate resources only according to the bottom line. We do not invest in order to make a profit or a one-for-one dollar in return. We invest in those areas where it is uniquely right for government to take the lead. We invest in the areas that make a difference in the everyday lives of Americans and that help build the foundations of our country and our economy--infrastructure, national security, our environment, education, science and research, healthcare.  I want to thank the U.Capitol Historical Society for organizing this anniversary celebration, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the remarks given by Senate Historian Betty Koed be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Appropriations Committee 150th Anniversary                        Wednesday, June 28, 2017                    Betty Koed, Senate Historian       On March 6, 2017, the Senate reached an important milestone      in the history of its committees. The Committee on      Appropriations turned 150 years old.       For its first quarter-century, the Senate operated without      permanent legislative committees. Instead, it relied on      temporary ``select'' committees to manage proposals and write      bills. In 1816, having created nearly a hundred of these ad      hoc committees, the Senate decided on something more      permanent.       In December of 1816, it created eleven standing committees,      including Judiciary, Foreign Relations, Commerce, and      However, it did not create a Committee on            Over the next five decades, the Finance Committee handled      most appropriations, but that overworked committee struggled      with the haphazard funding requests of executive agencies.       Wishing to appear frugal, agency directors often      understated their funding needs to the House of      Representatives and then, in the hectic final days of a      session, quietly turned to the Senate for emergency funds.       The threat of suspended operations usually convinced      Congress to replenish the coffers. If agencies ran a surplus,      directors simply spent those funds as they pleased.       By the 1860s senators realized that they needed to gain      better control over appropriations. The Civil War had vastly      expanded federal spending. In fact, in 1865, expenditures      passed the billion-dollar mark for the first time in our      national history.       The lack of centralized control over appropriations also      played to the president's advantage, and the executive often      spent millions without first securing formal congressional      appropriations.       In other words, by the end of the Civil War, no less than      the power of the purse was at stake.       On March 6, 1867, two years after similar action taken by      the House, Senator Henry Anthony of Rhode Island proposed a      new committee to consider spending bills.       The Senate agreed--by unanimous consent--and passed      subsequent legislation to better regulate how such funds were      used.       Before long, this new committee became a Senate powerhouse.      Led by strong chairmen like Iowa's William Allison, the      Appropriations Committee reached new heights of influence      during the Senate's Gilded       Not surprisingly, senators who did not serve on the      committee began to complain. Did this upstart committee have      too much power? Chairmen of the legislative committees, as      well as the heads of executive agencies, said yes, and looked      for ways to wrest back some of that power.       In the 1890s, senators curtailed the jurisdiction of the      Appropriations Committee, giving control over spending in      certain areas, such as agriculture, military affairs, and      pensions, back to legislative committees.       Committee chairs were delighted, but with no centralized      control over the budgetary process, the committees ran amok.      Spending increased with little or no accountability.       And so, in 1921, again prompted by war-related costs that      had pushed annual spending to more than $25 billion a year,      Congress passed the Budget and Accounting       Signed by President Warren Harding, the 1921 law      required an annual budget from the president, created the      General Accounting Office (now GAO), the Bureau of the Budget      (now the OMB), and led to the establishment of permanent      subcommittees for       But passage of that bill was just the beginning. In      implementing the new law, Chairman Francis Warren of      Wyoming shaped the future of the committee.       In 1922 Warren introduced a successful resolution to again      centralize the appropriations process. He also included in      his resolution a revision to Rule 16, requiring that all      general appropriation bills, and amendments to such bills, be      referred to the Committee on       This, in essence, established the broad jurisdiction that      the committee enjoys today.       Since that time, the Appropriations Committee has continued      to evolve as its duties and workload were amended by      subsequent legislation.       Of course, the biggest change came in 1974 with the Budget      Act, which created the House and Senate Budget Committees      along with the Congressional Budget But, again, the      Appropriations Committee remained intact.       In the 1980s and 90s, other elements were added--Gramm-     Rudman, budget summits, PAYGO, CRs--but you know that history      better than I do. You've been living it.       Today--150 years after its creation--the Senate Committee      on Appropriations, ably led by Chairman Cochran and Vice      Chairman Leahy, continues to be a powerful and influential      voice in national policymaking.       Of course, that doesn't mean that the appropriations      process has always been easy. In fact, at times, it has been      downright testy.       For example, on a hot day in August of 1950, as the Senate      continued working past its targeted adjournment date, tempers      inside the committee room got to be nearly as hot as the      scorching summer sun.       ``The Senate is beginning to show signs of overwork,''      observed newspaper columnist Jack ``Sessions are      growing longer,'' he wrote, ``and tempers shorter.''       Among the confrontations that caught Anderson's eye was a      battle between two of the Hill's best known curmudgeons,      Tennessee senator Kenneth McKellar and Missouri      Representative Clarence       They were the chairmen of the Senate and House      Appropriations Committees and for years they had argued      bitterly over federal spending. That battle reached a climax      in 1950.       ``A gavel-bashing, name-calling clash between 81-year-old .      . . McKellar, and 71-year-[[Page S3849]]     old . . . Cannon, was broken up . . . just short of physical      violence,'' noted the Washington Post on August 19, 1950.       While meeting in conference, Senator McKellar had sharply      commented on Cannon's personality, using language peppered      with words such as blind, stupid, and pigheaded.       Infuriated, Cannon sprang from his chair, rushed towards      McKellar, and shouted, ``I've taken all I'm going to      [take].'' Startled but defiant, McKellar snatched the gavel      and tried to rap it on Cannon's head.       ``In the nick of time,'' the Post reported, a staff member      ``grabbed Cannon'' and ``two senators seized the gavel from      McKellar.''       Peace was restored . . . for the moment.       A decade later, another chairman of the Appropriations      Committee--Senator Carl Hayden of Arizona--fought so bitterly      with old Clarence Cannon that the two houses of Congress had      to establish neutral ground.       Like McKellar, Hayden was an old hand at appropriations.      With 50 years of congressional service behind him, his      skillful management of spending bills had earned him the      label, ``the third senator from every state.''       But Hayden's notable length of service had not prepared him      for Clarence In the House since 1923, Cannon knew his      way around bicameral disputes.       This was a battle of the titans on Capitol       ``Government agencies are frantically going broke,'' wrote      a reporter in June of 1962, just because two members of      Congress ``keep yelling at each other.''       For months, Cannon and Hayden had delayed action on      legislation while they argued over seemingly petty issues.       The press dubbed it the ``Battle of the Octogenarians,''      but underlying this crisis was a dispute as old as Congress      itself.       Was the Senate truly the ``upper house''?       Fueling the argument was a long-simmering House resentment      of the Senate's general air of superiority, an attitude which      had resulted in some rather high-handed practices.       For example, for nearly two centuries, all conference      committees had been chaired by senators, and such meetings      had always been held on the Senate side of the       In 1962, the House decided to challenge this old custom of      senatorial privilege. Leading the charge was Appropriations      Chairman Clarence       Defending the Senate's prerogatives--Carl       Cannon informed Hayden that he refused to make the trek to      the Senate side of the Hill for conference meetings. From now      on, he insisted, senators had to walk to the House side--at      least half of the time! Furthermore, he demanded that he be      allowed to chair half of the conferences.       Hayden countered. In that case, he insisted, the Senate      would initiate half of all appropriations bills.       The resulting stalemate lasted for months. Meeting after      meeting produced no agreement. The appropriations process      remained stalled well past the end of the fiscal year, while      government agencies scrambled for funds.       Finally, Carl Hayden called for a truce. He suggested a      special meeting to be held on neutral ground and turned to      Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield for a solution.       Needless to say, Mansfield was anxious to end the battle.      He searched for a proper meeting space. Finally, he opened      EF-100, a small room located off the crypt, in the exact      center of the       ``I even agreed to have it surveyed,'' Mansfield explained,      ``so that the conference table would not be so much as an      eighth of an inch more on one side than the other.''       Presented with this option, Chairman Cannon agreed to meet      in conference, but stood firm in his demands to co-chair      meetings.       To end the crisis, and probably urged on by Mansfield, Carl      Hayden relented. The Senate sacrificed a few of its cherished      privileges, and government operations returned to normal.       Pundits dismissed the battle as a tempest in a teapot, but      more astute observers recognized that this high-profile      battle was another chapter in an on-going struggle over the      shared constitutional powers of the Senate and the       Finally, this evening I would like to highlight an      important but mostly forgotten milestone in this committee's      history.       Since 1867, about 300 senators have served on the      committee. Of those 300, a mere dozen have been women. The      first woman to serve was, of course, Margaret Chase Smith of      Maine, who joined the committee in 1953.       As you all know, in 2012, Senator Barbara Mikulski--the      second woman to serve on the committee--became the first      woman to chair it.       Those are both major milestones in Senate history.       Here's one more.       Way back in 1911, a woman served as chief clerk to the      Senate Appropriations       Her name was Leona She joined the Senate's clerical      staff in 1901 and remained on the payroll for 25 years. I      believe her to be the first woman to hold a top committee      position in the       Born in Illinois in 1877, Wells moved to Wyoming when she      turned 21, because this young suffragist could cast a vote in      There she met Senator Francis Warren, whose      patronage brought her to       As chair of the Military Affairs Committee, Senator Warren      appointed Wells to the committee's clerical staff When he      became chairman of Appropriations in 1911, he brought Wells      with him, giving her the position of chief clerk--although it      appears that the Senate never officially gave her that title.       At the time, Leona Wells was unusual--a well-paid      professional woman on Capitol In fact, she was so      unusual that she attracted media attention.       Leona Wells ``is probably the most envied woman in      government service,'' reported the Boston Globe in an article      titled ``Uncle Sam's Highest Salaried Woman.''       Not only did she earn a good salary, the Globe noted, but      she is ``the first woman employee of the Senate to be placed      in charge of the affairs of a big committee.''       Wells scouted new territory for female staff, but one area      remained off limits--the Senate When Chairman Warren      was on the floor doing committee business, Wells had to wait      outside.       Male committee clerks freely entered the chamber, but the      Senate was not yet ready to admit a female staffer. Instead,      as the Globe reported, Wells waited ``just outside the swing      doors of the chamber . . . and kept the door an inch or two      ajar that she might hear everything that went on inside.''       Leona Wells is largely forgotten now, but her service on      the Appropriations Committee opened a door so other women      could follow. Her story is also part of this committee's      history.       This has been an all-too-brief summary of the history of      this important committee, but I hope it will serve as a      reminder.       Just like Francis Warren or Carl Hayden or even Leona      Wells, all of you--chairs, vice chairs, members, and staff--     are part of the history of the Committee on                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgS3848.txt,1383,THE JOURNAL,2017.0,29.0,June

11417,topic-id,534,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to honor an often overlooked and sometimes underappreciated American hero: the American farmer.  The American farmer has been working the land since before the founding[[Page H4656]]of this country. Early settlers quickly discovered that America is endowed with abundant natural resources, rich soil, and temperate conditions that provide a solid foundation for a vibrant agrarian economy.  Fast-forward a few hundred years, and today the United States is the number one exporter of agricultural products in the world. In fact, farming accounts for over $163 billion each year. This production not only helps make our GDP the highest in the world, but it also helps feed billions worldwide, often in the most hard-to-reach places where food insecurity and malnutrition are chronic problems.  According to the most recent data from the USDA, family farms account for 99 percent of all farms in the U.and 89 percent of America's agricultural production. Ninety percent of the farms in the U.are considered small, and these small farms account for the vast majority of American farmers. This is equally true in Indiana, where, although we are the 38th largest State geographically, we rank in the top 10 in total agricultural sales.  Production in Indiana supports over 245,000 jobs, and corn, soybeans, hogs, poultry, and dairy have a combined $10 billion economic impact statewide. Simply put, ag is a really big deal in Indiana, and the Hoosier farmer does all of the heavy lifting.  Safe, affordable food is important to our national security, and a reliable, sustainable food source is crucial to safeguarding public health while preserving economic independence. That is why we should support our Nation's agricultural producers in every way that we can.                              {time}  1045  This includes supporting the U.crop insurance program, which provides an important safety net to farmers who assume major risks with each seed that they put in the ground. As recent natural disasters have made all too clear, widespread weather events can trigger huge losses for America's family farmers.  Without a national reinsurance pool, growers would have far fewer options available, many crops would be excluded, few could participate in the program, and growers would be forced to turn to Congress for assistance whenever disaster struck. That would be particularly true in areas where droughts and floods are common.  Through the crop insurance program, insurers can extend coverage to crops of all kind, providing farmers with the protections they need to do what they do best: grow food. This program is an example of the government partnering with industry to offer an exceptionally valuable service while maintaining a carefully limited Federal Government role. Frankly, it should be used as a model for other Federal reinsurance programs.  It is a success story, and even if you are not a farmer, you have benefited from its existence. It has helped you receive more affordable food and helped America maintain its agricultural preeminence. That is a great result for virtually every  Mr.Speaker, as Congress begins working on the next farm bill, I hope my colleagues recognize the value of our Federal crop insurance program and the important role that it plays in supporting the American farmer while he or she supports the American consumer.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgH4655-3.txt,2130,HEALTHCARE,2017.0,7.0,July

11522,topic-id,4144,"Mr.Speaker, I am here on behalf of the Progressive Caucus, which is the largest values-based caucus within the Democratic Party--74 members strong--who are helping to lead the legislative arm of the resistance in this country.  We, every year, put forth a Progressive Caucus budget, which is really a statement of the values of the Progressive Caucus and the values of the American people. This year, this week, we released our budget. But before I talk about it, let me just take a step back.  One of the things that people have asked us to do, asked so many of our Progressive Caucus members in this Congress to do, is to really fight and to lead the resistance here in Washington, D.And we are fighting many of the[[Page H3317]]bad ideas that get proposed, from the idea of having a wall on the Mexican border to the terrible tax plan that is going to cost tens of millions of people access to health care, to a tax plan that is going to lower rates for the wealthiest in the country and leave the working class and those aspiring to be in the working class without any benefits.  The cuts that the Trump administration has proposed in their budget, there is just so many bad things, day after day, sometimes hour after hour, in Washington, D.C., that happens. And it is the Congressional Progressive Caucus that is largely leading many of those fights, saying no to the bad ideas. But it is not enough to just say no. We also have to have a positive, progressive alternative so that the American people can see there is a true alternative.  You don't have to just go by the policies of this administration. You don't have to go down the path that really leaves so many people out so that the top 1 or 2 percent can continue to benefit. And that is exactly what the Congressional Progressive Caucus is doing.  So when we put forth a Congressional Progressive Caucus budget, it is a comprehensive budget that lays out the values of the American people from everything from education, to infrastructure, to health care, to our Nation's security. It is a document that we use throughout the year to put forth positive, progressive ideas to show that there is an alternative. You don't have to follow the ideas that have come forth from the Republican majority in this House and the  Let me just start by talking about the Republican budget, the budget that Donald Trump has proposed in his skinny budget he released a while ago. He will be producing a more in-depth budget, but he laid out the fundamental foundation of what his budget is going to look like. That budget is a budget that has no additional revenue. It has $54 billion of additional spending for the military, and because it has no additional revenue, it has cuts to almost every other program that we see, and these are deep cuts--20, 30 percent cuts--to all sorts of agencies.  So let me share a little bit about what that budget looks like, and then I will offer the contrast of what the Congressional Progressive Caucus has put forward and why it means so much to have that budget in place.  First of all, that $54 billion increase means you are going to have to have a lot of cuts to a lot of other areas in the budget, and let me just point a few of those out. One that means a lot to my district, and I represent the people of south central Wisconsin, but it means a lot to everyone across the country, is funding for the National Institutes of Health,  That is the area where that funding goes to researchers across the country who are finding cures for diseases so that we can live longer, and better, and have healthier lives, and it is essential funding. That is so important that, in the last Congress, one of the few things we got done in a bipartisan way is, we did additional funding for the National Institutes of  Just today, in the Omnibus bill to get us through funding through September 30 of this year, we upped funding in a bipartisan way for the National Institutes of Health, because we, in a bipartisan way, value the work they do. In President Trump's budget, there is a $6 billion cut--almost 20 percent of that budget--that would happen, threatening all sorts of research across the country.  For the Department of Education, there is a 13 percent cut, but that is not just a 13 percent cut. That cut would be even deeper if you didn't count the hundreds of millions of dollars put into taxpayer funds going into private schools. It would be more like an 18 or 19 percent cut, but it is huge cuts.  Just in higher education alone, Pell grants--something that I was fortunate enough to have--I grew up in a lower middle class family, and I was fortunate enough to get loans, and work through college, and get some Pell grants to help me so I could attend college. There is a $4 billion cut just in that line item. So clearly, there is not the attention to education from the K-12 level or higher education in that budget.  Programs like Head Start and others are devastated in the pre-K level. So there are a lot of problems with President Trump's budget for education. When you get to transportation, there is a 13 percent cut--$2.4 billion--everything from Amtrak, to dollars going to other rail programs and transit programs, investment programs that help people in rural areas, TIGER grants for highway projects, and more.  In energy, we see the nonnuclear weapon portion of the energy budget, a cut by 18 percent below the current level, and that contains programs like LIHEAP that helps provide assistance to low-income seniors in winter. Now, maybe a low-income senior in winter in Arizona isn't experiencing the same thing they are in Wisconsin, or Michigan, or Pennsylvania, or New York, or a lot of our States, but it gets cold. And sometimes those heating bills can really sock a senior who is on a limited income. That money is just vital to them being able to live in their homes.  It completely cuts the Community Development Block Grant program. That is things like housing programs, Meals on I had the good fortune of going around my district and delivering Meals on Wheels about a year ago to constituents one day.  It is not just that you are providing a nourishing meal to seniors who often can't get out of their homes, who this is the only place they may get that nourishing meal, but it is also a check-in to make sure that they are all right. Some are still living by themselves, and often you don't know if you don't have that visit to be able to check in. It would cut programs like that completely from getting any Federal funds.  At the Environmental Protection Agency, environmental programs, 50 programs would be eliminated, and 31.4 percent of their budget would be gutted for all sorts of things that protect our clean air and clean water--programs like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative or the Chesapeake Bay Watershed So many areas would be cut through that funding, and that just doesn't make any sense.  This is a time that we have the Flint, Michigans of the world, and we are finding that more and more communities with aging infrastructure of their waterways are having lead in their water and other contaminants. This is not the time to be cutting a program that watches out for this by 31 percent; and on, and on.  There are so many cuts that affect real people. So while maybe it is good for the defense contractors to get $54 billion because, trust me, that money is not going to be shared with the people who actually protect our country.  I was talking to another Member of Congress recently whose son is in the military making $22,000 a year. I can guarantee you that $54 billion is not going to be targeted to truly improve what that person is doing, what they are getting paid as they fight for our country to protect our country, but it is going to go to a bunch of new weapons systems and other things that allow the money that, again, is going to go to that top 1 and 2 percent in this  So let me offer what that contrasts. Instead of putting 54 billion new dollars into defense and cutting all of those programs I talked about by huge amounts--20, 30 percent, our State Department, 28 percent, go down the list, huge cuts--we actually invest in this country, and we invest in multiple levels.  The People's Budget: A Roadmap for the Resistance--that is what we call it--does a whole lot of different things. Let me just highlight some of what we put forward this week, along with 60 organizations, major organizations that are endorsing the efforts that we put forward.  First of all, we have a $2 trillion investment in our Nation's infrastructure; $2 trillion that is going into programs to modernize our roads and bridges; modernize our water and sewer systems, our ports and waterways; investing in our transit systems; investing in our K-12 school reconstruction; investing in high-speed broadband infrastructure that we need so desperately in our rural parts of the country; investing in the VA hospitals and extended-care facilities; and investing in the actual workers who are going to do these projects.  This alone is a $2 trillion investment, and, throughout this budget, it is estimated, by the Economic Policy Institute, would create 2.4 million new jobs[[Page H3318]]in this country, good family supporting wages, while we are reinvesting in our Nation's bridges, and roads, and schools, and broadband, and other infrastructure. That is a key part of what we have put out there, and it is what is needed in this country.  We have to invest in our country, and this budget does just that. We also look at taxes in a very different way, and we rewrite the rules in a system that often seems rigged against the middle class and those aspiring to be in the middle class.  We close loopholes for big corporations that send jobs overseas. We stop CEOs from receiving millions in tax-free bonuses, and we tackle income and equality by having fair tax rates--fair for those who are working, and sharing a little more for those who are the wealthiest in this country. We level the playing field for the working families across this country.  In this budget, we also have a new initiative to invest $1 trillion into childcare, childcare for everyone who needs it, pre-K education in this country. There is no question, we know more people are working more and working more jobs, but you can't if you don't have someone to watch your children when you are doing that.  Having this in place will allow us to make sure that those crucial years in education that really develop you for often the rest of your educational experience--K-12 and higher education--we have a plan to truly invest in every single person so that no one is paying more than 10 percent of their income for childcare.  It is not just that. We are funding K-12 schools. We are funding that infrastructure for our schools. We are making sure that people who live in rural areas have broadband so they can do the homework that you do in a modern  At the higher education level, we have several innovative ideas offered in our budget, from refinancing of student loans to the lowest current available rate so that you are not paying some of these high 6.6 percent interest rates that don't even make sense in today's economy, to providing for debt-free college; to make sure that if you actually work and you want to do a workstudy job, you should be able to leave a 4-year public institution debt free, and leave with a degree, compared to the $30,000 plus on average that people are leaving with now. We also tackle some of the ideas about free tuition in public institutions. So we have got some real ideas from pre-K, to K-12, to higher education.  We also make sure that we are addressing the costs of prescription drugs because that is one of the drivers as we have this debate around health care.  One of the reasons we have seen the spikes we have had is because, quite honestly, a lot of prescription drug companies have charged prices that are quite unreasonable, by any reasonable person's standards. There is no reason why the same drug you pay for in Canada or Ireland is substantially cheaper than it is in the United  We have measures to make sure that we can reduce the price of prescription drugs here in this country and that people don't have to make a decision between paying for their medicine or their groceries.  We also are looking at health care in another way. First of all, the Affordable Care Act, as I think now many people across this country understand and now support the concept--while they may not have supported ObamaCare, they love the Affordable Care Same thing, folks.  What we are finding is, there are things we need to do to improve it. And while we look at some of those, one of those is allowing States to look at going to a single-payer system, and we provide the pathway to do that, to reduce costs and increase coverage so that even more people can have that.  We also expand access to mental health care--this is Mental Health Awareness Month in this country, and we are making sure we are doing that--and treatment for opioid addiction.  We also have a humane and comprehensive immigration reform proposal. We are not talking about building walls at a time we should be talking about building bridges. Instead, we are having sensible plans that provide for full implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the DACA program.  We preserve funding for sanctuary cities, and we prohibit any funding whatsoever to go to President Trump's wall.                              {time}  1800  Those are just a few of the things that we have in this budget. When you contrast those deep cuts to programs that help middle class families and those aspiring to be in the middle class across the country, when you contrast it with the proactive positive alternatives we have in this budget, I think people will see that there truly is a significant difference and why we don't have to settle for something that is out there that is not going to take care of the working families in this country.  You know, a lot of people across the country talk to our Members of We see these huge attendances right now at townhalls, and every Member should be out having those townhalls. And what we are hearing from people is that they are not happy with the proposals offered by the Trump administration and by the Republicans in Congress, the healthcare proposal that they put forward that we could be voting on as early as tomorrow--the second attempt at this.  I will tell you, I have learned something very interesting. When someone doesn't want to put their name on something, in this place especially, it is usually not very good. I have found people really like to put their name on things in this town.  It's funny that the Trump administration was calling their healthcare bill RyanCare, Congress is calling it TrumpCare, people back home call it I Don't  In the end, what we are finding is this is a bill that is going to cut access to 24 million people, give tax breaks of $600 billion-plus to the wealthiest in this country, the top 1 and 2 percent, to insurance companies, to Big Pharma, and other big entities. That is often what it seems like it is really about.  It is going to increase fivefold. People will be paying five times as much--older Americans--for their health care, and it cuts Medicaid to so many people who need it in this country.  Don't forget, Medicaid is not just for people who are poor and trying to get health care and trying to get work; it is also people with disabilities, it is seniors in nursing homes.  It is, quite honestly, incomprehensible that the Republicans think it is all right to cut those programs. That is their tax plan. But here is the best part: they are making it now even worse. The words we are hearing and that they are bragging about are amendments to make it so that, State by State, they can turn down things like coverage for preexisting conditions and turn down other essential health benefits, things like prescription drug care, maternal care, emergency room visits.  That is what health care is all about. If you gut everything out of health care, all you have is a shell of what you can call health care but doesn't actually provide any of the benefits.  They are doing this to bring in the Tea Party, the most conservative element of their caucus that fundamentally doesn't believe in the functioning of government. They are going to basically do that, make sure government doesn't have any say in what health care is. You will have no guarantees.  I guarantee with what they are doing--this is according to the official nonpartisan estimates by the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, not our estimates--at least 24 million people will lose care under the old proposal. Take the new proposal, and if you start adding the States being able to make those decisions, more and more people will lose access to their health care.  We will see what happens, whether or not they can get this done. I think they are having a difficult time. When we had a little conversation on the floor about it today, we noticed they didn't quite have answers about when the bill will come up. We will see what does happen with that.  But when you contrast that sort of a healthcare proposal with the fundamentals that we have in the Progressive Caucus budget, you see a stark difference. We take and expand upon the progress of the Affordable Care Act that has allowed tens of millions of people to have access.  When you look at the proposals that we put forward, there was an Economic[[Page H3319]]Policy Institute article and a Washington Post article today that I will include in the             [From Economic Policy Institute, May 2, 2017]  The People's Budget, Not Trump's Budget, Will Help Working Americans                            (By Mark Pocan)       After President Trump's first 100 days in office, it's      clear that his promises to help the working class were little      more than a campaign ploy. His dismantling of Obama-era      regulations like the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule and      deregulation of the financial industry reveal what he really      cares about--lining the pockets of America's ultra-rich.       Nothing demonstrates his disdain for working people more      than his budget proposal. In it, he cuts 31 percent of the      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s budget, which ensures      people across the country have clean air and water, and 21      percent from Department of Labor programs that provide job      training to seniors and disadvantaged youth. Instead of      helping working people, Trump's budget imposes a hiring      freeze on crucial federal agencies and calls for many more      staff to be laid off from public sector jobs--the largest      reduction in the federal workforce since World War       The FY 2018 People's Budget: A Roadmap for the Resistance      by the Congressional Progressive Caucus stands in stark      contrast to Trump's budget. The People's Budget is a plan to      actually help working Americans who have felt left behind by      an economy rigged against them. Our budget is a roadmap for      the resistance, investing in the progressive priorities and      kitchen table issues that matter to real people:      infrastructure to create jobs and ensure public safety;      education to help our kids reach their full potential; and      sustainable energy to protect our precious environment.      Progressives in Congress fully want to make investments in      our future generations and protect programs that improve the      lives of people every day. We believe our budget should      strengthen Social Security and Medicare and invest in job      growth through infrastructure, education, and research and      development, while responsibly reducing our deficits and      cutting wasteful spending and redundant programs where they      exist.       As a business owner from Wisconsin and a long-time union      member, I understand what it means to take the economic high      road. It means ensuring that working people get a fair shake      at economic opportunities, that the wealthy pay their fair      share of taxes, and that we all do better, when we all do      better. I urge President Trump and Republicans in Congress to      seriously consider the proposals in the People's Budget so      that we can create a fairer economy.                                  ____                       [From the Washington Post]          This New Budget Points the Way Forward for Democrats                           (By James Downie)       Out of power in Washington and around the country,      Democrats are struggling with how to move forward as a party.      Already the jockeying for the 2020 nomination has begun. What      policies the party chooses to champion will be essential to      how long or short the path will be to recovery. On Tuesday,      the Congressional Progressive Caucus--led by Raul      Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and Keith Ellison (D-Minn.)--released its      annual ``People's Budget'' for 2018. The CPC has produced a      budget for years, but with the party at a crossroads, this      edition may be the most important ever. Democrats should      recognize its ideas as an inspiration for the party going      forward.       The People's Budget starts by acknowledging a problem that      most leaders acknowledge but few have addressed: the      country's crumbling infrastructure. It provides $2 trillion      over 10 years to repair bridges and tunnels, revitalize mass      transit, replace contaminated water systems, rebuild public      schools and more. Furthermore, weak wage growth and other      indicators demonstrate that the economy remains short of      where it was before the Great Recession, and infrastructure      investment can provide badly needed jobs that will help      propel the economy to new heights. The Economic Policy      Institute projects that the People's Budget would add 2.4      million jobs and increase GDP by 2 percent in the near term.       The CPC's plan also addresses other crucial domestic      issues. While Republicans struggle to reconcile repealing      Obamacare with keeping health care affordable, the CPC puts      forward actual ideas to bring the cost of health care down:      The People's Budget introduces a public option--which would      lower premiums--and ends the ridiculous prohibition on      Medicare negotiating drug prices. The document also      recognizes the dangers of climate change, puffing a price on      carbon and eliminating tax breaks for the fossil fuel      industry. And it funds universal pre-kindergarten and      strengthens antitrust enforcement, fighting back against the      oligopolies in health care, cable and other industries that      are hurting Americans' pocketbooks.       Finally, the People's Budget invests in communities that      need critical help. It ends funding cuts to programs such as      Head Start and needs-based nutrition programs--cuts which      disproportionately hurt women and people of color. It invests      millions to help veterans find housing, jobs and health care.      And it commits money toward fighting homelessness and funding      affordable housing.       With all this spending, people may wonder what happens to      the national debt, but the People's Budget reduces the debt      as a percentage of In addition to the savings and the      carbon pricing mentioned above, the budget raises trillions      while making the tax system more fair. In addition to closing      numerous loopholes for businesses and high earners, there are      three major changes: restoring Clinton-era tax rates for      income above $250,000 and higher rates for income over $1      million, going after companies that defer tax by sending      income overseas, and reintroducing a financial transaction      tax (which the United States had from 1914 to 1966). All      told, these three reforms raise nearly $5 trillion over l0      years.       The People's Budget has no chance of becoming law in a GOP-     controlled government. But this budget is a marker for      Democrats aspiring to lead the party forward. The party is      increasingly seen as out of touch, even by its own      supporters. The People's Budget by contrast is built around      sound policies that are also politically popular. It reflects      Americans' long-standing desires for fixing the country's      infrastructure, strengthening entitlements, lowering the cost      of health care and making the wealthiest pay their fair      share. These ideas, if adopted, could be the foundation of a      rebuilt and resurgent party, and by embracing the goals of      the People's Budget, Democrats can reorient toward the      future.

11523,topic-id,1172,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to read a little bit from The Washington  ``This new budget points the way forward for Democrats.''  And what this specifically is addressing is the Progressive Caucus budget. It is looking at it and saying:  ``Democrats should recognize its ideas as an inspiration for the party going forward.  ``The People's Budget starts by acknowledging a problem that most leaders acknowledge but few have addressed: the country's crumbling infrastructure. It provides $2 trillion over 10 years to repair bridges and tunnels, revitalize mass transit, replace contaminated water systems, rebuild public schools and more.''  And that is what we talked about. Those are the very provisions that we put forward in that $2 trillion investment in our infrastructure.  Mr.Speaker, I will go back to reading this.  ``The Economic Policy Institute projects that the People's Budget would add 2.4 million jobs and increase GDP by 2 percent in the near term.''  That is 2.4 million people with a good family-supporting job while we are rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure and increasing our Nation's gross domestic product.  What does that mean?  I have been a small-business owner for 29 years. It is the rising tide that lifts all boats. The more people that have money in their pockets that can spend it, puts money right back into the economy.  If we make sure that more people are working and more people have a family-supporting wage that they can buy a sofa, they can take their family out to dinner or to a movie, that creates more economic activity, and that creates even more jobs. That is exactly what we need in this country.  That is, again, the Economic Policy Institute projecting what our budget would do.  Mr.Speaker, let me go back to the document.  ``While Republicans struggle to reconcile repealing ObamaCare with keeping health care affordable, the CPC puts forward actual ideas to bring the cost of health care down: The People's Budget introduces a public option--which would lower premiums--and ends the ridiculous prohibition on Medicare negotiating drug prices.''  Can you believe that?  We don't use our purchasing power right now to negotiate for cheaper prices for prescription drugs. There is a reason why we pay sometimes 8 more, 20 times more, than other countries for the exact same drug. It is because we are not allowed to use that purchasing power in a way that will help create that economic savings.  Mr.Speaker, I will go back to the document.  ``The document also recognizes the dangers of climate change, putting a price on carbon and eliminating tax breaks for the fossil fuel industry.''  Think about it. We still subsidize gas and oil, which is one of the most profitable businesses on the planet, and we are subsidizing them with tax subsidies. We get rid of those tax subsidies.[[Page H3320]]  Mr.Speaker, I will go back to the document.  ``And it funds universal pre-kindergarten and strengthens antitrust enforcement, fighting back against the oligopolies in health care, cable and other industries that are hurting Americans' pocketbooks.''  These are the things that we have in our Progressive Caucus budget to make sure that real families, as you are sitting at your kitchen table trying to decide if you can afford to pay your mortgage, send your kids to college, take a family vacation this year, maybe have that one luxury of a camper or a snowmobile, only if you live up north, or a boat. Those are the things that I grew up with. I grew up in Kenosha, Wisconsin, like I said, in a lower middle class family. That was the existence of most everyone I knew. We are trying to make sure that that can be the existence again for every single person.  While wages have been largely flat, the economy has come back. We have just recently had a little bit of a bump in the last year or so of the Obama We need to do more for those families.  Mr.Speaker, let me go back to this document.  ``With all this spending, people may wonder what happens to the national debt. But the People's Budget reduces the debt as a percentage of In addition to the savings and the carbon pricing mentioned above, the budget raises trillions while making the tax system more fair.''  This budget actually reduces overall debt by $4 trillion between now and 2027. You don't see that out of almost any other budget proposed. Yet our budget, while investing in America and investing in Americans, we also help to turn back that crushing debt that this country has so often had and that we need to address.  Mr.Speaker, let me just finish with reading a little more of this document.  ``The People's Budget, by contrast, is built around sound policies that are also politically popular. It reflects Americans' longstanding desires for fixing the country's infrastructure, strengthening entitlements, lowering the cost of health care, and making the wealthiest pay their fair share. These ideas, if adopted, could be the foundation of a rebuilt and resurgent party, and by embracing the goals of the People's Budget, the Democrats can reorient toward the future.''  Now, that is, again, an opinion out of The Washington Post today about the budget we released yesterday.  I encourage people to go to the Progressive Caucus website to learn more about this budget, to look at the work that the Economic Policy Institute has done in working the numbers of this budget, and see what the contrast can be.  You don't have to settle for second or third best. We don't just have to make sure the top 1 and 2 percent have even more, and we hope that some of that trickles down on the other 98 percent of us.  Instead, we can have a budget that invests in infrastructure and creates good jobs, that invests in our public education system from pre-K to higher education. We can have a budget that expands our healthcare opportunities so that even more people can have affordable health care and helps lower the cost of prescription drugs.  We can have a budget that does these things, and we have put that forward in the People's Budget, which is the product of the Progressive Caucus here in  Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the time to be on the floor of Congress to present this on behalf, again, of the 74 Members of the Progressive Caucus, the largest value-based caucus within the Democratic We are proud to present this budget. This should be coming to the floor as we debate all budgets in the coming months. But we are proud to put ours out first. Let's set the standard. Let's see how we can see what the Republicans in this House will put forward, and we will see what details the President puts forward.

Mr.Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.1616, the Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting This bill establishes the National Computer Forensics Institute as an official Federal program to be managed by the Department of Homeland Security and operated by the U.Secret I strongly support it because it addresses a serious problem and advances a solution that is critically important to the safety of our people.  Cybercrime poses an enormous threat to national security, economic prosperity, and public safety. The range of threats and the challenges that they present for law enforcement multiply just as rapidly as technology evolves, causing serious insecurity in the personal lives, the work lives, and the finances of our people.  Over the past decade, our law enforcement community has recorded a significant increase in the quantity, quality, complexity, and danger of sophisticated cybercrimes targeting private industry, including our financial services sector and private individuals. These crimes include intrusions; hacking attacks; the surreptitious installation of malicious software; identity theft; and massive data breaches that have compromised and exposed the personal, financial, business, medical, and professional information of millions of U.citizens.  How many of our people have suffered the disruption, indignity, and anxiety of identity theft, for example?  For Americans who have been victimized by cybercrime, especially our seniors, it is a terrifying and demoralizing experience. For small businesses affected, it is costly and enormously draining.  Just as cyber warfare has transformed the nature of war in this century, cybercrime has transformed the nature of crime, adversely affecting the members of our law enforcement and intelligence services.  To date, the National Computer Forensics Institute has risen to the occasion, training more than 4,000 State and local law enforcement officers and 1,600 prosecutors. With this legislation, the institute will continue to educate State and local law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and judges on current trends in cyber and electronic crime investigations and best practices taken across the country. The institute will train officers on proper procedures to conduct these important investigations that are affecting more and more Americans every year.  In addition, the National Computer Forensics Institute will continue to work to protect our citizens' personal information from unwarranted governmental intrusion by establishing national standards for conducting these investigations. The institute will protect these important privacy interests along with the security of our businesses, our homes, our finances, and our personal effects.

Mr.Speaker, this is Police Week in the United It is our chance to show appreciation for some of the most important unsung heroes in our I couldn't be more grateful for the opportunity to use my time before this legislative body today to thank each and every member of this country's brave dedicated men and women of law enforcement. From patrolling our streets to pursuing criminals of every kind, it is these men and women in blue who keep our communities safe and uphold the pillars of law and order in society each and every day. Every American should be grateful for those who run towards danger and who march into harm's way to keep us safe.  Nearly a decade ago I had the privilege of being appointed the United States Attorney under former President George Serving as the President's top Federal law enforcement official gave me the chance to work shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of great police officers and police departments across the 33,000 square miles of the Eastern District of It also instilled in me an incredible sense of gratitude for those in law enforcement who wake up each and every day simply wanting to make the world around them a safer place to live for all of us.  I could say it 1,000 times and it wouldn't do justice to the service that they provide: Thank you. Thank you for all you do. We are all grateful.  And while the simple truth is that we can never really repay those in law enforcement for the incredible sacrifices they make each and every day, as a lawmaker, I want to do everything within my power to give them the tools to help them keep us safe.  Today this body has a unique opportunity to stand up for those who selflessly and dependably stand up for all of us. H.1616, the Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017, does exactly that by authorizing into law the National Computer Forensics Institute, or  As the chairman said, the NCFI is a critical national training center located in Hoover, Alabama, that is operated by the United States Secret Service for the purpose of training our State and local law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges on how to investigate cyber and electronic crimes, on how to conduct computer and mobile device forensics examinations, to respond to network intrusions, and to preserve the chain of custody for digital evidence.  Mr.Speaker, in today's digital world, it is rarely that drop of blood or strand of hair that solves a crime or a case. Instead, far more frequently, it is proof of a text message that was sent or an online purchase that was made or geolocation data on a mobile device.  Since its creation, the NCFI has trained and equipped more than 6,000 law enforcement officials from all 50 States on how to handle digital evidence and solve and prosecute cybercrimes. By authorizing the NCFI into Federal law, Congress can ensure that the NCFI remains our Nation's premier cybercrime training center for State and local law enforcement officials for many years to come.  This isn't some theoretical program at the The proverbial rubber is already hitting the road. In fact, three different law enforcement agencies in my own district have had their folks trained at the NCFI, folks like Don Waddle, a 25-year veteran of the Greenville Police Department in my home district. In a hearing I chaired last year about the impact of the training that Don received at NCFI, he talked about the value that not just he got as a law enforcement officer, but the community that he serves.  He told me: I am not the main benefactor of this training. The citizens of[[Page H4208]]Greenville and Hunt County and the entire northeast Texas area reap the benefits of this training with better recovery rates for stolen property, as well as more perpetrators being taken off of our streets.                              {time}  1630  Don is like thousands of detectives and prosecutors and judges across the country who because of their NCFI training are better able to serve their communities and do their law enforcement jobs in an ever-increasing digital world.

11319,topic-id,496,"Mr.President, today I am introducing the State Flood Mitigation Revolving Fund Act of 2017 along with Senators Kennedy and  The purpose of this bill is to reduce flood risk and the costs associated with flooding by establishing a State revolving loan program to fund mitigation projects for homeowners, businesses, and communities. This includes activities such as home elevations, flood proofing, acquisitions, and environmental restoration. By funding projects that reduce risk, the bill also provides an avenue to help middle-income and low-income property owners reduce their flood insurance premiums.  Mr.President, flooding is the most common and costly hazard facing American property owners. Every year, we are reminded of this when we see catastrophic flooding in communities across the country. Since 2010, my home State of Rhode Island has experienced two Presidentially-declared flooding disasters, which have cost the Federal government over $86 million in payments from the National Flood Insurance Nationally, disasters like these have caused FEMA to pay out an average of nearly $3 billion a year in flood insurance claims over the last five years--not to mention the billions in disaster payments for uninsured damage.  Almost universally, experts remind us that the best way to reduce the cost of flooding is to engage in proactive, not reactive, flood mitigation. This is what the State Flood Mitigation Revolving Fund Act seeks to do.  Modeled on the successful Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, this bill creates a straightforward and easily accessible program through which States can offer low-interest loans to homeowners, businesses, and communities who want to mitigate their flood risk. By creating a revolving fund, the bill will allow States to design and more efficiently implement their own flood mitigation strategies provided that they help achieve Federal objectives such as reducing disaster payments.  Within this construct, the bill gives States the flexibility to undertake flood mitigation projects without the red tape associated with other Federal disaster mitigation programs. The bill requires state to provide a match of 20 percent, but they would have an incentive to further leverage Federal dollars, as many already do under the drinking water and clean water  Additionally, the bill ensures mitigation assistance is focused on where the flood risk is greatest and where people are most vulnerable. The bill requires States to prioritize mitigation assistance for low-income homeowners and geographic areas, pre-FIRM buildings, and severe repetitive loss and repetitive loss buildings. Finally, it gives States the option of providing additional subsidization for low-income property-owners and-communities that simply do not have the wherewithal to assume additional debt.  Mr.President, as we talk about appropriate investments in infrastructure, mitigation is one place where we should be putting our money. FEMA reports that every $1 we spend on mitigation generates $4 in future savings. Not only will this legislation lead to a healthy return on investment, it will[[Page S3863]]also create jobs through the work it funds  I invite my colleagues to join me, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Menendez in supporting this legislation.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgS3860.txt,1982,STRENGTHENING STATE AND LOCAL CYBER CRIME FIGHTING ACT OF 2017,2017.0,29.0,June

11456,topic-id,396,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of H.1694, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017.  Mr.Chairman, transparency is critical. It is critical to oversight and accountability of the Federal Government and how it spends taxpayer dollars. The American public has a right to know how their tax dollars are spent.  The Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, is a key tool for citizens to access information about their government. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not subject to the requirements of FOIA, despite taxpayers' substantial investment into both entities and the government's implicit guaranteed backing of these entities.  Taxpayers have spent $187 billion to bail out Fannie and Freddie, the most sweeping government intervention into private financial markets in decades. Taxpayers are on the hook for $400 billion in lost investments and $5 trillion in mortgage liabilities.  At the same time, the American public is unable to seek accountability from these entities under It is far past time we apply FOIA to Fannie and There is precedent for applying FOIA to non-traditional quasi-governmental entities. Congress subjected Amtrak to FOIA in recognition of sizeable taxpayer funding.  To stabilize the housing market in the aftershock of the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship to return them to financial viability and stockholder control. FHFA is a government entity subject to Under the terms of its conservatorship over Fannie and Freddie, FHFA exercises the titles to their books and records, as well as the powers and privileges of Fannie and  Despite this government intervention and explicit guarantee, taxpayers, however, are unable to obtain any information from Fannie and  H.1694, the Fannie and Freddie Open Records Act of 2017, sponsored by Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz, will allow the American public to submit FOIA requests to Fannie and Freddie as long as the entities remain under FHFA's conservatorship. H.1694 reflects FOIA's presumptions of openness, granting taxpayers information unless an exemption applies.  This bill is a commonsense measure to allow the American public access to basic information regarding entities that they fund with their tax dollars.  The American public should not be in the dark when it comes to what Fannie and Freddie are doing.  Mr.Chairman, I urge support for the legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Applying FOIA to Fannie and Freddie while the entities remain in conservatorship will better ensure that the American people know what their government does with their taxpayer dollars. But, if and when Fannie and Freddie come out of conservatorship, the entities need to be able to operate as commercially competitive businesses.  This amendment clarifies that Fannie and Freddie may use exemption 4, which protects sensitive commercial information from disclosure, regardless of whether information was obtained from a person outside of Fannie or Freddie, to protect their financially sensitive materials from public disclosure.  Mr.Chairman, recognizing the administrative labors involved in setting up FOIA shops, the amendment also addresses the implementation date.

If FHFA fails to guarantee the soundness of their business dealings, FOIA could empower the taxpayer to step in and hold accountable Fannie or  For instance, thanks to taxpayers' explicit backing of Fannie earlier this year, Invitation Homes, the single-family rental business owned by the lucrative private equity firm Blackstone, secured a $1.8 billion initial public offering, or IPO, the largest since October of 2015.  In its IPO filing, Invitation Homes disclosed that Fannie, which received over $116 billion from the taxpayers in the aftershock of the financial crisis, is guaranteeing up to $1 billion in debt from While Blackstone gets the money, the taxpayers take on the risk; and Fannie pivots unimpeded into the rental markets, leaving those hopeful of homeownership with less support.  Applying FOIA to Fannie and Freddie under this bill strengthens the guarantee that government-sponsored entities are fulfilling their mandate to stimulate homeownership rather than being in the business of supporting profitable, private equity investors on the backs of taxpayers.

For half a century, the center has provided opportunities for healthy aging and lifelong learning that enhance the quality of life for seniors. The Montpelier Senior Activity Center, established in 1967 and nestled in our State's capital, has the mission of enhancing the quality of life for the older adults in the Montpelier area by developing physical, mental, cultural, social, and economic well-being in a welcoming and flexible environment.  A Nation is judged by how it cares for its most vulnerable. It is undeniable that we are living in a time when many Vermonters and Americans are having to do more with less and the most vulnerable among us are making the unacceptable decisions like choosing between paying for healthcare, food on the table, or a roof over their head. In Vermont, more than 11,000 seniors are living in poverty.  At a time of massive political discontent, we need to focus on building up, not dismantling, our communities. In Montpelier, VT, just that is happening, as seniors are able to access services that help them live out their lives in dignity.  The center serves more than 1,000 seniors every year, including more than one of every five seniors in In 2016, the Montpelier Senior Activity Center provided more than 17,000 nutritious home-delivered and community meals for seniors. More than 80 percent of senior activity center participants report that their participation makes them feel healthier.

11272,topic-id,726,"Mr.President, the Senate recently passed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection This legislation is intended to improve the VA by strengthening the process of holding nonperforming VA employees accountable, but it does this by removing certain due process protections that are currently in place to protect VA employees from unlawful discrimination or retaliation. David Shulkin, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, asked for this authority to reform the personnel system, and the Senate obliged his request.  In Hawaii we have a much different and more pressing problem that this legislation does not address, and that is the challenge we face with recruitment and retention of VA leaders and filling vacant positions at the  Nowhere is this challenge more evident than in the VA's yearlong search to recruit a new executive director for the Pacific Island Health Care System in During this time, six executive directors from six different VA healthcare systems on the mainland rotated through Hawaii on an interim basis. The VA said that its search dragged on for so long because it faced a shortage of individuals with the right skills to fill these medical director positions, but that is no excuse. The VA should have been doing more to develop a pool of qualified people to fill vacant medical director positions. Failure to find long-term, stable leadership undermines accountability not only at the highest level, but across the entire healthcare system.  I am also bothered by the decision to rotate medical directors in from other healthcare systems, even on an interim basis. This stopgap measure failed to ensure the proper leadership required to provide long-term direction for the Pacific Island Health Care System and to make sure that there was someone to hold accountable for the delivery of services to the more than 120,000 veterans that the VA is responsible for in the Those veterans and their families deserve better.  Leadership recruitment is not the only staffing issue we face. In its September 2016 report on the Pacific Island Health Care System, the VA's Office of the Inspector General specifically noted that recruitment and retention of staff is an ongoing challenge across our neighbor islands, in large part due to cost of living, distance, and physical isolation. At the time of its report, the OIG noted that there were 75 unfilled positions at community-based outpatient clinics across These are vacant positions at clinics that directly affect veterans' access to healthcare.  I worry that removing important due process protections for VA employees will only make this problem worse, because, where there are already issues in physician recruitment and retention, the VA could compete through the promise of a stable job, in an environment free from unlawful discrimination or retaliation. Knowing that those protections are in place is not only helpful to attracting recruits, but it is helpful to promoting a culture free of inequity and intimidation because people know they will be held to account for their actions. That kind of culture is critical to recruitment and retention because the last thing the VA wants is hard-working employees to search for[[Page S3729]]jobs that offer better working conditions elsewhere.  At our recent subcommittee hearing on military construction and veteran affairs appropriations, Secretary Shulkin acknowledged that the VA has seen cases of documented whistleblower retaliation, and that is important, because it means that Secretary Shulkin is going to have to be vigilant so that this new legislation is not abused. In his mind, he is not seeking this legislation so that the VA can fire employees without any reason or to allow supervisors to abuse them, and I hope that is how this plays out in practice across the country, but there is going to be more risk for a workforce of 360,000 that is decentralized, where decisions are made locally, and so we will be vigilant with him and will hold Secretary Shulkin accountable for any wrongdoing.  We are still left grappling with the challenge of recruitment and retention, and unfortunately, this legislation does not address it, and it may make addressing it even harder. With nearly 50,000 vacant positions across the VA workforce, Congress needs to get a handle on this issue because these vacancies risk undermining the delivery of services and care to our veterans who rely on the We can and need to do better by them.

11282,topic-id,1202,"Mr.President, in a few short hours, we will vote on the motion to proceed to the House Republican healthcare bill. I will have more to say on the matter prior to the vote.  At the moment, no one knows the plan that is being cooked up in the Republican leader's office, but it seems to be his intention to do whatever it takes to pass anything, no matter how small, to get the House and Senate Republicans into a conference on healthcare.  Surprisingly, I have heard that my friend, the junior Senator from Kentucky, will vote yes on the motion to proceed. He announced it himself. It is true he will likely get a vote on the motion to repeal without replace, but surely he knows that will fail. Why then would the junior Senator from Kentucky--a man who has preached the repeal of the Affordable Care Act root and branch, a man who proselytized that Republicans should stop at nothing short of full repeal--why would the junior Senator from Kentucky vote on the motion to proceed knowing he will not get what he wants? It is because, I believe, he and some of the others in this body know that if the Senate manages to pass something to get to conference in the House, the likely compromise in the conference is either a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act or something close to it. It will certainly mean drastic cuts in Medicaid, huge tax cuts for the rich, no healthcare for those with preexisting conditions, and millions and millions losing healthcare, particularly in our poorer and more brutal That is the only thing our Republicans have been able to agree on.  The hard-right Freedom Caucus in the House would never accept a Republican bill that only repeals a few regulations in the ACA but leaves much of it in place. No, they want full repeal, and, at minimum, deep cuts to Medicaid, huge tax breaks for the wealthy, and millions in every State in this Nation losing their healthcare.  To my Republican friends who have repeatedly said that full repeal without replace would be a disaster and to my Republican friends who have opposed the deep and drastic cuts to Medicaid, I say: Don't be fooled by this ruse. A vote in favor of the motion to proceed will mean deep cuts to Medicaid, maybe even deeper than in the House bill. It will mean people with preexisting conditions will be left high and dry. It will mean huge tax breaks for the wealthiest of It will mean millions will lose their coverage.  So with all the complaining, why are we here at this late moment? Because even the House bill was too drastic for many of the Members here, and it is now being ignored on this motion to proceed, and because we all know the ruse that is going on. The ruse is this: Send it back to the House; then, we will see what they send us. We know what they will send us. We may not know every detail. It will either be full repeal without replace or something far too close to that, and all of the work and all of the anguish that so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have shown in the last several weeks will be wasted because they know darn well what is going to happen when there is a conference.  There are no Democratic votes in the The Freedom Caucus calls the shots. They will either ask for full repeal or something very close to it. Make no mistake about it. A vote in favor of the motion to proceed this afternoon will be a permission slip to slash Medicaid, hurt millions, and give huge tax cuts for the wealthy--something the vast majority of Americans in every State, a large percentage of Republicans and Trump voters, abhor.  One last plea to my colleagues: Do not fall for the ruse that the majority leader is putting together. We know what is going on. We all know. Our constituents will not be fooled--oh, no. We on this side are not fooled--oh, no. I hope my colleagues who, out of compassion and care for the people in their States, have made such a fuss up to now will not be fooled either.

This is the first person who stuck his neck out for Donald Trump and who was with him through thick and thin. Now, even if the President has disagreements with him--which I think are ill-founded and self-centered and wrong--you don't ridicule him in public--someone who is your close friend. That speaks to character.  But I would like to speak to the major issue before us, which is related. It is clear that President Trump is trying to bully his own Attorney General out of office. How can anyone draw a different conclusion? If President Trump had serious criticisms of his Attorney General, why not talk to him in person? Why air his grievances so publicly? He wants him out. Here is the danger. Many Americans must be wondering if the President is trying to pry open the Office of Attorney General to appoint someone during the August recess who will fire Special Counsel Mueller and shut down the Russia investigation.  First, let me state for the record now, before this scheme gains wings, that Democrats will never go along with the recess appointment if that situation arises.

The United States will be hosting the Ministerial of the Arctic Council and will be passing the chairmanship of that Council over to  The Arctic Council is an important foreign policy body. It consists of the[[Page S2816]]Arctic countries of the world--the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and In just a few days, all of the Foreign Ministers of all of those countries will be in Fairbanks,  This is not the first time in recent memory that the Golden Heart City of Fairbanks has been on the world stage in its hosting of a critical foreign policy meeting of world leaders. In fact, almost exactly 33 years ago to this very day in 1984, on May 2, in Fairbanks, AK, Pope John Paul II and President Ronald Reagan met in It was a great meeting. You could see the chemistry between these two great world leaders. Right now, some historians believe that it was at the Fairbanks meeting of these two great leaders when the Pope and the great President Ronald Reagan laid out their vision and plans to vanquish global communism.  America is an Arctic nation because of Alaska, and we have very significant, strategic interests in the Arctic--economic opportunity, transportation routes, sea routes that are now beginning to open because of receding sea ice, responsible natural resource development--enormous natural resources of all types, including oil and gas--protecting the environment, and respecting the culture and way of life of the peoples in the Arctic, particularly of the indigenous peoples, including their subsistence hunting rights. After a substantial discussion I had just a couple of days ago with Secretary of State Tillerson about the upcoming ministerial, I am confident this ministerial will focus on these important issues.  In going forward, it is important to remember that right now in the Arctic, there are real people with real lives, real families, and real needs who live in this part of the world.

11323,topic-id,499,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Gibbs for yielding.  The Akron Beacon Journal, a few days ago, wrote an extraordinary editorial about Ralph The last paragraph sums Congressman Regula up best: ``What would benefit Congress and the country today are more lawmakers like Ralph Regula, devoted to their districts without losing sight of the larger picture. He wasn't just superb at legislating. He delivered what governing requires.'' I couldn't say it any better.  We in Ohio lost a truly wonderful person, a great Ohio has lost three of them in the last year who I served with here in the United States Congress who made this body a better place and who made this country a better place: nearly a year ago, Steve LaTourette from northeastern Ohio; earlier this year, Mike Oxley; and now Ralph  Ralph Regula was the dean of the delegation even before I got here, and he was the dean of the delegation when I came here in 2001. One of the great things that Ralph Regula did on our side of the aisle when we were in the minority and then when we were in the majority is he strategically placed members of our team from Ohio throughout all the committees. So you had people on the Appropriations Committee, you had people on the Ways and Means Committee, on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and on the Armed Services Ralph was so thoughtful that way trying to make sure that we represented our State in all sorts of ways.  I got to know Ralph mostly sitting in that corner with Dave Hobson, Ralph Regula, and Steve The dean of the delegation didn't speak loudly. He often spoke softly, but his words were meaningful--and usually right. He was a thoughtful guy who cared about our State, who cared about our country, and who taught so many of us how to legislate not just on the Appropriations Committee, but actually how to get things done. I have fond memories of the lessons that he gave us on an ongoing basis.  I only got to serve with Ralph for 8 years. There are others in the room who got to serve with him a lot longer. But it is safe to say what the Akron Beacon Journal said is right: He knew how to get things done.  He did it in a bipartisan way, he did it with his constituents in mind, and he did it because it was the right thing to do.  There is a long list of things that he accomplished and that got done. He didn't brag about it. He just did it in his soft-spoken, nice, gentlemanly way. The gentleman from Navarre contributed and gave more than he ever got.

11302,topic-id,1308,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding.  Certainly I understand the anger, Representative Garamendi, and I know I am not alone. I know all of my colleagues are hearing the outbursts in our given districts about the foolishness and the hard-heartedness of taking away a very valuable asset. Healthcare coverage is so important now to the American public, but in a particular way, it is near and dear to those who most recently realized that coverage.  I will tell you, being on this floor when the Affordable Care Act was passed, that was a monumental effort. It was difficult to launch that program. It took a lot of hard work, years of messaging, going to hearings, working those amendments that were suggested into the discussion, and making certain that the package met the mission that we embarked upon. So it is important now to make certain that we only go forward and upward from this moment.  Like many programs before the Affordable Care Act--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid--they were difficult to launch; but unlike those programs, Congress and the Presidents in those given eras came forward and said: What did we learn from that launch? How can we improve upon the package? How can we strengthen some of the dynamics of concern?  Here we have people, as you indicated, that are not only unwilling to make those reforms possible, but disguising what they call healthcare reform in the name of a tax package for the wealthy. How vulgar is that, when you can sweep the dollars, the savings from denying people healthcare coverage, and utilize it to relieve taxes for those most comfortable in our society? For those 400 households of which you spoke, the on-average relief was on the order of $7 million. Imagine that: taking away healthcare from people who live paycheck to paycheck in some cases, and using that to provide for tax relief for those most comfortable.  That is not in keeping with the spirit of this legislation. It is not in keeping with the harmony that was necessary to create this legislation.  The spirit was to speak to the fundamental needs of healthcare for individuals and families across this country to be able to get past difficult moments and situations like preexisting conditions, preexisting conditions that can be with an individual toddler from the moment of birth, as we have heard in the news.  This hard-hearted approach, this senseless attitude, this insensitive expression to Americans across this country by these reform efforts, today we know that the United States Senate went forth with a vote to proceed on their efforts. What will it be? Straightforward repeal, as the President recommends, where 30-plus million people lose their healthcare coverage, you rip it away from those tens of millions? Or will it be repeal and delay? Or will it be repeal and replace?  So far with the iterations, the versions of healthcare reform that have come forth from this House, that were approved in this House and sent over to the Senate, those devised by the Senate have been heartless.  This is about expressing compassion, about being just and fair.  Just this weekend I was with groups of constituents. The first that comes to mind is a fundraising effort for individuals who live with cystic fibrosis. Before I was even to walk into the room, where hundreds of people gathered to support the efforts for this cause, individual sets of parents came to me and said: Keep up the fight to keep Medicaid in the equation.                              {time}  1845  Our daughter, our son, can't do it without And these people were proud of their given children, adult children, in some cases, who had graduated with honors, played athletics and were athletes, star athletes in their high school years who, then, earned full scholarships to college. And his daughter made him most proud; he cited that moment of pride when he witnessed her on her campus wheeling her IV to class.  That is what we see out there, motivation, inspiration, respect for people who live with difficult challenges in life. And we were responding as a compassionate society, one that should separate us from the rest of the world because, within our abundance, we want to share that with everybody.  And it is so wonderful, Representative Garamendi, that you would bring that quote from the memorial, that speaks to the abundance of those who have where we are, evidently, with some of the constructs of legislation here, adding to that abundance, at the expense of those who have precious little. And so we can do better than this.  One other gathering that I attended was for developmentally disabled, differently-abled individuals whose programs focus and strengthen their abilities, focus upon and strengthen their abilities; again, people approaching me saying: Keep up the fight for  We cannot, our consumers cannot, do it. Our loved ones cannot do it without And I think the rejection of Medicaid expansion in this House that was offered by this House, by this town, by Washington, to the many States across the country, the rejection by those States, I believe, was sheer politics. And so, we denied people in States who pay Federal taxes the benefits of Medicaid expansion.  What sense does that make? What heart does that show? We are better than that. We are better than that.  Finally, I will say this, because I know we have colleagues who are looking to share their thoughts and their stories. I looked at some constituents this weekend, in the eyes, and in heartfelt conversation said: Do you think it is fair, do you think it is just to rip away healthcare from people so you can afford a tax cut for the very wealthy? Is it fair to deny preexisting condition coverage for individuals? Is it unfair to take it away?  What about the essential health benefits package, those of our neighbors and friends who struggle, who live with mental illness and mental health disorders, those who are dealing with the illness of addiction? Is it fair not to help them?  I looked at them, and I said: Okay, I know who you voted for. This is a nation where we have the freedom of choice. But when we vote for whomever, it is also our duty, our responsibility to see if they are acting accordingly. Do you think your candidate of choice is being fair and just?  They couldn't answer me about that situation. They wanted to redirect the conversation. Why?  Because I think it is difficult to say that people, leaders in this town, the President and leaders in the House and the leaders in the Senate, are not listening to America; and so it is unfair to utilize the sweeping of services, of healthcare and response to tens of millions of individuals and families, and utilize those dollars for a tax cut for the wealthy.  We are going to watch this aggressively, with laser sharp focus. The people of America have spoken. They are continuing to speak. They don't like the injustices. They don't like the unfairness. They don't like the calculated ripping away of healthcare insurance for tens of millions of people. Whether it is 30, 23, 22, 21, whatever the iteration, shame on us for allowing something like that to happen.  America deserves to be--as an industrialized nation that did not have access, affordability, and quality of care as givens for many households in this country, they need to express those terms in a much better format.[[Page H6289]]  Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative Garamendi for leading us in a discussion this hour to alert people to the fact that the Democrats in this House are still battling for those families that would have healthcare coverage ripped from them so that we can afford a tax cut for the wealthy.

Those are such essential forces. They are the underpinning of the foundation of the Affordable Care  When I heard your expression of concern here tonight and pinpointing those various elements of the positive reinforcement that comes from the Affordable Care Act legislation, hearing the voice of two Congresswomen here from New Mexico and Ohio on the floor joining us, it reminds me that our force is the essential force on the Hill in Washington to make certain that the people's voices are heard. There is anger out there, there is injustice, there is unfairness, and it has to be addressed.  I am proud of the efforts that have been made in my I know that you talked about the progress in In New York, I am proud of what the Governor, Governor Cuomo, and the legislature did in building those exchanges. It took response from each of the 50 States to make this work, or at least we had hoped each State would respond fully. But in New York, we are managing that effort through sound exchanges.  I get worried when I see tweets from the President when things didn't work for awhile in the Senate, when they couldn't move forward with the repeal or repeal and delay or repeal and replace: Well, we will just let the Affordable Care Act die of its own right.  What are you talking about? That sounds to me like a poor attitude, one that wouldn't do the very best to underpin, through the agencies that are connected to this legislation, to reinforce the markets out there. That is part of this response.  When I hear an attitude like that expressed, I am concerned about what the voice over to these agencies will be saying: Look, we need to be a good partner, a sound partner, an effective partner with the Affordable Care  I don't know if we would get that. So that worries me if your attitude is let it just die and crumble. Why? Why can't you put the American public before politics?  Let's do our best effort. Let's, in earnest, do our best. Let's be genuine in our approach.  I think it is absolutely incredible. You know, as the Republicans, Representative Garamendi, in the Senate race to pass TrumpCare, a bill that would rip coverage away from tens of millions of people, perhaps as many as 30 million--if you would allow me to share a few stories from my district, I think it is so important to put a face onto these discussions. I have documented some of the recent stories we have heard from constituents.  Cathryn, a 30-year-old in my district, left work to return to school to pursue graduate studies in social work, and she used the ACA exchange, their plans, to bridge gaps in employer-based coverage.                              {time}  1915  The ACA plans provided her with essential preventative healthcare services and ensured that a major health event would not leave her bankrupt as she was doing what we asked people to do: develop your talent and your skills to serve the general public.  So she was pursuing graduate studies. The security and affordability of Catherine's ACA plan was tremendously reassuring, allowing her to take risks in order to build a career in service to others. That is what the ACA afforded Catherine to do, a 30-year-old in my district.  Robert, a 52-year-old in my district, purchased insurance on a healthcare exchange while suffering from diabetes. Before buying an exchange plan, Robert spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars each month just to purchase insulin, and no other health coverage.  Because of the ban on discrimination that could be utilized against him based on his preexisting conditions, Robert can now afford a health plan that covers himself and his family.  A couple of other examples, if you will allow me.  Tracey, a 38-year-old from my district, a certified nursing assistant, needs multiple drug prescriptions to treat preexisting conditions, including diabetes. The Affordable Care Act has made it possible for Tracey to get health coverage for herself and her family. Without the ACA, Tracey would not be able to pay her doctors or her drug companies. As recently as January, Tracey was still paying off old bills for her medical care.  This has provided hope for people. We need to make certain we don't have people digging deeper into their pockets for healthcare coverage. We want to relieve that pressure that is upon them. We want to make prescription drugs affordable. We want to make certain that efficiencies are there in the system so we can save, but get the care to people.  That is the difference that we need to cite here. The contrast is that we are trying to make this ACA better and make it work, and we are asking for a bipartisan, bicameral, executive legislative partnership to make it better. Is that too much to ask?  Let me share one more story.  Elliot, a 56-year-old in the 20th Congressional District of New York lost his job in September last year after his company made a massive layoff, even though he just started his job. So through no fault of his own, he lost his employment. Elliot was then left to figure out how to support himself and his 19-year-old son who was a Syracuse University student. A COBRA plan would have cost $2,000 a month. Because of Medicaid, Elliot and his son now have quality health coverage as Elliot continues to look for work and his son is pursuing his college education.  These are real stories, real hardships, real challenges, real help, real assistance that has come in the way of these families. We don't need to take that good news and suffocate it. We need to build upon these stories.  Now, Senate Republicans are racing to pass a bill that would open the doors to less coverage, rip it away from tens of millions of people, and in many ways perhaps provide for an imposition of lifetime limits on care.  What does that do?[[Page H6292]]  It is a death sentence for far too many people. It would impact severely upon those who are struggling with cancer--working their hardest to defeat that, working with their doctor, their medical community to defeat that impact of cancer in their lives--heart disease, and other long-term illnesses.  My friends, this is about being a compassionate voice. It is about utilizing the advancements in medical care, technology, making affordable our healthcare system, making affordable prescription drug costs.  There is improvements that we want to make, not give a tax cut for the rich, which has been a terrible response. People would say: Oh, the Affordable Care Act is not working.  So if there were improvements required, be fair, be only honest with the public you represent, be there for them.  Finally, the last point I will make right here is Medicaid and the changing profile of Medicaid in many of our In New York, people need to see where the growth in Medicaid is. And because we have a disproportionate senior population in upstate New York, you are seeing the growth of Medicaid the farther north you go.  I ask my colleagues to be sensitive to their constituent base. Don't be heartless. Don't be cruel in the outcome. Walk away from this.  The silence is deafening at times when it comes to some of the proposals being sent by leadership in this House and in the Silence is not what is called for here.
