                 WELCOMING THE DEVIL BRIGADE BACK HOME

  (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, more than 3,000 soldiers with the Army's 
1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, are headed home 
to Fort Riley in my district this month after a 9-month deployment in 
South Korea.
  Also known as the ``Devil Brigade,'' these soldiers have been 
stationed in South Korea since October of last year. During their 
deployment, these American soldiers have trained closely with their 
South Korean partners, deterring North Korean hostility and providing 
security in the Korean Peninsula. This service is invaluable.
  These soldiers and families sacrificed greatly during their 
deployment. As the Devil Brigade begins to journey back home to Fort 
Riley, may I be the first to thank them for their service and say 
``Welcome Home.''
