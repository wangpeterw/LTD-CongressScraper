13472,topic-id,1380,"Mr.President, last year seems like a long time ago, but just 5 months ago, 94 Members of this body voted for a bill called the 21st Century Cures Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called it the most important legislation of the year. The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Ohio, had a major role in that legislation, especially the part having to do with opioids. This was legislation to spur research and development of cures, devices, and treatments for some of the most deadly and some of the most stubborn illnesses and diseases.  Frances Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health--which he calls the ``National Institutes of Hope''--last year offered what he called bold predictions about major advances that we could expect over the next decade with a sustained commitment to medical research. One prediction of Collins is that science will find ways to identify Alzheimer's before symptoms appear, as well as how to slow down or even prevent the disease. Another is that doctors could use the patient's own stem cells to rebuild his or her heart. An artificial pancreas will help diabetes patients by tracking blood glucose levels and by creating precise doses of insulin. He also predicts a Zika vaccine, a universal flu vaccine, and an HIV/AIDS vaccine in the next 10 years. To relieve suffering and deal with the epidemic of opioid addiction, Collins predicts new, nonaddictive pain treatments to manage pain.  The 21st Centuries Cures Act became a law last year and authorized 4.8 billion new dollars for medical research, on top of the support Congress already provides through the annual appropriations process. Because of bipartisan support, that was an extra $2 billion last year and an extra $2 billion this year. The way we add up money around here, over 10 years, that is $20 billion over 10 years last year and another $20 billion this year, which includes the $4.8 billion authorized in the 21st Century Cures legislation, all for medical research.  The next step in our efforts to turn Collins' predictions into a reality and to help America's patients benefit from all the research we are helping support is to fund the Food and Drug The FDA, as we call it, is the agency responsible for making good on the promise of the 21st Centuries Cures Act to actually reach America's patients.  Before September 30 of this year, four different FDA user fee agreements need to be reauthorized. They need to be acted on by the Senate, by the House, and sent to the President of the United These user fees are paid by manufacturers of drugs and medical devices and account for $8 billion to $9 billion over 5 years and over a quarter of all FDA funding.  Last week, 21 of the 23 members of the Senate HELP Committee voted to send to the Senate floor a bill reauthorizing those four user fee agreements based on recommendations from industry and from the FDA after a thorough and lengthy public process.  The FDA Reauthorization Act, sponsored by me and by Senator Murray, the distinguished Senator from Washington who is the ranking Democrat on our Senate HELP Committee, reauthorizes the four user fee agreements that expire at the end of The four agreements are, 1, the prescription drug user fee, which accounted for 70 percent of the brand drug review budget last year; 2, medical device user fee amendments, which accounted for 36 percent of the medical device review budget in fiscal[[Page S2954]]year 2016; the generic drug user fee amendments, which accounted for over 75 percent of the generic drug review budget in fiscal year 2016; and the biosimilar user fee amendments, which accounted for 29 percent of the biosimilar review budget in fiscal year 2016.  So here is my message to colleagues: The U.Senate has the opportunity to provide Americans with a prompt, bipartisan reauthorization of the Food and Drug Administration user fee agreements and, in doing so, take the next crucial step in helping Americans see the benefits of the results of our 21st Century Cures Act passed last year. If we do not move quickly to pass these agreements in late July, the FDA will be forced to send layoff notices to more than 5,000 FDA employees to notify them that they may lose their job in 60 days.  As I said, these reauthorizations are based on recommendations both from industry and from the Food and Drug Administration after a thorough public process. The FDA posted meeting minutes after every negotiation and held public meetings before discussions began and to hear feedback on the draft recommendations last fall.  Patients were also involved in developing commitment letters. We have received support from patient groups asking us to authorize the agreements expeditiously.  In Congress, over the last 15 months, the Senate HELP Committee, of which I am chairman and Senator Murray is the ranking Democrat, had 15 bipartisan briefings, some of which were with the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives, and heard, as well, from the FDA and industry about the reauthorization.  Our HELP Committee held two bipartisan hearings earlier this year on the Food and Drug Administration medical device and drug user fees and released a discussion draft of our legislation on April 14, which provided 2 weeks for public comment.  I go into all this because I want everyone to see how thoroughly this has been discussed and how important it is.  The committee then worked in a bipartisan way to incorporate comments from the public and from members of the committee.  The manager's amendment--which we approved in the committee last week, as I said, by a vote of 21 to 2--includes many priorities that are broadly bipartisan. Here are a few examples: legislation from Senators Isakson and Bennet to improve the medical device inspection process; a provision from Senator Hassan, Democrat, and Senator Young, Republican, to improve communication about abuse-deterrent opioid products; from Senators Franken, Democrat, and Senator Enzi, Republican, a provision to encourage medical device development for children and make sure FDA has the appropriate expertise to review devices for children; from Senator Baldwin, a provision to make sure the full experience of clinical trial participants is studied; from Senator Burr and Senator Young, additional reporting to make sure that the FDA is meeting their goals and that we can do proper oversight of the new agreements. It includes legislation by Senators Casey, Franken, and Warren on a pilot project on studying medical devices after approval to make sure they work as intended. A provision from Senator Cassidy requiring additional guidance for complex generics, like EpiPens, so manufacturers know what they have to do to make a generic version, was also included. A provision to make new hearing aid technology available came from Senators Warren and Isakson, as well as a provision from Senators Roberts, Donnelly, and Burr to allow more appropriate classification of accessories used with medical devices.  In the committee markup last week, we unanimously adopted these bipartisan amendments, which follow: an amendment from Senator Collins, which reflected legislation from Senators Collins, Franken, McCaskill, and Cotton on improving generic drug development and helping to lower prescription drug costs; an amendment from Senators Hatch, Burr, and Casey to improve patient access to clinical trials.  A delay in reauthorizing these agreements would delay the review of drugs and devices submitted after last April 1--more than a month ago. If we don't pass these reauthorizations into law on time, which means by the end of July, an FDA reviewer who gets started reviewing a cancer drug submitted to the agency in April would be laid off on October 1, before the reviewer is able to finish his or her work. In addition to harming patients and harming families who rely on medical innovation, a delay in the reauthorization would threaten America's global leadership in biomedical innovation.  After reviewing the recommendations from industry and from the FDA, I am convinced these are good agreements for patients. The sooner we pass this legislation, the better, to give certainty to patients, doctors, FDA reviewers, and companies.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

13495,topic-id,383,"Mr.Speaker, in the preamble of the Constitution, our Founding Fathers explained a more perfect Union required the Federal Government to do a few things, and to do them well. At the top of the list is the Federal Government's responsibility to provide for the common defense and secure our freedom.  There is no freedom without security. These concepts, these pillars upon which this great Nation was founded, must be proactively protected every day by men and women across this A select few of those men and women wake up every morning to patrol and protect our sovereign Nation's border in the face of drug smuggling, human trafficking, and violent criminal activity.                              {time}  1530  They work to safeguard our Nation, enforce the rule of law, and promote free trade and commerce through our ports of entry. Yet the previous administration's policy left our Border Patrol and Customs operations hamstrung and significantly understaffed.  As someone who represents a border State, I have seen and experienced those vulnerabilities firsthand.  To say that our Border Patrol and Customs operations are woefully understaffed is woefully understated. We are almost 3,000 officers and agents short of the minimum that is mandated by One reason for this understaffing is the unreasonable and protracted hiring processes.  In 2015, it took more than 460 days, on average, and 11 separate steps to hire a new officer or agent. This is absolutely absurd, even by government standards, and it must be fixed. That is why today I am proud to cosponsor H.2213. This legislation provides a more commonsense and expeditious process for hiring border personnel.  We also need enough Customs officers to foster efficient trade for a robust economy. A recent study found that every batch of 33 CBP officers hired could lead to an increase in GDP of $60 million and an employment gain of over 1,000 jobs. For too long, the Federal Government has abdicated its chief responsibility of securing our borders and protecting our citizens. We must put the safety and security of the American people first and give our Border Patrol and the CBP the staff they need to do their job.  Mr.Speaker, therefore, I urge my colleagues to support H.2213, and I applaud Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Vela, and Representative McSally for their leadership on this critical issue.

13450,topic-id,1093,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak about Sexual Assault Awareness Month and the need to support those who have been victimized by this terrible crime.  According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, nearly 1 in 4 women and 1 in 10 men will experience sexual violence, and 7 out of 10 sexual assault cases are committed by someone who the survivor knows.  Nearly 50 percent of female survivors will experience PTS, or post trauma stress, and per the Rape and Incest National Network, only 2 percent of those offenders will spend jail time or be convicted of a felony.  Sex trafficking is a prevalent problem, and according to the U.State Department, 600,000 to 800,000 people are trafficked across international borders. Of those numbers, 80 percent are female and half are children.  Sex trafficking occurs when someone uses fraud, force, or coercion to cause a commercial sexual act with an adult or cause a minor to commit a commercial sexual act.  Thus, victims of sex trafficking are also victims of assault. They are threatened, taken from families and loved ones, and forced to commit acts they would not do on their own free will.  These statistics demand action. I personally know victims of sexual assault, and I have tackled it head-on while as a commander. I started this journey when I was a commander at the Ramstein Air Base in  When I arrived there as a new base commander in 2008, the allegations of sexual assault were too high. I implemented a two-step solution to address the problem.  First, all rape accusers, if willing to testify, would have their day in court, have their day to say what happened to a jury.  Second, those convicted of rape would have their names and prison sentences distributed widely around the base. Our rates immediately improved. This program was later ranked by the Air Force as the number one sexual assault response program--the number one in the Air So I take this issue seriously.  I recently met with Courtney, a constituent in my district in Omaha, who was sexually assaulted while serving as a marine. She shared her story with me, including how she was treated after reporting the rape. And what she told me greatly disheartened me. I could not believe that someone who proudly served in uniform was basically ostracized by the very people she served with.  She felt persecuted and ignored for daring to report an assault that should not have occurred, from simple acts of being ignored to having her belongings thrown out of the barracks in black trash bags by her fellow servicemen.  Courtney was not only a victim of assault, but a victim of repeated backlash from superiors and colleagues. Courtney developed PTS because of not only the assault, but how she was treated for reporting the assault.  In my district office is Makayla, an intern who at the young age of 15 was molested by her father. Makayla's parents were divorced, and one weekend when she was alone with her biological father, the horrendous crime took place.  She would live in fear for the next 2 years until, finally, by the grace of God, she told her mom what happened. The days following were a whirlwind, from giving testimony to telling her grandparents what their son had done to her.  The lives of both women will never be the same. However, they both know and both knew that God would turn their trauma into triumph.  Makayla is now a college student at the University of Nebraska Omaha and shares her story at colleges, schools, nonprofits, and other organizations all over After graduating, she wants to work in politics to change the policies surrounding sexual assault cases.  Courtney is also speaking out and has started a blog on social media sites detailing her journey to recovery and sharing her story so others know that they are not alone.[[Page H2906]]  She also will be staying in touch with me about potential legislation and ideas to help those who are victims of sexual assault in the military.  There are many in Omaha who deserve recognition for the work they do every day to combat sexual assault and human trafficking to help victims. The Women's Center for Advancement helps victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. They have a hotline that victims can call and make that their first step in getting the help they need.  Project Harmony offers victims of child sexual assault the opportunity to take forensic interviews instead of having to appear in court, which can retraumatize the victims.  The Coalition on Human Trafficking is training staff at hotels and motels to be able to identify possible victims of sex trafficking. The goal is to provide the awareness training to all hotels within a 50-mile radius of Omaha, and to date they have trained over 85 locations.  Finally, we can't forget the members of law enforcement who work tirelessly to catch those responsible for sexual assault and human trafficking. Without them, there would be so many more victims who would still be abused, assaulted, and traumatized.  And while there are law enforcement and others dedicated to stopping these assaults and human trafficking, there is more that could be done.  Earlier this month I joined my colleagues as an original cosponsor on H.2052, also known as the PRIVATE Act, which would amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice to provide harsher penalties to anyone who engages in what is known as revenge porn.  The Violence Against Women's Act of 1994 also helps provide some justice. This act used Federal funds to help investigate and prosecute sex offenders and establish the Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice, a program we must continue to support.  Finally, I have agreed to cosponsor H.1035, the Extending Justice for Sex Crimes Act of 2017, which amends the statute of limitations for a victim of human trafficking or a Federal sexual offense to seek and recover damages.  This bill sets a 10-year statute of limitations from the date the victim discovers the offense or injury and not when it occurred to file a civil action. It also extends the statute of limitations for a minor victim to file a civil action for 10 years from the date that the victim turns 18. Currently it stands at 3 years.  Sexual assault and exploitation is a social problem and a crime. We need to step up and assist with prevention of these acts, prosecute the perpetrators, and provide the provisions for resources for victims.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-27-pt1-PgH2905-2.txt,99999999999999,ANTI-BORDER CORRUPTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,27.0,June
13521,topic-id,813,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to honor two lifelong servants from the State of Nebraska, former Speaker of Legislature Ron Withem and his wife,  Speaker Withem is retiring this month from 2 decades with the University of Nebraska, where he has served as the associate vice president for university affairs and the director of governmental relations.  As we see the end of one's historic career, we are reminded of the positive impact one person can have on so many. Ron and Diane Withem have selflessly dedicated their lives to the State of Nebraska both in educating our youth as well as through the legislative process. The impact they have made on the entire State of Nebraska is evident all around us in  The story of the Withems is one full of many accomplishments. After moving to Papillion, Ron and Diane both became respected teachers in our local school district. Prior to entering politics, Ron was a teacher of history. Diane spent nearly 4 decades teaching in the Papillion-LaVista schools and prepared many students for college and success, including my own chief of staff, Mark  As leaders in our Democratic Party, Diane and Ron's political journey began in 1976, when they campaigned for Hess Dyas during the U.Senate primary. Later that year, they both worked for another former Second District Congressman, John Cavanagh, in the general election. Following Congressman Cavanagh's victory, Ron served as a congressional aide in his local office.  By the 1980s, Ron was a member of the Papillion-LaVista School Board and was a member of the Papillion Planning When the legislative seat in District 14 became vacant in 1983, Ron was tapped by Governor Bob Kerry to serve out the term. And serve he did.  Ron Withem dedicated 14 years of his life in our legislature, serving as the chairperson of the Urban Affairs Committee, the chairperson of the Education Committee, and the high mark being his election as the first Democratic speaker since 1970, which happened in a Republican-majority body of our officially nonpartisan legislature.  During that time, he rose to become one of the most well-respected voices in our unicameral, proudly working on issues that he was passionate about and that would have had a profound impact on our  Some of his accomplishments are easily visible, such as the Harrison Street Interstate Working alongside local elected officials and business leaders, Ron's strong advocacy paved the way for what is now one of our most vibrant areas in the district.  A leader among leaders, Ron was instrumental in sponsoring and guiding many other important pieces of legislation into law. He negotiated the State's first major reform in K-12 educational funding, sponsored legislation granting tuition waivers for veterans' dependents, led efforts to improve accessibility and the transparency of our elections, and he worked to create Nebraska's first bone marrow drive system.  Through his years in public office, he was well-respected by both his colleagues as well as his constituents. Ron was known for his uncanny ability to remember bill numbers, the year a bill was discussed, and even the most[[Page H5304]]minute details surrounding the debate. As his former aide, Michelle Waite, said: ``He might be a donkey, but Ron had the memory of an elephant for sure.'' He was considered a master legislative strategist who knew how to pull together a coalition from both parties to get the people's business done.  After 14 years of serving in the legislature, Ron went to work for the University of During his tenure, he made a tremendous impact on our State by leading the university's legislative relations strategy. He also was the force behind the Building a Healthier Nebraska legislative initiative. The result of this initiative was a new cancer center, veterinary diagnostic center, and a health sciences center facility.  Ron was one of the architects behind the compromise that transferred the Nebraska State fairgrounds to the University of Nebraska for the development of the Nebraska Innovation This public-private partnership leverages university research for economic benefit, all the while preserving some of the history of our State fairgrounds.  His colleagues at the university talk about their tremendous respect for He was known for building quality relationships with others and his ability to meet daily challenges with positivity. Ron once said: ``My goal is to communicate to policymakers the enormous value the University of Nebraska brings to the State and its people.''  His passion for the university and the success of Nebraska's youth motivated him to work in higher education State relations. His achievements in higher education State relations did not go unnoticed. At the Higher Education Government Relations Conference in 2013, Ron was awarded the Marvin ``Swede'' Johnson Achievement Award, a very prestigious national level award.  As a fellow citizen of Papillion, I want to thank both Ron and Diane Withem for their positive impact that they have made serving our community and our                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgH5303-2.txt,99999999999999,ANTI-BORDER CORRUPTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,29.0,June

13408,topic-id,1515,"Mr.President, as you know, last night President Trump fired FBI Director James He did this in the middle of an active FBI investigation into possible links between the Trump campaign, Trump associates, and the Russian This action should worry every Member of the I know it worries the people we represent. My office has been flooded with calls since this decision became public. Americans are asking why this firing happened now, why the firing happened at all--and they are right to ask.  Officially, President Trump said the FBI Director's dismissal was necessary to restore the ``public trust and confidence'' in the That is laughable. Anybody who knows Director Comey or knows the FBI knows that statement is completely false. I had my issues with the decisions that Director Comey had made over the past months. I never called for his removal, but I know that he did not have a negative effect on morale at the Justice Department or in the  I worked for a Deputy Attorney General of the United I am so disappointed in the tone of the letter written by this Deputy Attorney General--we learned this afternoon--at the request of the President of the United This is not a letter that came up through the chain at DOJ, but a conversation--as the public reports are tonight--that happened at the White House, where the Deputy Attorney General and the President agreed mutually that it was time for Director Comey to go.  The President, apparently, asked the Deputy Attorney General to put it in writing. Then he wrote a letter, the[[Page S2876]]type of which I have never seen come from the Deputy Attorney General's office. I worked on reports that we made with the Office of Professional Responsibility at the Department of I never saw a report like this before. But what I really find amazing about this decision--and I don't know why the decision was made; I am the first to say that I don't know--is that, having been in the Senate, having worked in the Deputy Attorney General's office at the Department of Justice, that nobody at the White House said to the President: Maybe the best thing to do is not to fire the FBI Director when he is in the middle of an investigation about ties of your campaign to Russia, because maybe that will undermine Americans' confidence in the rule of law, and maybe that will undermine Americans' confidence in this administration and worry people that the FBI isn't treating this fairly. The idea that not a single member of the administration was successful in making that case to the President is really worrisome to me tonight, and it is one of the reasons why people think the answer to why this firing occurred is simply not credible.  President Trump, unlike some, has repeatedly praised Director Comey over the past months. He said he had guts. He said: ``I respect him a lot.'' Now, overnight, based on a completely nonroutine letter written at the request of the President, he has turned 180 degrees.  The American people deserve an explanation for this unprecedented action. They deserve an explanation tonight. They deserved one this afternoon. They know this isn't how our government is supposed to work. I think the reason why people in Colorado and in other parts of the country, I am sure, are concerned is that this dismissal is not the first action the President has taken that raised concerns about his commitment to the rule of law or his commitment to the independent judiciary or to the freedom of the press under the First Amendment when he doesn't like the scrutiny he or his administration are getting from a free press. He does not have a fundamental appreciation for the basic institutions and traditions of this country.  It is a great irony, I think, at this moment in our politics, that the President represents a radical view of American history and American traditions. It is my hope that this Senate--Republicans and Democrats working together--can express together a conservative view of those traditions, a view that says: We need to preserve the sanctity of the rule of law. We need to preserve and elevate the idea that the judicial branch is an independent judiciary, separate from the legislative branch, separate from the executive branch.  The Founders knew that when they wrote the One of their biggest concerns was that somehow the judiciary and the executive branch might reach some sort of unholy alliance that would all of a sudden call the rule of law into question.  I think that is why people are worried. They are worried because they remember this President slandered a judge because of his ethnicity and said that he wouldn't be able to decide a case fairly because of where his parents came from. They remember his attacks on the free press, as well, when he doesn't like their reporting, and his resorting to talking about fake news when he doesn't like the reporting.  I have had to talk with so many high school students and middle school students in Colorado over the last 4 or 5 months about this whole question of fake news and what the importance of edited content is to our society and, again, to our commitment to the rule of law--the importance that middle school students and high school students place on edited content and on curated content; their ability to distinguish between something that is science or something that is real, something that is edited versus somebody shooting their mouth off on the internet.  The President has a hard time making that distinction, as well. He has shown little regard for the traditions and norms that our Founders established when they created this separation of powers.  So I say to my colleagues tonight, the Senate must stand firm and speak with one voice--Democrats and We now have a vacancy in the FBI Director, and we need to make sure that whoever that is, whoever replaces James Comey, pledges to continue the ongoing investigation and reinforce the FBI's independence from undue influence from the White That needs to be nonnegotiable. In my view, that is the least that must happen.  In order for the American people to learn the full truth, the Deputy Attorney General must immediately appoint an independent special prosecutor to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, which, by the way, everybody I know up here believes happened. But the President continues to say: Maybe it was the Chinese; maybe it wasn't the No intelligence agency in America believes that. No Senator believes that.  The President, who has access to all of that intelligence, is saying: It might not have been the Russians; it might be the  We need to know. I am not prejudging the result, but we need to know what these links were, if there were links, between the Trump campaign and the Russian These are serious questions that need answers. I worry a lot about what the President has said about our allies in Europe, what the President has said about NATO, what the President has said about the European Union--none of which serves the national security interests of the United States but is an invitation to the Russians to continue to meddle in elections, not just here but in Western Europe and in Eastern Europe as well. It is hard for me to see how that is in anybody's national security interest, except for the Russians or President  Our intelligence agencies have been crystal clear to the Members of Congress that the Russian Government tried to influence the 2016 election in President Trump's favor. The American people deserve to know what the truth is. What is the extent of these relationships? It goes to the core of our security. It goes to the heart of our democracy. That is why preserving this investigation's integrity is so vital.  I can tell you that the American people are not going to relent. I understand there will be some time here when people want to collect their thoughts and gather their thoughts. The American people are not going to relent. They are going to want an independent investigation here. For all Americans and, I would say, most of the time, but certainly at moments like this--this is a moment in the course of our politics when they say to us: Partisanship needs to give way to patriotism. This is one of those moments.  I urge every Member of this body, every Member of Congress, to rise above the pressure of the moment and see this not as just another skirmish in our endless and often pathetic feuding but as a test of the resilience of these institutions and of our Republic, a test of whether we as Congress stand for something more than winning praise from our base in a cable news cycle or in the next election or whether we take seriously our oaths to put our institutions, our security, and our country first.

13489,topic-id,655,"Mr.Speaker, we begin an unusual week here on Capitol Hill, although unusual is sort of the new usual in Washington, D. The Senate begins deliberations on an 8-year Republican mission to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and they don't fully know what it is exactly they are voting on.  There is uncertainty in the House over both the budget and appropriations, but, you know, there is an opportunity for Congress to take a step back, to do something that will make a huge difference for everybody from coast to coast, something that can bring together a wide coalition of support and meet unmet needs.                              {time}  1015  I am talking about addressing the unmet infrastructure needs for a country that is falling apart as we fall behind.  We haven't raised the gas tax in 24 years. And in the course of that 24 years, we have watched the value of the Federal gas tax actually erode 40 percent, due to inflation and increased fuel efficiency, while our needs continue to go up each and every year.  Congress has put together a series of stopgap measures--gimmicks here and there--which have not adequately met those needs, and they have actually increased the budget deficit.  I think back to Ronald Reagan making his Thanksgiving Day speech in November of 1982, when he called on Congress to come back from their recess and more than double the gas tax because, he pointed out, it would put people to work and improve road conditions that were actually damaging people's cars more than what modest increase they would pay. Well, Congress did it, and we were better off as a result. I think each of us would do well to look back at that speech that Ronald Reagan gave, calling on Congress to step up and do its part.  The States are not sitting back. Since over the last 5 years, more than half of the individual States have gone ahead and raised their transportation funding. So far in 2017 alone, California, Indiana, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, West Virginia, and South Carolina raised the gas tax. In fact, South Carolina raised the gas tax by overriding a Republican Governor's veto.  There are opportunities here for us to be able to step forward and build on this vast coalition. It really isn't a profile in courage to support legislation that is endorsed by the U.Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, contractors, a variety of labor unions, road builders, engineers, trucking companies, and The widest coalition of people supporting any major issue before us deals with increasing the fuel tax.  And it is interesting, for those who are worried that maybe there is some political downturn, despite the fact that the States have been able to summon the courage. The American Road and Transportation Builders Association did an extensive survey about who were those intrepid legislators that voted to raise the gas tax since 2012. What they found is that those legislators who had the courage and the vision to do what was right for their States were reelected by an over 90 percent rate.  But this shouldn't be about elections. It should be about what is right for the American people. Stepping up, meeting our obligations, so that the Federal Government is a full partner, working with State and local governments, working with the private sector, to be able to meet the over $1.1 trillion of critical transportation needs between now and 2025 ought to be the order of business.  I would hope that my friends in Republican leadership would allow us to have just 1 week of hearings on this issue so that we can hear from the president of the U.Chamber of Commerce, the president of the AFL-CIO, the truckers, AAA, Republican legislators of principle, people across the country who talk about the need to rebuild and renew America, make our communities more livable, our families safer, healthier, and more economically secure.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgH6219.txt,99,PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR,2017.0,25.0,June

13601,topic-id,554,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1927, which is on the floor this afternoon, the African American Civil Rights Network This is to honor the sad, yet heroic struggle for civil rights in America, a struggle for those who participated in the civil rights movement, a struggle for people that were, in fact, soldiers in a war for justice and democracy.  We appropriately and regularly honor the soldiers who wore uniforms and went to Europe and Asia to defend our country, and we appropriately and properly give them benefits that they deserve for what they did to protect democracy and justice.  But what we forget is those citizens in America who had to fight their own government and their own country for those same rights of justice and democracy.  Enslaved for over 250 years, and then treated in a netherworld of segregation for 100 years, and then slowly creeping in after Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 and the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act of the sixties and to this day, those who fought for civil rights deserve to be recognized as soldiers for justice and democracy, and this bill will honor their work with the Civil Rights Network Act in our country.  They used protests to gain public attention and, eventually, to spur judicial and legislative action. It goes all the way back to W.E.DuBois and others who fought when they weren't so popular and on television.  H.1927 would establish a Civil Rights Network to commemorate and honor the history of the civil rights movement. And I want to encourage that the proposed sites include the Memphis Heritage Trail, which has applied for funding as part of that historical network.  It was in Memphis, unfortunately, in April of 1968, where Martin Luther King, Jr., was slain. King gave his last speech in Memphis the night before at the Mason Temple, the ``I Have[[Page H6307]]Been to the Mountaintop'' speech. And it was in Memphis where he started his last march about a week earlier, marching from the historic Clayborn Temple with the AFSCME workers--the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees--who were garbage workers not recognized as a union and not recognized as men. ``I am a man.'' King came to Memphis as part of his fight for justice and freedom.  The Clayborn Temple has risen from the ashes and is being renewed in Memphis as a place for events, worship, concerts, and protests. The National Civil Rights Museum has risen at the Lorraine Motel, where King was slain; the National Civil Rights Museum, which is outstanding and, next year, will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the assassination. Our own John Lewis will be there.  H.1927 would help to memorialize these events and these places across the United States and others, from North Carolina, where the sit-ins started, and Nashville, to the voting rights march in Selma, the atrocities in Birmingham, and Rosa Parks and the bus boycott in  Julian Bond, our own John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Viola Liuzzo, Ida Wells, Michael Schwerner, James Cheney, Andrew Goodman, Joseph Lowery, Roy Wilkins, and others will be recognized.

13476,topic-id,1171,"Mr.President, ensuring that more Americans are better prepared financially for their retirement is one of my top priorities.  That is why I rise to reintroduce with my colleague, Senator Nelson, the Retirement Security Act of 2017. Our bill would encourage more small employers to offer retirement plans, provide incentives for employees to save more for retirement, and make it easier for low- and middle-income taxpayers to claim tax benefits for retirement savings already authorized in law.  According to the non-partisan Center for Retirement Research, there is an estimated $7.7 trillion gap between the savings American households need to maintain their standard of living in retirement and what they actually have. A recent Gallup poll found that only 54 percent of working Americans believe that they will have enough money to live comfortably in retirement. We must continue to work to ensure that more Americans will have the resources they need to enjoy their ``golden years.''  The Social Security Administration's most recent report noted that 61 percent of all beneficiaries rely on Social Security for more than half of their income. Many seniors in my State rely almost entirely on Social Security to cover their monthly expenses, despite the fact that the average annual benefit is only about $16,000 per year. It is hard to imagine stretching those dollars far enough to pay the bills--certainly a ``comfortable retirement'' is out of the question.  Sadly, they fare no better when it comes to savings: a survey by the Federal Reserve found that nearly half of individuals do not have enough savings to cover an emergency expense of $400. That is not even enough to buy new tires for a car. For this reason, among others, Americans need to increase their personal savings so that we can better weather financial emergencies without raiding our retirement accounts.  There are many reasons why Americans have struggled to save for retirement, including the shift away from employer-based ``defined benefit'' plans, or pensions; the severity of the recent financial crisis; rising health care costs; the need for expensive long-term care; and most of all, the fact that Americans are living far longer than they did in the past. Many Americans reaching retirement age also have more debt than retirees of previous generations.  Another contributing factor is that employees of small businesses are much less likely to participate in employer-based retirement plans. According to a study by the PEW Charitable Trusts, more than 30 million U.workers lack access to a work-based plan to save for retirement.  Making it easier for smaller businesses to offer retirement plans for their workers would make a significant difference in the financial security of many That is why the bill we are introducing today focuses on reducing the cost and complexity of retirement plans, especially for small businesses, and on encouraging individuals to save more for retirement. Let me describe the provisions of the bill:  First, our bill would make it easier for businesses to enter into multiple employer plans, known as MEPs, to offer retirement programs to their employees. MEPs permit small companies to share the administrative burden of a retirement plan, which helps lower costs. Current law discourages the use of MEPs because it requires a connection, or ``nexus,'' between unrelated businesses in order to join a MEP, such as membership in the same trade association. Our bill would waive the nexus requirement for businesses.  Second, our bill makes joining a MEP a more attractive option for small businesses. Under current law, if one employer in a MEP fails to meet the minimum criteria necessary for retirement plans to obtain tax benefits, all employers and their employees could lose these tax benefits--which are substantial. For employees, benefits include delaying the taxation of income contributed to a plan until funds are[[Page S3652]]withdrawn. For employers, plan disqualification could result in limited deductions and a higher tax burden. Our bill would address this uncertainty, and protect members of a MEP from the failure of one bad apple to meet its obligations.  Third, our bill would reduce the cost of maintaining a retirement plan. Current law requires that participants in a retirement plan receive a variety of notices. Our bill would direct Treasury to simplify, clarify, and consolidate these required notices to lessen costs.  Fourth, the Retirement Security Act would encourage those still in the workforce to save more for retirement. Retirement plans are often designed to comply with existing safe harbors to prevent the IRS from challenging the tax benefits that flow to employees and employers. The existing safe harbor for so-called ``automatic enrollment'' plans effectively caps employee contributions at ten percent of annual pay, with the employer contributing a ``matching'' amount of up to six percent. Our bill would create an additional safe harbor for these plans that would allow employees to receive an employer match on contributions of up to ten percent of their pay. Employees would be able to contribute more than ten percent, albeit without an employer match for contributions above ten percent.  I recognize that businesses that choose to adopt a plan with this new optional safe harbor may face additional costs due to the increased employer match. That is why our bill would also help the smallest businesses--those with fewer than 100 employees--offset this cost by providing a new tax credit equal to the increased match.  I should note that the new retirement plan options for businesses included in our bill are just that--options. No business, large or small, would be required to offer its employees a retirement plan under the Retirement Security  Finally, our bill would ensure that current measures to encourage savings are functioning as they were intended. One such measure is the so-called ``saver's credit,'' which reduces the tax burden on low- and middle-income individuals who contribute to retirement plans, including IRAs and 401(k) plans. Yet the credit cannot be claimed on a Form 1040EZ, which is frequently used by these individuals. A 2013 Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies survey found that only 23 percent of people with household incomes of less than $50,000 per year, the group most likely to qualify, were aware of the saver's credit. To address this, our bill directs Treasury to make the credit available on Form 1040  Mr.President, during my time as chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, I have heard countless stories of retirees whose savings did not go as far as they anticipated. Adequate savings reduce poverty among our seniors. As the HELP Committee noted in a July 2012 report, poverty among our seniors also increases Medicare and Medicaid costs and strains our social safety net. Giving those not yet at retirement age more opportunities to save, and to save more, would help ease this additional burden on entitlement programs that already are projected to be unsustainable.  In light of the positive effects this bill would have in strengthening retirement security for millions of Americans, I urge my colleagues to join Senator Nelson and me in supporting the Retirement Security Act of 2017.  Thank you, Mr.                                ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgS3651.txt,2121,CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,20.0,July
13587,topic-id,344,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise reluctantly in opposition to H.1862, and I regret this opposition because it would add a new offense--well, new offenses--to the current provision in the criminal code providing for mandatory life imprisonment for certain repeat sex offenders.  Now, under section 3559(e) of title 18 of the U.Code, a defendant who has been previously convicted of a Federal felony or State sex offense committed against a child, and who is guilty of a predicate Federal sex offense against a child, must be sentenced to life in prison. H.1862 amends section 3559 to add more Federal predicate offenses on which to base imposition of a life sentence; namely, sexual contact with a minor under the age of 12, aggravated sexual contact with minors between the ages of 12 and 15, and illicit sexual conduct with a minor abroad by a U.citizen. The bill would also provide the requirement that a Federal predicate offense relating to coercion or enticement of a minor be related to prostitution.  Instead, H.1862 would allow coercion or enticement of a minor into any criminal sexual activity to serve as a basis for imposition of a mandatory life sentence. Repeat offenders should, of course, be subject to increased penalties, and, for some offenses, life imprisonment is appropriate. Yet Congress should not mandate that life imprisonment be the only sentencing option.  For far too long, the Federal criminal justice system has relied on an unsustainable system of mass incarceration that is largely driven by inflexible mandatory minimum sentencing. Mandatory minimums are not necessary to impose appropriate sentences. The judge at sentencing has all the information he or she needs to impose a sentence commensurate with the crime committed and the culpability of the offender. Arrived at this way, sentences may still be quite lengthy--perhaps, in some cases, life in prison--but these penalties must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, I encourage my colleagues to join with me and others in opposing this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

After graduating from high school, Jack enlisted in the He served our Nation on Active Duty for 4 years and completed two overseas assignments. Not long after finishing his military service, Jack attended Montana State University--Northern and trained to become a teacher. In 2006, he began teaching at Harlem Public Since arriving in Blaine County, he has grown into a fixture in the local community. Jack has taught history and government to both high school and junior high school students. During the warm months, you will find Jack in the classroom teaching summer school, helping students rise to the next level academically. For the past 4 years, he has taught government courses at the Aaniiih Nakoda Earlier in his teaching career, Jack was an assistant coach for the Harlem Wildcats football team. Through all seasons and across multiple academic levels, Jack has served his fellow Montanans by teaching the historic context and hard-earned value of our constitutional system of government.  Jack has excelled in his transition from a tanker to a teacher. The best part of Jack's story is he loves what he does and plans to continue doing it for a long time. Montanans are grateful for folks like Jack who make our communities stronger.

13614,topic-id,3623,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to speak about the administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.  In 1992, under President George H.Bush, the Senate unanimously approved a treaty to allow the United States to join the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Since then, we have been engaged in a global conversation with nations around the world to tackle the challenges of climate change and ensure that we leave future generations a planet that is not plagued by catastrophic drought, famine, floods, wildfire, and a rising sea level.  After years of intense negotiation, the world finally reached an international agreement that resulted in a global commitment, and 195 countries from around the world, except for 2, came together. Nicaragua abstained; they wanted a stronger agreement. Syria was another country that stepped aside and didn't take part, for obvious reasons. Representing more than 90 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, these 195 countries committed to reducing their carbon emissions to prevent the average global temperature from rising by more than 2 degrees.  I cannot fathom why any President of either political party would want to isolate the United States from the rest of the world, from our allies and trading partners, by leaving this agreement.  President Trump justified this decision with concern for American jobs and American business. Yet, since the election, American business leaders have called him on the phone, sent a barrage of public letters, and paid for full-page ads in newspapers, trying to get the message through to him in any way possible that American business strongly supports the Paris Agreement, which President Trump has walked away from.  Tech companies and retailers, insurance companies, and even energy companies, such as ExxonMobil and BP, support global engagement on climate. In fact, the World Economic Forum estimated that the Paris Agreement represents a $23 trillion investment potential due to the growing demand in every corner of the world for clean energy. Between consumers who want[[Page S3271]]clean energy and local regulations that require it, the demand for clean energy will continue to grow here in the United States and around the world.  While pulling out of the Paris Agreement might seem like a way to protect jobs, for example, in the coal industry, the truth is that when these jobs do go away, it is mostly due to other things: market forces and automation.  I have been down in the coal mines of Southern Illinois, Central I have seen the way they mine coal today. For those who have not been there and paid close attention, it may come as a surprise. It is largely automated. Massive machinery, known as continuous miners, literally chew away at the walls of coal, transporting it back up to the surface for transport.  Back in the day, hundreds, if not thousands, of coal miners would head for their jobs with little more than a pick or an ax or a shovel or some drill. Today, it is an automated industry, and fewer jobs are creating more and more coal opportunities because automation is a big part.  In addition, there is a change in the global energy market. Because of fracking in States like North Dakota and South Dakota, we have seen an increase in the availability of natural gas at lower prices. Last year, for the first time in modern history, we had more electricity generated in 1 month in America from natural gas sources than from coal sources.  We have turned a corner when it comes to the availability of alternatives in energy. Between consumers who want access to clean energy and local regulations that require it, clean energy is going to continue to grow in demand.  Meanwhile, even in my own home State of Illinois, which is the fourth largest coal-producing State in the Nation, we already have thousands more workers in the solar industry than in the coal industry.  Clean energy jobs are growing. Remaining engaged on climate change spurs new investment and strengthens American competitiveness for jobs in the future. These jobs include designing more efficient solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and manufacturing the components for export all over the world. Why should other nations get to lead this growing industry of clean energy and the United States step away? We can create those jobs right here in America--American jobs for American workers in clean energy opportunities. We should lead the world in the creation of clean energy jobs.  This decision by the Trump administration to turn its back on this revolution in energy is going to cost us dearly. When the coal jobs do decline, we have responsibilities to retrain the workers for clean energy jobs and other opportunities in the future. The Paris Agreement ensured that we have credibility as leaders, access to global markets, and reduced financial risk for our citizens and businesses associated with changing climate.  By walking away from the agreement, America is not just giving up an environmental commitment, but it is giving up economic opportunity. We have given away our leadership, isolated ourselves from the rest of the world. They are not going to wait for us; they are going to move forward and look for other leaders than the United This President talked about making America first. His decision to walk away from the Paris Agreement puts America dead last when it comes to energy in the 21st century.  Climate change is a dire threat to the global economy and global stability. It will cause catastrophic consequences for global health, food security, and habitat on land and in the ocean. My constituents in Illinois are already experiencing the adverse effects of changing climate.  In recent years, our State--and, I might add, many others--has seen historic storms, floods, and droughts, causing millions of dollars in damage. Climate models suggest that if current global warming trends continue, Illinois will have a climate similar to the Texas gulf coast by the end of this century. For Illinois farmers, these changes to the environment have a direct effect on their livelihood and for all of us, a direct impact on our food supply.  Climate change also has significant national security implications that affect our shores--ones we simply can't ignore. The crisis in Syria, the flow of refugees from unstable parts of the world, is an early warning of the link to climate change and how humanitarian crises, particularly from less stable parts of our shared planet, are going to get worse if we continue to let climate change go unaddressed.  Back in 2011, when pro-democracy protests began in Syria, many of those joining were displaced farmers who had suffered 4 years of drought, made worse by the effects of climate change. The National Academy of Sciences published findings earlier this year showing that extreme drought in Syria between 2006 and 2009 was more likely due to climate change and that the drought was a factor in the uprisings in 2011.  Last year, Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist Tom Friedman wrote about massive migration out of parts of West Africa through the Sahara Desert to Libya, where people were hoping to eventually cross the dangerous trek across the Mediterranean Sea to He wrote: ``Just as Syria's revolution was set off in part by the worst four-year drought in the country's modern history--plus overpopulation, climate stresses and the Internet--the same is true of this African migration wave.''  Former CIA Acting Director Mike Morell recently called President Trump's decision to pull the United States from the Paris climate agreement the worst decision made by this President so far.  Mr.Morell pointed out that pulling out not only cedes American leadership in the world, but it harms our own national security by ignoring the impact of climate change on failed and fragile states that are homes to instability and violence. He further noted that we face three possible threats to our existence: nuclear war, a natural or manmade biological threat, or climate change. President Trump's dangerous decision, if not reversed, will contribute to that threat.  Anyone in this Chamber claiming to be serious about national security simply cannot be credible without addressing the long-term threats posed by weak states and climate change in the decades to come.  It is amazing to me that people around the world have come together to recognize the danger and the urgent need to act on climate change everywhere in the world except right here in the United States of  I don't understand the other political party. I can remember a time when we would have a debate on climate change on the floor. We would be talking about the Environmental Protection Agency, created by a Republican President, Richard Nixon, and we would have Senators from both sides of the aisle actively debating climate change, realizing that it is a threat to our future. Those days have changed.  Any debate now about environment is strictly one-sided. Was the science changed when it comes to global warming and climate change? Not at all. Ninety-eight percent of scientists agree that we have global warming, and the reasons for it relate directly to greenhouse gas emissions.  So what has changed? Why isn't this a bipartisan debate anymore? The politics have changed. They have changed dramatically with the way we finance political campaigns in this country. Groups have emerged--one in particular, the Koch brothers, who have made their fortune in carbon industries and who have promised any Republican who steps out of line on climate change this: You are in for a fight; you are going to face a primary. Don't you dare stand up and talk about climate change here on the floor of the  That is where we are today. We have come to a standstill, and now we have a President who has decided to walk away from this issue. This President has chosen politics over science and greed over responsibility. His decision is a fateful decision for our children, our grandchildren, and generations to come.  There may be some momentary applause in some places because President Trump has walked away from this global agreement to deal with this global challenge, but I could tell you the cheers are short-lived. When we see the price that we are going to pay--and that our kids will pay--for this gross irresponsibility, there will not be a lot of cheering.  I have said this on the floor before, and I will say it again because I am waiting for someone on the other side[[Page S3272]]to come to challenge me: The Republican Party of the United States of America is the only major political party in the world today that refuses to take climate change seriously. I have said that over and over, and I expect Senators from the Republican side to come to the floor and say: That is not true; we take it seriously. But they don't. Or I expect them to come to the floor and say: No, there is another major political party that also denies climate change.  One Republican Senator, after I said this on the floor repeatedly, pulled me off to the side in the corridor, looked around, and whispered: There is a party in Australia that also doesn't believe in climate change.  You think to yourself: So it has come to that. We have isolated ourselves in the eyes of the world when it comes to protecting this world for generations to come. We are going to pay a heavy price for that, but the biggest price is going to be paid by future generations.  Can we make a little sacrifice today, drive more energy-efficient cars and trucks, and think about ways to heat our homes and to light up our rooms that don't consume so much energy? Well, of course, we can. We have already done it, and we can do so much more. Walking away from the Paris Agreement is not the path that should lead America into the 21st century.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, earlier today, Majority Leader McConnell came to the Senate floor to, once again, be critical of the Affordable Care Act, a law that has resulted in more than 20 million Americans gaining health insurance. The law has lowered the uninsured rate to the lowest in American history. This law has put an end to insurance discrimination based on preexisting conditions or gender. It is a law that has made sure that Americans suffering from mental health or substance abuse addiction can get treatment. It is a law that extended the solvency of Medicare by a decade and decreased prescription drug costs for seniors by more than $1,000 for each senior in It is a law that has helped to reduce--cut in half--the number of bankruptcies filed in America because so many were the result of medical bills that people just couldn't pay. I was proud to vote for this law.  Is it perfect? Of course not. Can it be improved and strengthened? Yes, it should be. Improvements can be made the same way we have made improvements in Medicare, Social Security, and in so many other programs over the years, but not by repealing Social Security, not by repealing Medicare but by sitting down on a bipartisan basis to try to find a way to make sure that we don't deny health insurance coverage to 23 million people in America because of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and to find a way not to raise costs on older Americans, which the bill that passed the House of Representatives would do, and to find a way to make this law better for people living in rural  My hometown is in downstate I, as a Congressman and Senator, have represented a lot of small towns in sparsely populated counties. They value many things. They sure value their schools, their basketball teams and football teams. I will tell you what they value as much, if not more, than anything else--their local hospital.  The local hospital makes such a difference in smalltown It is not only a lifesaver--it saves you from driving another 50 or 100 miles for quality care--but it is also a source of great employment. Probably the best paying jobs in town are at the local hospital. If you want to keep a business or attract one, a local hospital is a good selling point.  Do you know what the bill that passed the House of Representatives will do to the rural and smalltown hospitals in Illinois?  Don't take my word for it. Ask the Illinois Health and Hospital They anticipate losing 60,000 jobs in Illinois because of the healthcare repeal bill that passed the House of Representatives, and they know that many hospitals downstate and many in the inner city are going to be forced to cut back in services, if not close, as a result of it.  What can we do to make this a better bill, to make the Affordable Care Act work more effectively? Let me give you a couple of ideas. First, we don't have anything in the law today that deals with prescription drug prices. We are at the mercy of people--pharmaceutical companies, investment bankers, and others--who come and control these pharmaceutical patents. They can literally raise the cost of these drugs beyond the reach of many families.  I had a young man come see me. He is in high school. He has been fighting diabetes since he was a little boy. He and his mother talked about the dramatic increase in the cost of insulin that he has faced over the last several years. Insulin has been around a long time. This is not a new wonder drug. It is a critical, lifesaving drug, but the prices and costs of insulin are going through the roof, and there is no way under current law for us to deal with it. Should we take that up? Of course, we should.  Blue Cross Blue Shield in Illinois told me recently that they spent more money last year on pharmaceutical costs than they did on inpatient hospital care, and the costs continue to go up. We need good, lifesaving drugs. We need to reward the companies that find them with a profit. But as to those who want to gouge prices and take advantage of people of modest income or folks who don't have insurance, there has to be a way to answer that and to deal with it honestly.  Yesterday, I went with eight other Senators up to the National Institutes of It is out in Bethesda, It is the premier medical research facility in the world. We are lucky to have it right here in the United  Time and again they told us about breakthrough drugs that were making a big difference that started with research at the National Institutes of I asked at one point: Is it too much to ask the pharmaceutical companies that take your basic research idea and turn it into a profitable product to give some of those profits back to the NIH to continue their research? They said: We have tried to do it, but the pharmaceutical companies walk away. They don't want to give us a penny for our future research.  Well, that is wrong. We ought to be investing in that research, rewarding the pharmaceutical companies for their development of these products, as well, but making certain we continue this leadership in the world when it comes to medical research and pharmaceuticals.  The individual market on health insurance is one that troubles us because it is the area where people who don't have health insurance through their place of employment or don't qualify for a government health insurance plan--like Medicare, Medicaid, veterans care, or the like--go to buy insurance on the insurance exchange. This is where the premiums have gone up. Now, why have the premiums gone up in that one sector? Because when it comes to individuals, those who are older and sicker are the first to sign up, but the healthier, younger ones are the last.  We can sit down on a bipartisan basis and find ways to create an incentive so that we can increase the participation in this insurance pool and bring down the premium costs for those who are paying.  The third thing we need to do is to make sure that no matter where you live in the United States, there is an option to choose when it comes to buying your health insurance. One of the things we can do is to take one of the most popular medical care programs in history--the Medicare Program itself--and duplicate it in a public option available to people across the United Do you want to buy a health insurance program that looks like Medicare, a not-for-profit program? This would be your chance.  So those are three ideas that I think we could bring forward in an effort to make the Affordable Care Act even more responsive.  Senator McConnell, the Republican Leader, comes to the floor frequently to talk about the choice to expand the Medicaid Program, as allowed under law in many I would welcome the opportunity to expand that program.  Most people do not understand the Medicaid Oh, that is health insurance for poor people. Well, in a way, it is, but it is so much more. For example, one out of every two births in[[Page S3273]]Illinois is paid for by the Medicaid Program to keep mom healthy so she delivers a healthy baby and to keep that baby healthy as soon as it is born. It is paid for by Medicaid in 50 percent of the cases of new births. But that is not the most expensive thing.  The most expensive thing under Medicaid is for your mom and your grandmother who is in a nursing home, living on Social Security and Medicare, and they need help. So they qualify for Medicaid to pay for the medical care they need so they can continue to live wholesome lives.  The third area, of course, is medical insurance for the disabled who have ongoing needs. Those three areas make up When the Republican proposal that came out of the House wanted to cut $600 or $700 billion and give tax cuts to wealthy people, they took it out of  So which of the groups that I just described to you would you take health insurance away from--mothers with new babies, elderly folks in nursing homes with no resources, or the disabled who live in our communities?  I would think it is a step in the wrong direction to hit any of these groups. That is why Medicaid was expanded in so many States and why we should continue to find ways to expand it in a responsible fashion.  As I go back home and talk to people about this Republican alternative that passed the House of Representatives, it is very clear they oppose it.  I have challenged those Congressmen who voted for the Republican repeal bill to find one medical advocacy group in my State that supports their effort. There are none. The Illinois Health and Hospital Association, the Illinois Medical Association, the Illinois Nurses Association, and the Illinois pediatricians all oppose it.  The AARP, or American Association of Retired Persons, opposes it because the bill removed the protection for elderly people when it came to the cost of premiums. The AARP believes--and I am afraid the facts bear it out--that what passed the House of Representatives will dramatically increase health insurance premiums for people between the ages of 50 and 64. We can do better, but we need to do it on a bipartisan basis.  I yield the floor.

13586,topic-id,498,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Children are the most vulnerable and innocent members of our society, and we have a duty to make sure our laws protect them to the fullest extent possible. H.1862, the Global Child Protection Act of 2017, closes regrettable loopholes in existing child exploitation statutes to do just that.  Currently, dangerous sexual predators who violate children overseas can avoid culpability simply by engaging in what the United States Code defines as sexual contact rather than what the law defines as illicit sexual conduct. That is, they can go abroad, cause a child to sexually touch them, and return, without exposure to the criminal liability they would face had they engaged in what the law defines as illicit sexual conduct.  I am sure my colleagues would agree that it should not matter whether the offender engages in sexual conduct or contact with a child. Either way, he is a child predator. This is the very definition of a loophole, and it is putting children at risk. That is because these predators are aware of this loophole, and they are able to share this information quickly in chat groups on the internet. They plot their foreign sex tourism accordingly, to circumvent criminal liability.  H.1862 closes this loophole by expanding the definition of illicit sexual conduct to include sexual contact. No longer will these predators be able to escape justice and continue to offend with impunity.  This bill also closes a loophole for recidivist offenders. It is estimated that only between 8 and 20 percent of victims of childhood sexual abuse report they have been abused. That is why it is vitally important that, when we do become aware of these offenses and secure convictions, our justice system imposes penalties to adequately punish and deter this evil.[[Page H4400]]  Current law provides that an offender convicted of committing a Federal sex offense against a minor shall be sentenced to life imprisonment if that offender has a prior conviction for a sex offense against a minor. In defining sex offense, however, this provision inexplicably excludes two serious offenses. It is missing offenses covering abusive sexual contact with a minor under 12 and also does not apply to offenders who commit their sex crimes against children overseas. H.1862 fixes these oversights--and they were clearly oversights--by adding these provisions into the definition of Federal sex offense.  When an offender has previously harmed a child, been punished for that offense, and goes on to harm another child, the risk that he will go on to abuse again is extremely high, and we must ensure our children are safe from such a dangerous predator. That dynamic of deterrence, ensuring repeat offenders face harsher penalties, is at the core of our system of justice. It is even more important here where the victims are our children. Children are one-third of our population and all of our future. We must prioritize their protection.

13591,topic-id,236,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  First, let me make it very clear that there are no new mandatory minimums in this bill. The mandatory minimum that is already in the law is appropriate for those who are a danger to children, particularly where these enhancements apply when they have abused a minor, not once, but twice.  We are closing a loophole in the current law and we are adding to this provision the sexual abuse of children under 12 years old. Having already harmed two children, an offender poses too great a risk to our vulnerable citizens. There are victims here and potential victims to protect.  As I mentioned before, child victims report abuse at a shockingly low level. It is important that this conduct is adequately deterred for someone who has already abused a child. Clearly, one conviction was not adequate.  Prosecutorial discretion in these cases act as an appropriate buffer to ensure these provisions are being used reasonably. There are no new mandatory minimums in this bill. We simply close a loophole to make sure that people do not sexually abuse children under 12 years of age, not once, not twice, but more than twice. That is why this mandatory minimum should have a loophole closed to include it, but there is not a new mandatory minimum sentence in this bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, my friend and colleague, the ranking member, asked that we look at this in a broad and general way, but that is not what this bill is all about. I ask my colleagues to look at this in the very specific way that this bill is designed: to address a loophole in current law that allows sexual predators of children under 12 years old to avoid the sentencing consequences of their actions.  We are about protecting children. This law is about protecting children. But predators know this loophole in the law, and it needs to be closed, so that is what this is about.  This is about making sure that sexual predators are taken off the streets and prevented from not abusing children once or twice, but many more times. This will stop that. This will close that loophole.  This is not the place--sexual predators for children under 12 years old. This is not the place to have a general, broad discussion about mandatory minimum sentences.  Let's fix this problem. And we can and will as we address criminal justice reform, look at our overall sentencing, but this problem needs to be addressed. It needs to be addressed now for the sake of protecting our children. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Anyone who votes for this bill is voting to support and implement Donald Trump's views on immigration, his desire to militarize our southern border, and his fantasy of a mass deportation force. You cannot spin it any other way.  If we want to lower the standards for screening and hiring CBP officers, eliminate checks that could help weed out candidates with criminal histories or criminal intentions, and water down the integrity of this important national security source, this bill is for you.  But if you care about border security and the integrity of the officers, you should join me in voting against the bill.  To me and a lot of other people watching this debate, this is about something else.

Do you want to buy into his vision of immigrants as a brown horde intent on doing America harm?  If you are onboard with this, you are also onboard with building a wall; onboard with billions to be spent on deporting moms and dads who have lived here for decades; going after DREAMers as the Trump administration is doing today, deporting DREAMers from the United States of Where do you want to draw the line on the Trump deportation agenda?

13467,topic-id,2287,"Mr.President, peace and order are the indispensable pillars of a stable society. They grant us security in our daily lives, trust in our communities, and faith in our democratic institutions. Where peace and order reign, so too does society thrive and prosper, but none of that is possible without our Nation's 700,000 men and women in blue.  Each and every day, these brave sons and daughters--brave souls--stand up for all of us. Each and every day, they stand guard, ready to do justice or risk harm--all on our behalf. So today I rise on behalf of a grateful Nation to recognize them. Their performance is exceptional, and their sacrifice is immense.  Far too often, we take our police officers for granted. Far too often, we forget how hard it is to win and how easy it is to lose the peace and order that we all enjoy, but our police officers never forget. They are always at the ready. As we honor them this week, we remember that the question is not ``What causes violence or what causes crime?'' but rather, ``What causes peace, and what causes security?''  The answer is our men and women in blue.  In celebration of our National Police Week, I wish to express my profound appreciation for our Nation's law enforcement community--the courageous men and women who each day put the safety of others before their own. Their success is impossible to fully measure. It cannot be counted in crime statistics or etched into medals. It can only be seen in the peace and order that their sacrifice makes possible.  Therefore, allow me for a moment to speak directly to our police officers.  Trust that your selflessness does not go unseen, that your service does not go unfelt, and that your sacrifice does not go unknown. We appreciate you, we support you, and we honor you. Law enforcement is among the noblest of professions. You are the brave guardians among us who fight for peace and protect the vulnerable from harm. On behalf of a grateful nation, I wish to thank you and your families for bearing the burden, shouldering the sacrifice, and making us all proud.  Let it be known that I proudly back the blue.  This is a critical moment to show the police our support. We live in a time when law enforcement officials are not only underappreciated but often maligned and, quite often, openly disparaged. Day in and day out, they suffer criticism and pressure. This week we let them know of our respect and admiration.  Today, I wish to express my gratitude for our men and women in uniform by sharing stories of their heroism. You see, we hear all about police mistakes, and we hear wall-to-wall coverage of the controversies, but we seldom hear about the acts of bravery and professionalism that distinguish our police officers as the finest in the world. In particular, I would like to relate the account of Utahns Bre and Kayli Lasley, two sisters whose lives were saved by an on-duty police officer.  In September 2015, a man armed with a knife climbed through a bedroom window in Bre and Kayli's Salt Lake City apartment. Once inside, he brutally beat both sisters before pulling out a knife and repeatedly stabbing Just as the attacker raised his knife to Bre's throat, Salt Lake City police officer Ben Hone charged into the room. He told the intruder to drop his knife.  In that critical moment, with lives literally hanging in the balance, Bre remembers:       That's when I saw the officer, and he was our angel . . . I      looked at the officer in his eyes, and he was so professional      and calm.  When the attacker refused to surrender his weapon, Officer Hone raised his service pistol and fired, killing the armed intruder and saving Bre's life. In that moment, Officer Hone was truly Bre's guardian angel.  She remembers:       When [we] made eye contact, I knew I was safe. It's a      miracle that he had so much composure and was able to take      that shot.  In recognition of his heroism, Officer Ben Hone was honored by the National Associations of Chiefs of Police and the American Police Hall of Fame as the 2015 Law Enforcement Officer of the I think it was an honor richly deserved.  Officer Hone survived that day. For that, we give thanks, but the sad reality is that many lose their lives in the line of duty. So today I wish to honor those men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice and paid the highest price that society can ask. Our debt to them will not--indeed, cannot--be repaid.  Among the fallen is Utah Highway Patrol Trooper Eric Ellsworth, who died only a few days after being struck by a car while on duty in Box Elder We also mourn the passing of West Valley City police officer Cody Brotherson and Greater Salt Lake Unified Police Department officer Douglas Barney, who were both killed in the line of duty this past year in  I express my deepest condolences to the families and friends of these brave heroes and the countless others who have experienced similar tragedies.  Although we cannot bring these officers back, we can honor their legacies by committing ourselves to supporting their brothers and sisters in uniform. To that end, I have introduced and cosponsored a number of bills this Congress that are meant to assist law enforcement as they serve our communities. These bills include the Rapid[[Page S2951]]DNA Act, the Probation Officer Protection Act, and the Child Protection Improvements Just yesterday, I joined Senator Coons in introducing the U.Marshals Service Hiring Improvement Act, which was named in honor of U.Marshals Service deputy Patrick Carothers, who was a 26-year veteran of the U.Marshals Service who died in the line of duty in Georgia in November 2016.  Last week, I was grateful to see the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably report my bipartisan bill--the Rapid DNA Act of 2017. This critical legislation, which has garnered support from the National Association of Police Organizations, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the National District Attorneys Association, updates the law and leverages advancements in rapid DNA technology to expedite analysis in the FBI's Combined DNA Index If enacted, this commonsense proposal will enable law enforcement to analyze DNA in record time, reducing backlogs in rape kits and keeping violent criminals off of our streets. By facilitating the use of rapid DNA technology, this bill will also help to exonerate those wrongly accused of crime.  The Rapid DNA Act has received strong support from U.Attorney General During his confirmation hearing, Attorney General Sessions said:       Rapid DNA analysis is a hugely important issue for the      whole American criminal justice system. It presents      tremendous opportunities to solve crimes in an effective way      and produce justice because it's the kind of thing that you      can't fake or mislead, so I am very strongly in favor of      it.''  In remarks before the Senate Judiciary Committee, former FBI Director James Comey said that the Rapid DNA Act ``will help us change the world in a very exciting way,'' and it ``will materially advance the safety of the people of the United States.''  Each time I talk to a police officer, I always hear nearly the same thing. They have no need for fanfare or fame. All they need is the public's support and the tools necessary to do the job. In commemoration of National Police Week, let's make sure to give them both. I encourage my colleagues to join me in passing these bills and in showing our heroes in blue the gratitude and admiration they deserve.          Tribute to Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan  Mr.President, in addition to honoring our men and women who wear the police uniform, I wish to pay tribute to a seasoned leader who wears the military uniform--Christopher General Bogdan is the program executive officer of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Program He is really a respected airman, a true patriot, and a dear friend.  Nearly singlehandedly, he salvaged the F-35 program from ruin, providing much needed leadership at a critical time in the development of this important weapons system. He will be retiring this June after more than three decades of dedicated and decorated service in the U.Air On behalf of a grateful nation, I wish to thank General Bogdan for his leadership, service, and his sacrifice.  General Bogdan is an exceptional leader and a man of unwavering character and integrity. Several years ago, the general was given the daunting task of saving the F-35 program from the clutches of ``scandal and tragedy,'' as Senator McCain once so accurately described. During his tenure, General Bogdan overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles to right the ship at the F-35 program office. Along the way, he demanded the highest performance from his own staff and industry partners to establish a corrective path forward.  I first met General Bogdan in October 2013, when I made a special visit to the F-35 program office in Arlington, General Bogdan warmly greeted me before introducing me to all eight of the national deputies from the program's partner nations. I was so impressed to see all of them in uniform--these great heroes from all of these other nations that are dependent upon the United States and our F-35 program. The general spoke briefly about how important this weapons system was not only to our own national security but also to the collective defense of the program's partner nations--the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Norway, and Denmark, and, in the case of military sales, Israel and At that moment, I realized just how vital this cutting-edge platform was to the cause of freedom around the globe.  We then adjourned to General Bogdan's office, where he asked for my help in three areas that would be critical to bringing the F-35 to full operational capability: activating depot workloads, expanding the Utah Test and Training Range, and building infrastructure for the sustainment of F-35 software--one of the most complicated and the most highly scientifically run airplane in the world.  That day, I made a commitment to help General Years later, I am pleased to say that, in working together, we were successful in achieving all three objectives. In last year's National Defense Authorization Act, I offered an amendment to expand the Utah Test and Training Range by 40 percent, which is an increase of more than 1,000 square miles. With a little help from Congress, the depot activations at Hill Air Force Base progressed quickly, enabling the Air Force to station its first operational F-35 squadron at the base last In working alongside State leaders, I was also able to generate support for the construction of a software facility that will help sustain the F-35 for years to come.  Without General Bogdan's vision and strategic direction, none of these accomplishments would have been possible. It really is important. Utah is the only place over land where you had a big enough area where you could fly this immensely important F-35 and do the training that needed to be done--with live ordnance by the way.  A year after we met, General Bogdan cleared his schedule so he could accompany me on a visit to the F-35 production line in Fort Worth, There, I witnessed the current production run of over 100 F-35s progressing through the assembly line--truly a sight to behold. As planes moved out of the assembly line, General Bogdan explained critical challenges at each stopping point. I wondered how one man could be so intimately involved in every minute detail of the plane's production, yet still have the capacity to lead at the highest levels. In that moment, I knew General Bogdan was the right man to be in the largest acquisition program the world has ever seen.  When General Bogdan first took the helm of the F-35 Joint Program Office, he walked into a hostile environment, knowing full well he would face constant scrutiny and tremendous political pressure from all sides. He knew he would have to answer for every decision he would make, but General Bogdan was more than up to the task. In his leadership of the F-35 Joint Program Office, General Bogdan embodied three core values of the U.Air Force: integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all they do.  Both in the Air Force and in his private life, General Bogdan is a model of commitment and sacrifice. As great as his service to our Nation, the Air Force, and the F-35 program has been, it pales in comparison to the dedication he has shown his lovely wife April and their two children, Amanda and  Our Nation is safer today thanks to General Bogdan's 34 years of distinguished military service. I would like to congratulate my friend on the Senate floor on a stellar Air Force career. I consider myself lucky to know General Bogdan and even luckier to call him a friend. I wish him and April the very best as they begin the next chapter of their lives.  This is a man for whom I have the utmost respect. I lost my brother in the Second World He was a flier on a B-24 in one of the Palestine oil raids. I have to say that General Bogdan reminds me of my brother and a lot of heroes I have met who have served this country so well. He is at the top of the list. I just think the world of him, I think the world of his family, and I wish him the absolute best.  I thank the  I yield the floor.

13399,topic-id,1189,"Mr.President, I am proud that the Senate voted to reject an effort to overturn commonsense protections to reduce methane waste. It was 3 years ago that satellite images from NASA revealed that there is a giant cloud of methane--about the size of the State of Delaware--sitting over the Four Corners region in Northwestern New Mexico and Southwestern  Although evidence had shown that there was methane air pollution in the Four Corners as early as 2003, the image of NASA data is truly striking. This is a warning of a potentially major threat to public health for communities in the region.  The San Juan Basin in the Four Corners region has long been a leading producer of oil and natural gas. With the natural gas boom of the mid-2000s, production in the basin grew by leaps and bounds, and that created hundreds of new high-paying jobs and a major new domestic source of an important energy resource.  Unfortunately, amid all this growth, some producers developing natural gas on our public lands and on Tribal lands released harmful air pollution and wasted these publicly owned resources by allowing methane to leak into the air from faulty equipment and pipes, and even by burning off valuable natural gas in the process called flaring.  Following the discovery of the methane hotspot, researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory joined Caltech and University of Michigan scientists to conduct a detailed study into the cause of the methane cloud. Some producers claimed that the hotspot was caused primarily by natural seeps of gas from underground geologic formations and by gas venting out from an old coal mine in the region.  The NASA researchers, using instrumentation mounted on aircraft that flew close to the ground and throughout 1,200 square miles of airspace in the Four Corners region, identified leaks from natural gas wells as the major methane emitters contributing to the methane air pollution.  As greenhouse gas, methane has over 80 times the global warming potential as carbon dioxide over the short term. We have a moral obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to mitigate our contributions to climate change.  Even absent its consequences for climate change, methane leaks waste valuable energy resources, and they harm public health. When methane leaks from oil and gas wells, harmful carcinogens such as benzene leak into the air alongside it.  Because of the air pollution over the Four Corners region, the American Lung Association gave San Juan County in New Mexico an F rating for ozone pollution in 2016. That means children suffer more asthma attacks and seniors have more difficulty breathing.  I want it to be clear that this is not a case of pitting development of our energy resources against human health. We have a golden opportunity to apply innovative, existing technologies to this problem, grow our economy, and improve air quality for the people of the Four Corners region. That is because minimizing the amount of methane that leaks, vents, or flares out of the oil and gas wells isn't just good for air quality, it is good for business and the bottom line.  When oil and gas companies modernize their equipment to reduce leaks, they are able to capture more gas that they can sell, as well as increase worker safety at their wells. When we capture more gas, that also means we see more royalties and revenues for States, Tribes, and local communities. By updating oil and natural gas production equipment and infrastructure to reduce wasted natural gas, we create new jobs for energy workers and manufacturers.  When we reduce wasteful leaks, it means that instead of having a giant methane cloud over the northwest corner of New Mexico and over the Navajo Nation--a major public health hazard--we put our publicly owned natural gas resources to beneficial use. That is the definition of a win-win situation.  I say all this because that is exactly what the Bureau of Land Management's methane waste prevention rule is designed to do. These commonsense and cost-effective protections in the rule were put in place to reduce harmful methane and benzene pollution and to ensure that oil and gas operations are using technological advances that minimize emissions and maximize the amount of natural gas we produce.  Between 2009 and 2015, the BLM estimates that oil and gas producers on our public and Tribal lands vented, flared, and leaked 462 billion cubic feet of methane. They wasted enough natural gas to supply over 6 million American households for a year. Instead of heating our homes or fueling powerplants, powering buses, that gas was leaked into the atmosphere, wasting millions of dollars of this limited resource.  It is estimated that the oil and gas industry wastes about $100 million worth of natural gas every year. That also means $6 million each year of lost State revenue, revenue that pays for schools, roads, and emergency services in New That is quite a figure.  A recent report found that New Mexico taxpayers have lost out on over $42 million of royalty revenues since the year 2009--$42,728,949 to be exact. The BLM's methane waste prevention rule will help put a stop to this wasted resource.  While developing the rule, the BLM held public meetings, it held Tribal consultations, and it factored in feedback from over 300,000 comments submitted during the public comment period. The agency also coordinated with States like Colorado, Wyoming, and North Dakota that have already created similar protections to reduce methane leaking and flaring at the State level.  The BLM rule will have minimal costs for oil and gas producers, and, in fact, leak detections and repairs required by the rule will help companies make more money selling the gas that they save. Meanwhile, this rule will grow our economy by investing in innovative companies that have developed the technologies to minimize leaks and protect our public health. This rule should not have been controversial.  The overwhelming majority of my constituents in New Mexico support reducing wasted natural gas. A recent poll by Colorado College conducted after the election found that 74 percent of New Mexicans support the BLM's methane waste reduction rule.  I am proud that enough Senators shared that view and voted to reject an attempt to repeal this commonsense protection of public health, air quality, and responsible development of our natural resources. There is nothing conservative about making it easier to waste a precious public energy source.  We should be focused on reducing waste, capturing critical royalties for New Mexico communities, and putting our natural gas resources to beneficial use. This repeal effort of the methane rule would have represented a major step backward.  Today's vote was a major victory for responsible development of our natural gas resources and our Nation's decades-long commitment to protect the air we breathe. On behalf of my constituents and theirs, I want to say a special thank-you to all 51 Senators who supported our efforts today. Thank you very much.

As a former attorney general of North Dakota, I have always had a special relationship and appreciation for law enforcement. Serving as the top law enforcement officer in my State will always be one of the most meaningful moments in my professional career. When I began serving as attorney general, law enforcement wasn't one of the goals I had. So I told my head of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, a brilliant leader by the name of Bill Broer, that he could just deal with the law enforcement portion of the job, and I would take responsibility for the rest of the job.  Bill was going to have none of that, and consistently invited me along as he visited peace officers from all over the State, as we went to intel meetings, and as we talked about the challenges of equipping and staffing our law enforcement agencies. I can tell my colleagues that after 8 years of being North Dakota's attorney general, that portion of the job was the job I miss and love the most because I worked with the finest collection of peace officers in the country, and I could not be more proud to continue that work and work alongside of them as their U. I am here to thank each and every one of the peace officers who selflessly serve in communities throughout North Dakota and to let you know I don't just appreciate the work you do and the sacrifices you and your family make each and every day, but I also have your back, 24/7, 365 days a year.  I also come to the floor with a heavy heart, as I have had to come to the floor twice already in less than a year, to honor North Dakota peace officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty.  We lost Officer Jason Moszer of the Fargo Police Department on February 11, 2016. Less than a year later, we lost Rolette County Deputy Colt Allery on January 18, 2017. I say ``we'' because the loss of these fine, young peace officers was felt across the entire State of North Dakota, and it still impacts their families, their departments, and our communities to this day.  Both of these young men made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their State and their communities, each succumbing to gunshot wounds inflicted by individuals who were prepared to inflict even more damage and take more lives. The brave actions of these two peace officers prevented that from happening.  Officer Jason Moszer's name was etched into the Peace Officer Memorial here in Washington, DC, this week, and his name was read out loud during a ceremony this past weekend honoring all the officers who died in the line of duty last year and whose names have been added to the wall.  Officer Moszer's name will now serve as an example not just to North Dakotans but to people from all over this country and all around the world who visit the memorial each year. He will serve as an example of the best our State and country has to offer, an example of what it truly means to have lived and died so others may be safe; quite simply, an example for everyone of what it means to be a hero.  We must also remember the families of our peace officers that sacrifice so much, not knowing if their loved ones will return each time they walk out the door. I want to recognize Officer Moszer's family, his wife Rachel, his children Dillan and Jolee, his brother Brian, his sister Michelle, and especially his parents Dave and Karen, who care so much and have sacrificed so much and today suffer that loss with their community, but, more importantly, in private. So I know what Jason meant to you. I know what he means to you. He now belongs to the entire State of North We will never forget his name or his sacrifice.  To the men and women of the Fargo Police Department, led by a great guy, Chief David Todd, I commend all of you for your courage and strength, for standing alongside the Moszers every step of the way. Jason's loss was your loss too. I stand in awe and appreciation of the job you do each and every day, and I thank you.  Next year, unfortunately, I will be coming to the floor again to honor Deputy Allery, as his name will be engraved on the memorial wall. My heart breaks about having to do this again, but I also consider it an incredible privilege to honor the very best of what we as a State and country have to offer.  To all of our peace officers, especially those back home in North Dakota, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your sacrifice to the people of Fargo and the State of North  I also want to mention that we walk by peace officers every day--peace officers who have the responsibility of protecting the most iconic image of American democracy; that is, the U.Capitol and the buildings we serve in. They stand ready to take anything that walks through that door. Let me tell you, anyone who thinks that is an easy job--trying to anticipate, trying to pay attention, and trying to know how to treat our citizens with the utmost respect but also recognizing that every one of those people coming through the door at any of these gates, any of these doors, could be intent on doing damage to this institution and causing death among the people we work with every day--it is an awesome responsibility and I think a responsibility that too often goes unattended and unrecognized and unappreciated.  I want to stand today and give a shout-out not only to the great peace officers of my State but the great peace officers who serve with us every day. Whether they are in border patrol and protection, whether they are in Customs and Border Protection, whether they are police officers at the parks, whether they are police officers serving all across these Federal agencies, whether it be ICE or the FBI, we should be proud of the work that they do. We should be standing with them in the work they do because their job is as important as our job, and that is to protect our country and protect our people.  So I want to say it is not enough to just stand here and recognize the heroes. If we really want to appreciate peace officers and peace officer week, and if we want to really honor peace officers, every day is a day that we say thank you. Every day we pass a uniform of a peace officer who is protecting us, we say thank you. We recognize their service, we recognize their sacrifice, and we recognize that all too often they are the only people who stand between us and chaos, who stand on that line and protect our country and protect our children and protect our citizens.  May God bless all of our peace officers and may God bless the United States of  I yield the floor.

13469,topic-id,681,"Mr.President, I, too, stand in honor of National Police I want to thank my two previous colleagues from Utah and North Dakota for their heartfelt tributes to the men and women in blue and the hard work they do in protecting us every day.  National Police Week was established in Congress in 1962. National Police Week is an opportunity to pay tribute to law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. It is also an opportunity to recognize and thank the members of our law enforcement community in Nevada and throughout the country.  Each day our law enforcement officers put themselves at risk to protect our families and to protect our communities. Their courage, selflessness, and commitment to serve is a reflection of what makes this country so great; that is, their willingness to answer the call--without being asked--to put the welfare of others over themselves.  This commitment doesn't come without tremendous sacrifice. I was reminded of that earlier this month at the 30th annual James Hoff Peace Officer Memorial in  The James Hoff Peace Officer Memorial is a tribute to Nevada law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty.[[Page S2953]]The memorial also recognizes officers who were placed in danger and survived. Named after Reno Police Officer James Hoff, who was killed in 1979 by the suspects he was investigating, the memorial hosts an annual ceremony attended by State and local officials and members of the law enforcement community. It is always a privilege to attend this annual event honoring the heroism of fellow Nevadans whose names and legacies are enshrined in this memorial.  At this year's ceremony, we honored and celebrated the life of Detective Chad Parque, who served with the North Las Vegas Police Department for 10 years. At just 32 years old, Detective Parque tragically lost his life after his department vehicle was struck head-on by another vehicle earlier this year. Detective Parque is survived by his wife, children, and siblings, and mourned by all of those who had the privilege to know him.  In describing Detective Parque, a fellow law enforcement officer said:       He was a ten-year officer and you could see the fire in his      eyes as if he had just signed on. He loved his community.  He served with passion and dignity. He will never be forgotten for the many contributions to North Las Vegas and to our great  His plaque is now alongside other members of Nevada's law enforcement community who were enshrined on this memorial from past years and whose stories continue to inspire all of us.  In 2016, at least 144 law enforcement officers across this country lost their lives in the line of duty, a sharp increase from the previous year.  Let's not forget that behind the names--the many names--of those who have fallen are the people, spouses, children, and parents who may not have had a chance to say good-bye. Most of us will never know their pain, but we are deeply appreciative of their unwavering support for their community. While there is nothing we can do to bring back those who died in the line of duty, I am committed to doing everything I can at the Federal level to try to prevent it from happening to one more officer and one more family.  I am proud to support the Back the Blue Act, legislation that increases penalties for killing law enforcement officials. The bill ensures that anyone who purposely targets law enforcement should, and would, face justice for that crime.  The Nevada law enforcement community has my full support this Police Week--and every week and every day, each year they are on the job.  To all our law enforcement officials, we are all indebted to you and your families for all your sacrifices, and I am personally and sincerely grateful for your dedication to the people of  To our protectors, our peacekeepers, and those who are first to answer the call for help and who run toward, not away, from danger, we thank you, and we honor you.

13623,topic-id,521,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak in support of the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act--bipartisan legislation that will help ensure that our veterans receive the care they deserve.  We owe our veterans more than we can ever repay for their dedicated service. Part of this debt is providing our veterans with timely, high-quality healthcare.  In my home State of North Dakota, our VA medical center is located in It not only serves the veterans in North Dakota, but it also serves the western half of Minnesota as well. If there is one thing that our veterans have made very clear about the health center in Fargo--from both North Dakota and Minnesota--our veterans have made clear that it is an outstanding healthcare center that provides high-quality service. Our veterans love the Fargo They do a great job.  It is important to note that the vast majority of VA employees are dedicated to serving our veterans and are working diligently to provide services to veterans in their communities. However, as recent events have shown, there are a number of instances where poor performance or misconduct by a VA employee has had tragic consequences.  In cases like these, the VA needs to have the ability to address these situations and to do it in a fair but expeditious manner. This bipartisan legislation will provide the VA Secretary with the necessary tools to do just that and ensure that VA employees are putting our veterans first. Specifically, this legislation establishes in law the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection within the VA, a post which was created earlier this year through Executive order. It authorizes the Secretary of VA to reprimand, suspend, demote, or remove VA employees at any level and hasten the appeal and review process. Additionally, it establishes protections for whistleblowers .  These reforms are important for our veterans. That is why the legislation has garnered the support of many veterans organizations. It has garnered the support of our North Dakota VA Commissioner, as well as the veterans service organizations, including the American Legion, AMVETS, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Military Officers Association of America, and others. It has also garnered the support of cosponsors on both sides of the aisle in this  Seventy-three years ago, over 160,000 brave Allied troops landed on the beaches of I can think of no more an appropriate day to pass legislation that honors our commitment to our veterans and helps ensure they receive the care they have earned.  I thank the committee chair, Senator Isakson of Georgia, and also Senator Tester of Montana for their outstanding bipartisan leadership on this important legislation.  I particularly also want to thank Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is the primary sponsor of this legislation and has been a champion for veterans issues. I know this accountability issue is one he has spoken about consistently, often, and passionately on behalf of our veterans. I thank him for his leadership on this very important legislation.

13606,topic-id,1327,"Mr.President, I am pleased to rise today on the 73rd anniversary of the invasion of Normandy, Omaha Beach, and Sword Beach by 156,000 brave Americans who saved our freedom and liberty, for the American people as well as all of Europe, who put an end to the reign of Adolph Hitler, and remind me every day as chairman of the Veterans' Committee why I am here in the U.Senate--and that is to see to it that we take care of those who have taken care of us.  Somebody asked me this morning: Is it coincidence that D-day was 73 years ago today? I said: It is Divine providence that we are on the floor today paying back those brave 156,000 who invaded those beaches to make the Veterans' Administration a more favorable agency than it is already.  I am proud to be on the floor to lead a part of the debate with Senator Tester--my ranking member on the committee and my dear friend--on a bill that I think is of great significance. It is the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection  The best quote is not one I could come up with or I doubt that Jon could come up with. The best quote really was come up with by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the When asked, they said: ``This is the strongest VA accountability measure that can be signed into law.'' I want to reiterate that: the strongest accountability measure of the VA that can be signed into law. Which means we are reaching into every corner of problems in the VA which have existed over the last years. We are making sure we make the corrections necessary to make the VA an accountable organization, and we are doing it in a bipartisan fashion together, Democrats and Republicans alike.  As I have said very often, there aren't Republican casualties and Democratic casualties on the battlefield. They are American citizens who have fought and died for this country. So there is no room for partisanship when it comes to providing them with the benefits that are necessary and seeing to it that they get what they deserve.  I thank all the members of the committee; in particular, Ranking Member Tester for his work; Senator Moran, who did such great work for us on the accountability measure; Senator Rubio, who is not a member of the committee but did a great job in terms of accountability, and he will speak later on the floor--as I am sure others will--about this.  We have had a great committee working for a long period of time. We passed a bill--almost--last year and then failed at the last few moments of the session to get it done. So we are back a second time, but we are back[[Page S3267]]with a bill that has come unanimously from the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and I hope will leave this Senate floor unanimously so we send a clear signal to our veterans: We will hold ourselves accountable to you.  What specifically does the legislation do that is important? One, it makes what President Trump referred to in an Executive order about 3 weeks ago, the veterans whistleblower protection act, a reality and codifies it into law. Second, it removes many of the bureaucratic hurdles currently in place, making it easier for the VA Secretary to remove employees of all departments in the VA who are found guilty of wrongdoing or misconduct, and I underscore found guilty of wrongdoing or misconduct.  The bill shortens the removal process for employees of the VA and ensures an individual appealing removal from the VA is not kept on VA's payroll indefinitely while they appeal. The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act also prohibits the VA from awarding bonuses to employees found guilty of misconduct. The bill would remove the bureaucratic Merit System Protection Board from appeals by the senior management--top management--of the Veterans'  The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act establishes the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection to make it permanent in the United States of  In essence, and very simply, this bill ensures and codifies into law the accountability of this agency and its operation to the American people and to the veterans of the United States of America for all they have done for each and every one of us.  It is very important to appreciate that this does not come to us by some Senator or some Representative coming up with a bunch of crazy ideas at the last minute. This is a response to what we have seen happen over and over again over the past few years. Most, if not all, of the employees in the Veterans' Administration are hard-working, dedicated, committed individuals, but there have been, from time to time, questions that have arisen about the handling of certain situations: the situation that took place in Phoenix, AZ, in terms of appointments; the rash number of suicides and mishandling of pharmaceuticals in the Atlanta office of Clairmont, near where I am in my office in Atlanta, GA; the situation of transfers in Philadelphia, PA, where people were transferred rather than disciplined and were paid their moving expenses and cost-of-living adjustments upward--all to get rid of somebody in one office but move them to another, instead of handling them in the way in which they should have been, which holds them accountable, rather than making sure they work somewhere else. We took instances where people themselves were breaking the law and violating the law, and we are now holding them accountable because of what is written into the VA accountability and whistleblower act.  Simply put, we have taken the worst performance, in isolated cases in the past few years, and did what was right. We have corrected it where it needed to be corrected, we have eliminated it where it needed to be eliminated, and we have given the authority to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and employees under the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to discipline people who work for them and hold them accountable for doing the wrong thing and encourage them to do the right thing.  I reiterate, though, that we are not singling out an agency which has a large number of people who are not performing. We are singling out an agency which has had some situations where a few employees have done some egregious things that need to be addressed. They were addressed but couldn't be addressed under the current status of the law, which now will be able to be addressed under the status of the new law and held accountable for their actions.  Nothing happens when one person does it. Everything happens when people come together as a team. It has been a pleasure for me to have a great teammate in this effort; that is, Jon Tester from I have been on the committee 12 years, and I think Jon has been on the committee 8 or 9 years.  You are on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, first of all, because you want to be on it. It is what we refer to as a B committee, which means it is a second tier. A lot of times it is a fill-in committee for Members of the Senate or the House, but for me and for Jon, it is our principal and primary responsibility. We know to whom we owe everything, and that is our veterans to whom we owe everything.  Jon Tester has been a great teammate. He has been great to work with. He has helped us get through some times of difficulty and some good times of common understanding and settlement, and I appreciate that very much.

The VFW wants the Secretary to weed out misperformers and especially the criminals, regardless of whether the crime was committed on or off duty.  The VFW wants a bill passed because maintaining the status quo does not work for those who have borne the battle and borne the fight.  They want to make sure the VA holds their employees to the standards the veterans of America feel they have committed themselves to as veterans serving in our military.  The American Legion applauds the bipartisan effort to provide Secretary Shulkin the additional tools to increase accountability and address poor performance within the Department of Veterans  I underscore this, because in the bill Jon and I ensure we motivate management to understand it is their job to seek out nonperformance and correct it before it runs amuck. So this bill incentivizes management of the Veterans' Administration to find those employees who are not performing well and turn them around and reward those employees who are turned around to be an example they set for all the rest of the employees.

13610,topic-id,523,"I want to talk about the culture the Senator just mentioned. He is exactly right. The main thing the American people are going to see from the Veterans' Administration now is a culture throughout that organization of excellence to serve the veterans the way they should be served. And where there might be an isolated problem, make sure it is sought out, rooted out, and corrected within the agency. Our veterans deserve the highest quality care.  Secretary Shulkin has asked for more authority to hold accountable those who are not meeting standards. He wants to recognize those who have not only met but exceeded standards as well.  This bill gives VA the authority to expedite the removal of a bad employee, but it doesn't motivate them to get rid of people, it gives them the parameters by which people should be dealt with if, in fact, they are behaving poorly. It shortens the process for removing an employee to 15 days. That doesn't mean you act recklessly or quickly, it means you act expeditiously to see to it that if you have a problem, it is addressed quickly for the benefit of all the agencies.  It removes the Merit Systems Protection Board from the appeal process for senior executives. There is some bad talk out there about removing the Merit Systems Protection Board for all employees. It doesn't do that at all. But the most senior employees of the Veterans' Administration deserve to be held accountable without lots of hoops you have to go through before ever getting to them. So by taking the Merit Systems Protection Board away from those senior executives, you are holding them totally accountable in the bright light of day for their own actions, without some hoop to go through for the agency trying to remove them.  It prohibits bonuses and relocation expenses for employees guilty of wrongdoing. I mentioned this in my earlier remarks, and I will reiterate. This deals with things like what happened in Pennsylvania, where two employees were reassigned for a discipline, yet they were given bonuses and cost-of-living adjustments in their pay upward for doing something wrong. That sends exactly the wrong signal to any employee in the Veterans'  For anyone doing a good job, it pats them on the back and lets them know they can do an even better job.  It expedites the hiring of VA medical center directors, which is absolutely critical. We have far too many people in the VA healthcare system today who are acting. They are acting director or acting assistant. We don't need any more ``acting'' in the Veterans' Administration; we need performance.  That is what this bill ends up being about--the performance of delivery of quality healthcare to our veterans, rewarding those employees who are doing a good job, encouraging those who aren't to do a better job, and seeing all American veterans get the services they deserve to get.  The need for this bill does not come out of thin air. I say to Senator Tester, can you tell me why the VA and veterans need this legislation to strengthen accountability at the VA?

Congress cannot allow itself to become desensitized to the gravity of those accusations or be deterred from an aggressive, expeditious, and fully independent investigation conducted in full view of the American public, because the real victims of this investigation's ``cloud'' are our constituents: Americans who wake up every morning praying that their monthly budget won't be compromised by the unexpected; who walk into their office hoping that today isn't the day that that layoff notice arrives; who tuck their son or daughter into bed at night knowing that, despite working two jobs, their kid won't be afforded the[[Page H4708]]same luxuries as their friend down the street; who look to Washington for a hand and instead see us forced to wrestle with an almost unbelievable question: whether the leader of the free world compromised the security of his citizens and our democracy to a foreign adversary.

13493,topic-id,353,"Mr.Speaker, I do not at all question the intentions of the proponents of this bill. I understand that the entire rationale is to expedite hiring because of the vast number of vacancies. I do, however, question the wisdom of this approach.  I think it is worth noting that, currently, two-thirds of the applicants for CBP fail the polygraph test; and that is important not as a barrier, but because that polygraph test reveals misconduct that makes them ineligible.  Now, the current Department of Homeland Security inspector general, John Roth, has expressed strong reservations about polygraph changes, the waivers, and, specifically, about these bills. He indicates that we need to identify other ways to make hiring more efficient ``without sacrificing integrity and effectiveness.'' And, in fact, the DHS OIG is currently auditing the CBP polygraph program, as is the  If you take a look at the bill, it allows for exemptions of the polygraph to certain categories of people, one of which is law enforcement officers who have undergone a polygraph examination as a condition of employment within the past 10 years. Well, you know, there was actually a Freedom of Information request on who flunked the polygraph tests in the CBP, and what has come out is that people who fall into this exemption admitted conduct that would make them ineligible, including child pornography, smuggling of drugs, theft.  It is fine to say that this would only be used when you knew that there wasn't a problem. The problem with that argument is sometimes you don't find out what the problem is until you subject the applicant to a polygraph or they know that they are about to be subjected to a polygraph, in which case, they own up.  So the Border Patrol is to be honored; they do a great job for us. But we know that the Sinaloa drug cartel is trying to recruit applicants.

13615,topic-id,3020,"Mr.President, just a little less than 2 weeks ago, President Trump released his proposed budget for fiscal year 2018, which would begin October 1. He named his plan ``A New Foundation for American Greatness.'' While unveiling this budget, Director Mulvaney, the OMB Director, declared that ``We are no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs, but by the number of people we help get off of those programs.''  When I read this and looked at the budget, I was reminded of the story of the two hikers who got to the top of a mountain. They stood near a big cliff and one hiker said: It is a beautiful vista.  The other hiker said: I am so exhausted from hiking all the way up; I wish I could get down quickly.  The first hiker then said: Let me help you with that. And he shoved him off the cliff.  That is what this budget does. It doesn't help people get off programs through education and training; it shuts down the programs. It shoves people off the cliff.  In this budget, millions of struggling, rural, middle-class, low-income, and working Americans are thrown off the cliff. They are thrown out of these programs as these programs are just struck down, not because programs have served their purpose and are no longer needed but because the President wants to do two things. He wants to build a lot more in terms of the military, and he wants to give a tax giveaway of some $6 trillion in the budget, with most of it going to the very richest This is not an ``America first'' budget; this is a ``billionaires first'' and a ``rural and working Americans last'' budget.  We see this vision implemented through dramatic cuts to food stamps, children's healthcare, job training, after-school programs, scientific research, and other anti-poverty programs. One program after another designed to help American families who are devastated will be eliminated, all in the name of building a wall, building more missiles and more bombs, and giving this massive, massive giveaway of the Treasury to the privileged and powerful.  Now there is good news. The good news is that I think we are going to have a bipartisan coalition we can build to defeat this budget. Even some of our colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus, who often talk about slashing government spending and eliminating programs, are saying that this proposal and its impact on rural Americans and rural America is draconian and unacceptable. It is not often that you hear folks throughout the entire political spectrum come together to say the same thing--that this budget is shortsighted and ill-conceived--but that is where we are now.  This budget tells us a lot because a budget is an expression of values. When President Trump placed this budget before us, we gained insight into his values. What we quickly learned is that President Trump doesn't place value on struggling and working American families, helping them climb a ladder to a better point. What this budget does tell us is that our President is all about raiding the National Treasury for the privileged and the powerful--quite the opposite of what we heard when he was campaigning.  Franklin Roosevelt once said that, as a nation, ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have little.'' By ``enough'' he meant, do we provide a ladder of opportunity for families to get their economic footing, to be able to buy a house, to be able to find a job, to be able to educate their children?  In this budget, President Trump puts out a different test. With this budget, he is saying that the test of our progress is whether we destroy programs for working Americans in order to fund a $6 trillion giveaway to the privileged and powerful. That is Donald Trump's test of progress, and I think we find very few in the country who might agree with that vision of making economic and educational progress for working Americans much more difficult. It is not an ``America first'' budget. It is not a foundation for American greatness. It is more akin to a great train robbery, a great raid on the National Treasury to benefit those who are already at the very top.  It is a budget that hurts children. It is a budget that hurts struggling, hard-working It cuts 20 percent from the Children's Health Insurance Program, critical for the health of our children. Shouldn't every child in America have access to affordable healthcare? That is a value I can get behind. But slashing healthcare for children and making it harder for them to succeed in life--I can't agree with that.  Let's make children hungrier by cutting the basic food stamp program or school programs that 44 million Americans rely on, cutting it by $193 billion. Making children hungrier doesn't help them learn. Helping children learn is a value I can get behind. Making it harder for them to succeed in school may be a Trump value, but it is not mine, and I don't think it is shared by many Members of this  We find that he proposes to get rid of the subsidization of interest on student loans, making the cost of college even more unaffordable for low-income and working graduates. He freezes the Pell grants that already have not kept pace with inflation. He proceeds to wipe out the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program that erases student loans after a decade of service to the public. All of this is about making college more expensive. I can get behind the value of making higher education more affordable, whether it is apprenticeship training, career technical education, or a 4-year college program. I can get behind making those programs more affordable, making community college programs more affordable because some form of education, whether it is in the technical education world or community college world or a 4-year program--some aspect of that is important to virtually every job in  Making it more affordable is what virtually every other developed country has done. In Germany, going to a public university is free in terms of tuition--not so here in the United[[Page S3274]]States of Our students are burdened by massive, massive debt. It is growing and growing and growing. I can get behind the value of saying we shouldn't make college a financial gauntlet because it is so essential to the success of our children. But Trump has a different value. His value is let's make it harder. Let's make it more difficult. Let's put students further into debt. Those are not values I can support. Again, I think very few in this Chamber would share in that.  The list goes on and on. This isn't just an attack on the ladder of opportunity for working Americans; this is an attack on rural During the last couple of years, I served as the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development and FDA, and in that time I have seen the tremendous impact many of these programs have had in providing opportunity and strengthening the economy in rural I value making rural America stronger, but that is not the value Trump put into his budget. He put into this budget: Let's undercut, let's undermine, let's make it more difficult for rural This is truly a ``rural America last'' budget.  It eliminates funding for Essential Air The Essential Air Service is essential to key small towns across our Nation, including one in my home If the Essential Air Service is wiped out, the economy of that town, Pendleton, would be dramatically impacted.  It slashes the Contract Tower Program that supports even more airports--six of them in my State--rural airports that need that contract tower support to be able to remain open. Small towns from Aurora to Klamath Falls would be dramatically impacted.  How about rural infrastructure? He takes out the rural water and wastewater disposal program. As I hold townhalls around my State--and I go to every county every year, all 36. Before I hold a public townhall where people can ask any question they want, I meet with the local county commissioners, city commissioners, and all the locally elected. In virtually every county, every year, I hear about the challenge of water infrastructure, expanding the clean water supply or waste water treatment. These two challenges are enormous. Yet here is President Trump wiping out the rural water and wastewater programs.  How about critical housing programs? Well, here is the issue. In our rural communities, often the economy is hindered by the lack of availability of affordable housing. I have been in town after town after town saying: We have interest by a company to move here because of some of the key assets we have. Then they decide not to because they don't have affordable housing in the community for them to be able to hire the staff they need. So we have these programs at the Federal level--direct single-family housing loans, direct multifamily housing loans, low-income housing repair loans, farm labor housing loans, self-help housing grants. Here again, the Trump budget wipes them out.  The Community Development Block Grant Program provides flexible strength for rural communities to address local problems. We talk a lot about flexibility in the Senate, enabling local areas to decide how best to use funds. The CDBG, the Community Development Block Grant, does exactly that. Yet it is not valued by our President, who probably doesn't even know what the program is, but he wiped it out.  How about the Rural Business-Cooperative Service that offers programs to support business development and job training? It is gone too. His budget slashes USDA's rural development programs by about $1 billion, a little less than $1 billion. This is a part of the agency where programs focus on supporting economic development, housing, and infrastructure in rural communities.  Then we have the impact on rural healthcare. This budget impacts rural healthcare in several different ways. It cuts the Rural Hospital Outreach Grant Program that helps small rural hospitals get resources to create collaboratives for long-term care facilities or with ambulance services. It eliminates the State offices of rural health.  In addition, this budget destroys healthcare for 23 million Americans, and many of those live in rural In fact, in Oregon, about one out of three individuals, almost one out of three in our small towns find healthcare through the Oregon Health Plan, the Oregon Health Plan funded by Rolling back Medicaid would throw some 400,000 people off of healthcare in Oregon just by itself, and that would make a huge impact in rural  I have been holding a lot of townhalls in rural This year I have had over 12 in what you would see on a map as pretty red counties, and people are coming up to me at townhalls and saying that they are scared to death about this budget's impact on healthcare. They are not just scared; they are terrified. And they are not just terrified; they are angry because they finally have the peace of mind that if a loved one gets sick, that loved one will get the care they need, that loved one will not end up bankrupt. That is a huge improvement in quality of life, but this budget from the President destroys that peace of mind.  It is not just impacting those who directly benefit from the Oregon Health Plan; it also impacts everybody else in the rural communities because the health plan has enabled our rural clinics and hospitals to do much better financially.  Out in the northeast corner of my State--it is a very remote and beautiful place--a person told me that his local clinic had gone from 20-some employees to about 50 employees, roughly doubling the healthcare provided. Why were they able to do that? Because they had had so much uncompensated care before people had access to insurance. Now that has dropped dramatically, and their finances are much better. So they are able to hire a lot more people and provide a lot more healthcare to this rural part of the But that changes with this Trump budget.  Let me list a few more details about some of these areas, starting with the USDA Rural Development Water  Last year, 14 projects in my State received $10.7 million in loans and $6.5 million in grants in order to provide reliable, clean drinking water and waste disposal, affecting 12,000 folks in rural Vernonia, which is in northwest Oregon, relied on these programs so as to finally improve the town's wastewater system--a project almost 20 years in the making. I have visited Vernonia a number of times. In 1996 it suffered a terrible flood, and then, again, in 2007, there was another major flood. The floods overwhelmed Vernonia's wastewater treatment systems and lagoons and caused overflows on public and private properties as well as into the nearby Nehalem Thanks to loans and grants from the USDA's rural water programs, the town of Vernonia was able to purchase new equipment, upgrade its wastewater systems, and protect the water for its residents. That is just one community that has benefited.  Let's talk a little bit more about housing. The budget singles out many housing programs to cut.  It eliminates the USDA Rural Development's direct housing loan programs and most of the housing grant programs and community facilities programs, which include programs like the rural Single Family Housing Direct Loans, the rural Multi-Family Housing Direct Loans, the self-help housing program, housing repair loans, and the Farm Labor Housing  With so many States and so many communities across our Nation suffering from a shortage of affordable and available housing, how can we consider it a positive thing to slice and dice these programs?  Last year, 6,000 rural Oregonian families were living in 211 affordable apartment complexes thanks to USDA financing. But keeping these programs and strengthening our housing initiatives isn't just good for our Nation's families. It is also critical for the economic development of rural towns and communities. As I have mentioned so often, I have heard from town leaders that they have a potential deal within their grasp, and it falls out of their grip because of the shortage of housing. We need to do better in this area, not worse.  Let's talk about another program--the Forest Service Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program.[[Page S3275]]This program is an all-lands approach to collaboratively encouraging science-based ecosystem restoration of priority forest landscapes.  Let me put it more simply.  Often, in terms of forest health, we have a challenge. The work in the woods can be quite expensive to improve forest health, and, often, you have disputes between the environmental community and the timber community on just how this should be done. A collaborative brings together these elements--the environmental side and the timber side--with the goal of both making the forest healthier and providing a steady supply of sawlogs to the mill.  This is something that happened in the Fremont-Winema National Forest, and it has given environmental and conservation groups confidence that Fremont-Winema is on a track to having a healthier ecosystem. At the same time, their work has helped to ensure that there is a balance between the timber industry and environmental protection, which means that timber is still coming and will keep coming to the local mill, which will help to create local jobs, like at the Collins Mill in Klamath That mill is able to continue employing more than 80 workers because of the steady supply of logs that makes its way from Fremont-Winema due to the eco-friendly forest management practices.  This ``billionaires first'' and ``rural America and workers last'' budget is going to die here in the Senate because there is going to be a bipartisan coalition of Democrats and Republicans who say that undermining the success of our families in order to provide a massive giveaway--a raid, if you will, on the National Treasury--and a handout to the privileged and powerful is, simply, the wrong way to go. This is, really, Robin Hood in reverse. This is a situation in which the working families are undermined to provide a $6 trillion raid on the Treasury, with most being given away to our richest American families.  I do not know that there is anyone in this Chamber who is not already aware that we have massive income inequality here in the United States of I do not think there is any Senator among the 100 Senators of the Senate who is unaware that we have a massive wealth gap in It has gotten larger and larger and larger until it has become equal to that level or near that level at which it was before the Great That is not a way for America to thrive--to raid working families in order to provide even more giveaways to those who have the most.  I must say that this budget does not surprise me. It does not surprise me that the President submitted this. The President himself is a billionaire. The President lives in that world of billionaires, and he was persuaded to think that helping the billionaires to have even millions more would, somehow, be good for  I would like to take the President to real working America so that he may see the real impact on the ground of destroying rural health clinics, see the real impact on the ground of destroying rural water systems, and see the real impact on the ground of destroying rural housing programs. We need to get the President outside of his billionaire bubble and seeing the impact so that, somehow, he gets a grip on what it means to guide this country in education policy and economic policy and so that we strengthen that ladder of opportunity rather than destroy it.

Nothing less is at stake, and none of us here should forget that.  For months, the questions surrounding President Trump's campaign's ties to Russia--what happened, who was involved, and why--have gone unanswered. The more information that comes out, the more suspicious it all looks. And the more that President Trump tries to douse the flame by firing the people looking at where the smoke is coming from, the more we are going to keep paying attention, because the bottom line is that there are so many questions--real questions, legitimate questions--that absolutely need to be answered.  Many of us have pushed for these answers. We have called for an independent investigation. We had hoped that President Trump would resist the urge to slow them down or stop them or cover anything up. But the time for the back-and-forth is over. The time for hoping is behind us, and the time for all of us to come together and speak with one voice for truth and against any kind of coverup is now.[[Page S2874]]  What happened yesterday was truly shocking, and this is coming from someone who didn't think that was possible anymore with this  But if anyone was wavering before, if anyone wanted to give this administration just a bit more time, I am hoping they have been paying attention to the events of the past 24 hours because it is hard to stay on the fence now.  President Trump's firing the head of the FBI like that--in such a haphazard way--in the middle of an investigation into his own campaigning activities should be the last straw for anyone. So right now it could not be more clear.  It is time for a special prosecutor who can run an independent investigation, far from the reach of President Trump and his administration, to take the case and finally get the answers the American public deserves.  At the same time, our efforts here in Congress--especially the investigation in the Intelligence Committee--have to continue, and they need to continue in an independent and bipartisan way.

More than 100 days into his term, President Trump may have forgotten that he promised to be a voice for millions of people across our country. But I haven't forgotten whom I represent, and I stand here today to lift up the voices of so many people in my home State of Washington who are calling on us to get the answers--people who care about our country, who know we can do better, who hate to see us spiraling toward situations we have not seen since President  As of noon today, my office had been flooded with hundreds of calls.

13622,topic-id,1256,"Mr.President, I wish to take a few minutes this afternoon to talk about TrumpCare, specifically, about what families back in my home State of Washington are saying about the harm that this bill will do and why, despite how often Republicans say they are struggling to find a way to jam TrumpCare through the Senate, now is the time to keep the pressure on.  I have had to say this far too often: Right now people across the country are scared, and they have a right to be. The policies in TrumpCare would turn our healthcare system into a minefield of higher costs and worse care for our families. If you are a young person who needs mental healthcare, you could pay thousands more a year on top of what you are already paying for insurance. If you are a senior, your premiums could increase by as much as 850 percent. If you need maternity care, the independent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office shows you could pay as much as $1,000 more a month.  Under TrumpCare, 23 million people across the country would lose coverage, and, because insurance companies would have far more power to lower their standards and offer skimpy, snake-oil plans, we would go back to the days when a trip to the emergency room could result in a truly devastating financial hit.  I have just described some of the biggest impacts TrumpCare would have. None of them help patients and families. They instead do serious harm.  But you know who would benefit from TrumpCare? Special interests in the healthcare industry that would get a massive tax break and, of course, President Trump, who is desperate for a political win.  For these reasons and many more, people across our country are rejecting They don't want the dramatically higher healthcare costs. They don't want this bill to create even more chaos in our healthcare system than Republicans already have, and they certainly don't think they should have to pay more, all to appease President Trump and those at the very top.  Senate Republican leaders have said they expect their final product will look a whole lot like the version of TrumpCare that passed in the In fact, some of them said they expect to keep as much as 80 percent of the House-passed version of So it is no wonder that they are now having trouble figuring out how to cobble together enough votes to jam this disastrous bill through the If that is truly the case, then, I would again encourage them to drop this reckless repeal effort, to stop creating chaos in our healthcare system, which is driving up our premiums, and to work with Democrats on real solutions.  We are ready, like we have always been, to find ways to bring down families' healthcare costs while making sure they get the same quality of care and finding ways to get families more affordable coverage. Unfortunately, we have not heard from any Republicans who are willing to reverse course. That is why, despite how much trouble Republicans may be having with their disastrous policies, I am here today urging anyone who rejects TrumpCare and what it means for our families' health and financial security to fight as hard as they can against this bill. Keep making those calls, keep rallying, and keep sharing your stories.[[Page S3279]]  Since the election, I have heard from family after family in Washington State about what the future holds for their healthcare. One of those is a constituent of mine named Marcy Her husband is a small business owner, and they purchase individual insurance.  Well, in 2014 Marcy was diagnosed with cancer. She has had to have not one but two stem cell transplants since then, and her chemotherapy costs are over $3,000 each month.  Before the Affordable Care Act, Marcy's health insurance had no out-of-pocket limit. Without limits on how much insurance companies can charge patients--a protection that TrumpCare would take away--Marcy says she and her husband will most definitely face bankruptcy.  Marcy also says that the ACA ``literally saved my life--and we could not afford the type of care I am receiving without it.''  There are stories like Marcy's in literally every community in our country--in red States, in blue States, in purple It is appalling that instead of working with us to make healthcare more affordable and with higher quality and expanding coverage, instead of listening to people like Marcy and joining us at the table, Republicans are trying to jam through the Senate a plan that would do the opposite--one that would threaten lives and devastate our families financially.  So I am going to do everything I can to fight back, and I will keep working hard against the deeply harmful TrumpCare plan that Republicans are determined to get signed into law. Families like Marcy's are bravely speaking up and making clear just how damaging TrumpCare would be, and that is exactly what Democrats here in the Senate are going to do as well.                         the President's Budget  Before I close, Mr.President, I want to take a couple of minutes to talk about President Trump's latest budget proposal, because even after last week's stunning move by President Trump to obstruct our fight against climate change and seeing another confirmation the week before that that 23 million Americans would lose their healthcare coverage under TrumpCare, we cannot lose sight of the grand scope of President Trump's cruel attack against working families. Nowhere has the President's broken promises to working families been more evident than in his recent budget proposal.  President Trump spent his campaign promising workers he would stand with them, promising seniors he would protect their care, promising the middle class he would make the economy work for them. Then he came to Washington, DC, and crafted a budget that is a perfect summary of all the way those promises are broken.  In fact, the President's budget director came up to Capitol Hill just 2 weeks ago to try to defend the budget, to try to explain how it didn't break promises, but he couldn't do it because it can't be done.  From his promises not to cut Medicaid or Social Security to his promise to provide ``insurance for everybody'' that was better and at lower cost, promise after promise was not just broken but shattered.  So I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to reject President Trump's anti-worker, anti-student, anti-woman, anti-senior agenda. Thankfully, we are seeing signs that is happening. Democrats, Republicans, and Independents have been criticizing this budget here in DC and across the country. One senior Republican Senator called it ``dead on arrival,'' and he is exactly right.  The families we represent want us to work together, to invest in our workers and in our middle-class families, to protect patients, to stand with women, to grow our economy from the middle out, and not simply give more tax cuts to the wealthy or well connected. We were able to do this before. Recently, Democrats and Republicans came together to pass a spending bill that rejected President Trump's extreme agenda and worked for families and the middle class. We were able to come together on bipartisan budget deals that increased investments. So I am hopeful that Republicans will stand with us on the side of the people they represent, push aside this awful budget from the President, and work with us to do this again. I stand ready to do that.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

13618,topic-id,575,"Mr.President, it is fitting that today, June 6, the anniversary of D-day in Europe and the Battle of Midway in the Pacific, we are talking about our country's veterans in the debate that is going on in the The brave men and women who have served our country deserve the very best care our Nation can give them. That is why I rise today in support of the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which I believe will pass by a voice vote in the Senate later this afternoon.  This bipartisan bill will help improve the quality of care our veterans receive by reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs and making it easier for the Secretary of the VA to fire poorly performing employees. The legislation will allow the VA to hold its employees more accountable. It will also create new protections for whistleblowers--those who report wrongdoing. And it would ensure that any employee who is terminated has an adequate opportunity to appeal their dismissal.  For years, the VA has been plagued by reports of inefficiency and long wait times. I might say that often we find those reports are true, but that is completely separate from the quality of medical care that is given through the VA healthcare system. If you talk to almost any veteran, they are very pleased with the quality of that medical care. It is the administrative stuff getting in the way, and that is what there has been such an outrage about.  Well, this VA bill is going to help the VA get rid of the bad actors while protecting the good ones. I want to make it clear that the vast majority of VA employees perform their work admirably in an often thankless environment. These dedicated public servants work hard to provide the day-to-day care our veterans deserve, and they should be protected. That is why, while I believe it is important to hold poorly performing employees accountable, I also believe that it is important to protect the rights of the employees who may have been wrongly terminated, especially at the lower levels, by giving them the opportunity to appeal a supervisor's decision to fire them. This bill we are going pass does that. It is supported by dozens of veterans service organizations, the Office of Special Counsel, the Secretary himself. So I urge our colleagues to join me and join so many of us in voting in favor of the bill.  I would also say that on this very famous day, this anniversary, June 6, I have been to the beaches of Normandy, I have been to Omaha As a matter of fact, while there, it is impossible to walk into that cemetery on the cliff overlooking the beach--it is impossible to walk into that beautiful, beautiful American cemetery and not become very, very emotional, realizing what happened in 1944.  I felt so strongly about this that at one point I wanted to put on my jogging shoes and run the 4 miles of that Omaha I wanted to reach back into time, having been there where so many sacrificed so much.  Then, of course, the Battle of Midway, the time which turned the battle in the Pacific, where a young admiral showed his courage and his superiority in planning. As a result, that battle turned around the course of the war in the Pacific with What a day to remember, June 6.  I yield the floor.

13534,topic-id,457,"Mr.Speaker, my legislation would provide a much-needed ``commencement of construction'' extension to the FERC permit for the Enloe Dam Hydroelectric Project located in my Central Washington district.  The Enloe Project is located at the existing Enloe Dam in the Similkameen River Valley, which is situated approximately four miles upriver of the City of The original dam was constructed by BLM in 1920 for power generation but operations ceased in 1958 when the Bonneville Power Administration extended a high-voltage transmission line into the Okanogan  However, since 1958 the dam and its related power-generating facilities have sat dormant and the Okanogan Public Utility District (``District'') is now working on the proposed project to re-energize this infrastructure for hydropower development, as well as to relocate the site to the opposite bank, which offers numerous environmental and construction advantages.  The proposed 9 megawatt hydropower facility has faced several setbacks and regulatory hurdles, which have been addressed but have also delayed progress. However, despite these challenges the District has made considerable progress in fulfilling all of the pre-construction obligations contained in its FERC license.  H.2828 would ensure this critical hydropower project can move forward and provide important renewable energy generation to the region. The Enloe Project makes economic and environmental sense, as it will convert currently untapped energy in existing flow releases into clean, carbon-neutral energy. Additionally, the Project will have a footprint that is roughly half the size of the existing facility but will provide approximately three times the generating capacity of the decommissioned plant.  Completion of the Project will provide Washingtonians and the Pacific Northwest region with a clean, renewable energy resource that generates an estimated 45,000 megawatt hours per year of carbon-free, renewable power. Further, the proposed project will create jobs and needed employment opportunities in a region with an unemployment rate that far exceeds the national average, underscoring the many positive benefits this project will have for the local community, state, and region.  This important legislation will allow for development of this critical hydropower facility to move forward under a realistic regulatory timeline and in a manner consistent with prior congressional actions on similar projects.  By passing this measure and extending the ``commencement of construction'' deadline for the Enloe Project, Congress can help spur hydropower development in Central Washington and ensure the Project's many benefits are realized, which will have a lasting impact on the region's energy supply and economic viability.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.Upton) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.2828.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.

13621,topic-id,2343,"Mr.President, we have 50 workdays in the Senate before the end of this fiscal year--50 days. That does not include the 5 weeks we will be gone during the August State work weeks. I rise tonight to talk about what happens September 30. September is the end of the fiscal year. That means we have to have the Federal Government funded for fiscal year 2018, which starts October 1 of this year.  Like most years--as a matter of fact, like every year since 1980--the Federal Government will probably not be funded by the end of this fiscal year in the manner it was supposed to be, according to the law that was done in 1974, the Budget Act of 1974. In the last 43 years, the Federal Government has only been funded four times, according to that bill. We have used 178 continuing resolutions, and therefore ongoing omnibuses and so forth, where six people get in a room, basically decide how we are going to spend $1 trillion.  This is the only enterprise I can find anywhere in the world that funds its operations this way. The problem is, we have a system that is absolutely totally broken. It is a fraud that is being perpetrated on the American people. We have been asked, between now and September 30--this is the way the budget process works. By the way, we should have started this back in January, but we couldn't do it because we were working on the fiscal year 2017 budget to do reconciliation so we could work on healthcare.  Now we are going to, when that gets done, do a budget for 2018. We will do a reconciliation and hopefully do a tax package behind that, but wrapped up in all of that, here comes September 30 and 50 workdays from today to fund the Federal Between now and then, in 50 days, we are asked to do a budget for fiscal year 2018, to do full authorizations for 16 different entities, committees, and then do appropriations for 12 committees.  By the way, over the last 43 years, you have to fund 12 appropriations bills to fund the Federal It was 13 appropriations bills up until around 2000. Since then, it has been 12, but of those 12, the average number of appropriations bills this body has appropriated each year is 2\1/2\.  Now, by any measure, that is unacceptable, but we are now asked, between now and September 30, in a very truncated manner, to do the budget, do all 16 authorizations and all 12 appropriations. Now, I am not a betting man, but I will go to Vegas and short that idea right now. There is no way we are going to fund this government according to that policy--no way. It will not happen. It can't happen. It has not happened in 43 years that way except four times.  Every single year this process breaks down. Like I said, we have used 178 continuing resolutions. What does a CR do? It ties the hands of our military leaders, where they can't move money from one bucket to the other to help accommodate it. So what we have right now is a process that just has not worked. Yet, because of that, the Federal Government has exploded in size.  In 2000, the Federal Government spent $2.4 trillion running the Federal Last year, we spent $3.9 trillion. Those are constant 2016 dollars. Over the next 10 years, we are going to spend $53 trillion running the Federal We are going to borrow a significant part of that--another $10 trillion.  The irony is, the debate we are having between now and September 30 is to fund the government, not on the full $4 trillion we are going to spend next year running the Federal Government, we are going to have this debate on only about $1.1 trillion, the discretionary side of the budget.  If you do the math, in the last 8 years and, oh, by the way, in the next 10 years, according to the current CBO baseline budget, we borrow over 30 percent of what we spend as a Federal Well, discretionary spending over the next 10 years is going to be less than that. So what that means is, over the last 8 years and over the next 10 years, every dime we have spent on discretionary spending has, by definition, been borrowed.  There is no other way to look at it. That means that every dime we have spent for our military, which is about $600 billion today, every dime we spend on our VA, which is a little less than $200 billion, and every dime we spend on all other domestic expenditures, including healthcare, by the way, comes to $1.1 trillion. Every dime of that today is borrowed money. That means we have to go to China and the rest of the world to fund all of our discretionary spending.  Now, by anybody's estimate--conservative, liberal, whatever--that is not acceptable. Here is why it is not acceptable: It cannot be sustained over a long period of time. Yet we are sitting here with a budget today that goes for the next 10 years that says we are going to continue operating business as usual and add another $10 trillion to this already burdensome debt of $20 trillion.  The debt crisis and the budget problem are interlinked. There is no way that we can solve the debt crisis unless and until we solve the budget process. The difficulty comes in trying to align the prospects within the process itself of getting to a determination.  Right now, the budget process doesn't work for this very reason: The budget itself is not a law. It is a resolution, which means the majority party can cram down the throat of the minority its version of a political budget. That is all it is.  Then you go to an authorization process, and, in the authorization process today, we have over $310 billion of Federal expenditures that are not authorized, including the State Last year, we didn't even do an authorization for our military. Even then, after passing the appropriations bill in the Armed Services Committee 30 to 0, we could not get that bill on the floor of the We tried six times. So it was not authorized or appropriated last year, but it got wrapped up in an omnibus, and that same thing will more than likely happen this year.  This can be fixed. It is not that difficult. Several of us have been working behind the scenes, looking at other best practices around the world--other countries, companies, and even We have looked at best practices. What we found was that nobody else tries to fund their government or their enterprise the way we try to fund the Federal This goes back to article I and article II of our  Article I says that funding the Federal Government is the responsibility of Yet we have absconded with that. The 1921 act that created the Office of Management and Budget went well beyond what I think is called for in the original So what we are looking at today is a legislative underreach and an executive overreach relative to funding government, out of necessity because of the dysfunction right here in the Senate relative to how we fund our government. There is no question that we will not fund this government without a continuing resolution and/or an omnibus come September 30.  The fix is not that unreasonable. All we need is a politically neutral platform that brings all expenses into the budget process--all $4 trillion today. That would include discretionary and mandatory and that the budget become a law, which means that we have to get bipartisan support for the budget.  Then, lastly, if we don't get the budget done by a certain date and we don't fund the government by the end of the fiscal year, then, severe consequences are borne by the people who have the responsibility to fund the government, and that is the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the people in the administration who are responsible for their part of it.  It is not that complicated. Many other countries do it. Most other countries do it. In fact, in some countries, if[[Page S3278]]they don't fund the government by the end of their fiscal year, their constitutions actually say that the government gets disbanded and they have an election. Well, that is not what I am calling for here. I don't think we have to do anything that severe.  There are colleagues of mine right here in this body, on both sides, who have contributed--Senators Whitehouse, Enzi, Corker, Lankford, Tillis, Ernst, Rounds, Sullivan, Daines, and others--and who are weighing in on this. Governors, who have executive experience running large financial enterprises at the State level, have come into this body and bring enormous wealth of experience about how to get this done.  My argument is that right now, during this period of dysfunctionality when we see firsthand the reality of not being able to take care of domestic needs, military needs, or any other discretionary enterprises that we want to fund because of our own budgeting intransigence, I can find no other time better than what we have right now to raise the question on both sides of the aisle. This is not a partisan conversation. Both sides are guilty, but let's come up with a politically neutral platform that would allow both sides, during the budget process, to talk about tax increases, tax expenditures, spending cuts, all the spending that we have, and all the responsibility we have in the Federal Government or in the Congress of funding the Federal Why not?  We have one suggestion that says: Pick a time in the future. Decide what percentage of your GDP should be covered by debt--no more than that--and have a limit on that, and then pick a roadmap back from that point in time to today with guardrails around that. That suggestion comes from the other side of the aisle, and I applaud that suggestion and I think it is very workable. I think we can find ways to make all of this work. This should not be a partisan conversation.  I sit on the Armed Services Committee, and I sat on Foreign Relations the last 2 years. Both of those committees are really very strong bipartisan efforts by every  That is what is needed here, and yet the Budget Committee, ironically, is one of the most partisan committees. The reason it is so is because of the law itself, because the budget is not a law. It is a resolution. My contention is that this is the root of this problem. It is one of the causative factors that cause this debt to be uncontrollable and to cause a dysfunction in this body from even being able to attempt to bring that under control.  The solution is not just taxing more. It is not just spending more. It is not just growing more. The problem is much bigger than that. The debt problem will never be solved unless and until we solve this budgeting process.  As we close in on the next 50 days, as we check off every single day, I want my colleagues in here to be reminded of what we are going to have to do to fund the government come October 1. Please, let's not get right up to September 30 with a gun to our head that says: Either do it this way, spend this money this way, or do not fund the government tomorrow. That is total irresponsibility, just like I believe this budget process is a fraud perpetrated by Washington on the people of America and it is not honest relative to what we have to face up to in terms of our responsibilities.  We cannot afford to do all that we are doing. That is just pure fact. The world is no longer going to be able to loan us the money that we need over the next 10 years--another $10 trillion. There is some $200 trillion of total debt in the world. Only $60 trillion of the $200 trillion is sovereign debt, and we have one-third of that sovereign debt today. Now, most other countries have curtailed their borrowing. We are one of the few that continue to just race along this path of borrowing money at this breakneck pace and adding another $10 trillion. We could, potentially, have over half of the world's sovereign debt in the next 10 years. That cannot happen. The world bond risk and the bond markets will not, potentially, allow that to happen.  So today is the day. As we go through the next 50 days, I believe we need to look for opportunities on both sides of the aisle to find a bipartisan way to stop this nonsense and to get to where we can fund the government in a responsible way each year, not just 1 year, and to get away from the past 43 years of total failure in terms of funding the Federal Government, such that when we get to September 30 of each year, we have already approved the budget and we have the appropriations lined up and funded for the needs that we have all agreed here in Congress need to be met.  I can think of no other call on this body higher than this right now because it puts us at risk of doing the very things that we need to do; that is, to take care of our domestic needs, to take care of the people who need the safety net, to take care of these legacy programs of Social Security and Medicare, and yet defend our country. Because of this debt, we are limiting the opportunities that we have, and we will not solve that until we address this budget process.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Paul).

Last century it looked like the regimes of the Axis Now it looks like North Korea, Egypt, the Philippines, and, yes, These are all nations led by strongmen whom our President has praised in some manner, strongmen who hold democratic institutions in contempt and exercise disproportionate control over their nations' military, government institutions, and the media.  While the press here in the United States remains independent, we have a President who has chosen to regularly do battle with what he derides as the ``fake news media.'' He has even called our cherished, constitutionally protected free press ``the enemy of the American people.''  It is often said that the news is the ``first rough draft of history.'' While the President can attempt to wage war with the news media, none of us can truly fight history. But here in the Senate, we can help shape it. History has its eyes on our Chamber now.  Some of my colleagues across the aisle have said they are ``troubled'' or ``disappointed'' by the President's decision to fire Director Comey, but it appears that many are taking a wait-and-see approach. They are taking a wait-and-see approach to Director Comey's firing. They are taking a wait-and-see approach to how the administration replaces him. They are taking a wait-and-see approach to the ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's potential collusion with The problem here is that this administration won't let us see anything. The Trump administration is actively working to cover up everything that we, as the independent legislative branch, need to see to get to the bottom of the Trump campaign's potential collusion with  Director Comey was investigating this potential collusion at the time that he was fired, and it has been reported that Director Comey recently asked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for an increase in money and personnel for this very investigation. Within a matter of days, the Deputy Attorney General wrote a memo recommending that President Trump fire Director Comey for actions he took last year. So was Director Comey fired on May 9, 2017, for his actions back in 2016? Are we to believe the President and the Attorney General were carefully weighing the merits of Director Comey's service since the inauguration, or was he fired because he was ramping up his investigation into Russian collusion? Let's not forget that this is the same collusion investigation from which Attorney General Sessions recused himself before recommending to the President that he fire Director  This is clearly a President who is more than happy to fire people, and he does so in a hasty fashion. Director Comey is not the first public servant to be fired while investigating this administration. In fact, he is in pretty good company. Acting Attorney General Sally Yates was fired while overseeing the collection of intelligence related to meetings between the Russian Ambassador and members of the Trump team. The U.attorney for the Southern District of New York was fired while investigating HHS Secretary Price's financial investments, in addition to leading a separate investigation into corrupt Russian businessmen and officials. One firing is an incident, two is a coincidence, but three is a pattern.  The past 4 months suggests that our President thinks he can simply tweet and fire his way out of this problem, while continuing to cozy up to the Earlier today, less than 24 hours after firing Director Comey, President Trump hosted the Russian Ambassador and the Foreign Minister in the Oval  I am deeply concerned that the President is unable or unwilling to grasp what the underlying problem here actually is. When the President hears Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle discuss the Russian attack on our election and the very foundations of our democracy, he hears sour grapes stemming from people who would have liked the Republican primary or the general election to have ended differently. But let me be very clear: This is not about scoring political points. This is not about winning the news cycle or the back-and-forth on This is not the newest iteration of partisan politics.  Now is the time for all of us to put country above party. Throughout our Nation's history, Senators have come together to tackle some of the Nation's most difficult problems. Our Union has survived other challenges, and I am confident we can navigate this together, but we need to know exactly what we are up against. This is about properly diagnosing and curing a possible Russian infection in the White House and inoculating our government and elections for the future. Firing your doctor won't take your illness away, and taking a wait-and-see approach won't do that either.  We need an independent special prosecutor to diagnose potential collusion between the Trump campaign and We cannot wait for the President to handpick a new FBI Director who will owe his or her nomination for this unexpected job opening to the very people he or she will be charged with investigating.  Our democracy is resilient and our democracy is strong, but if we have a festering foreign infection that is left untreated, our democratic system will certainly weaken. We need a special prosecutor to either identify and address any malfeasance or issue this White House a clean bill of health.  Democracies are built on trust in civic institutions--a trust that has eroded in recent years, and I am deeply concerned that this erosion is accelerating. As Americans and as elected officials, we must come together and restore our constituents' trust in the Federal We cannot just wait and see any longer.

I hope the Senate moves expeditiously to vote for it and to help our veterans to be able to have the kind of responsibility and accountability they deserve.                         Remembering Les Spaeth  Mr.President, I also rise today to talk about veterans. I am going to focus on World War II veterans.  Last Monday was Memorial I was in Mason, I was in Warren County, My mom grew up there, and my family still has a lot of ties there. I was there at a ceremony for the veterans memorial, one of the most beautiful memorials in the State of I happened to be there about 15 years ago when it was first began, and it was great to be back. At the ceremony, I got to see a World War II buddy of mine. His name is Les He is also a good friend of my father's and grandfather's. As always, seeing him brought back great memories, and I was able to speak about him during my remarks.  Two days later--a few days ago--we got word that Les Spaeth died at age 92. I want to take a moment to pay tribute to this man who gave so much to his country and to his community.  Les was a marine corporal during World War He signed up after graduating from Mason High School in 1942. He served in the Pacific, including the occupation of Japan after the war, helping that country make a difficult transition to democracy. Thanks in large part to American soldiers like him, by the way, the transition worked. Japan has become one of our greatest allies.  Les came back to Mason, OH, and started a small business called Spaeth Brothers He had that optimism so many of the World War II generation had. He had the courage to take a risk and help build jobs and help the economy of his hometown. My dad did the same thing after World War  Les was a businessman, but he was also a public servant for more than half a century. He served six terms as Warren County auditor. He served on the Board of Elections for 25 years. He chaired the Warren County Republican Party for 17 years.  He was very active in the community in so many other ways too. He was one of the very first volunteer firefighters in Mason, OH, starting way back in 1948. He was elder at his church, Heritage Presbyterian, where his service will be held. For 70 years, he was a freemason and member of the American He helped set up the American Legion Buckeye Boys Program, a great program where they are teaching young men about State, local, and Federal government and values and leadership. His whole life was centered around his community--through the family business, through military service, through elected office, and through volunteerism.  In 2009, Mason High School started having a distinguished alumni graduation speaker every year. For all the reasons I talked about a moment ago, a few years ago, in 2013, I wrote a letter and recommended that they honor Les They agreed with me. That spring of 2013, it was time to receive his award. He gave a beautiful speech. He talked about his love for this country and counting our blessings as He received a standing ovation from the graduating class. I know that meant a lot to him. That ovation shows the respect and esteem people in Warren County have for Les Spaeth across generations.  On behalf of Ohio, I want to express my condolences to the family of Les I also want to thank them for sharing Les with the rest of us in Ohio for these past 92 years. He was a dedicated servant to the people of Warren County, an American hero for his military service, and a good friend to so many.                       73rd Anniversary of D-day  As was noted, as we talk about World War II, today is also the 73rd anniversary of D-day. As Chairman Isakson just said, it was really the beginning of the end of that war. And 73 years ago this morning, Les Spaeth was in theater in the Pacific, as I said, risking his life for all of us. But in Europe on that same morning, the largest amphibious invasion in the history of the world was taking place. Men as young as 18 years old were crossing the channel, carrying packs weighing 80 pounds. More than 160,000 Allied soldiers--mostly Americans--and more than 5,000 ships backed by more than 10,000 aircraft were fighting to liberate Europe from The outcome was far from certain. The Nazis had spent 2 years fortifying the coast to prepare for this moment. It was Hitler's so-called Atlantic The beautiful coastline of France was covered in barbed wire, land mines, and bunkers.  A little more than a month before D-day, by the way, the Allies had conducted a trial run. They practiced on beaches in western England that were most like those of The practice run was a disaster. In fact, Germans spotted the Allied ships and attacked them. Hundreds of American troops died in that practice session.  COL George Taylor told his troops as they were about to land on Normandy: ``Only two kinds of men are going to be on this beach--the dead, and those about to die. So get moving.'' This was[[Page S3270]]tough stuff. They had an enormous task, and the stakes could not have been higher.  Erwin Rommel--and Rommel was leading the Nazi defense at that time--said at that time: ``The fate of Germany depends on . . . the first 24 hours of this invasion.'' He was right.  Well-known historian Douglas Brinkley said that D-day was ``the single most important moment in the 20th Century.'' It was one of the bloodiest too. It was the beginning of the end of the most difficult war in human history, and the lives of millions of people depended on the outcome.  They depended on the success of brave, young Americans like Eugene Lyons of University Heights, Eugene was a medic. His ship hit a mine in the English Channel and sank off the coast. He swam to shore while German planes shot at him, missing him by a matter of inches. Or the Napier brothers of Warren County, like Les Five brothers all served during World War Two of them were there on the beaches that day; one died. Or Jim ``Pee Wee'' Martin from Dayton, OH, who served in the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment and parachuted behind German lines before dawn that day. Jim received both the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star for his service that day. Or Sigmund Czelusniak of North Royalton, OH, who was wounded by a mortar shell on Omaha Sigmund later said, as he lay wounded: ``In my heart, I didn't think I'd ever come back.''  More than 10,000 Allied troops did not come back.  While those brave men and hundreds of thousands of others were fighting, President Franklin Roosevelt took to the airwaves, as you would expect a President to do. As you know, he was known for what were called fireside chats. These were informal speeches he would give to the Nation during difficult times. But on that day, he did something very different. Instead of giving a speech, he was called to lead the Nation in prayer. This prayer brought our country together. It strengthened our resolve. It comforted us at a very difficult and frightening time for our country, and it briefly encapsulated, as you will hear in a second, what our purpose was--not just in World War II but what our purpose was as He made an indelible mark on our history.  Three years ago, after the 70th anniversary of D-day, then-President Obama signed into law legislation that I had authored to add the words of this famous prayer to the World War II Memorial in Washington, Since then, the site for the plaque has been approved. The architect is continuing to work with the National Park Service on the design. I have been told that the Park Service intends to present the design options to the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission during their meetings this summer. Construction could begin as soon as December and be completed by next  Frankly, I am discouraged this has taken so long because this prayer belongs on the World War II Memorial, and Congress has said so. I urge the Park Service to move as expeditiously as possible to complete this project, to bring those words to so many veterans and others who visit that beautiful memorial.  As has been my tradition since the time we were trying to get that legislation passed, I would like to read the words President Roosevelt spoke on D-day 73 years ago.  He started by saying:       My fellow Americans: Last night, when I spoke with you . .      . I knew at that moment that troops of the United States and      our allies were crossing the Channel in another and greater      operation. It has come to pass with great success thus far.      And so, in this poignant hour, I ask you to join with me in      prayer.  This was his prayer:       Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have      set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our      Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free      a suffering humanity. Lead them straight and true; give      strength to their arms, stoutness to their hearts,      steadfastness in their faith.       They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and      hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces.      Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return      again and again; and we know by Thy grace and by the      righteousness of our cause our sons will triumph. They will      be sore tried, by night and by day, without rest--until the      victory is won. The darkness will be rent by noise and flame.      Men's souls will be shaken with the violences of war.       For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They      fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end      conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice      arise, and tolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. They      yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the      haven of home.       Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive      them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom.       And for those of us at home--fathers, mothers, children,      wives, sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas, whose      thoughts and prayers are ever with them--help us, Almighty      God, to rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this      hour of great sacrifice.       Many people have urged that I call the nation into a single      day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the      desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a      continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again      when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips,      invoking Thy help to our efforts.       Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks, to      redouble the contributions we make in the physical and      material support of our armed forces.       And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail,      to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our      sons wheresoever they may be.       And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee; faith in      our sons; faith in each other; faith in our united crusade.      Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not      the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but      fleeting moment--let not these deter us in our unconquerable      purpose.       With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces      of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and      racial arrogances. Lead us to the saving of our country, and      with our sister nations into a world unity that will spell a      sure peace--a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy      men. And a peace that will let all men live in freedom,      reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.       Thy will be done, Almighty  Those were the words he spoke and the words that will soon be inscribed on the World War II monument.  I yield the floor.

13589,topic-id,721,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for making our efforts to combat child exploitation and human trafficking a priority on the Judiciary  Mr.Speaker, one of the reasons I was eager to join the Judiciary Committee was to play a role in combating crimes against children. I am proud to serve on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, where, under the leadership of Chairman Trey Gowdy, we are working to protect innocent children, and make sure that those that would do them harm are brought to justice.  Mr.Speaker, it is not easy to talk about crimes against children, particularly those that are sexual in nature. Just speaking the term ``global sex tourism'' is enough to send chills up almost anyone's spine. Because this subject is so ugly and uncomfortable, most Americans probably have no idea the extent to which children around the globe are at risk of exploitation. That is what makes it so important that we do talk about it and address the problem head-on.  Earlier this year, I met with experts from the Department of Justice to discuss how loopholes in current law are allowing child predators to evade punishment for their abuse of children in the United States overseas. Certain types of sexual contact with children are not explicitly covered under the criminal definition of ``illicit sexual conduct.'' This allows child predators engaged in global sex tourism to evade punishment for acts that are clearly abusive.  Also, current sentencing code does not treat contact offenses against child victims under the age of 12 the same as it does against those victims between the ages of 12 and 18.  Mr.Speaker, these loopholes were, of course, never intended. Nonetheless, these technical flaws in the law are making it harder for authorities to put serial child abusers away where they belong.  H.1862, the Global Child Protection Act, aims to close these loopholes and better equip law enforcement to protect people and punish abusers. Specifically, this bill would expand the definition of ``illicit sexual conduct'' to include ``sexual contact,'' thus allowing authorities to crack down on global sex tourism and punish these criminals.  This bill also seeks to protect the youngest child victims by broadening the sentencing code to ensure that all types of contact offenses against children of all ages are treated with the same level of seriousness.  To be clear, the current statute criminalizes the act of traveling abroad to do terrible things to children, but it does not criminalize the people who force children to perform sexual acts on them. This bill very simply closes the loophole when it comes to sex tourism and soliciting sexual acts from a minor, to include not just what someone would do to a child, but what they would force a child to do to them.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank our strong partners in the White House and the Department of Justice for their commitment to combating exploitation and abuse here in our country and abroad.  Last week I went with the chairman and others to the White House to participate in a bipartisan listening session on human trafficking and exploitation hosted by Ivanka I appreciate Ivanka for inviting me and my fellow lawmakers to be a part of this very important exchange. I believe that her involvement and leadership on this issue can be instrumental to achieving results.  Also, it certainly wasn't lost on me that in his first official act after being sworn in, Attorney General Jeff Sessions presented the President with an executive order strengthening the enforcement of Federal law on international trafficking, including human trafficking. We have dedicated law enforcement professionals working hard every day to protect children and punish abusers, and we need to make sure that they have every tool at their disposal to do their job.  Mr.Speaker, it is our enduring responsibility to protect those among us who cannot protect themselves. We have an opportunity to do that today by passing the Global Child Protection Act and getting one step closer to closing these loopholes.  Of course, my bill is just part of a slate of Judiciary Committee bills aimed to combat child exploitation and human trafficking. I urge my colleagues to approve all of these bills and to take action toward stopping this growing problem in this country and abroad.

If there were a big fight on the floor about this and people were bickering or arguing, it would get more coverage, but the fact that we were able to come together across party lines on this issue and get it done should not be a reason not to recognize its importance. That is not why we are doing it. We are doing it to make a change.  I think it is important to preface my remarks by saying that it has been an honor and a pleasure to work with Chairman Isakson and with the ranking member, Senator Tester, and all the members of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee on what is now truly bipartisan legislation that is before the I remain grateful to the committee for their efforts to help bring needed accountability reforms to the This is an issue, as I said, that we have been working on for several years, and I am pleased that we are now on a path to enact real change.  This spring marks 3 years since light was shed on the veterans who died while they were stuck on secret waiting lists at the Department of Veterans After it was revealed that the Phoenix, AZ, VA facility had widespread mismanagement and misconduct by employees, Congress came together and acted promptly. In the wake of that deplorable situation, this Chamber responded in a bipartisan way by passing the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014.  While many of those reforms have begun to make a difference, we knew even then that it would not be enough. As reflected in the legislation that is now before us, in this law we are seeking to address those shortcomings and doing so in deference to what the courts have decided is consistent with the Constitution of the United  As virtually every Member of this Chamber--if not everyone--has done, over the years I have met with veterans throughout my home State of Florida, and I have found that many share a common frustration and disappointment and often express resignation that meaningful accountability has yet to come or occur at the It is my hope that will begin to change with this vote today. These men and women, our veterans, have sacrificed much for our country, and it is our duty to take care of them when they come home after taking care of us. Sadly, for many, this solemn obligation and promise has not been kept.  Plain and simple, ineffective governance is unfair to our veterans and to the American taxpayer. The VA must be properly managed so that it can provide timely, quality care to veterans and be held accountable to all  Let me follow up what I just said by making it abundantly clear that the overwhelming majority of the people who work at the VA are good, hard-working employees who serve our veterans well. Many of them are veterans themselves. This is not a punitive measure, nor is it meant to degrade the work they are doing under very difficult circumstances. But it has become clear that under the current law, the VA often is unwilling or unable to hold individuals appropriately accountable for their actions and/or misdeeds--usually not because they don't want to but because under the law they just can't. Even in instances in which disciplinary action against an employee was attempted, the complexity and the lengthiness of the process prevented meaningful consequences.  The unfortunate reality is that those few but significant number of negligent employees often went unpunished. To shield such employees from the consequences brings down the entire Department, demoralizes the workforce, and undermines the core mission of the That comes not from political talking points but from many of the men and women who themselves work at the  We cannot and must not allow bureaucratic redtape to get in the way. Our VA is staffed by those who belong there and are willing to perform the important tasks of serving our heroes.  It is our hope and my belief that this law will change the VA, and it will change it for the better. Simply put, the law gives the VA Secretary the authority to reprimand, to suspend, to demote, or to remove any employee if their behavior or their performance warrants such an action.  Importantly, these reforms establish a period of adequate notice, response, and final decision on a disciplinary action initiated by the Secretary and is under an enforceable and capped timeframe. So while the employee is getting due notice and the opportunity to defend themselves, it doesn't drag on forever.  It also provides a new avenue for whistleblowers so they can come forward without fear of retaliation through the establishment of an Office of Accountability and Whistleblower This is critical because, as we have seen, in order to uncover many of these abuses at the Department, we oftentimes need to rely on information directly from those who have seen it happen and are involved.  In summary, this bill will protect our veterans while also serving as a means to protect the countless well-performing, dedicated VA employees and whistleblowers in the Department who are frustrated that just a handful of bad apples are standing in the way of providing the service they signed up to provide. This bill will also ensure that VA employees' due process rights are respected and not infringed upon. This is not an anti-VA employee law; it is designed to reward those who work hard and perform and to identify and remove those who do not.  I am proud to say this bill would not have been possible without the support of our current VA We worked closely with him and his office to ensure that the provisions would provide the tools they need now and for future Secretaries so they can carry out their important mission.  In addition to the Secretary, the bill has been endorsed by the Office of Special Counsel, Project On Government Oversight, and several veteran service organizations, including the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Concerned Veterans for America, the Reserve Officers Association, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, American Veterans, and the Military Officers Association of These organizations serve our veterans admirably, have valuable knowledge of veterans' needs, and they agree that this legislation provides overdue reforms to the VA's current broken civil service system. We are all grateful for their help, for their support, and for helping and informing us in tweaking this law so that it actually solves problems.  There are two more points that I want to make.  I am proud that we were able to come together as a unified body--Republicans and Democrats--to show the Nation that the Republic can still work and that we can work together to solve problems. Hopefully, that spirit will carry over into other issues that confront our  With today's vote, I think we move one step closer to achieving the worthy goal of bringing accountability and, as a result, an improvement in the I thank my colleagues for joining this fight to better serve our Nation's veterans.[[Page S3281]]  I close by thanking the people who worked day in and day out on this, including the staffs for Chairman Isakson and Ranking Member Adam Reece and Jorge Rueda worked tirelessly on the bill. I thank Hazen Marshall and Tom Hawkins with Senator McConnell's office. I thank our cloakroom staff--Laura Dove, Chris Tuck, and Tony Hanagan--for their work in getting this bill here today.  On my own personal staff, I thank J.Sanchez, who has worked on this personally for 2\1/2\ to 3 years. I don't know what he is going to do with his time now because he has spent so much time and passion on this, and he knows many of these veterans personally.  This is a good day, and I look forward to eventually getting this bill over to the President's office so that accountability and improvement in performance can finally come to the VA and so that the men and women who have taken care of us will finally be taken care of the way they deserve.

(2) Upon presentation of the properly signed statutory      advance voucher, the Disbursing Office will make the original      advance to the chairman or his/her representative. This      advance may be in the form of a check, or in cash, receipted      for on the voucher by the person receiving the advance. Under      no circumstances are advances to be used for the payment of      salaries or obligations, other than petty cash transactions      of the committee.

Anyone with      an outstanding advance at the end of the 30 day period will      be notified by the Disbursing Office that they must repay      within 15 days, or their salary may be garnisheed in order to      satisfy their indebtedness to the Federal government.       (8) In those cases when a travel advance has been paid for      a scheduled trip which prior to commencement is canceled or      postponed indefinitely, the traveler should immediately      return the travel advance to the Senate Disbursing       (9) No more than two (2) travel advances per traveler may      be outstanding at any one time.       (10) The amount authorized for each travel advance should      not exceed the estimated total of official out-of-pocket      expenses for the trip in question. The minimum travel advance      that can be authorized for the official travel expenses of a      Committee Chairman and his/her staff is $200.

Travel may begin and/or end at the Senate traveler's      residence when such deviation from the duty station locale is      more advantageous to the government.       3. For purposes of these regulations, the ``duty station''      shall encompass the area within thirty five (35) miles from      where the Senator's home state office or designated duty      station is located.       No employee of the Senate, relative or supervisor of the      employee may directly benefit monetarily from the expenditure      of appropriated funds which reimburse expenses associated      with official Senate travel. Therefore, reimbursements are      not permitted for mortgage payments, or rental fees      associated with any type of leasehold interest.       A duty station for employees, other than Washington,      D.C., may be designated by Members, Committee Chairmen, and      Officers of the Senate upon written designation of such      station to the Senate Disbursing Such designation      shall include a statement that the Member or Officer has read      and agrees to the pertinent travel regulations on permissible      reimbursements.

Airport locations of       a) Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall      Airport       b) Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport       c) Washington Dulles International Airport       When the legislative business of the Senate requires      that a Member be present, then the round trip actual      transportation expenses incurred in traveling from the city      within the United States where the Member is located to      Washington, D.C., may be reimbursed from official Senate      funds.       Any deviation from this policy will be considered on a      case by case basis upon the written request to, and approval      from, the Committee on Rules and       Travel Expense Reimbursement Vouchers       All persons authorized to travel on official business      for the Senate should keep a memorandum of expenditures      properly chargeable to the Senate, noting each item at the      time the expense is incurred, together with the date, and the      information thus accumulated should be made available for the      proper preparation of travel vouchers which must be itemized      on an official expense summary report and stated in      accordance with these regulations. The official expense      summary report form is available at the Senate Disbursing      Office or through the Senate       Computer generated vouchers should be submitted with a      signed original. Every travel voucher must show in the space      provided for such information on the voucher form the dates      of travel, the official travel itinerary, the value of the      transportation, per diem expenses, incidental expenses, and      conference/training fees incurred.       Travel vouchers must be supported by receipts for      expenses in excess of $50. In addition, the Committee on      Rules and Administration reserves the right to request      additional clarification and/or certification upon the audit      of any expense seeking reimbursement from the contingent fund      of the Senate regardless of the expense amount.       When presented independently, credit card receipts such      as VISA, MASTER CHARGE, or DINERS CLUB, etc. are not      acceptable documentation for lodging. If a hotel bill is lost      or misplaced, then the credit card receipt accompanied by a      certifying letter from the traveler to the Financial Clerk of      the Senate will be considered necessary documentation. Such      letter must itemize the total expenses in support of the      credit card receipt.

Train Accommodations       a) Sleeping-car accommodations: The lowest first class      sleeping accommodations available shall be allowed when night      travel is involved.       When practicable, through sleeping accommodations should be      obtained in all cases where more economical to the       b) Parlor-car and coach accommodations: One seat in a      sleeping or parlor car will be allowed. Where adequate coach      accommodations are available, coach accommodations should be      used to the maximum extent possible, on the basis of      advantage to the Senate, suitability and convenience to the      traveler, and nature of the business involved.       2. Airplane Accommodations       a) First-class and air-coach accommodations: It is the      policy of the Senate that persons who use commercial air      carriers for transportation on official business shall use      less than first-class accommodations instead of those      designated first-class with due regard to efficient conduct      of Senate business and the travelers' convenience, safety,      and comfort.       b) Use of United States-flag air carriers: All official air      travel shall be performed on United States-flag air carriers      except where travel on other aircraft (1) is essential to the      official business concerned, or (2) is necessary to avoid      unreasonable delay, expense, or inconvenience.       Change in Travel Plans: When a traveler finds he/she      will not use accommodations which have been reserved for him/     her, he/she must release them within the time limits      specified by the carriers. Likewise, where transportation      service furnished is inferior to that called for by a ticket      or where a journey is terminated short of the destination      specified, the traveler must report such facts to the proper      official. Failure of travelers to take such action may      subject them to liability for any resulting losses.       1. ``No show'' charges, if incurred by Members or staff      personnel in connection with official Senate travel, shall      not be considered payable or reimbursable from the contingent      fund of the       2.

A Member shall be permitted to make more than one      reservation on scheduled flights with participating airlines      when such action assists the Member in conducting his/her      official business.       Compensation Packages: In the event that a Senate      traveler is denied passage or gives up his/her reservation      due to overbooking on transportation for which he/she held a      reservation and this results in a payment of any rebate, this      payment shall not be considered as a personal receipt by the      traveler, but rather as a payment to the Senate, the agency      for which and at whose expense the travel is being performed.       1. Such payments shall be submitted to the appropriate      individual for the proper disposition when the traveler      submits his/her expense account.       2. Through fares, special fares, commutation fares,      excursion, and reduced-rate round trip fares should be used      for official travel when it can be determined prior to the      start of a trip that any such type of service is practical      and economical to the       3. Round-trip tickets should be secured only when, on the      basis of the journey as planned, it is known or can be      reasonably anticipated that such tickets will be utilized.       Ticket Preparation Fees: Each Chairman, Senator, or      Officer of the Senate may, at his/her discretion, authorize      in extenuating circumstances the reimbursement of penalty      fees associated with the cancellation of through fares,      special fares, commutation fares, excursion, reduced-rate      round trip fares and fees for travel arrangements, provided      that reimbursement of such fees does not exceed the rates      prescribed by the Committee on Rules and       Frequent Flyer Miles: Travel promotional awards (e.g.      free travel, travel discounts, upgrade certificates, coupons,      frequent flyer miles, access to carrier club facilities, and      other similar travel promotional items) obtained by a Member,      officer or employee of the Senate while on official travel      may be utilized for personal use at the discretion of the      Member or officer pursuant to this section.       1. Travel Awards may be retained and used at the sole      discretion of the Member or officer only if the Travel Awards      are obtained under the same terms and conditions as those      offered to the general public and no favorable treatment is      extended on the basis of the Member, officer or employee's      position with the Federal       2. Members, officers and employees may only retain Travel      Awards for personal use when such Travel Awards have been      obtained at no additional cost to the Federal It      should be noted that any fees assessed in connection with the      use of Travel Awards shall be considered a personal expense      of the Member, officer or employee and under no circumstances      shall be paid for or reimbursed from official funds.       3. Although this section permits Members, officers and      employees of the Senate to use Travel Awards at the      discretion of the Member or officer, the Committee encourages      the use of such Travel Awards (whenever practicable) to      offset the cost of future official travel.       Indirect Travel: In case a person, for his/her own      convenience, travels by an indirect[[Page S3133]]     route or interrupts travel by direct route, the extra expense      will be borne by the traveler. Reimbursement for expenses      shall be allowed only on such charges as would have been      incurred by the official direct route. Personal travel should      be noted on the traveler's expense summary report when it      interrupts official travel.       Miscellaneous Transportation During Official Travel: The      cost of public transportation, taxicabs, or other mode of      transportation hired for a fee in connection with official      travel will be allowed as an official transportation expense.       Dual Purpose Travel: Dual purpose travel occurs when a      Senator, staffer, or other official traveler conducts both      Senatorial office business and Committee office business      during the same trip. The initial point at which official      business is conducted will determine the fund which will be      charged for travel expenses from and to Washington, D.     Examples include:       1. If committee business is conducted at the first stop in      the trip, travel expenses from Washington, D.C., to said      point and return will be chargeable to the committee's funds.      Additional travel expenses from said point to other points in      the United States, incurred by reason of conducting      senatorial business, will be charged to the Senators'      Official Personnel and Office Expense       2. If senatorial business is conducted at the first stop in      the trip, travel expenses from Washington, D.C., to said      point and return will be chargeable to the Senators' Official      Personnel and Office Expense Committee funds will be      charged with any additional travel expenses incurred for the      purpose of performing committee business.       Interrupted Travel: If a traveler interrupts official      travel for personal business, the traveler may be reimbursed      for transportation expenses incurred which are less than or      equal to the amount the traveler would have been reimbursed      had he/she not interrupted travel for personal business.      Likewise, if a traveler departs from or returns to a city      other than the traveler's duty station or residence for      personal business, then the traveler may be reimbursed for      transportation expenses incurred which are less than or equal      to the amount the traveler would have been reimbursed had the      witness departed from and returned to his/her duty station or      residence.       Baggage       The term ``baggage'' as used in these regulations means      Senate property and personal property of the traveler      necessary for the purposes of the official travel.       Baggage in excess of the weight or of size greater than      carried free by transportation companies will be classed as      excess baggage. Where air-coach or air-tourist accommodations      are used, transportation of baggage up to the weight carried      free on first-class service is authorized without charge to      the traveler; otherwise excess baggage charges will be an      allowable expense.       Necessary charges for the transfer of baggage will be      allowed. Charges for the storage of baggage will be allowed      when such storage was solely on account of official business.      Charges for porters and checking baggage at transportation      terminals will be allowed.       Use of Conveyances: When authorized by the employing      Senator, Chairman, or Officer of the Senate, certain      conveyances may be used when traveling on official Senate      business. Specific types of conveyances are privately owned,      special, and private airplane.       Privately Owned       1. Chairmen of committees, Senators, Officers of the      Senate, and employees, regardless of subsistence status and      hours of travel, shall, whenever such mode of transportation      is authorized or approved as more advantageous to the Senate,      be paid the appropriate mileage allowance in lieu of actual      expenses of transportation. This amount should not exceed the      maximum amount authorized by statute for use of privately      owned motorcycles, automobiles, or airplanes, when engaged in      official business within or outside their designated duty      stations. It is the responsibility of the office to fix such      rates, within the maximum, as will most nearly compensate the      traveler for necessary expenses.       2. In addition to the mileage allowance there may be      allowed reimbursement for the actual cost of automobile      parking fees (except parking fees associated with commuting);      ferry fees; bridge, road, and tunnel costs; and airplane      landing and tie-down fees.       3. When transportation is authorized or approved for      motorcycles or automobiles, mileage between points traveled      shall be certified by the traveler. Such mileage should be in      accordance with the Standard Highway Mileage Any      substantial deviations shall be explained on the      reimbursement voucher.       4. In lieu of the use of taxicab, payment on a mileage      basis at a rate not to exceed the maximum amount authorized      by statute will be allowed for the round-trip mileage of a      privately owned vehicle used in connection with an employee      going from either his/her place of abode or place of business      to a terminal or from a terminal to either his/her place of      abode or place of business: Provided, that the amount of      reimbursement for round-trip mileage shall not in either      instance exceed the taxicab fare for a one-way trip between      such applicable points, notwithstanding the obligations of      reasonable schedules.       5. Parking Fees: Parking fees for privately owned vehicles      may be incurred in the duty station when the traveler is      engaged in interdepartmental transportation or when the      traveler is leaving their duty station and entering into a      travel status. The fee for parking a vehicle at a common      carrier terminal, or other parking area, while the traveler      is away from his/her official station, will be allowed only      to the extent that the fee, plus the allowable mileage      reimbursement, to and from the terminal or other parking      area, does not exceed the estimated cost for use of a taxicab      to and from the terminal.       6. Mileage for use of privately owned airplanes shall be      certified from airway charts issued by the National Oceanic      and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, and      will be reported on the reimbursement voucher and used in      computing payment. If a detour was necessary due to adverse      weather, mechanical difficulty, or other unusual conditions,      the additional air mileage may be included in the mileage      reported on the reimbursement voucher and, if included, it      must be explained.       7. Mileage shall be payable to only one of two or more      employees traveling together on the same trip and in the same      vehicle, but no deduction shall be made from the mileage      otherwise payable to the employee entitled thereto by reason      of the fact that other passengers (whether or not Senate      employees) may travel with him/her and contribute in      defraying the operating expenses. The names of Senate Members      or employees accompanying the traveler must be stated on the      travel voucher.       8. When damages to a privately owned vehicle occur due to      the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Member,      Officer, or employee of the Senate while acting within the      scope of his/her employment, relief may be sought under the      Federal Tort Claims       Special       1. General:       a) The hire of boat, automobile, aircraft, or other      conveyance will be allowed if authorized or approved as      advantageous to the Senate whenever the Member or employee is      engaged on official business outside his/her designated duty      station.       b) Where two or more persons travel together by means of      such special conveyance, that fact, together with the names      of those accompanying him/her, must be stated by each      traveler on his/her travel voucher and the aggregate cost      reimbursable will be subject to the limitation stated above.       c) If the hire of a special conveyance includes payment by      the traveler of the incidental expenses of gasoline or oil,      rent of garage, hangar, or boathouse, subsistence of      operator, ferriage, tolls, operator waiting time, charges for      returning conveyances to the original point of hire, etc.,      the same should be first paid, if practicable, by the person      furnishing the accommodation, or his/her operator, and      itemized in the bill.       2. Rental Cars:       a) Reimbursements for rental of special conveyances will be      limited to the cost applicable to a conveyance of a size      necessary for a single traveler regardless of the number of      authorized travelers transported by said vehicle, unless the      use of a larger class vehicle on a shared cost basis is      specifically approved in advance by the Committee on Rules      and Administration, or the form `Request for a Waiver of the      Travel Regulations' is submitted with the voucher, and found      in order upon audit by the Rules       b) For administrative purposes, reimbursement may be      payable to only one of two or more Senate travelers traveling      together on the same trip and in the same vehicle.       c) Government Rate: In connection with the rental of an      automobile for the use in conducting Senate business, it      should be noted that the Defense Travel Management Office      (DTMO), a division of the Department of Defense, arranges      rental car agreements for the government.       (1) These negotiated car rental rates are for federal      employees traveling on official business and include      unlimited mileage, plus full comprehensive and collision      coverage (CDW) on rented vehicles at no cost to the traveler.       (2) For guidance on rate structure and the companies      participating in these rate agreements, call the approved      Senate vendor (currently the Combined Airline Ticket Office      (CATO)).       (3) Individuals traveling on behalf of the United States      Senate should use these companies to the maximum extent      possible since these agreements provide full coverage with no      extra fee. The Senate will not pay for separate insurance      charges; therefore, any individuals who choose to use non-     participatory car rental agencies may be personally      responsible for any damages or liability accrued while on      official Senate business.       d) Insurance: In connection with the rental of vehicles      from commercial sources, the Senate will not pay or reimburse      for the cost of the loss/damage waiver (LDW), collision      damage waiver (CDW) or collision damage insurance available      in commercial rental contracts for an extra fee.       (1) The waiver or insurance referred to is the type offered      a renter to release him/her from liability for damage to the      rented vehicle in amounts up to the amount deductible on the      insurance included as part of the rental contract without      additional charge.       (2) The cost of personal accident insurance is a personal      expense and is not reimbursable.       (3) Accidents While on Official Travel: Collision damage to      a rented vehicle, for which[[Page S3134]]     the traveler is liable while on official business, will be      considered an official travel expense of the Senate up to the      deductible amount contained in the rental contract. Such      claims shall be considered by the Sergeant at Arms of the      Senate on a case by case basis and, when authorized, settled      from the contingent fund of the Senate under the line      item--Reserve for This is consistent with      the long-standing policy of the government to self-insure      its own risks of loss or damage to government property and      the liability of government employees for actions within      the scope of their official duties.       (4) However, when damages to a rented vehicle occurs due to      the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Member,      Officer, or employee of the Senate while acting within the      scope of his/her employment, relief may be sought under the      Federal Tort Claims       3. Charter Aircraft:       a) Reimbursements for charter aircraft will be limited to      the charges for a twin-engine, six seat plane, or comparable      aircraft. Charter of aircraft may be allowed notwithstanding      the availability of commercial facilities, if such commercial      facilities are not such that reasonable schedules may be      kept. When charter aircraft if used, an explanation and      detail of the size of the aircraft, i.e., seating capacity      and number of engines, shall be provided on the face of the      voucher.       b) In the event charter facilities are not available at the      point of departure, reimbursement for charter from nearest      point of such availability to the destination and return may      be allowed.       c) When a charter aircraft larger than a twin-engine, six      seat plane is used, the form `Request for a Waiver of the      Travel Regulations' is submitted with the voucher.       Corporate/Private Aircraft: Reimbursement of official      expenses for the use of a corporate or private aircraft is      allowable from the contingent fund of the Senate provided the      traveler complies with the prohibitions, restrictions, and      authorizations specified in these regulations. Moreover,      pursuant to the Ethics Committee Interpretive Ruling 444,      excess campaign funds may be used to defray official expenses      consistent with the regulations promulgated by the Federal      Election       1. An amendment to Rule XXXV of the Standing Rules of the      Senate, paragraph 1(c)(1)(C), enacted September 14, 2007,      pursuant to P.110-81, states:       (C)(i)Fair market value for a flight on an aircraft      described in item (ii) shall be the pro rata share of the      fair market value of the normal and usual charter fare or      rental charge for a comparable plane of comparable size, as      determined by dividing such cost by the number of Members,      officers, or employees of Congress on the flight.       (ii)A flight on an aircraft described in this item is any      flight on an aircraft that is not--       (I) operated or paid for by an air carrier or commercial      operator certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration      and required to be conducted under air carrier safety rules;      or       (II) in the case of travel which is abroad, an air carrier      or commercial operator certificated by an appropriate foreign      civil aviation authority and the flight is required to be      conducted under air carrier safety rules.       (iii)This subclause shall not apply to an aircraft owned or      leased by a governmental entity or by a Member of Congress or      a Member's immediate family member (including an aircraft      owned by an entity that is not a public corporation in which      the Member or Member's immediate family member has an      ownership interest), provided that the Member does not use      the aircraft anymore than the Member's or immediate family      member's proportionate share of ownership allows.       2. Prior to the commencement of official travel on a      corporate or private aircraft, the traveler or the traveler's      designee shall contact a charter company in the departure or      destination city to request a written estimate of the cost of      a flight between the two cities on a similar aircraft of      comparable size being provided by the corporation or private      entity.       a) For example, if a Learjet 45 XR aircraft is being      provided by the corporation or private entity, the traveler      or the traveler's designee shall request a written estimate      of the cost to charter a Learjet 45 XR aircraft from the      departure city to the destination city.       b) If no charter company is located in either the departure      or destination city which rents a similar aircraft of      comparable size, a charter company nearest either the      destination or departure city which does so shall be      contacted for a written estimate.       3. Following the completion of official travel on a      corporate or private aircraft, reimbursement for related      expenses may be processed on direct pay vouchers payable to      each individual traveler, to the corporation or private      entity, or to the travel charge card vendor. The written      estimate received from the charter company shall be attached      to the voucher for processing.       Interdepartmental Transportation       The reimbursement for interdepartmental transportation      is authorized as a travel expense pursuant to 2 U.S.58(e)      but only for the incidental transportation expenses incurred      within the duty station in the course of conducting official      Senate business. Such reimbursement would include the      following expenses:       1. Mileage when using a privately owned vehicle.       2. Public transportation, parking, auto rental, taxicab, or      other mode of transportation hired for a fee.       Pursuant to 294, agreed to April 29, 1980,      section 2.(1), reimbursements and payments shall not be made      for commuting expenses, including parking fees incurred in      commuting.                          Subsistence Expenses       Per Diem Expenses       Allowance       1. Per diem expenses include all charges for meals,      lodging, personal use of room during daytime, baths, all fees      and tips to waiters, porters, baggagemen, bell boys, hotel      servants, dining room stewards and others on vessels,      laundry, cleaning and pressing of clothing, and fans in      rooms. The term ``lodging'' does not include accommodations      on airplanes or trains, and these expenses are not      subsistence expenses.       a) Laundry: Laundry expenses must be incurred during the      mid-way point of a trip. Reimbursable laundry expenses are      for the refreshing of clothing during a trip, but not the      maintenance of the clothing.       b) Meals: Reimbursable expenses incurred for meals while on      official travel include meals and tips for the traveler only      and may not include alcohol.       2. Per diem expenses will not be allowed an employee at      his/her permanent duty station and will be allowed only when      associated with round trip travel outside his/her permanent      duty station.       a) Training: Meals in the duty station are only      reimbursable when they are incurred during a training      session. If the cost of the meal is included in the training      session, then a meal certification form should be included      with the voucher. The Committee on Rules and Administration      will consider these on a case by case basis. Meal      certification forms are available at the Disbursing Office or      on the Senate intranet.       (1) Training is defined as a planned, prepared, and      coordinated program, course, curriculum, subject, system, or      routine of instruction or education, in scientific,      professional or technical fields which are or will be      directly related to the performance by the employee of      official duties for the Senate, in order to increase the      knowledge, proficiency, ability, skill and qualifications of      the employee in the performance of official duties.       (2) Meetings in the duty station where meals are served,      such as but not limited to Chamber of Commerce monthly      meetings do not constitute training. Therefore, the meals      associated with these meetings are not an authorized      reimbursable expense.       3. In any case where the employee's tour of travel requires      more than two months' stay at a temporary duty station,      consideration should be given to either a change in official      station or a reduction in the per diem allowance.       4. Where for a traveler's personal convenience/business      there is an interruption of travel or deviation from the      direct route, the per diem expenses allowed will not exceed      that which would have been incurred on uninterrupted travel      by a usually traveled route and the time of departure from      and return to official business shall be stated on the      voucher.       5. Per diem expenses will be allowed through the time the      traveler departs on personal business and will be recommenced      at the time he/she returns to official business. Such dates      and times shall be stated on the voucher.       Rates       1. The per diem allowances provided in these regulations      represent the maximum allowance, not the minimum. It is the      responsibility of each office to see that travelers are      reimbursed only such per diem expenses as are justified by      the circumstances affecting the travel. Maximum rates for      subsistence expenses are established by the General      Services Administration and are published in the FEDERAL      Maximum per diem rates for Alaska, Hawaii, the      Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and possessions of the United      States are established by the Department of Defense and      are also published in the FEDERAL In addition,      per diem rates for foreign countries are established by      the Department of State and are published in the document      titled, ``Maximum Travel Per Diem for Foreign Areas.''       a) Per diem expenses reimbursable to a Member or employee      of the Senate in connection with official travel within the      continental United States shall be made on the basis of      actual expenses incurred, but not to exceed the maximum rate      prescribed by the Committee on Rules and Administration for      each day spent in a travel status. Any portion of a day while      in a travel status shall be considered a full day for      purposes of per diem entitlement.       b) When travel begins or ends at a point in the continental      United States, the maximum per diem rate allowable for the      portion of travel between such place and the place of entry      or exit in the continental United States shall be the maximum      rate prescribed by the Committee on Rules and Administration      for travel within the continental United However, the      quarter day in which travel begins, in coming from, or ends,      in going to, a point outside the continental United States      may be paid at the rate applicable to said point, if higher.       c) In traveling between localities outside the continental      United States, the per diem rate allowed at the locality from      which travel is performed shall continue through the quarter      day in which the traveler arrives at his/her destination:      Provided, that if such rate is not commensurate with the      expenses[[Page S3135]]     incurred, the per diem rate of the destination locality may      be allowed for the quarter day of arrival.       d) Ship travel time shall be allowed at not to exceed the      maximum per diem rate prescribed by the Committee on Rules      and Administration for travel within the continental United            Computations       1. The date of departure from, and arrival at, the official      station or other point where official travel begins and ends,      must be shown on the travel voucher. Other points visited      should be shown on the voucher but date of arrival and      departure at these points need not be shown.       2. For computing per diem allowances official travel begins      at the time the traveler leaves his/her home, office, or      other point of departure and ends when the traveler returns      to his/her home, office, or other point at the conclusion of      his/her trip.       a) The maximum allowable per diem for an official trip is      computed by multiplying the number of days on official      travel, beginning with the departure date, by the maximum      daily rate as prescribed by the Committee on Rules and      If the maximum daily rate for a traveler's      destination is higher than the prescribed daily rate, then      the form ``Request for a Waiver of the Travel Regulations''      must be submitted with the voucher showing the maximum daily      rate for that location and found in order upon audit by the      Rules       b) Total per diem for an official trip includes lodging      expenses (excluding taxes), meals (including taxes and tips),      and other per diem expenses as defined by these regulations.                          Incidental Expenses       Periodicals: Periodicals purchased while in a travel      status should be limited to newspapers and news magazines      necessary to stay informed on issues directly related to      Senate business.       Traveler's Checks/Money Orders: The service fee for      preparation of traveler's checks or money orders for use      during official travel is allowable.       Communications       Communication services such as telephone, telegraph, and      faxes, may be used on official business when such expeditious      means of communications is essential. Government-owned      facilities should be used, if practical. If not available,      the cheapest practical class of commercial service should be      used.       Additionally, one personal telephone call will be      reimbursed for each day that a Senator or staff member is in      a travel status. The calls may not exceed an average of five      minutes a day, and cannot be reimbursed at a rate higher than      $5.00 without itemized documentation.       Stationery: Stationery items such as pens, paper,      batteries, etc. which are necessary to conduct official      Senate business while in a travel status are authorized.       Conference Center/Meeting Room Reservations: The fee for      the reservation of a meeting room, conference room, or      business center while on official travel is allowable.       Other: This category would be used (with full      explanation on the Expense Summary Report for Travel) to      disclose any expense which would occur incidentally while on      official travel, and for which there is no other expense      category, i.e., interpreting services, hotel taxes, baggage      cart rental, etc.                      Conference and Training Fees       Training of Senators' Office Staff: The Senators'      Official Personnel and Office Expense Account is available to      defray the fees associated with the attendance by the Senator      or the Senator's employees at conferences, seminars,      briefings, or classes which are or will be directly related      to the performance of official duties.       When such fees (actual or reduced) are less than or      equal to $500, have a time duration of not more than five (5)      days, and have been asked to be waived or reduced for      Government participation, reimbursement shall be made as an      official travel expense. However, if the fee or time duration      for meetings is in excess of the aforementioned,      reimbursement shall be made as a non-travel expense.       Reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees      associated with classes attended to earn credits towards an      advanced degree or certification.       The costs of meals that are considered an integral,      mandatory and non-separable element of the conference,      seminar, briefing, or class will be allowed as part of the      attendance fee when certified by the registrant. The meal      certification form, which must accompany the reimbursement      voucher, is available in the Disbursing Office or through the      Senate       Training of Committee Employees: Section 202(j) of the      Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 provides for the      expenditure of funds available to standing committees of the      Senate for the training of professional staff personnel under      certain conditions. It is the responsibility of each      committee to set aside funds within its annual funding      resolution to cover the expenses of such training.       Prior approval for attendance by professional staff at      seminars, briefings, conferences, etc., as well as committee      funds earmarked for training, will not be required when all      of the following conditions are met:       1. The sponsoring organization has been asked to waive or      reduce the fee for Government participation.       2. The fee involved (actual or reduced) is not in excess of      $500.       3. The duration of the meeting does not exceed five (5)      days.       When such fees are less than or equal to $500, have a      time duration of not more than five (5) days, and have been      requested to be waived or reduced for Government      participation, reimbursement shall be made as a non-training,      official travel expense. However, if the fee or time duration      for meetings is in excess of the aforementioned,      reimbursement shall be made as an official training expense.      Reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees      associated with classes attended to earn credits towards an      advanced degree or certification.       If the fee or time duration for meetings is in excess of      the aforementioned, advance approval by the Committee on      Rules and Administration must be sought. Training requests      should be received sufficiently in advance of the training to      permit appropriate consideration by the Committee on Rules      and       The costs of meals that are considered an integral,      mandatory, and non-separable element of the conference,      seminar, briefing, or class will be allowed as part of the      attendance fee when certified by the registrant. The meal      certification forms which must accompany the reimbursement      voucher are available in the Disbursing Office or through the      Senate       Training of Administrative Offices Staff: The      administrative approval of the voucher is the only approval      required by the Committee on Rules and      Training expenses of staff shall be limited to those fees      associated with the attendance by staff at conferences,      seminars, briefings, or classes which are or will be directly      related to the performance of official duties. However,      reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees      associated with classes attended to earn credits towards an      advanced degree or certification.                             Special Events       Retreats: Reimbursement of official travel expenses for      office staff retreats is allowable from the contingent fund      provided they follow the restrictions and authorizations in      these regulations. Reimbursement of expenses for meeting      rooms and equipment used during the retreat also is      allowable. The vouchers for retreat expenses should be noted      as retreat vouchers.       Discussion of Interpretative Ruling of the Select      Committee on Ethics, 444, issued February 14, 2002       An office retreat may be paid for with either or both      official funds (with Rules Committee approval) or principal      campaign committee funds. Private parties may not pay      expenses incurred in connection with an office retreat.      Campaign workers may attend, at campaign expense, office      retreats if their purpose in attending is to engage in      official activities, such as providing feedback from      constituents on legislative or representational matters.       When processing direct pay vouchers payable either to      each individual traveler or to the vendor providing the      retreat accommodations, prior approval by the Committee on      Rules and Administration is not required. Retreat expenses,      including but not limited to per diem, may be charged to the      office's official centrally billed government travel charge      card and paid on direct vouchers to the charge card vendor.      Any deviation from this policy will be considered on a case      by case basis upon the written request to, and approval from,      the Committee on Rules and       Spreadsheet of Expenses       1. The Member office, Committee, or Administrative office,      must attach to the retreat voucher(s) a spreadsheet detailing      each day of the retreat broken out by breakfast, lunch,      dinner, and lodging for each traveler attending the retreat.       2. For each traveler, the spreadsheet should list his/her      duty station, additional per diem expenses incurred outside      of the retreat, and any other retreat attendee the traveler      shared a room with during the retreat. Any non-staff members      attending the retreat also should be detailed on the      spreadsheet. The ``Waiver of the Travel Regulations'' form      does not need to be attached to retreat voucher(s) for the      sharing of rooms.       3. The per diem expenses for staff members attending a      retreat within their duty station are not reimbursable but      should be detailed on the spreadsheet. All expenses for non-     staff members attending the retreat are not reimbursable, but      their attendance at the retreat must be taken into account      when computing a per traveler cost on the spreadsheet.       4. An example of this spreadsheet can be found on the      Senate       Funerals: Members who represent the Senate at the      funeral of a Member or former member may be reimbursed for      the actual and necessary expenses of their attendance,      pursuant to 263, agreed to July 30, 1998.      Additionally, the actual and necessary expenses of a      committee appointed to represent the Senate at the funeral of      a deceased Member or former Member may be reimbursed pursuant      to 458, agreed to October 4, 1984.       Pursuant to 2 U.S.58e, which authorizes reimbursement      for travel while on official business within the United      States, members and their staff may be reimbursed for the      actual and necessary expenses of attending funerals within      their home state only.

For the purposes of these regulations, the      following definitions shall apply:       (a) Documentation means invoices, bills, statements,      receipts, or other evidence of expenses incurred, approved by      the Committee on Rules and       (b) Official expenses means ordinary and necessary business      expenses in support of the Senators' official and      representational duties.       Section 2. No reimbursement will be made from the      contingent fund of the Senate for any official expenses      incurred under a Senator's Official Personnel and Office      Expense Account, in excess of $50, unless the voucher      submitted for such expenses is accompanied by documentation,      and the voucher is certified by the properly designated staff      member and approved by the       Section 3. Official expenses of $50 or less must either be      documented or must be itemized in sufficient detail so as to      leave no doubt of the identity of, and the amount spent for,      each item. Items of a similar nature may be grouped together      in one total on a voucher, but must be itemized individually      on a supporting itemization sheet.       Section 4. Travel expenses shall be subject to the same      documentation requirements as other official expenses, with      the following exceptions:       (a) Hotel bills or other evidence of lodging costs will be      considered necessary in support of per diem.       (b) Documentation will not be required for reimbursement of      official travel in a privately owned vehicle.       Section 5.

Said hearings are of such a classified or security      nature that their transcripts can be accomplished only by      reporters having the necessary clearance from the proper      federal agencies;       2. Extreme difficulty is experienced in the procurement of      local reporters; or       3. The demands of economy make the use of Washington, D.C.,      reporters or traveling reporters in another area highly      advantageous to the Senate; and further provided, that should      such hearings exceed five days in duration, prior approval      (for the payment of reporters' travel expenses) must be      obtained from the Committee on Rules and       Witnesses Appearing Before the Senate (committees only)       The authorized transportation expenses incurred and      associated with a witness appearing before the Senate at a      designated place of examination pursuant to 259,      agreed to August 5, 1987, will be those necessary      transportation expenses incurred in traveling from the      witness' place of residence to the site of the Senate      examination and the necessary transportation expenses      incurred in returning the witness to his/her residence.       If a witness departs from a city other than the witness'      city of residence to appear before the Senate or returns to a      city other than the witness' city of residence after      appearing before the Senate, then Senate committees may      reimburse the witness for transportation expenses incurred      which are less than or equal to the amount the committee      would have reimbursed the witness had the witness departed      from and returned to his/her residence.

13416,topic-id,762,"Mr.President, every week I have been coming to the floor to recognize someone in my State who has made a difference, someone who has devoted time and energy to making my State a better place to live for others. We call these individuals our Alaskan of the  As I have said repeatedly, I believe my State is the most beautiful State in the country. We have visitors. We want to welcome more and more visitors. Come on up. I guarantee it will be the trip of a lifetime.  When you go to Alaska, one town that nobody should miss is Homer, It is surrounded by the glistening waters of Kachemak Bay, jagged mountains, glaciers, and snowcapped volcanoes. Some people call it the Halibut Fishing Capital of the Others call it the Cosmic Hamlet by the Some, like me, call it a slice of  I was there a few weeks ago holding a community meeting. I thanked them then, and I want to thank them all today for the very warm welcome I received.  I also wish to thank Homer for the very warm welcome they gave to Navy destroyer USS Hopper, which spent a few days in Homer before participating in a joint naval exercise with the Army in the Gulf of The 300-member crew of the USS Hopper was greeted by hundreds of cheering, flag-waving Homer residents. The commander of the Hopper, J.Gainey, wrote that in his 24 years of naval service, ``I have never seen as much patriotism as we enjoyed in Homer.'' Thank you, Homer, from all of us. Alaskans love  They see it for the landscape but also for the people. It is a tight-knit community. They might not always agree with one another, particularly with regard to politics, but they look out for each other. Like any community with a heart, they look out for their animals.  This week I want to recognize a special person as our Alaskan of the week, Sherry Bess, who spent nearly 30 years--three decades--taking care of Homer's animals as the manager of the Homer Animal In 1989, when Sherry began to volunteer at the pet shelter in Homer, there was one building, no phone, and only four cages to hold cats. ``It was basically a shack,'' she said. The snow would come in through the dog door. The drains in the water bowls would freeze. Sherry's hands and feet were always cold, and it was infested with mice. There was no bathroom. Oftentimes, when the shelter was too busy and when the animals needed extra care, Sherry would take them to her home, where she would care for them.  Sherry and a handful of residents cared for over 1,200 animals each year in that little shelter. Along the way, she gathered both happy stories and heartbreaking stories about the animals she found that were abused and the ones she found homes for. In fact, one of the members of my team in Alaska took a puppy that had been abandoned in a crate in the woods near Homer, took him home, fed him, and Mick Fleagle on my staff now has a dog. His dog Sookie, 8 years old, has the full reign of the house. He is loved.  Thanks to Sherry, stories like that abound throughout For 26 years, she has worked night and day, 7 days a week, for the pets in that community. She recently stepped down from that job. She is taking care of her own pets, lots of them--her family she calls them--but she will always be known to so many people in Homer for what she has done for their pets and their animals.  ``Over the years, those animals that came to me,'' she said, `` . . . unwanted and sad and depressed, and then you help them and you love them and they go to a home and they're loved. That's the most rewarding thing about what I did.''  Sherry said over the years she has noticed that the residents of Homer and throughout the country have been kinder to their pets. Part of that is the result of what Sherry and others like her across the country do to educate the public on taking care of animals through vaccinations, neutering. Some of it is more and more because people like Sherry are considering pets as their families.  So I want to thank Sherry, as our Alaskan of the Week, for all she has done and for all she has done for pets in our great Great job.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-09-pt1-PgS2848-2.txt,2290,CELEBRATING ESTES PARK'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY,2017.0,9.0,June
13543,topic-id,153,"Mr.Speaker, late last night, Senate Republicans failed in their latest attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but today is not a day for celebration. It is a day for solutions.  Over the past 7 years, the Affordable Care Act has expanded access to healthcare for millions of Americans; but the law's imperfections, combined with politically motivated opposition, have created a system that falls short of the goals we all share.  In many communities across the country, there is not enough competition in the individual marketplaces, there is not enough support for middle class families and small businesses, and there is not nearly enough being done to curb the prescription drug prices that are swallowing family budgets.  The good news is that we know how to solve these challenges.

You have a reputation of being a man of honesty, integrity, and fair dealing, and you have once again lived up to that reputation. I could not ask for a better chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee than you. I very much appreciate the work you have done on this bill.  I, too, want to thank Senators Rubio, Moran, Shaheen, Blumenthal, Angus King, Donnelly, Baldwin, and There are a number of folks on both sides of the aisle who have stepped up--some on the committee, some off the committee--who have done such a great job making sure we ended up here today.  Chairman Isakson knows this. We got a bill over from the House, we sat down together, and we negotiated. We gave and took and massaged the bill. We ended up with a bill that probably Johnny would not have written and probably I wouldn't have written, but it is a bill that is going to work, and it is going to give the VA what they need to hold people accountable.  I also echo what Johnny said. Veterans across this country are very happy with the care they get at the VA, and it is because of the great people on the ground within the VA, but every once in a while we get a bad apple, and the VA needs to be able to remove that bad apple because that bad apple reflects poorly on everybody within the So this bill is about making sure the VA has the tool it needs to hold itself accountable and hold itself accountable to the veterans.  What I hear from the folks in Montana is: How come it took so long?  We have been at this for a while, and I hope it is worth the wait. I think we have a good bill here. I think we have a bill that really holds folks accountable while protecting workers' rights moving forward.  The VA is a different kind of animal than any other agency. We owe it to the people who put it on the line for this country. When things don't go just right, we have a problem, and we have a problem that needs to be fixed and not fixed yesterday--fixed today. These folks have given their all to this country, and they have earned these healthcare benefits. We need to make sure that when they need them, they have them and there aren't any mistakes made.  What I also hear from veterans in Montana, other than it took so long, is: How can we rebuild the VA to make it all it can be? I think this bill is going to help with that, too, by making sure we have the best of the best there, by making sure we have training for our hospital administrators and being able to hire hospital administrators--that is part of this bill, too--while holding the VA accountable when folks screw up in areas of misconduct.  So there is a bunch in this bill. I think this bill will fit the needs, not only of veterans in a rural or frontier State like Montana but in more populated areas like Atlanta, I think it gives the Secretary of the VA the tools at his disposal to be able to make the VA as strong as it can possibly be.  I will say that this bill would not have happened without the good work of Johnny and his staff and my staff coming together and getting stuff done. I think this is one of the days in the Senate where we can look back and[[Page S3268]]say that folks came together as Democrats and Republicans and did the right thing for the veterans of this country.

This bill maintains bargaining rights of union workers at the One of the problems we had with the House-passed bill was it did away with the ability of members to use the bargaining process. This does not. It maintains it. It does not gut due process protections. It keeps all the existing due process protections under current law. Unlike the House bill, it doesn't shorten or eliminate the appeals process for employees who are fired. Moreover, we provide a judicial review to employees who are directed to repay a bonus and other protection. Finally, this bill does not allow VA supervisors to get away with firing anyone who just challenges them. Evidence is still required in order to take action, and that evidence must go through general counsel for review before an action is proposed.  This is all critically important, as we go forth, to give accountability and yet be able to protect the rights of the workers who are doing the job. I think we found the sweet spot there.

13611,topic-id,459,"I sure can. I talked previously about this. It has been a while. It has been 3 years. We talked about this accountability issue a lot in the Veterans' Affairs Committee and here on the floor. I think the context is important for folks who do make the claim that there is no need for this particular bill, that we are simply playing politics. That couldn't be further from the truth.  If you remember, back in August of 2014, in response to systemic failures in the Veterans Health Administration, the Senate overwhelmingly passed the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014. We were both members of the committee back then. We both helped draft that bill. It passed by a vote 91 to 3. As my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee are well aware, the bill included a provision to hold senior executives of the VA more accountable. That provision was in response to multiple reports from both the Obama administration and an independent VA inspector general documenting the need to bring greater accountability to the  While much of the attention has been focused on senior-level employees, hospital administrators, and the like, there are employees across the system who need to be effectively held accountable for misconduct and inappropriate behavior. Last Congress, the[[Page S3269]]Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee reported bipartisan legislation that would give the VA greater authority to improve accountability for all employees. Unfortunately, we never got floor time for that bill.  This Congress, the House passed a VA accountability bill that, at least in my view, needed some fixing. I appreciate that my Republican colleagues worked closely with us--with me--on these changes, and we got to this point today.  But make no mistake about it--veterans in Montana and all the major veterans service organizations support giving the VA the authority to expedite disciplining and firing bad employees. Let me say that one more time. Every major veteran service organization supports giving the VA the authority to expedite disciplining or firing bad employees. The President and the VA Secretaries--both McDonald and Shulkin--have asked for this authority. Former VA Secretary McDonald repeatedly asked Congress to give him the tools he needed to hold employees accountable. Secretary Shulkin has followed and done the same. So we have this bill up today.  I would like to end where I started, and that is by thanking Chairman Isakson for his leadership and his willingness to work together in a bipartisan way to reach a compromise and make ``collaboration'' a good word again, to get to a point where we can get a bill, as the IAVA said, that can pass and that can pass the Senate and that hopefully will pass the Senate within the next few hours.

13616,topic-id,1196,"Mr.President, everyone remembers President Obama's famous--or perhaps infamous--promise that he would sign a healthcare bill that would ``cut the cost of a typical family's premiums by up to $2,500 per year.'' Well, as everyone knows, that didn't happen. Between 2009 and 2016, the average family with employer-sponsored health insurance saw its premiums rise by $4,767. That is just the beginning.  Two weeks ago, the Department of Health and Human Services released a report comparing the average individual market insurance premium in 2013--the year when most of ObamaCare's regulations and mandates were implemented--with the average individual market exchange premium in 2017 in the 39 States that used healthcare.gov--so 2013 to 2017 individual market premiums. Here is what they found. Between 2013 and 2017, the average individual market monthly premium in the healthcare.gov States increased by 105 percent. In other words, on average, individual market premiums more than doubled in just 5 years.  In my home State of South Dakota, premiums increased by 124 percent or $3,588 over 5 years. As I said, that is according to HHS reporting on the premiums in the individual market exchanges over the course of the past 5 years. So $3,588 in South Dakota is money that South Dakota families had to take from other priorities, like saving for retirement or investing in their children's education.  Three States saw their premiums triple over those 5 years. The average monthly premium in Alaska went from $344 to $1,041. That is an increase of $697 per month or more than $8,300 a year. Think about that. Over the past 5 years, the average individual market yearly premium has increased by $4,800 in Arizona, by $3,648 in Louisiana, by $5,064 in North Carolina, by $4,488 in Tennessee, and by $5,292 in West Those kinds of premium increases are just not sustainable.  Some people, of course, received tax credits to help offset their premium payments, but many others are left to face these massive premium hikes by themselves. And most people do not have the money to easily absorb a 105-percent premium increase or more in many States, as I pointed out, over 5 years.  Of course, premium increases show no signs of slowing down. Numbers for 2018 are emerging, and they are not looking good. Insurers on the New York exchange are requesting double-digit rate hikes. A Connecticut insurer requested an average rate hike of 33.8 percent. One Virginia insurer requested an average rate increase of 38 percent. Another has requested an average 45-percent rate hike. In Oregon, the average rate hike requested is 17.2 percent. Companies offering plans on the exchange here in Washington, DC, are requesting average rate hikes ranging from 13 percent to nearly 40 percent. In Maryland, average increases range from 18 percent to almost 59 percent. One insurer in Maryland has requested a rate increase of up to 150 percent--150 percent for just one year.  As if the premium hikes aren't bad enough, many Americans don't have a cheaper option to choose. In 2017, roughly one-third of U.counties have just one choice of insurer on their ObamaCare exchange--one choice in one-third of all the counties in So you pretty much have to take whatever rate they are going to quote you when that is the only option in town. Talk about a lack of competition.  Several States, including Alabama, Oklahoma, Alaska, and Wyoming, have just one choice of insurer for the entire The entire State--in those States that I just mentioned--has one choice of insurer. Things are only getting worse.  In 2018, a number of counties may lack any ObamaCare insurer at all. On Friday, the Omaha World-Herald announced that 100,000 Nebraskans could end up with zero options for individual market coverage in 2018. Iowa is facing a similar situation. In April, Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield announced that it will withdraw from the individual market in Iowa in 2018. Days later, Aetna announced that it would pull out of the Iowa exchange. In the wake of these announcements, Medica, the last ObamaCare insurer for most of Iowa, announced that it will likely leave the State in 2018. That would leave 94 of the 99 Iowa counties with no ObamaCare insurer next year.  Republicans in the Senate are currently working on legislation to repeal and replace Why? Because, as I just pointed out, ObamaCare is broken. This law is not working. This law has never worked. It shows absolutely no sign that it is going to work in the future, particularly if those premium increases are any indication. From first to last, this law has been a disaster--high premium costs, high deductibles, customers losing health plans, customers losing doctors, fewer choices, failed co-ops, unraveling exchanges. I could go on and on because the list of the failures goes on and on.[[Page S3276]]  Given all of this, it is hard to believe the Democrats are still defending this disastrous law. I sometimes wonder just what it will take for my Democrat colleagues in the Senate to accept the staggering amount of evidence that says this law has failed. Do premiums have to triple? Do they have to quadruple? Does every American on the exchanges have to be reduced to just one choice of insurer or be without an insurer at all?  ObamaCare was going to reduce premiums. It didn't. People were going to be able to keep their healthcare plans. They regularly found out that they couldn't. Buying insurance was going to be like shopping for a TV on Amazon--well, maybe if Amazon had only one brand of television.  The responsible thing to do when a government program has turned out to be a disaster is to repeal it. That is what Republicans are working to do with We are working to repeal this law and replace it with real healthcare reform. My colleagues in the House have made a good start. We are working to build on their bill in the U.Chairmen Alexander, Enzi, and Hatch have been leading the charge on this. I am grateful to them and their staffs for all of their hard work.  Republicans are committed to restoring the millions of Americans trapped on the ObamaCare exchanges and lifting the burdens this law has foisted onto taxpayers. We are committed to addressing ObamaCare's skyrocketing premium increases. We are committed to preserving access to care for Americans with preexisting conditions. We are committed to making Medicaid more sustainable by giving States greater flexibility while insuring that those who rely on this program don't have the rug pulled out from under them. We need to make healthcare more affordable, more personal, more flexible, and less bureaucratic.  It would be wonderful if at least some Democrats would join us in this effort and stop prioritizing partisanship over the needs of the American people. Republicans know that the American people are suffering under ObamaCare, and we are committed to bringing them relief. They are ready for healthcare reform that actually works, and that is what Republicans intend to deliver.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

This bill will authorize the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, to extend the time period during which a licensee is required to commence construction of a hydroelectric project.  Back on July 9, 2013, FERC issued a license for the Public Utility District Number 1 of Okanogan County, Washington's proposed 9-megawatt Enloe hydroelectric project. This project will be located at the existing Enloe Dam on the Similkameen River near the city of Oroville,  The license requires the licensee to commence construction of the project within 2 years of the issuance date of the license, or by July 9, 2015. At the licensee's request, FERC has already granted the maximum allowable 2-year extension, thus making the construction deadline July 9, 2017.  Development of the Enloe project has experienced setbacks that have complicated the licensee's ability to meet the deadline. This bill, H.2828, would authorize FERC to reinstate the license and issue up to three consecutive 2-year extensions to commence construction.

I have forcefully rejected the President's mass deportation efforts from the beginning, and I will continue to do so.  Many of us have appropriately criticized our President for wrongfully attributing the criminal actions of a few undocumented individuals to the entire undocumented population. Equally here, it would be hypocritical to attribute the criminal actions of a few rogue agents to the hardworking men and women that protect our Nation every day and who uphold the ethical standards that we should expect.  The Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017 will assist CBP in fulfilling its mission to facilitate legitimate trade and travel at our ports of entry.  According to the Joint Economic Committee, the volume of commerce crossing our borders has more than tripled in the last 25 years. Currently, 1.1 million people and $5.9 billion in goods enter and exit the U.at 328 U.ports of entry every day.  In fiscal year 2016, CBP officers and agents seized and/or disrupted more than 3.3 million pounds of narcotics across the country, including approximately 46,000 pounds of methamphetamine, 48,000 pounds of heroin, and 440 pounds of fentanyl, keeping these harmful drugs off of our streets.  CBP has struggled with recruiting the officers and agents to fill its frontline ranks at our Nation's air, land, and seaports. Currently, there are 1,400 unfilled positions within the CBP workforce at our Nation's ports of entry. Delays and short staffing at our ports of entry costs the United States economy up to $5.8 billion each year.  Under this bill, the CBP Commissioner may, on a case-by-case basis, exempt certain veterans and State and local law enforcement officers who meet specific standards, such as holding a security clearance and previously passing a polygraph, from having to take the CBP polygraph as a part of the hiring process. All other vetting requirements in the 12-step hiring process for these applicants will still apply.  This bill simply grants CBP limited authority to waive a single step in its robust vetting process for qualifying applicants who hold security clearances or who have successfully completed polygraphs.  I would like to thank Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, and Chairwoman McSally for their work on this bill. I also thank Chairman McCaul and Chairwoman McSally by accepting changes offered by the minority to improve this bill.[[Page H4678]]  Ranking Member Thompson offered an amendment in committee to require CBP to report to Congress how many of these waivers are requested, granted, and denied; the reasons for these denials; as well as whether these applicants are ultimately hired or not.                              {time}  1515  Additionally, it requires CBP to inform Congress on the number of applicants who are granted a waiver but undergo a polygraph examination anyway based on information discovered during their background investigation.

While this bill purports to fast track the hiring of Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents in order to ensure our national security, it would actually water down hiring practices and allow potential vulnerabilities in the country's largest law enforcement agency. H.2213 would allow certain CBP applicants to bypass polygraph testing.  In 2010 Congress passed the Anti-Border Corruption Act, which mandated CBP applicants pass a polygraph test as part of their hiring process. This bill was an essential step after an influx of corruption cases were revealed within the agency--ranging from drug trafficking to accepting bribes. Decreasing hiring standards as proposed by H.2213 would do exactly what the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010 fixed.  Instead of finding common-sense ways to expedite the hiring process without compromising the integrity of the agency, H.2213 irresponsibly cuts corners in an attempt to keep President Trump's campaign promises of quickly increasing border patrol agents.

13558,topic-id,544,"Mr.President, I wish to honor a rare and wonderful individual known throughout Oregon and the Nation who passed away on April 11 at the age of 94. Chairman Sue Shaffer, of the Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua Tribe of Indians, lived a powerful life as a nonstop advocate for her family, her Tribe, and her community. As a mother, wife, daughter and friend, Sue created an atmosphere of energy, honesty, and kindness wherever she went. For Sue, no person or job was too big or too small to embrace.  Sue was a descendant of one of the seven founding families of the Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua She grew up during the Great Depression in rural Douglas County at a time when everything was scarce. Despite her family's own struggle, their door was always open to neighbors in need of food or lodging, and they were always willing to support their community members. As she liked to recall, she grew up in a household where honesty, moral integrity, education, hard work, and helping others were all high priorities. For Sue and her family, life's rewards came from working hard and reaching out to others--and that is just what she did.  Sue's mother, Nellie Crispin, kept records of the Tribe's heritage and passed down to her daughter the desire to fight for Tribal recognition. That vision and determination drove Sue to play an instrumental role in convincing Congress to formally recognize the Tribe in 1982. In 1983, Sue Shaffer became chair of the newly restored Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua Tribe, and for nearly 30 years, she worked with her Tribe and the community and expanded the Tribe's prominence by growing its economic footprint.  Sue served as delegate to the National Congress of American Indians, delegate to the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, and delegate to Indian Women's Leadership White House[[Page S3095]]Conference, but her leadership in the community was not limited to the Sue served on a myriad of boards in the community, including Umpqua Community College, becoming the first woman to chair the board. Throughout her life, Sue was also honored with many awards, including the 1999 President's Award for outstanding contribution to community in economic development by the Roseburg Chamber of Commerce, 2000 Female Citizen of the Year award for ``unselfish devotion and distinguished service'' by the Roseburg Area Chamber of Commerce, and the Eleanor Roosevelt Award in 2003. She was inducted into the Hall of Fame at Umpqua Community College in June 1999 in recognition of the 17 years she served on the UCC board of trustees.  Sue Shaffer was a dear friend, always known for being fair and never one to hesitate to ``tell it like it is.'' I will greatly miss Sue's friendship and good counsel. She was a true dynamo whose eloquent and powerful advocacy helped right the long, tragic history of wrongs inflicted on the Cow Creek and other Tribes in Sue gladly led on so many fronts to improve life for the Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua Tribe, create a better Douglas County and a better place for all of Oregon to enjoy. Her indelible legacy of achievement for our State and our Nation will live on to benefit generations to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-23-pt1-PgS3094-3.txt,1247,1215,2017.0,23.0,May
