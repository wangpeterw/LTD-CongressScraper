                       MEDIA WANTS TRUMP TO FAIL

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Pew Research Center recently 
studied how the media covered the first 60 days of each recent 
administration. Not surprisingly, 62 percent of the media coverage of 
President Trump was negative, compared to 20 percent for President 
Obama and 28 percent for Presidents Bush and Clinton.
  As Investor's Business Daily put it: ``The media from the get-go had 
decided Trump was a bad President--before any of his policies had a 
chance to take hold.''
  Now that his policies have taken hold and improved the economy, the 
media still does not want President Trump to succeed. You have seldom 
heard or read a word about our strong economic growth, the record-
breaking stock market, high consumer confidence, and the record-high 
household income.
  The liberal media seldom highlight this news because they would have 
to credit President Trump's successful policies. When the liberal media 
give the American people the facts and present the news objectively, 
they will have earned our trust. Until then, they just serve as another 
biased source of information.
