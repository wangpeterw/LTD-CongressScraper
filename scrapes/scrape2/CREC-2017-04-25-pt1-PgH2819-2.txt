                   DO EVERYTHING TO SECURE THE BORDER

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, for years, cries for help coming from 
those on the front lines of the Rio Grande have fallen on deaf ears in 
Washington.
  I have traveled to the southern border many times in Texas, New 
Mexico, Arizona, and California. Law enforcement and citizens do the 
best they can with what they have got, but they are outmanned, 
outgunned, and outfinanced by the drug cartels and other devious actors 
trying to enter the United States.
  The Federal Government has been negligent for too long, but there is 
a new sheriff in town, and President Trump has promised that help is on 
the way. He wants to build a wall.
  Mr. Speaker, I believe that effective border security requires a 
comprehensive strategy that includes not only physical barriers in 
places but also increased use of technology, more boots on the ground, 
and more boats in the Rio Grande.
  The United States has amazing capabilities like aerial drones, 
aerostats, and seismic technology to detect crossers. Let's use and do 
everything to secure the Nation.
  The Commander in Chief is right when he indicates border security is 
a matter of national security.
  And that is just the way it is.
