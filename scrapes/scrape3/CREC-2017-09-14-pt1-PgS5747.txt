 SENATE RESOLUTION 257--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 16, 2017, AS ``ISAAC M. 
                           WISE TEMPLE DAY''

  Mr. BROWN (for himself and Mr. Portman) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 257

       Whereas 2017 marks the 175th anniversary of the 
     incorporation of the congregation of the Isaac M. Wise Temple 
     in Cincinnati, Ohio;
       Whereas 2017 marks the 150th anniversary of the 
     establishment of the current site for the Isaac M. Wise 
     Temple, also known as the ``Plum Street Temple'';
       Whereas Rabbi Isaac M. Wise led that congregation for 
     nearly a half century, establishing the congregation as the 
     cradle of American Reform Judaism and helping to make 
     Cincinnati a center of Jewish life in the United States;
       Whereas Rabbi Isaac M. Wise founded the Union of American 
     Hebrew Congregations (now known as the ``Union for Reform 
     Judaism'') in 1873 and the Central Conference of Reform 
     Rabbis in 1889 to help lead the United States Jewish Reform 
     movement;
       Whereas Rabbi Isaac M. Wise founded the Hebrew Union 
     College in Cincinnati in 1875, now the oldest rabbinical 
     school in continuous existence in the United States; and
       Whereas the Isaac M. Wise Plum Street Temple is listed on 
     the National Register of Historic Places for the significant 
     role that the Temple played in the history of Reform Judaism 
     and for the unique Moorish architectural style of the Temple: 
     Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates September 16, 2017, as ``Isaac M. Wise 
     Temple Day''; and
       (2) recognizes the importance of the Isaac M. Wise Temple 
     in--
       (A) United States Jewish history;
       (B) establishing Cincinnati, Ohio, as a great center of 
     Jewish life; and
       (C) contributing to religious life in the United States.
