        RECOGNIZING F.X. MATT BREWING COMPANY OF UTICA, NEW YORK

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize F.X. Matt Brewing 
Company, located in Utica, New York. Founded in 1888, Matt's Brewery is 
the fourth oldest family-owned brewery in the United States.
  An award-winning brewery, F.X. Matt Brewing Company is famous for 
their pale ale lager, Utica Club, the first beer licensed for sale 
after Prohibition, in addition to international taste test winner 
Saranac beer and soda lines.
  F.X. Matt Brewing Company is currently among the 15 largest beer 
producers in the Nation, and the Matt family continues to develop new 
recipes each year.
  Matt's Brewery has played an important role in our local community by 
hosting Saranac Thursdays, a weekly summer concert series, where a 
portion of the proceeds are donated to the United Way of Utica. Matt's 
Brewery also hosts the post-race celebration for the world famous Utica 
Boilermaker 15K road race.
  I am grateful to Fred Matt, Nick Matt, and everyone at the brewery 
for their hard work, ingenuity, and dedication to our community as they 
continue this historic family business. I encourage my colleagues to 
stop by my office to try some of their great products.
  On a personal note, as a lifelong friend of the Matt family, I will 
always be grateful to Lillian ``Duffy'' Matt, affectionately known as 
Duff, who taught me how to ride a bicycle.
