                           JCPOA NEGOTIATIONS

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, ``irresponsible, reckless, duplicitous,'' 
all words used to describe Iran during the JCPOA negotiations.
  Soon, if this administration abrogates the JCPOA, those words would 
apply to us: ``irresponsible'' for shredding an agreement that makes 
the world a safer place, ``reckless'' in giving Iran an excuse to 
immediately restart the nuclear program, and ``duplicitous'' in 
breaking an international agreement for no legitimate reason but to 
fulfill a campaign promise.
  Make no mistake, Iran is still a bad actor. It destabilizes the 
region. It funds terrorist activities. That is why we voted to increase 
nonnuclear sanctions on Iran yesterday. But the Iran nuclear agreement 
is being adhered to, and it is working.
  Under this administration, are we, as a nation, no longer as good as 
our word?
