                  HONORING THE SERVICE OF LEWIS VILLA

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, this coming Saturday marks Veterans Day, a 
day on which we honor and cherish heroes like Lewis Villa from Hopewell 
Township, Pennsylvania.
  Nearly seven decades ago, Mr. Villa, a graduate of Aliquippa High 
School, followed in the footsteps of his two older brothers by 
enlisting in the Army. He joined the 456th Airborne Field Artillery 
Battalion of the 82nd Airborne and eventually became an Army Ranger 
assigned to 1st Company, 1st Platoon, 1st Squad of the Airborne 
Rangers.
  He deployed in 1950 to Japan, and then Korea, where he was captured 
by communist Chinese forces and spent 28 months in a prisoner of war 
camp.
  After returning home, Villa became a mailman, where he met his 
beloved late wife, Helana, and had two children.
  Lewis Villa is a treasure of the Aliquippa community, and he rarely 
fails to land a joke, and always lights up a room with laughter. I 
would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to him as well as to all 
our veterans.
  Happy Veterans Day, and may God bless them and their families.
