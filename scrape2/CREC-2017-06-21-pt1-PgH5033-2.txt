           CELEBRATING THE REMARKABLE CAREER OF TINA HERRING

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
remarkable career of Ms. Tina Herring, who retired as branch manager 
with the Georgia Department of Veterans Services on Thursday, June 1, 
2017.
  During her childhood, Ms. Herring often moved with her father, a 
Pearl Harbor survivor who frequently traveled on Air Force assignments. 
This instilled an appreciation for our Nation's Armed Forces.
  She began her career with the Department of Veterans Services in 1985 
as a benefits caseworker. In this position, she worked to ensure that 
Georgia's servicemen and -women received the crucial resources and 
benefits which they and their families deserve.
  Ms. Herring was promoted to oversee multiple southeast branches of 
the Georgia Veterans Services Department in 2009 because of her 
exceptional dedication to Georgia's veterans and her 25 years of hard 
work.
  Ms. Herring, thank you for your extraordinary effort in honoring our 
servicemen and -women. You have managed southeast Georgia's Veterans 
Department with exceptional precision. I wish you the best of luck in 
all your future endeavors.
