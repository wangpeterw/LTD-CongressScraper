   THE CITIZENS OF PUERTO RICO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR WILL TO JOIN OUR 
                                 NATION

  (Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, the American 
citizens of Puerto Rico overwhelmingly voted in favor of becoming the 
51st State of our great Nation. This is the second time in the past 5 
years where my constituents have expressed their will to join our 
Nation.
  Soon I will introduce legislation to set forth the terms of admission 
for the new State of Puerto Rico.
  Our people have, in war and peace, made countless contributions to 
our Nation. They have fought in every conflict since the Great War. 
Many have made the ultimate sacrifice, and when they do, their casket 
is flown back to this country draped in an American flag bearing the 50 
stars, but no star that represents them.
  It takes a special kind of patriotism to fight for a nation that does 
not treat you equally, a nation that is a champion of democracy and 
self-determination, yet denies those same principles to 3.4 million of 
its own citizens in Puerto Rico.
  Mr. Speaker, my constituents have spoken, and they deserve Congress' 
response.
