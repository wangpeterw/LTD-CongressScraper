            RECOGNIZING 77TH ANNUAL PIKES PEAK OR BUST RODEO

 Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 
annual Pikes Peak or Bust Rodeo, an important part of the Western 
culture and history of the Pikes Peak Region. This year marks the 77th 
rodeo, making it one of the oldest and most prestigious in the county.
  The Pikes Peak Region plays a significant role in our American 
history. For centuries, this area was home to Native Americans, 
pioneers, miners, farmers and ranchers, and other explorers. The Pikes 
Peak region became a prime location for trade and, eventually, the home 
of the ``Pikes Peak or Bust'' gold rush in 1857. Thousands of 
prospectors scrambled to the area for their piece of the gold fortune. 
This area became the pinnacle of the American frontier, which spurred 
development and innovation.
  Today community-wide events, including the Pikes Peak or Bust rodeo, 
celebrate the adventurous spirit of the Pikes Peak region and its 
Western heritage. In addition, the rodeo donates all proceeds to 
charities that support military members and their families, such as the 
Fort Carson Outreach Program and the U.S. Air Force Academy's Operation 
Warm Heart. Thank you to the Pikes Peak or Bust Rodeo leadership and 
entire El Paso County community for keeping these longstanding 
traditions alive.
