                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O Eternal God, who rules the raging of the sea, You are our guardian 
and friend. Place Your arms of protection and wisdom around our 
lawmakers, shielding them from life's pitfalls and using them for Your 
glory. Lord, be their refuge and strength, a very present help in 
trouble. May they rejoice because of Your mercies, serving You with 
grateful hearts. Turn the night of their distress into the morning of 
Your hope, causing them to wait patiently for the unfolding of Your 
loving providence. May they feel Your everlasting arms beneath them and 
find peace in Your presence.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
