 A FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE A SAFE HAVEN FOR COMPANION ANIMALS

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as we continue to shed light on 
domestic violence during this month of October, I would like to 
highlight a bill, H.R. 909, the Pet and Women Safety Act.
  This necessary bipartisan legislation introduced by my friend 
Representative Katherine Clark and I will establish a Federal grant 
program to provide a safe haven for the companion animals of domestic 
violence victims.
  Studies show that almost half of domestic violence survivors do not 
leave their abusive relationships out of fear of what would happen to 
their beloved pets. When less than 5 percent of domestic violence 
shelters are able to house pets, it is no wonder why so many victims 
choose to stay in these relationships for as long as they do.
  Our bill empowers these victims and gives them the necessary 
resources to help them step out of the shadow of fear and uncertainty.

  Mr. Speaker, the Pet and Women Safety Act now enjoys the bipartisan 
support of 237 of our colleagues. I encourage every Member of Congress 
to add their name to this legislation, and I ask our leadership to 
bring H.R. 909 for a vote.
