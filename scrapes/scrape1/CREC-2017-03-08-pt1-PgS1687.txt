                          KINGSPORT CENTENNIAL

  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the Record a copy of the Tennessee General Assembly's proclamation 
recognizing the city of Kingsport, TN, centennial celebration.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                          Kingsport Centennial

       Whereas, it is fitting that the members of this legislative 
     body should pause in their deliberations to recognize and 
     honor those venerable communities of this State that are 
     marking special occasions in their histories; and
       Whereas, the new city of Kingsport was incorporated in 
     1917, using the historical name of a nearby town that was 
     previously incorporated in 1822 but lost its charter after 
     the Civil War; and
       Whereas, Kingsport is the first thoroughly diversified, 
     professionally planned, and privately financed city in 
     twentieth-century America; and
       Whereas, Kingsport was the first city in Tennessee, and one 
     of the first in the nation, to adopt the ``model city 
     charter'' establishing a city manager form of government; and
       Whereas, Kingsport was produced by the marriage of New 
     South philosophy and Progressivism, born at a time when 
     capitalists turned their attention to Southern Appalachia; 
     and
       Whereas, the seeds planted in 1917 grew to become the 
     corporate headquarters of Eastman, a Fortune 300 company with 
     a significant global presence that has provided economic 
     opportunity for generations of Tennesseans; and
       Whereas, early founders coined the term ``Kingsport 
     Spirit'' to describe the work ethic, can-do attitude, and 
     caring culture that are still widely prevalent today; and
       Whereas, Kingsport continues to be a leader in innovation 
     and collaboration to redefine the economic future of 
     Tennessee and Tennesseans; and
       Whereas, on this milestone occasion, it is fitting that we 
     recognize and honor the city of Kingsport and its residents: 
     Now, therefore,
       I, Randy McNally, Speaker of the Senate of the One Hundred 
     Tenth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, at the 
     request of and in conjunction with Senator Jon Lundberg, do 
     hereby proclaim that we honor and commend the fine citizens 
     of Kingsport as they celebrate their city's centennial and 
     extend to them our best wishes for continued success and 
     prosperity in the future. Proclaimed in Nashville, Tennessee, 
     on this the 13th day of February 2017.
