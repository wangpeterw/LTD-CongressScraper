[[Page H8047]]

  Almighty God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  As the Members return, we ask Your blessing on all those who are 
discerning significant options about remaining in the people's House or 
choosing to run for this office. May a spirit of freedom and public 
responsibility prevail among all the voices competing for ascendancy in 
the conversations and debates that ensue.
  Bless all Members with wisdom in good measure, pressed down, shaken 
together, and running over, that the legacy of great legislators of our 
history might be carried on with integrity for the benefit of all.
  May all that is done in the people's House be for Your greater honor 
and glory.
  Amen.

                          ____________________
