                         REPUBLICAN HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, the new Republican healthcare 
scam, again, slams good hardworking Americans with higher costs and 
less healthcare coverage. Fewer people will have healthcare coverage, 
and insurance companies will increase their already record profits.
  And what would a Republican healthcare bill plan be without a massive 
tax cut for high-paid insurance executives?
  UnitedHealthcare is one of America's largest insurers and is under 
investigation by the Department of Justice for defrauding Medicare and 
the American people out of billions of dollars over the past decade.
  On page 67, in seven words, this Republican bill gives their chief 
executive officer, who made $66 million in 2014, a massive tax cut.
  Mr. Speaker, this is disgusting and morally reprehensible.
