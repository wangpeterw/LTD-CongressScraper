                 RECOGNIZING CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
acknowledge the outstanding performance of Pennsylvania's critical 
access hospitals.
  Before I was elected to serve in the House of Representatives, I 
spent nearly 30 years in the healthcare field. I am most proud to see 
Pennsylvania recognized in the top 10 States by the Health Resources 
and Services Administration for quality performance.
  With the help of funding from the Federal Office of Rural Health 
Policy, Pennsylvania's critical access hospitals are able to invest in 
quality improvement projects and new technical assistance resources to 
better care for their patients.
  Pennsylvania is home to 15 critical access hospitals that provide 
service to the most rural areas in our State. Since 1991, the 
Pennsylvania Office of Rural Health has dedicated its efforts to ensure 
that these hospitals constantly improve the quality of care they 
provide to their patients.
  Rural hospitals are critically important to our communities. They may 
be limited in resources, but they are committed to providing the best 
care possible to patients.
  I am proud of our Pennsylvania critical access hospitals, and I 
congratulate them on this national recognition.
