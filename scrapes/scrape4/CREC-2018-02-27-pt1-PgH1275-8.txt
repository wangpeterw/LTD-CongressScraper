                   INTRODUCING THE GATEWAY AT BUFFALO

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, yesterday we unveiled plans for 
a new, state-of-the-art land port of entry at the Peace Bridge in 
Buffalo, New York.
  Deploying the most advanced detection technology, the Gateway at 
Buffalo will improve national security and

public safety. It will cut wait times for both passenger and commercial 
vehicles in half. It will greatly improve air quality in the 
neighboring community. It will improve aesthetics with new L.E.D. 
lighting, landscaping, and public art.
  This plan will improve our region's growing economic relationship 
with Canada, leveraging $30 billion in commerce and over $200 billion 
in economic activity, supporting over 1 million jobs. This plan is long 
overdue. It is a plan that our community deserves and a gateway that is 
worthy of the promise and potential of our future in Buffalo and 
western New York and our relationship economically and otherwise with 
the great country of Canada.
