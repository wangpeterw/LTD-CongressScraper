                        PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BUDGET

  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, the Trump budget is a disaster for the 
very people who the President claims he wants to assist. It is 
reckless, reprehensible, and regressive.
  The Trump budget balances itself on the backs of working families, 
middle class folks, senior citizens, the poor, the sick, the afflicted, 
and rural America. The Trump budget fails to invest in education and 
job training, it fails to invest in transportation and infrastructure, 
and it fails to invest in research and development. Instead, the Trump 
budget would cut Head Start, cut Medicaid, cut assistance to nursing 
homes, and it even cuts Meals on Wheels.
  This is all being done simply to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy and 
the well-off--lifestyles of the rich and shameless. The Trump budget is 
a disaster, and we are going to do everything possible to vote it down.
