                              SABOTAGE X 2

  (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, sabotage.
  A plot is afoot in Washington. It is time to sound the alarms. It is 
time to let the people know. It is time to ride like Paul Revere across 
our Nation and awaken Americans to this sinister scheme.
  President Trump is sabotaging the Affordable Care Act. Trump has 
threatened to cut subsidies to millions of Americans, creating more 
uncertainty today by stalling in court. He has refused to fund the 
high-risk corridors, causing insurance companies to flee States like 
Iowa and Kentucky. He has cut the public notices to keep those in need 
of healthcare in the dark. He has cut the signup period in half to 
prevent more Americans from signing up.
  Is sabotage destroying the healthcare market worth it? Is robbing 
millions of Americans of healthcare coverage worth it? Is that the 
price Trump is willing to pay for repeal? To give tax cuts to 
billionaires?
  Mr. Trump, ObamaCare works. If you break it, you own it. When you 
sabotage healthcare for millions of Americans, you are responsible. And 
the people ought to know.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.
