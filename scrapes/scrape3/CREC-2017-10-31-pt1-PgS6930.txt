   BLACK LEGISLATIVE STAFF CAUCUS AND ITS ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE SENATE

  Ms. HARRIS (for herself, Mr. Booker, and Mr. Scott) submitted the 
following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 317

       Whereas, in 1977, Jackie Parker and Ralph Everett had the 
     vision and courage to improve the working conditions of Black 
     Senate staffers;
       Whereas the Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus continues 
     to promote diversity and inclusion within the Senate;
       Whereas, for the first time in its 40-year history, the 
     Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus celebrates 3 African-
     Americans serving simultaneously in the Senate;
       Whereas the Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus 
     recognizes each of the 10 current or former Senators of 
     African-American descent; and
       Whereas, the Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus 
     continues to fight for the justice and equality that started 
     during the civil rights movement of the 1960s: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate honors the Senate Black 
     Legislative Staff Caucus for its many contributions and 
     commitment to enrich the Senate community.
