                               TAX REFORM

  (Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, it has only been a few weeks 
since Congress passed the historic tax reform bill, but I am afraid it 
has got to be very tough for the opponents and our friends across the 
aisle because, well, you have to wonder: At some point, don't they tire 
of being wrong so often?
  You might recall some claim before we passed the bill that it would 
raise taxes on the middle class, yet a majority of Americans will now 
see a tax decrease. In fact, the average family of four in Minnesota's 
Second District, which I am proud to represent, will see a tax cut of 
$3,154.
  Then they claim that reducing taxes on businesses would never benefit 
Americans, but employers have already responded by giving a combined 
total of $1 billion in bonuses and wage increases to their employees. 
That equates to over 1 million Americans and counting getting a bonus.
  Finally, they said the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would never jump-start 
economic growth. Well, now, after two quarters of well over 3 percent 
growth, approaching 4 percent, it is as if the opponents of the tax 
reform bill are left telling the American people: Are you going to 
believe me or your own eyes?
  The fact of the matter is our opponents rely on hyperbole, but the 
facts speak for themselves.
