         DO NOT REPLACE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WITH TRUMPCARE

  (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about the 
Republican's sick plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it 
with TrumpCare, where the wealthy will get huge tax cuts and the rest 
of America will pay more for less. Twenty-four million will be losing 
their doctors, their nurses, and their medicine, and my constituents 
are frightened.
  Just ask Amy Bernard, whose mom, Francine, like 70 percent of 
Americans living in nursing homes, pays for it with Medicaid. Francine 
was a teacher. She planned for her retirement. She had savings, Social 
Security, and a pension. Then she was diagnosed with Parkinson's 
disease, and she spent all her savings on in-home care. And then one 
day after a near-fatal fall, her family realized she needed around-the-
clock care.
  TrumpCare means tax cuts for the very rich, less for the rest of 
Americans, gutting Medicaid, and sending folks like Francine to the 
curb.
