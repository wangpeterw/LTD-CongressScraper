              WELCOME HOME, ROPER'S COUNTRY STORE AND CAFE

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to work for the Texans in a 
small town on the Brazos River, in Simonton, Texas.
  There is an icon in Simonton that is loved by all in Fort Bend 
County. It is called Roper's Country Store and Cafe.
  Roper's fought Mother Nature twice: the Brazos River dropped by 
uninvited in 2016, and again with Hurricane Harvey in August of last 
year.
  At 6 a.m., exactly 1 week ago, Roper's beat Mother Nature. As you can 
see in this photograph, the owner, Lauren Gillespie, is watching Maria 
Silva welcome Anne, Ramona, and Laura home to Roper's.
  I dropped by last Saturday and had a homemade breakfast with Simonton 
Mayor Louis Boudreaux. Maria was still smiling when I went there 
Saturday, as I filled up. Her shirt says: Texas Strong.
  What that really says is: Simonton Strong, Roper's Strong.
  Welcome home, Roper's.
