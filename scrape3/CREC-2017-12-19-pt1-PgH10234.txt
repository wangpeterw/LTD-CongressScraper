                     RUSSIA AND THE ADMINISTRATION

  (Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, recently there has been a real flurry by 
the Republicans here in Congress to disparage and call names to the FBI 
and to the Justice Department, but it is right after Michael Flynn pled 
guilty, right after George Papadopoulos pled guilty in the 
investigation into Russia and potential collusion with the 
administration.
  Now my question is: What are you afraid of? Why are you getting in 
such a big rush to complain about these folks now? What are you hiding? 
What is it that is bothering you? Let the detectives do their work to 
figure out what happened between Russia and this administration.
  I mean, it is like we have been asking for the President's tax 
returns for ages. What is he hiding? We won't even know how much money 
he gets to save under this terrible tax bill that was passed today by 
the Republican Congress.
  So I just want to know: Why are you so worried? What are you afraid 
of? What are you hiding?
