   A CALL FOR HEARINGS TO DETERMINE ROOT CAUSE OF WAVE OF HATE CRIMES

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)

[[Page H2092]]

  

  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, over the last few months, we have 
seen a surge of hate-driven violence, vandalism, and threats against 
numerous communities. As a member of the Oversight Committee, I am 
calling for hearings to determine the root cause of this wave of hate 
crimes and how we can combat it.
  While our government must show its commitment to answering these 
attacks, the American people already have. Desecrations of Jewish 
cemeteries were met with waves of volunteers assisting in their 
restoration. Mosque burnings were met with contributions from Americans 
of all faiths to help the rebuilding. And when two Indian men in Kansas 
were shot and one murdered, a Caucasian third man was wounded when he 
heroically sought to intervene.
  These actions speak to the resilience of our people, the highest 
principles of our Nation, and why we are proud to be Americans. America 
is, indeed, an exceptional nation.
  I hope Chairman Chaffetz will heed my call and hold hearings on this 
wave of hate-inspired attacks to help America remain exceptional.
