  SENATE RESOLUTION 246--DESIGNATING THE FIRST WEEK IN AUGUST 2017 AS 
 ``WORLD BREASTFEEDING WEEK'', AND DESIGNATING AUGUST 2017 AS 
                    ``NATIONAL BREASTFEEDING MONTH''

  Mr. MERKLEY (for himself and Mr. Markey) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 246

       Whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that 
     breastfeeding continue for at least 12 months after the birth 
     of a baby and for as long as the mother and baby desire;
       Whereas the World Health Organization recommends continued 
     breastfeeding for 2 years or longer after the birth of a 
     baby;
       Whereas the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action has 
     designated the first week of August as ``World Breastfeeding 
     Week'', and the United States Breastfeeding Committee has 
     designated August as ``National Breastfeeding Month'';
       Whereas National Breastfeeding Month focuses on how data 
     and measurement can be used to build and reinforce the 
     connections between breastfeeding and a broad spectrum of 
     other health topics and initiatives;
       Whereas World Breastfeeding Week and National Breastfeeding 
     Month provide important opportunities to address barriers to 
     breastfeeding faced by families across the United States;
       Whereas, according to the [2016] Breastfeeding Report Card 
     of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4 of every 
     5 mothers, or 81.1 percent of mothers, in the United States 
     start breastfeeding their babies;
       Whereas by the end of 6 months after the birth of a baby, 
     breastfeeding rates fall to 51.8 percent, and only 22.3 
     percent of babies are exclusively breastfed at 6 months of 
     age;
       Whereas 2 of every 3 mothers report that they are unable to 
     reach their personal breastfeeding goals;
       Whereas there are substantial racial and ethnic disparities 
     in breastfeeding initiation and duration;
       Whereas, in 2013, 84.3 percent of non-Hispanic White 
     infants initiated breastfeeding, as compared to--
       (1) 66.3 percent of non-Hispanic Black infants; and
       (2) 68.3 percent of non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska 
     Native infants;
       Whereas the Healthy People 2020 objectives for 
     breastfeeding are that--
       (1) 82 percent of babies are breastfed at some time;
       (2) 61 percent of babies continue to be breastfed at 6 
     months; and
       (3) 34 percent of babies continue to be breastfed at 1 
     year;
       Whereas breastfeeding is a proven primary prevention 
     strategy that builds a foundation for life-long health and 
     wellness;
       Whereas the evidence of the value of breastfeeding to the 
     health of women and children is scientific, solid, and 
     continually reaffirmed by new research;
       Whereas, during the first year of the life of a baby, a 
     family that follows optimal breastfeeding practices can save 
     between $1,200 and $1,500 in expenses on infant formula;
       Whereas a 2016 study of maternal and pediatric health 
     outcomes and associated costs based on 2012 breastfeeding 
     rates indicates that if 90 percent of infants were breastfed 
     according to medical recommendations, 3,340 deaths, 
     $3,000,000,000 in medical costs, and $14,200,000,000 in costs 
     relating to premature death would be prevented annually; and
       Whereas the great majority of pregnant women and new 
     mothers want to breastfeed but face significant barriers in 
     community, health care, and employment settings: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates the first week of August 2017 as ``World 
     Breastfeeding Week'';
       (2) designates August 2017 as ``National Breastfeeding 
     Month'';
       (3) supports the goals of National Breastfeeding Month; and
       (4) supports policies and funding to ensure that all 
     mothers who choose to breastfeed can access a full range of 
     appropriate support from health care institutions, health 
     care insurers, employers, and government entities.
