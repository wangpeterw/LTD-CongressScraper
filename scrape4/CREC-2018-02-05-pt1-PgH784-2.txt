        H.R. 4924.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
        Article 1, Section 5 of the United States Constitution
       ``Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns 
     and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each 
     shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller 
     Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to 
     compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and 
     under such Penalties as each House may provide.
       Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, 
     punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the 
     Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.
       Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and 
     from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as 
     may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays 
     of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the 
     Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the 
     Journal.''
