                              TAX PROPOSAL

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, this week the Republican leadership 
will reconcile the House and Senate tax proposals. In doing so, I 
strongly urge my colleagues to put politics aside and put working 
families first.
  To do this, we need to enable employers and workers to invest in new 
skills for emerging jobs in our evolving economy. We need to spur 
infrastructure investment. We need to promote innovation, 
entrepreneurship, and new business formation. We need to ensure that 
every American has access to a quality education that prepares them for 
a successful career.
  We need to do all of this without exploding the national debt. The 
plans before the committee do not pay for themselves. Unfortunately, 
they do not guarantee against cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social 
Security either, and they do not put working families first.
  For the sake of our economy and for the sake of our seniors, 
students, and working families, I strongly urge the conferees to 
produce a bill that focuses on their needs.
