                        TRIBUTE TO DEVIN MARTIN

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Devin Martin, one 
of my Washington, DC, interns, for all of the hard work he has done for 
me and my staff at the Senate Republican Conference.
  Devin is a graduate of Huntley High School in Huntley, IL. Currently, 
he is attending the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, SD, where 
he is majoring in journalism and political science. Devin is a 
dedicated worker who has been committed to getting the most out of his 
experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Devin Martin for all 
of the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the 
years to come.
