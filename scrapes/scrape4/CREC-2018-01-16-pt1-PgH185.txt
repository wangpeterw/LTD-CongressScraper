                             General Leave

  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 4318, 
currently under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Michigan?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here today to speak in support of H.R. 
4318, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018.
  This bipartisan bill will provide long-awaited tariff relief to our 
American manufacturers, who require certain inputs that are simply not 
made in the United States. Forcing them to pay tariffs for these inputs 
runs up their manufacturing costs and makes them uncompetitive compared 
to manufacturers in other countries. It also limits their ability to 
create more good-paying jobs here at home.
  For companies in my home State of Michigan, the Miscellaneous Tariff 
Bill Act will provide nearly $27 million in cost savings, which can, 
instead, be used to employ more Americans, create new products, and 
boost the United States economy.
  For years, American manufacturers have been asking Congress for 
tariff relief to help them reduce costs, create jobs, and compete 
globally. Today, we can take critical steps in delivering that relief.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act has historically had 
broad bipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress as a means to 
bolster U.S. manufacturing and competitiveness.
  Right now, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act has been expired for 
more than 5 years. I am pleased that today we are finally able to 
consider updating this bill.
  The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act is designed to provide relief to 
domestic firms by reducing or lifting tariffs on imported goods, as 
long as those goods are not produced here in the United States of 
America.
  It is estimated that this legislation will provide more than $1 
billion in tariff relief to U.S. businesses. Many of these businesses 
are needlessly paying more to acquire inputs to manufactured products 
here in the United States.
  My home State of New Jersey will benefit greatly from this program, 
with firms projected to save more than $100 million over the course of 
a 3-year program. As a result, these New Jersey companies will receive 
a competitive boost and will be able to use their resources more 
productively, whether by raising wages or investing in research and 
development.
  Consider ICF Mercantile, located in Fort Lee, New Jersey, which will 
obtain duty relief on high-tenacity rayon yarn, an input for material 
used for naval defense systems. Unfortunately, this specialty yarn has 
not been produced domestically in 20 years. That means that removing 
the tariff here would help, not hurt, U.S. industry.
  New Jersey has a robust presence of chemical companies--it is our 
largest industry--employing directly or indirectly over 100,000 jobs. 
Several of those firms will receive tariff relief from numerous 
imported chemicals that I dare not try to pronounce.
  All of these folks who like their antipasti, their Italian subs, 
salad, or pizza with some extra heat will be pleased to enjoy tariff 
relief on little green pepperoncini, either packed in oil or not.
  The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act is also intended to carefully 
prevent domestic companies from being harmed. Under the current 
process, the International Trade Commission and the Department of 
Commerce analyzed whether products are currently or could be eminently 
produced in the United States. If such production or potential for 
production was found, the ITC recommends excluding that product.
  The American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act, which passed in 2016 
with only two votes against it in the House, established the current 
process that invites U.S. firms to submit petitions that the ITC, the 
Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
analyze, vet, and recommend to Congress for inclusion or exclusion.
  I would like to thank each agency for its hard work in coordination 
with Congress throughout the process. Boosting the competitiveness of 
American manufacturers and manufacturing workers should be one of our 
highest priorities in Congress. The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act is a 
program that helps do that, and I want to make sure its impact is 
maximized.
  This bill covers more than 1,600 products compared to the previous 
MTB, which covered only half as many products. Because this is the 
first time that this new process has been used, I am interested in 
reviewing both the process and, more importantly, the results, and 
working together with those who have constructive suggestions for any 
improvements that can be made.
  But I also want to note that this program is not enough. We, as a 
Congress and as a nation, need to be doing more in looking for 
opportunities to enhance American competitiveness meaningfully. The 
global economic environment is not just tough, but it is becoming more 
and more challenging and hostile to our companies and our workers.

                              {time}  1700

  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a bill that will 
provide some important relief to U.S. firms across the country.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the folks on the other side. We have 
worked very closely on this legislation over a number of years, and it 
is finally coming to fruition.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).
  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, first of all, we need to ask ourselves, what does H.R. 
4318 do,

[[Page H386]]

the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act? It is going to make it easier for 
American manufacturers to compete globally.
  As my friend, Mr. Pascrell, has just said to you, for so many years, 
we have put ourselves at the wrong end of the way things should work. 
We add tariffs, we add taxes on the people who manufacture.
  This is a commonsense bill. In every measurable way, our country and 
our people are the beneficiaries of this bill.
  Now, through this legislation, Congress will be able to reduce or 
totally suspend the tariffs, which are essentially a tax. At the end of 
the day, by giving tariff relief to U.S. businesses, this will reduce 
manufacturing costs, therefore, making products more competitive for 
U.S. consumers. It is a win-win for America's consumers and for 
American workers.
  For decades, Congress has passed this type of legislation to boost 
the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing by lowering the cost of 
imported goods without unnecessarily harming U.S.-based companies that 
produce competing products.
  Now, let me just take, for example, a company back in Pennsylvania, 
Lasko Products. Mr. Pascrell and I sat in a hearing and we listened to 
these folks as they talked about what makes them competitive, what 
takes them off the shelf where they can't compete, and too often it was 
their own country that was making it difficult. Lasko is an 11-year-old 
company. They employ 1,000 people.
  Now, Mr. McCasey, who is the chief operating officer, came and talked 
to us. When you hear what goes on with Lasko--this is in his words, and 
I think this is where we have to really concentrate--Mr. McCasey says: 
We are in a business of pennies and can sometimes lose the sale of a 
fan to an overseas competitor due to a cost differential of 20 to 30 
cents.
  So what is it that Lasko makes? It makes fans. Seventy-two percent of 
their fans are portable fans. Why in the world would their own 
government make it harder for them to compete in a global economy? It 
makes absolutely no sense.
  We have come together, both sides, in agreement that, if there is 
something that we can do, why wouldn't we do it? Why wouldn't we make 
it easier for our own companies to compete? Why wouldn't we make it 
easier not just for us to compete, why wouldn't we make it easier for 
us to win, and win in big ways?
  This piece of legislation is so commonsense. There is nothing in it 
that both sides don't agree on. Quite frankly, and I agree with Mr. 
Pascrell, this is the first step, but we have got to go even further.
  When we see what has happened in our country since last year, the 
Trump administration's policies and the numbers that we have seen 
rising and escalating at such an ascent that we didn't ever expect this 
to happen this quickly, when we see America winning again, we know that 
that means America's workers, every man and woman, everybody in America 
benefits through this legislation because we make ourselves competitive 
on the global stage.
  There is no reason for America ever to take a backseat to anybody 
else in the world, and we do it through commonsense legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and Mr. Pascrell. It is good to be 
on the same team. It is good to be winning and keeping America winning 
as we go forward.
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, for far too long, American manufacturers have been put 
at a disadvantage because they are forced to pay tariffs on products 
they need but are not made in the United States. This has increased 
their costs, limited their ability to create new jobs, and decreased 
their competitive edge.
  Today we have the opportunity to change that by passing the 
Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018. This bipartisan bill would 
deliver the tariff relief our manufacturers need to strengthen their 
competitive edge, create new, good-paying jobs, provide more benefits 
to their employees, and boost the American economy. At the same time, 
because relief is temporary, we continue to create an incentive for 
United States manufacturers to decide to make these products here at 
home.
  For years, American manufacturers have been asking for tariff relief. 
Today we can do our part to deliver it. I urge my colleagues to join us 
in supporting this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the 
following:
