                       NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 2017

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
National Police Week. It is a privilege to take the time this week to 
reflect, remember, and honor our Federal, State, and local law 
enforcement officers who courageously defend American citizens and 
protect our communities. They selflessly put their lives on the line to 
ensure that this Nation is one of safety and order.
  On November 18, 2016, the reality of that danger hit home in 
Georgia's First Congressional District. Deputy Commander Patrick 
Carothers, a 26-year veteran of the U.S. Marshals Service and a 
resident of Long County, lost his life in the line of duty while 
serving a routine warrant. He left behind a loving wife and five 
children.
  This week the House will vote on H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act. 
With this bill, we can put a safeguard in place that works to protect 
our officers and their families from experiencing the same tragedy that 
took Commander Carothers' life.
  Thank you to the hardworking men and women of law enforcement that 
work each day to keep us safe, and thank you to the family of Commander 
Carothers, who sacrificed his life in the name of public good. You are 
in our thoughts and prayers.
