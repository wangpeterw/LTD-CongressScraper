                TRUMPCARE IS A PRESCRIPTION FOR DISASTER

  (Ms. McCOLLUM asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, TrumpCare is a disaster for children, 
families, seniors, and people with disabilities.
  The bill we are considering today has been strong-armed through this 
House with no public hearings. Today as we vote, we don't have an 
updated estimated cost from the Congressional Budget Office, but here 
is what we do know:
  Under TrumpCare, families will pay more for their insurance premiums 
and their deductibles.
  Under TrumpCare, older Americans will be forced to pay higher 
insurance premiums, five times higher than what others pay.
  Under TrumpCare, health care for vulnerable children, seniors, and 
people with disabilities will be rationed.
  Unbelievably, TrumpCare even attacks the solvency of Medicare. It 
will be weakened by giving big tax breaks to billionaires.
  TrumpCare was made even worse overnight. Now insurance companies will 
be able to sell policies that exclude basic health care like cancer 
screening and preventative care and even some hospitalizations.
  Mr. Speaker, this is not a healthcare bill. It is a prescription for 
disaster. I urge my colleagues to strongly oppose TrumpCare.
