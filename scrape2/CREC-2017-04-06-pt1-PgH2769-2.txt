       TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MUST STAND UP FOR SYRIAN CHILDREN NOW

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I could not leave this place, the most 
powerful lawmaking body in the world, in the season of Easter and 
Passover and sacrifice without bringing to the attention of my 
colleagues that children are dying. The children in Syria are suffering 
from the bombing and the vileness of President Assad and the chemical 
attack, where children and babies are struggling to breath.
  This Congress has to act. We must join those who want an infusion of 
emergency dollars.
  Where is our heart.
  And then the famine in Sub-Saharan Africa, where there are more 
displaced persons than we have seen in history. Sixty thousand have 
escaped to Kenya, and children and women are dying. In the name of our 
former colleague, the Honorable Mickey Leland, who died in 1989, taking 
grain to the famine area in Sub-Saharan Africa, we must act now.
  As a founder of the Congressional Children's Caucus myself, I cannot 
stand here and allow the children to die. This Congress must 
immediately issue emergency funds that appropriators such as 
Congresswoman Lee are putting forward. We must go to the region now and 
say what America is going to do. And the Trump administration must 
stand up for children now.
