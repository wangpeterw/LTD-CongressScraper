                  VOTERS BELIEVE MEDIA FABRICATES NEWS

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a recent Morning Consult poll found 
that nearly half of all voters--46 percent--``believe the media 
fabricates news stories about President Donald Trump and his 
administration.''
  It is not surprising that the American people feel this way. Each day 
they wake up to another barrage of negative reporting about a President 
they elected.
  In fact, a recent Harvard University study found that news coverage 
of President Trump's first 100 days was 80 percent negative, a record 
high for any recent President.
  The news media used anonymous sources to report illegitimate claims 
that intentionally placed the President and his administration in a bad 
light. This is borderline malicious.
  The liberal media frequently rushed to print stories with one single 
biased source. Often, the stories turn out to be false. This is the 
current state of journalism by the liberal media.
  The media should report on the topics of the day in a fair and 
balanced manner; otherwise, the American people will continue to 
consider the media's coverage to be fabricated news.
