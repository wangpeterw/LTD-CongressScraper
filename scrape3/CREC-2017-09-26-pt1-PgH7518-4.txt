                       HONORING GOLD STAR MOTHERS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Sunday marked a special 
kind of Mother's Day: Gold Star Mother's Day. Since 1936, the Nation 
has observed Gold Star Mother's Day on the last Sunday in September. 
The President humbly proclaimed Gold Star Mother's and Families' Day 
this Sunday, September 24.
  Our Gold Star Mothers should be honored and offered respect and 
gratitude for their personal sacrifice. Gold Star Mother's Day is 
intended to pay tribute to women who have experienced tremendous 
personal loss on behalf of our country.
  Mr. Speaker, our Gold Star Mothers serve as a strength and 
inspiration for this country. They are part of an exclusive group, one 
that no one ever hopes to belong to. One can hardly imagine the deep 
pain and anguish that a mother experiences when losing a child, 
particularly in military action.
  May we always honor the Gold Star Mothers of America for their 
courage, their strength, and their sacrifice. They bear their cross 
with honor. The memory of their children lives on not only in their 
hearts, but in the heart of this Nation.
