                      FAIRCHILD CHALLENGE PROGRAM

  The SPEAKER protempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
innovative educational program in my south Floridacommunity called the 
Fairchild Challenge.
  As a nonprofit founded in 2002, this no-cost, environment-focused 
annualcompetition based at the world-renowned Fairchild Tropical 
Botanic Garden, located in my district, invites students from aroundthe 
world to participate from a young age as active and thoughtful members 
of society.
  The Fairchild Challenge focusesattention on conservation of the 
environment, while introducing students to the importance of STEM: 
science, technology,engineering, and mathematics.
  In the 2014-2015 school year, over 153,000 participants were involved 
in the program. High-performing schools are eligible for cash prizes, 
while participating students may earn college scholarships.
  Throughinnovative programs like the Fairchild Challenge, students are 
sure to be conscious of the benefits of conserving ourenvironment and 
may more readily engage in the STEM fields that will better prepare 
them for the future.
  Congratulations toall the student participants of the Fairchild 
Challenge. Hats off especially to the board members, staff, and the 
manyvolunteers of the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, and most 
especially to Mr. and Mrs. Greer, the heart and soul of thesebeautiful 
botanical gardens.
