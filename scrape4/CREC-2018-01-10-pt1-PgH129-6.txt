                   HONORING THE MEMORY OF LISA HANSEN

  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of an 
extraordinary constituent, Lisa Hansen.
  Lisa was an Air Force veteran, a longtime civil servant, and an 
inspiration to many as an ovarian cancer survivor.
  In the final years of her career, Lisa worked as a defense contractor 
at the legendary Arsenal in Watervliet, New York.
  During her 14-year battle with cancer, Lisa became an expert in 
cancer research and treatment. She used that knowledge and experience 
to become an advocate and a mentor to fellow survivors.
  Ovarian cancer will affect 1 in 75 women. There is no diagnostic tool 
for it. Raising awareness is one of the best and only ways to get women 
diagnosed sooner.
  Lisa made it her personal mission to reach as many women as possible 
in New York's capital region and beyond through her leadership at 
Caring Together, Inc. She also participated in the Survivors Teaching 
Students program, sharing personal experiences with medical and nursing 
students.
  Lisa passed away on January 6. We will remember her passion and 
selfless dedication to ovarian cancer research and the extraordinary 
power in her voice and in her story.
  Thank you for a lifetime of service to others, Lisa. You will be 
sorely missed, but thank you for the inspiration you have provided to 
so many.
