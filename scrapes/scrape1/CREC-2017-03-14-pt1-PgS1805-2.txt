           100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SOUTH DAKOTA FARM BUREAU

 Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th 
anniversary of the South Dakota Farm Bureau.
  Established in 1917, the South Dakota Farm Bureau has worked 
tirelessly to promote, uphold, and improve agriculture across our 
State. What started as a small group of farmers and ranchers, joining 
together to protect their homes and livelihoods, has grown to represent 
more than 16,000 families in South Dakota today.
  As advocates for rural America, their mission is to ``make the 
business of farming more profitable, and the community a better place 
to live.'' They accomplish this by educating consumers, leading 
grassroots advocacy efforts, and providing youth programs to train the 
next generation of farmers and ranchers.
  I congratulate the South Dakota Farm Bureau on 100 years of 
successfully supporting South Dakota farmers and ranchers, so they can 
continue to supply safe, high-quality food to consumers around the 
globe.
