                   ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE FUNDING CUTS

  (Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of communities across 
Michigan's First District that depend on Essential Air Service funding 
for industry, mobility, and economic success. I believe that, when it 
comes to protecting taxpayer dollars, we as Congress have a fiduciary 
responsibility to the American people. We owe it to them to evaluate 
what is working and what isn't and make the appropriate adjustments.
  The Essential Air Service program is a great example of a program 
that is working, and I am proud to support it. EAS grants make it 
possible for 8 of the 10 airports in Michigan's First District to 
provide reliable air services, promote economic stability and job 
growth, and support a healthy tourism industry in the Upper Peninsula 
and throughout northern Michigan.
  The benefits that this program provides to small towns and cities in 
Michigan and across the United States are well worth the investment, 
and I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to ensure 
full Essential Air Service funding.
