                     RECOGNIZING DR. JOACHIM FRANK

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent 
of mine, Dr. Joachim Frank. Dr. Frank is a faculty member at Columbia 
University who, earlier this month, along with his international 
research colleagues, was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
  Dr. Frank becomes the third constituent from New York's 13th 
Congressional District who has received this tremendous honor and 
crowning achievement from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Dr. 
Frank's work and success is the foundation for scientists to explore 
and illuminate an almost unimaginable world that exists much beyond 
what you and I can imagine.
  We will see new medicines, curative therapies, and access to more 
information than we have ever seen before: the true product and 
potential of unrelenting intellectual curiosity.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to congratulate my constituent, Dr. 
Joachim Frank, and his research partners as the distinguished 
recipients of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
