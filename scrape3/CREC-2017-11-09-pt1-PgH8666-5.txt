 COMMEMORATING VETERANS OF THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS AND THROUGHOUT THE 
                             UNITED STATES

  (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my family and staff, I want 
to salute and commemorate the veterans of the U.S. Virgin Islands and 
throughout the United States on this Veterans Day.
  The Virgin Islands along with the other territories send more men and 
women per capita to serve in the U.S. military than anywhere else in 
this Nation.
  I would like to personally recognize Task Force Alpha on St. Croix, 
Task Force Bravo on St. Thomas, and St. John Responders.
  On Veterans Day, we salute the men and women who have proudly worn 
the uniform and the families who have served alongside them. We affirm 
our sacred duty as citizens to express our enduring gratitude, both in 
words and actions, for their service.
  As part of Veterans Day this year in the Virgin Islands, we will be 
honoring female veterans in the territory. Being honored as parade 
marshal and guest speaker on the island of St. Croix is Major Kathleen 
Parris; on St. Thomas, Sergeant First Class Laurel Maloon-Francis, 
serving as parade marshal; and serving as guest speaker on the island 
of St. Thomas will be former military spouse, Monique Y. Ferrell, 
director of the Army Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention 
Program.
  Mr. Speaker, just as we vow to leave no soldier behind on the 
battlefield, we vow not to forget any veteran when they return home.
