                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Infinite Spirit, maker of Heaven and Earth, we experience peace 
because of the knowledge that You are the same yesterday, today, and 
forever. May we continue to find rest and peace in You as You continue 
to be our help in ages past and our hope for years to come. Loose us 
from the changes that create cynicism, pessimism, and despair. Remind 
us of the foolishness of seeking security apart from You.
  Lord, bless the Members of this body. Help them in the making of laws 
to execute justice for the oppressed and to set the captives free.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
