             RECOGNIZING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AWARENESS WEEK

  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Multiple Sclerosis 
Awareness Week, which is March 11 through 17.
  Each year, activists, physicians, and policymakers come together to 
spread awareness about this disease and to salute the healthcare 
professionals and researchers who are dedicated to finding treatments 
and a cure for this debilitating disease.
  Since 2008, I have introduced a bipartisan resolution recognizing the 
goals and ideals of MS Awareness Week. That is H. Res. 176.
  MS is an unpredictable and incurable disease that my family and 
hundreds of thousands of families across our Nation experience every 
day.
  My sister, Mildred, has lived with MS for more than 40 years. Her 
courage and the courage of 2 million people living with MS around the 
world inspire my efforts to bring more research for treatment and a 
cure.
  As a member of the House Health and Human Services Appropriations 
Subcommittee, I promise to continue fighting for increased funding to 
find a cure, and I hope all of my colleagues, Democrats and 
Republicans, help us in this effort.
