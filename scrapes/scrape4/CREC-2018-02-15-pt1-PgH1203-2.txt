                 HONORING THE LIFE OF CHRISTIANA DUARTE

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Madam Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of 
Christiana Duarte. Christiana attended the Route 91 Festival in Las 
Vegas on October 1.
  She had recently graduated from the University of Arizona with a 
degree in business marketing. While in college, she interned with the 
Arizona Wildcats and was a member of the sorority Sigma Kappa. After 
graduation Christiana worked for the Los Angeles Kings as a fan 
services associate.
  Friends and family remember Christiana as a bright, beautiful young 
woman who was full of life and energy.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Christiana Duarte's family 
and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of 
Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.
