                        HONORING DORIS A. DAVIS

  (Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, on this International Women's Day, I rise 
to honor the life of the Honorable Doris A. Davis, who passed away last 
month, after providing decades of public service to the city of 
Compton.
  After serving as Compton's first African-American city clerk, Ms. 
Davis then went on to become the first African-American mayor of a 
major metropolitan city in the country.
  During her time in office, Mayor Davis worked tirelessly to increase 
tax revenues and job opportunities in Compton.
  Upon leaving office, she founded the Daisy Child Development Centers, 
a nonprofit organization that provided assistance to single parents and 
families in and around Compton.
  Mayor Davis was always an active participant in our community--
belonging to over two dozen organizations, including the NAACP, the 
Urban League, and the League of Women Voters--and her legacy of public 
service will live on.
