               PRO-GROWTH TAX REFORM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES

  (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the need for pro-
growth tax reform for small businesses in America.
  Last week, I was on Main Street in Grapevine, Texas, surrounded by 
local businesses that were started in pursuit of the American Dream. 
These businesses are opened by hardworking people trying to give their 
families a better life and create jobs in north Texas and the 
communities that I represent.

  Washington's Tax Code is too big and too complicated for American 
small businesses to grow and to be the job creation engine for future 
generations. We need pro-growth tax reform that lowers the rates for 
local businesses and simplifies the code for families. Main streets 
across America are counting on us to do that.
