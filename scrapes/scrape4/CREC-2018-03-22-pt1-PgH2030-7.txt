                  HONORING DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, while we are on recess, the city of Memphis, 
Tennessee, will be the center of civil rights history as the 50th 
anniversary of the tragic assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., 
will be memorialized on April 4 in Memphis, where he was slain.
  At the Lorraine Motel where he was staying and killed, a great civil 
rights museum has sprung up like a phoenix from the ashes, the great 
history of the civil rights movement. At that spot, at the same time he 
was killed, there will

be a bell ringing, and there will be civil rights leaders from all over 
the country in Memphis to mark the occasion: our own  John Lewis, 
Andrew Young, Danny Glover, and Cary Kennedy. There are so many that I 
shouldn't start, but they will be there to honor Dr. King's memory.
  Dr. King's dream is not fulfilled yet. We need to continue to work to 
make his dream fulfilled in this country to where everybody, regardless 
of their race or their gender, for that matter, or their sexual 
orientation, has an opportunity to climb ladders of opportunity to 
participate in the American Dream and have a successful life and be a 
part of the middle class, if possible.
  I hope everybody will give some thought to Dr. King and his dream on 
April 4.
