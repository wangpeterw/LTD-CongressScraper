                   CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF RON PARISH

  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday morning, Ron Parish of 
Yorkville, Illinois, passed from the loving arms of his wife, Becky, 
into the open arms of Jesus.
  Ron was a lifelong salesman whose career included RC Cola, Nabisco, 
McCormick spice company, and more. After he retired, he faithfully 
served our community's homeless at Kendall County PADS.
  Ron's people skills served him well in business and in his 
relationships. He was always reaching out to friends and strangers 
alike. He would ask how they are doing, how he could help, and he was 
always pointing them to Jesus.
  In fact, Ron and Becky introduced my family to their church, Harvest 
New Beginnings, and they were the very first to greet us on that God-
ordained day 3 years ago when we first visited Harvest New Beginnings. 
It has become our home church.
  Ron was 75 years old and is survived by Becky; two children, Ron, 
Jr., and Rhonda; four grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; and 
many other relatives and friends.
  I know you are smiling down on us now, Ron. Well done, good and 
faithful servant.
