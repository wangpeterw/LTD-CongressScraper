         RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF FIRST 5 SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY

  (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the work 
being done by First 5 San Luis Obispo County for families on the 
central coast.
  I stand to endorse their Children's Bill of Rights. This document 
serves as a guide well beyond San Luis Obispo County that every 
lawmaker in this Nation should work toward, especially the right to 
visit a doctor to help children stay physically and mentally healthy.
  This week marks the eighth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act 
that covers 1 million children through the State and Federal 
marketplaces. The ACA also made significant investments in our 
Children's Health Insurance Program.
  I urge my colleagues to continue to work together to strengthen this 
legislation. By controlling the cost of prescription drugs, ensuring 
cost-sharing reduction subsidies, and adding a public option to bring 
down the cost of health insurance plans, we can ensure that we continue 
to raise healthy children.
