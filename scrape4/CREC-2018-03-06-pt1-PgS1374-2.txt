 Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that 
I honor the life and memory of Dana Marshall-Bernstein and express my 
deepest condolences to her parents, family, and friends.
  Dana was diagnosed as a young child with Crohn's disease, which she 
succumbed to at age 28, but Dana did not allow her disease to define

Colitis Foundation.
  Dana lived life to the fullest--skiing, playing piano, creating art, 
and singing every chance she got. Dana's intelligence, brilliance, 
amazing sense of humor and wit, loving compassionate heart, and all-
around remarkable soul will always be in the hearts and minds of her 
loving family and in those who had the fortune of knowing her.
