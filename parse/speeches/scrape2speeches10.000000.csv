Four hundred is the level we should not go below.  Our strategic nuclear force enterprise is America's force of last resort and has, for decades, asserted peace through strength for the United States and its allies around the world.  I would like to remind my colleagues that every one of us in the House and the many millions of Americans we represent have lived and prospered in peace precisely because we have made the conscious decision as a nation many years ago to keep a strong, responsive, and resilient nuclear deterrent.  The ICBM leg of the nuclear triad is, by design, the largest, safest, and most responsive part of our central strategic forces. It is the very foundation of our nuclear deterrent, and we must preserve the longstanding bipartisan consensus that our ICBMs be kept at high levels of alert and at sufficient numbers to ensure our nuclear deterrent stays credible.

2078,topic-id,613,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for 187, Relating to Efforts to Respond to the Famine in South Sudan, as amended, which passed out of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and has received bipartisan support.  As always, Mr.Speaker, I thank and appreciate the leadership of Chairman Royce, Chairman Smith, and Ranking Member  The United Nations has declared what is going on now in four countries as potentially the worse humanitarian crisis since the U.was formed in 1945. Famine has been declared in one country, and three others are at risk of famine. Famine might be averted in Somalia if the rains come. In Nigeria and Yemen, famine might be averted if the world acts in time.  But South Sudan, which is the world's newest nation, is currently experiencing famine. The United Nations defines famine as meaning over 20 percent of the population has access to only 2,100 calories per day. Thirty percent of children are malnourished. And 2 to 4 people die per day because of lack of food. Tragically, South Sudan meets all three conditions.  Over the years, the U.has played a leadership role in the region. The U.has helped South Sudan throughout their struggle for independence, and has tried to help the world's newest nation over the last several years before and during the conflict.  The tragedy is the people of South Sudan are in the midst of a famine, not because of a drought or other natural disaster, but because of ongoing conflict. There is heavy responsibility on all sides of the fighting. There is no innocent party here.  In South Sudan, the U.has reported roughly 5 million people who are in urgent need of food and nutritional assistance. There are almost 2 million internally displaced persons in camps in South Sudan, and 2,400 South Sudanese refugees arrive in Uganda every single day.  If the world does not act, 5 million people will be at risk for starvation by mid-2017. Without urging humanitarian intervention, more civilians will continue to die from acute malnutrition, and millions more will remain at risk.  If we fail to act prior to the upcoming rainy season, which is May to August, this will create additional problems that will further impede humanitarian efforts. Unfortunately, the areas where famine has been declared have also seen some of the most intense fighting.  The amendment to 187 calls for USAID to continue providing desperately needed and locally appropriate food aid through the Food for Peace and Emergency Food Security Programs, and calls on the Government of South Sudan to declare and observe a cessation of hostilities to allow food and essential supplies to reach affected civilians.  The resolution urges the Government of South Sudan to allow immediate and unrestricted humanitarian access to the southern unity region, where the famine is currently underway.  The amendment also condemns all threats and violence against civilian populations and aid workers, including over 70 humanitarian aid workers that have been killed since the conflict began.  The resolution condemns the brutal attack by the South Sudanese military on humanitarian aid workers, including Americans at the Terrain Camp in July of last year.  The resolution condemns the multiple instances in which security forces have looted humanitarian assistance destined for civilians in need, and supports the effort of the U.Government working with partners in the international community, including the U.N., the African Union, and the European Union, to facilitate humanitarian access to affected areas, and encourages greater diplomatic pressure on the parties to return to the negotiation table to stop the violence and to allow full humanitarian access.

2007,topic-id,507,"Mr.President, during this week, all across the country, people are honoring the men and women who serve as law enforcement officials. Clearly, they deserve and receive recognition every day for what they do, but this is an incredibly difficult job.  Last night, I was with some of our officers from Missouri and with family members, and I said: A lot of times, it is easier for you to walk out the door than it is for your family to see you walk out the door, not knowing what you are going to face every day.  When Senator Coons and I came to the Senate 7 years ago, we created and cochaired the Senate Law Enforcement It is a privilege to be part of that and also to speak today on behalf of those who serve us.  This is a week in which we take a moment to recognize the law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. Today, I want to pay tribute to three Missouri law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty this past year. Master Sergeant Carl Cosper of the Barry County Sheriff's Office was one of those, as were Officer Blake Curtis Snyder of the Louis County Police Department and Deputy Sheriff Paul Allen Clark of the Francois County Sheriff's  Just last month, Master Sergeant Cosper was killed in a vehicle collision while responding to a domestic disturbance call. He had served the Barry County Sheriff's Office for 10 years before that fatal accident.  In October of 2016, Officer Blake Snyder was shot and killed while responding to a disturbance. He had served the Louis County Police Department for 4 years. He is survived by his wife and their 2-year-old son. I had a chance last night to visit with his wife again. Elizabeth and her brother Justin, also a police officer in Louis County, were here earlier this year to talk about police and families and what we need to do to really express our understanding of what those families go through, their strength and their reliance, both humbling and inspiring, and I am sure they are passing along those very values to Blake's 2-year-old son.  In July of 2016, Deputy Sheriff Paul Clark died from complications related to injuries he sustained in October of 2015 when he was intentionally struck by a stolen vehicle near Desloge, Deputy Clark had served the Francois County Sheriff's Department for 13 years and had previously served with the Park Hills Police Department for 5 years. He is survived by his wife, two children, and by their grandchildren.  All of these individuals are heroes, and our prayers remain with their families.

1856,topic-id,981,"Madam President, I rise to introduce the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act (Dignity Act), a critical criminal justice reform bill that would provide much needed reforms to address the unique needs women face in Federal prisons. This legislation helps shed light on the unique challenges women face behind bars, which seldom receive the attention they deserve in our criminal justice reform efforts. It is time we begin to remedy the barriers incarcerated women face, and that's what this bill would do. I thank Senators Warren, Durbin, and Harris for cosponsoring this bill, and I am proud to have their support.  America is truly exceptional when it comes to incarceration. The United States has 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the globe's prison population. Since 1980, our Federal population has grown by nearly 800 percent.  But let's look specifically at incarcerated women. Only 5 percent of the world's female population live in the United States, but nearly 30 percent of the world's incarcerated women are in our Nation--twice the percentage of China and four times as much as Since 1978, the number of women incarcerated in State and Federal prisons in the United States has increased by 716 percent, twice the growth rate of men. America currently has 110,000 women behind bars, and women account for a larger proportion of the prison population than ever before in our Nation's history.  The numbers of women in our Federal prisons has seen substantial growth. Although women represent a small percentage of Federal prisoners, the proportion of women in the Federal system rose from 12.1 percent in fiscal year 2009 to 13.3 percent in fiscal year 2013. Based on the most recent Sentencing Commission data, 9,400 women were in Federal prisons as of fiscal year 2013. In 2013, more than two-thirds of women in Federal prison were behind bars due to nonviolent drug, fraud, or immigration crimes and over 70 percent of women in Federal prisons had little or no prior criminal history.  An urgent need exists to address the unique challenges women face while behind bars. Women are often primary caretaker parents, meaning their incarceration impacts children. Incarcerated women face the unconscionable choice of either calling home to talk to their children or using commissary funds to buy sanitary napkins. Women in prison are frequently victims of trauma. According to data from Vera Institute of Justice, women in jails face high-levels of trauma: 86 percent experienced sexual violence, 77 percent report partner violence, and 60 percent were survivors of caregiver violence. These troubling statistics deserve our attention.  Today, I'm proud to introduce the Dignity Act, a comprehensive bill that would begin to remedy the unique challenges faced by women behind bars. The bill would require the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to consider the location of children when placing an incarcerated parent in a Federal prison, which helps alleviate the great distances children and other loved ones often have to travel to visit incarcerated parents.  The bill would mandate the BOP create more generous and uniform visitation hours for primary caretaker parents to provide more easy access to loved ones while a woman is behind bars. We know family visitation is a critical part of a successful reentry strategy, so this commonsense provision would help maintain family contact when parents are behind bars. As a result, this provision makes it less likely that returning citizens commit crimes, which would enhance public safety.  The Dignity Act would ban solitary confinement and shackling of pregnant women in Federal prison. Studies confirm serious psychological and physical harm are likely to occur when these harsh practices are used on pregnant women. It is time we ban the use of solitary and shackling on pregnant women and treat these women with the dignity and respect they deserve.  The bill would also require the BOP to provide parenting classes to primary caretaker parents, provide trauma-informed care to victims of trauma, and allow returning citizens to mentor incarcerated people. It would mandate the BOP train correctional officers in how to identify trauma victims in prison. This bill would help ensure people behind bars receive the critical programming they need to prepare for reentry into society.  The Dignity Act contains numerous other reforms. It would create an ombudsman at the Department of Justice to look into abuses associated with solitary confinement, prisoner transportation, strip searches, and other civil rights abuses. The bill would require the BOP to eliminate prison phone rates and mandate all prisons be equipped with video conferencing, which the bill ensures would be made available free of charge to incarcerated people. The legislation would require the BOP to make certain health products available for free, such as sanitary napkins, toothpaste, and ibuprofen.  Other reforms in the bill would preclude correctional officers of the opposite gender of the incarcerated individual from conducting strip searches or entering a restroom of the opposite gender. The bill has a common-sense exception for when an incarcerated woman's health is in danger and for other exigent circumstances. The bill would require the BOP to allow primary caretaker parents access to the Residential Drug Abuse Program, a critical drug treatment program, even if they fail to admit to having a substance abuse disorder prior to their incarceration. Finally, the Dignity Act would require the BOP to create a pilot program for overnight visits for incarcerated parents and children.  The legislation has broad support from organizations like the National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls, the ACLU, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under  The Dignity Act would provide critical reforms to address challenges women behind bars face. Again, I thank Senators Warren, Durbin, and Harris for their leadership. I am proud to introduce this important criminal justice reform bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its speedy passage.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-11-pt1-PgS3922.txt,2194,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,11.0,July

2114,topic-id,314,"Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.3178, the Medicare Part B Improvement Act of 2017.  This bill represents a series of bipartisan reforms from the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means that will provide targeted reforms to improve access to care for Medicare beneficiaries.  Home infusion patients are oftentimes our Nation's sickest and most vulnerable, and maintaining access to these services in home settings has proved invaluable in ensuring that patients can continue to effectively receive the care that they need.  Under last year's 21st Century Cures Act, we took the necessary steps to ensure that taxpayers and beneficiaries were no longer overcharged on the acquisition and dispensing costs associated with home infusion. Additionally, we took complementary steps to recognize the unique education needs associated with receiving infusion in the home.  However, as my subcommittee learned in a hearing on this issue just last week, there is still more that must be done to integrate these two policies without jeopardizing access to patient care. Therefore, today's bill creates a bridge to connect these critical policies and to resolve the issue.  Additionally, H.3178 takes an additional needed step to protect home health services by expanding opportunities for individuals to receive home dialysis. Access to services like home infusion and home dialysis has had a significant impact in my home State of Texas, and I am encouraged by today's bill, as it will build upon these additional successes for Texans and all  I would like to thank Chairman Brady, Chairman Tiberi, and Chairman Walden for their leadership on the bill.

1966,topic-id,2652,"Madam President, first, let me thank the Democratic leader for his statement on a better deal for all  I had a chance over the weekend to travel throughout my State, and I heard over and over again the people of Maryland talking about what we need to do on a better deal. I had an interesting forum on healthcare, and Marylanders want a better deal on healthcare. They want to make sure healthcare is affordable, that they can get access to quality care, and they can make sure we maintain the highest quality healthcare.  What they don't want to see is us moving in the wrong direction. I heard over and over again their concerns about what is happening with the consideration of the bill the Republican leadership is anticipating having a vote on later this week. That bill would proceed on legislation that would eliminate healthcare coverage for, at least, 22 million Americans, maybe as high as 33 million I must tell you that is not a better deal for Americans on their healthcare needs. We could do much better moving in the opposite direction and making healthcare more affordable, not cutting people out of healthcare insurance.  In my State of Maryland, in 2018 alone, 221,000 people in my State would lose coverage under the proposals the Republican leadership is suggesting, including 4,200 veterans, 164,000 people in the Medicaid system, and 62,000 people in the individual marketplace. That is going to hurt. These are people today who have healthcare coverage who would lose their healthcare coverage. It would hurt our seniors in the coverage they get under the Medicaid system for long-term care. It would hurt those who are working to try to end this opioid drug addiction issue.  Under the current law, mental health, behavioral health, and drug addiction is covered under the essential health benefits. It is covered under private insurance. It is covered under the Medicaid system. That is in danger of being lost under the legislation being considered.  I heard from public health and law enforcement over the weekend how that would move our community in the wrong direction if those bills were considered.  I also heard from the majority leader that all he wants to do is get on this bill, and then we can offer amendments. Well, that is not accurate. You can't offer any amendments you want on a bill that is under reconciliation instructions, and we certainly aren't[[Page S4126]]going to get a fair shot at trying to make this bill a better bill under the restrictions we are operating under: We had no committee hearings. We had no committee markups. That is not the way legislation should be considered.  The other issue I heard about from people in Maryland--I think you will hear this from people around the country--is they want to bring down the cost of their healthcare coverage. They want to bring down the cost of their healthcare. They want to reduce the high growth rate in healthcare costs in this country. Yet the Senate Republican bill increases the average premium by as much as $1,700 in Maryland by 2020 and preserves what we call the age tax--a 5-to-1 difference.  So if you happen to be 55 years of age, you are going to pay a lot more than that in increases in your health insurance premiums. That is not what people in Maryland want to see. That is not what people in this country want to see. They are concerned that we should be building on the Affordable Care Act to bring down the cost of their premium increases, not to increase it by that dramatic amount of money.  The increase in deductibles in Maryland could be as high as $3,300 for a person making $42,000 per year and $5,600 for a person making about $18,000 a year. Those are increases in deductibles. They can't afford that. The concerns we have--people like the Affordable Care Act, and they want us to improve it. They want us to improve it. They don't want us to add to their costs, and the bill the majority leader is asking us to consider would have people in Maryland and around the country paying more--not less, which they want.  The people in Maryland and around this country like the consumer protections we have under the Affordable Care They like the idea that there is no annual cap or lifetime cap. I had several people who came up to me to tell me about their own personal circumstances. One father explained to me that his child was born with serious issues and that they reached their cap within a matter of months. Without the protection in the Affordable Care Act, they would have had no other insurance coverage. Yet, under the bill being considered by the Republican leadership, that family could lose that protection because you could see the imposition of caps.  All of us know of people who are very concerned about preexisting conditions. The bill that is being considered under the Republican leadership weakens those protections against discrimination of preexisting conditions.  Let me just remind my colleagues of what we saw before the Affordable Care Act in discriminatory practices by private insurance companies. We had reined much of that in under the Affordable Care All of that could be lost if we proceed on legislation--and move it forward--that doesn't provide the consumer protections, allows the elimination of caps, allows discriminatory practices in regard to preexisting conditions, restricts the amount of money going into the Medicaid system so our States are forced basically to cut back on the Medicaid system. We lose the expanded coverage--the Congressional Budget Office has already told us that--and we go back to the days of job lock. I want to talk about that for one moment because I think this is one of the untold stories. We haven't had a lot of discussion on the floor.  If you go in the wrong direction and you do what the Republican leadership is talking about doing and repeal the Affordable Care Act and either repeal and later replace or replace it now with a program that will eliminate a lot of coverage and once again eliminate these consumer protections we have in health insurance, what you do is people get locked into employment. They are afraid to leave their job because they have insurance that covers their family--they have a spouse with cancer or they have a child with a major disability. Yes, they would like to do what this country is best known for, and that is set out with an entrepreneurial spirit, start a company or go and take risks, but they can't do it because they know they are jeopardizing their family's healthcare because they can't get the type of insurance they need to cover their risks. That is called job lock and that works against the growth of our economy.  There are so many reasons to be concerned about what the majority leader is asking us to do--to proceed on this bill that all the options we have seen will cost tens of millions of people their coverage, take away a lot of the consumer protections we have seen in the law, and discriminate against our elderly, discriminate against minorities and women. That would be returning to our old healthcare system. No, that is not the right way to do it.  I am frequently asked: Well, what should we do? The Affordable Care Act, doesn't it have problems? Doesn't it need to be fixed?  The Affordable Care Act has done a lot of good. It has given people coverage who never had coverage before. It has reined in the discriminatory practices of health insurance companies. It has made a dramatic improvement on dealing with minority health and health disparities. It has provided essential health benefits so we deal with mental health and addiction. It has done a lot of really good things, but, yes, we could improve it. There has never been a major law passed without us going back and revisiting.  Why haven't Democrats been part of this process? Well, we could not get engaged in this process because the way this bill came to the floor, it didn't come through the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, it didn't come in through the Finance Committee, the two committees of jurisdiction that deal with the healthcare system in this country. Instead, it came in through the majority leader using the rule XIV process to bring out a reconciliation bill that can be jammed through, with limited time and no open amendment process, from the point of view that amendments have to be germane to the reconciliation instructions so we don't have an opportunity to fix this bill.  We weren't part of the process to develop the bill. You are not giving an opportunity for the democratic system to work. There was no on-ramp for Democrats to get engaged in the process.  About 2 weeks ago--maybe 3 weeks ago now--I filed legislation and sent letters to my Republican colleagues telling them: I want to work with you. I do. I have worked with Republicans in the Finance Committee on healthcare bills. We have gotten some good things done. Democrats and Republicans want to work together, so let's work together.  The legislation I filed dealt with the two major problems that I hear about, as I travel throughout Maryland, regarding what we need to fix on the Affordable Care Act and how we can make it better.  Problem 1, we need more stability and competition within the individual marketplace. Yes, we have seen large proposed increases in premiums in the individual marketplace--not in the group plans where most Americans have their insurance but in the individual marketplace. Why? Because we don't have enough people who have signed up in the exchanges. Younger, healthier people, because there really hasn't been a penalty imposed, have chosen not to join. They will say: Look, we will join if we have a need.  We have also found that with President Trump indicating he may not fund the cost-sharing provisions that go directly to the insurance carriers that keep the premiums low and the deductibles and copays low, this also has a lot of insurance companies nervous. As a result, the premium increases are larger than what we had anticipated. We need to do something about it.  How can we keep those premium increases at a more reasonable growth rate rather than what we have seen? One way we could do it is a proposal that, I believe, has bipartisan support; that is, deal with what is known as reinsurance. Reinsurance is a way we spread the risk over a greater group of people, therefore dealing with those high-risk pools in a way in which their premium costs are much more affordable.  Another way we can do it is by Congress mandating that the President fund the cost-sharing with the insurance carriers so we don't have the threat that they are going to pull out those funds that are used to keep copays and deductibles low.  Another way we can do it is to increase our support for those who are of[[Page S4127]]modest income and the funds they have to lay out for their premiums because we know you can make a good salary, but because of the cost of healthcare, if you don't have an employer providing part of those benefits, it is very hard for you to be able to afford that without some help. We can do all of that.  Another thing we could do is bring more competition into the individual marketplace. We have had those who have suggested a Medicare for all. We have had those who have suggested Medicare for the near elderly--the 55 to 65 age group or something similar to that. We have others who have suggested that we have a public option under the exchanges. All those, to me, make sense because it just brings in more competition. There is no additional government cost here because they are not subsidized any differently than any other insurance plan, but it gives more options, more choice, more competition, and therefore more stability in the individual marketplace. We could do all that and all that can help.  The other thing we really need to deal with is to deal with the overall cost of healthcare. Here, again, Democrats and Republicans have had ideas. Why don't we take on the pharmaceutical industry? Why do Americans pay twice what Canadians pay for the same medicines that are manufactured here in the United States? Why don't we have rebates in the Medicare system like the rebates we have in the Medicaid system? Why don't we organize our purchasing power in a larger pool so we can get greater discounts for the government taxpayers? All those things will bring down the cost of prescription medicines. The President has talked about it. Democrats and Republicans have talked about it. It is time we act.  We have acted in several areas to try to deal with more value-based reimbursements in our healthcare system, recognizing we should treat the person, not the particular disease. Many people have more than one ailment, and they have to go back to the doctor multiple times. Why don't we have a more coordinated, integrated care model?  I talked on the floor about 2 weeks ago about the coordinated care model between Sheppard Pratt Hospital in Baltimore and Mosaic, which deals with behavioral health issues and how they deal with it in an integrated, coordinated care model, which saves money. It saves money. There are fewer tests, more timely interventions.  How can we use telemedicine? They are using telepsychiatry. How can we use that to bring down the cost of care? When I am asked in my district, asked in my State as to what I can do--where is my plan, and how can we fix the Affordable Care Act--my answer is quite simple: I am proud of the progress we have made under the Affordable Care I invite Democrats and Republicans through our committees to work together to improve it. Yes, we can improve it. We can provide more stability in the individual marketplace. We can bring down the high annual growth we have seen in premiums in the individual marketplace. We can continue to bring down the growth rate of healthcare costs by working together on some of these commonsense approaches in order to deal with healthcare in All of this I think we can do, with Democrats and Republicans working together. But the first order of business--and I urge my colleagues--the first order of business is to stop this process of trying to jam a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a replacement that would cost tens of millions of people in this country their health coverage and would move in the wrong direction on how we should improve healthcare in Let's get that off the table.  Let's reject this motion to proceed that the majority leader is talking about voting on later this week. Let's do what Senator Alexander, the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has suggested. Let's have hearings in our committees. Let's work together, and let's bring legislation that stabilizes the Affordable Care Act and deals with the two major problems that the people in this country are talking about; that is, bringing down the growth rate of premium costs and bringing down the overall growth rate of healthcare costs in I believe we can do both by working together. There are suggestions I have made, and I am sure other Members have. Let's work on those. Let's work together and get it done. Let's do what is in the best interest of the people in this country.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                           Montana Wildfires  ",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgS4124.txt,,HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT,2017.0,24.0,July

The key to their successes is that these kids grew up together, and they played sports when they were They played sports when they were in middle school. By the time they got to high school, they had worked together, trained together, and knew each other, and they did well as a team.  I met another athlete from Middletown a couple of weeks ago.

I still work out every day. I have been doing this since I was a brandnew ensign in the Navy and on my way to Pensacola, FL, to become a naval flight officer and serve our country around the world.

2003,topic-id,1847,"Mr.President, it is fair to say that Americans are sick of partisanship when it comes to issues of greatest concern. They are asking, if you will, that we in the Senate put party behind us--behind the needs of the people. This is especially true when we are speaking of those issues of greatest importance, and I would argue that the replacement of the Affordable Care Act is one of those issues of greatest importance.  Whatever the excuse, no Senator of either party should sit on the sidelines. This is such an important issue that every Senator, whatever her or his personal views, should be engaged.  We know President Trump's principles, if you will. He laid them out time and again on the campaign trail. He wants to maintain coverage, lower premiums, care for those with preexisting conditions, and eliminate the ObamaCare mandates upon individuals and businesses.  At his inauguration speech, he spoke of the forgotten man and of the forgotten woman. In fact, we can see that just before his inauguration, he emphasized that with what he said during the campaign:       We're going to have insurance for everyone. There's a      philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you      don't get it. That is not going to happen to us.  He also emphasized the quality of the care, saying that people covered under the law that he would propose to replace can expect to have great healthcare. ``It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive, much better,'' he said to the Washington Post just before he was sworn in. These are his principles.  When he was sworn in and gave his inaugural address, speaking of the forgotten man and the forgotten woman, I cannot help but think that he was influenced as he went through counties seeing folks with terrible tales of their child dying from opioid addiction or their spouse unable to afford insurance under  I will point out that there is a huge dimension to this that we sometimes forget, but we should not. Senator Jerry Moran from Kansas made the point that healthcare is like no other issue. It is an issue which touches us most personally. I think President Trump saw that on the campaign trail. He saw the parent of an adult child with mental illness, and she could not get a psychiatric bed for her child. We know the fate of that child if he does not have the care he needs. He will end up either in a homeless shelter, a jail cell, or the morgue. That is the human dimension to this, and that is why we need to help President Trump fulfill his pledge.  Voters understand what we are speaking of; they understand the importance of it. But let me speak just a little bit more to the politics of this because we cannot separate what we do here in Washington, DC, from politics.  There are researchers from Princeton who recently published a report. If you look at White males and females between 18 and 54 who lack a college education, their life span is decreasing. Now, for Hispanics, African Americans, and other minorities, it is improving, but for this group, it is decreasing.  I have seen data which shows that in the population centers of the United States in which this phenomenon is being most seen--these Whites from age 18 to 54, noncollege educated, their life span is decreasing--the counties in which this effect is most seen were most likely to vote for Donald Think about the politics of this. The politics are that a group of folks who understand that their life is materially and physically declining, with higher rates of suicide, addiction, liver disease, and other chronic illness, ending in premature death, voted significantly more for the President who swore that he would remember them, who spoke of the forgotten man and the forgotten woman. His pledge to them was a lifeline. Their vote for him was a cry for help.  This is not just a human dimension; there is a political dimension leading to a policy necessity.  Let's stop for a second. There is a key issue of cost. We understand that the Affordable Care Act was too expensive. We can save money. But let's not fool ourselves; it is still going to cost. We can save the $150 billion or so that the House suggested we have to save. We know the rules the Senate has to address to save at least that much money. On the other hand, we know that Congress has mandated people can get care; therefore, if Congress mandates that folks get care, then Congress should help provide the means by which to pay for it.  There are some who think, oh, my gosh, Congress does not need to provide for the money for care, and everything will be good. I am a physician. I have been in the emergency room at 2 in the morning, and at 2 in the morning, when those emergency room doors are open, whoever comes in is treated. She may have heart failure, he may have a drug overdose, they might be a schizophrenic, or they might be somebody vomiting blood. Each one of them receives all the care that he or she needs to stabilize their emergency condition. And if they have to be hospitalized--think of a car wreck with multiple traumas--and they are in the hospital for 4 months, they still get that care because Congress mandates that. But, if Congress does not provide the means to pay for it, the cost of that care is shifted not to government; the cost of that care is shifted to the privately insured. All of those getting their insurance through their employer begin to pay higher premiums--much higher premiums. Somebody pays. And if we do not fulfill our obligation, after mandating that those patients get cared for--we, being Congress--then society pays, and society is the person struggling to make ends meet and now finds out from her employer that her premium has increased 20, 30, sometimes 50 percent--all because of the cost-shifting that occurs.  It is not just the group market. Under ObamaCare, we can see that in the individual market, premiums have skyrocketed. It is not that the Affordable Care Act is working so well. Last week I communicated with someone who lives in San Francisco, and she and her young family are paying $20,000 a year for a premium, $6,000 deductibles; none of them is sick, none of them will meet their deductibles, but living in a very expensive city, having to struggle to pay their mortgage, groceries, and transportation, now they have to come up with $20,000 to pay for their healthcare. That is all because of the Affordable Care  Then I spoke with a person in Washington, DC, and someone in Washington DC--that person who is a consultant on insurance issues, knows insurance backward and forward, says that for his family, the premium is $24,000 a year, with a $13,000 family deductible. The insurance expert says: I will be out $37,000 in a single year before my insurance kicks in. Families cannot afford that.  I will finish up lastly with a story from Folks never believe this because it seems too crazy, but I put it on my Facebook page. There is a couple back home, 60 and 61. They were quoted a premium of $39,000 for a premium of one year, with a deductible on top of that--$39,000. We can see that in the individual market, the Affordable Care Act is not working, it is becoming the un-Affordable Care We have to address this.  But let me say, we have to address it whether we are a Democrat or a We must respond to the cries for help coming from those folks suffering from addiction, mental illness, heart failure, or any other chronic disease for which they do not have coverage, but also to the cries for help from middle-class families who cannot afford these premiums, and if they don't sacrifice something in the budget to pay for it, under the Affordable Care Act, they will be fined.  Let's return to the political side. The political side is that I have voters back home asking why Republican Senators[[Page S2945]]are not helping a Republican President fulfill his pledge--a pledge to all voters--but one that certain Republican voters specifically took to heart; that is, to fulfill his pledge of caring for those with preexisting conditions, continuing coverage, lowering premiums, and eliminating mandates.  If you are a Democratic Senator, the forgotten woman and the forgotten man is in your State too. I can promise you, even if you are not a Republican but you are a Democrat, you have an opioid crisis in your So if we are now looking at addressing Medicaid expansion or the affordability of the individual market, and you are a Democratic Senator and you decide to sit on the sideline--if you are a voter in that State, you should be asking why.  Let's face it. Speaking of my Democratic colleagues, many of you do not like President Some of you hate President Some of you like him, but you have to pretend that you hate him. Even though this is President Trump's pledge, this is not about President This about the voters--the patients, the people in our States who either cannot afford their insurance or who have an addiction or some mental illness or some other critical mental healthcare need that, if this ObamaCare replacement is not done well, will leave them far worse off.  I have heard some of the excuses from my Democratic colleagues as to why they cannot participate. They say: Oh, we are using the word ``repeal'' or, oh, we are not going through a normal committee process--oh, this, or oh, that. I concede it all. Who cares? If you are a voter right now, and your child is addicted to opioids, do you really care that there is a semantic issue regarding whether or not we are saying ``repeal'' or ``repair''? Do you really care that after 8 years of hearings, we don't have a few more hearings? Do you even understand the difference between reconciliation versus normal process? I would say no, because the principal thing that concerns you is that your child is desperate for help and you are not sure that the help will continue.  So I say to my Democratic colleagues: Whatever the excuse, ignore the excuse, and please engage.  Let me finish where I started. I think the average American right now wants every Senator, whether Republican or Democrat, to help President Trump fulfill his pledge to maintain coverage, lower premiums, and care for those with preexisting conditions, without mandates. Every Senator should listen to the American people as they ask us to put patients over party, to put the American people over partisanship.

2105,topic-id,1603,"Mr.President, one of the things we are debating right now is, What is the future of the Affordable Care Act or, I should say, healthcare in the United States? One thing we can all agree to is that the individual market under the Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare, as it is commonly called--is not doing well.  I will put up this Facebook post from a constituent in Louisiana named He wrote in to say:       My family plan is $1,700 a month. Me, my wife, and 2      children. The ACA has brought me to my knees.  He doesn't say this, but we know that, most likely, his family deductible is $13,000.       I hope we can get something done. . . . The middle class is      dwindling away. Can everyone just come together and figure      this out?  So his family is putting out $20,000 a year for insurance. They most likely have a $13,000 family deductible. They have two children, a young family, $33,000 of out-of-pocket expenses before they would see significant benefit from their policy. Clearly, we have a problem.  When he was campaigning, Candidate Trump recognized this, and he said over and over that his contract with the voters was to maintain coverage, lower premiums, address and care for those with preexisting conditions, and to eliminate the ObamaCare mandates. This, if you will, was his contract with the voters--a pretty good contract. I think it is something both parties can get behind.  Candidate Trump and then President-elect Trump doubled down on this just before taking the oath of office, saying: ``People covered under the law''--meaning the law that he would support to replace the Affordable Care Act--``can expect to have great healthcare. It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.''  Indeed, the President of the United States seemed, again, to renew this commitment this past week at a lunch with 15 Senators at the White House, once more saying how we have to have a law that lowers premiums and cares for those with preexisting conditions.  That is the baseline. Some would argue, has President Trump committed himself to some right that previously did not exist that all Americans would have healthcare?  I am a physician, a doctor. I worked in a public hospital for the uninsured for so long. I can tell you, Congress created a right to healthcare when it passed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor I think President Clinton was the one who signed it into law. This said that anyone--whether they were a U.citizen or not--could come to an emergency room and receive all the care they needed, and if they could not pay, they would still receive care.  Whenever somebody says ``My gosh, folks don't have a right to healthcare,'' I note that when I was in the emergency room at 2 o'clock in the morning, as long as those emergency door rooms were open, there were people coming through. They would have congestive heart failure, COPD, diabetes out of control, gunshot wounds, or vomiting blood. They could be schizophrenic or a drug overdose. As long as[[Page S3549]]that patient or those patients came through the door, we treated them, and someone paid.  I would say that it is the fiscally conservative way that if Congress is going to say ``My gosh, everybody has a right to healthcare,'' then we should come up with a considered way to pay for it, as opposed to forcing the hospital to shift the cost of this care to other sources--principally, by the way, small businesses paying higher premiums for their employees, higher rates to pay for the uninsured. The fiscally conservative way is ``Let's address these needs.''  As a physician, I will also say that the best business practice ways to address somebody with chronic health conditions is to actually manage the disease. If you have a diabetic who doesn't have insurance, she may come to the hospital once a month with diabetes out of control. You have to start an IV and put her in the hospital, perhaps overnight, sometimes in the hospital for longer. This can cost thousands of dollars. Contrast this with having that patient with a primary care physician so that you can manage her disease. Not only is her health better, but you spend a lot less money.  In fact, the wisest corporations in our country now consider the health of their employees as a cost center. What can we do to have the best outcomes at the lowest price? This is the most fiscally conservative way. I think that is the approach we should take as a country.  This brings us to the next point. How do we achieve that which President Trump suggested, which was that we would maintain coverage, lower premiums, care for those with preexisting conditions, and eliminate mandates in a way that we could achieve it? Some folks say that you cannot achieve this. I disagree with this.  The way to achieve it is to embrace each of President Trump's goals. Susan Collins and four other Senators and I have put forward a bill called the Patient Freedom In the Patient Freedom Act, the approach we take is to first maintain the coverage President Trump spoke of, but we do it by eliminating mandates. We give the States the options of doing something called automatic enrollment. It means it is easy to be enrolled.  On our income taxes, for example, Republicans have always said: We want to make it easy to pay your taxes--not 16 pages of forms that you have to fill out with a CPA and an attorney but, rather, something you can do on one page. We need to make enrollment in insurance easy.  The second thing--if you can expand the enrollment, we can take from what we know works, which is on When someone turns 65, he or she is automatically on They don't have to fill out a bunch of forms online. Rather, they are just on They get a card. Here is your Medicare card. You are in unless you don't want to be.  If you don't want to be, we make it easy to get out. You just call up and say: I don't want to be on And you are not. It turns out that 99 percent of Americans like this simple approach, and they stay on  We could expand coverage and make it simple, still eliminating mandates by giving States the option to say to their residents, you are in unless you are out. We are going to make it simple.  If you are eligible for this credit, you would get the credit. And unless you call us up and say that you don't want it, you would be enrolled in an insurance program.  In this way, we care for those with preexisting conditions. How is that the case? If you have a few sick people in the insurance pool, then the only people whom you can spread that risk among are the few and the sick in the pool. Every year they pay higher and higher premiums.  On the other hand, if you can expand the risk pool to include all the young ``healthies''--the folks who think themselves immortal, who on an average year may only have $500 or $800 worth of healthcare expenses--if you can incorporate all of them in your risk pool, then the expense of the few and the sick is spread out over the many and the healthy. Instead of premiums rising because of one person's illness, premiums hardly budge because the cost of that care is spread over so many.  We call it a risk pool for a reason. If you take a cup of water and you pour it in a large swimming pool, the level of that swimming pool does not change because that big pool absorbs the water. If you take a cup of water and you pour it in a smaller cup of water, it overflows.  We need to make it where it is the former situation--where we have a big risk pool with lots of young, healthy people with whom we can share that risk over the many and not the few. In this way, we can lower premiums.  It was modeled that if we did automatic enrollment in my State, still maintain the enrollment of the older and the sicker who are already in, we would lower premiums by 20 percent. That is the power of giving the States the option to make it simpler for people to be enrolled in their insurance.  The conservative way to approach our healthcare reform is to recognize that President Trump's contract with the voter on the campaign trail is the pathway to achieving his goals. As we do that in a fiscally conservative way, we recognize that we should not move this cost of care off to small businesses. We should go ahead and pay for it. It is fiscally conservative to manage these patients' illnesses, as opposed to have them going to an emergency room every so often for emergency room care.  Lastly, we have to say that if we embrace Republican ideas of making it simpler to be in a plan, as opposed to more complicated, we are more likely to have that risk pool that is inclusive of many who are healthy, not just a few who are sick.

Mr.Chair, our ICBMs are a critical leg of our triad as they provide our commanders with a responsive, flexible, and survivable military response ready 24/7, 365 days a year.  Our ICBM leg of the triad also adds significantly to our deterrence capability by increasing the number of targets our adversaries must hold at risk.  My amendment is a safeguard that prevents any unilateral disarmament that would leave our Nation vulnerable to attack. My amendment does not impact our compliance with the New START, and it does not change our current alert level or require the deployment of any additional ICBMs at this point.

1885,topic-id,1027,"Mr.Chair, since 2001 when we passed the original Authorization for Use of Military Force against al-Qaida and against associated enemies, the nature of the war on terror in which we find ourselves has changed dramatically. We now find ourselves fighting enemies that simply did not exist at the time in areas that nobody in Congress anticipated we would be at war.  This has caused a number of us to have very serious concerns as to whether or not the original Authorization for Use of Military Force is still relevant, and frankly, many of us have concerns that the war-making power of Congress is slipping away from us. Indeed, we find ourselves engaged since that original AUMF in 14 different countries on more than almost 40 different occasions without Congress authorizing the use of force. In our view, a new AUMF is necessary.  However, I also recognize that needs to come through a process. My effort here is to try and set up a process where the administration can participate, we can have an orderly discussion, and the appropriate committees can mark up a new AUMF if Congress, indeed, thinks it does--and again, I think many of us do.  A new AUMF would provide clear authority for ongoing operations against ISIS and other terrorist groups, and it would fulfill the constitutional responsibility of Congress to authorize the use of force. My amendment directs the President to put forward a strategy, an analysis, and a framework that we can actually debate and take action on.  The underlying bill being considered today provides authorization for training and equipping our military. Just as important is the time to debate and deliberate how that military should be used to defeat our enemies.  Recently, in an appearance before the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Secretary Mattis made an appearance, and I actually asked him would it be helpful to have an At that time, he said it absolutely would be helpful.  Our men and women who we have deployed in places, again, that nobody in 2001 thought they would be deployed to, need to know that the Congress of the United States is fully supportive of their deployment.  So this amendment would direct that the President, within 30 days after the passage of the legislation, present to Congress a report that, again, justifies the action, tells us the strategy, lays out the objectives. Within 30 days after that report was received, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense could be called before the relevant committees to actually explain and defend that.  Now, again, in my view, I still think we need a new Authorization for Use of Military Force, but I want to start a process whereby that would begin, and I think this would help us achieve that. If others have an opinion, that is fine too, but I think they would still find the report useful and the testimony invaluable.  Sooner or later, Congress needs to take responsibility. I think with the best will in the world, we have slipped into almost endless warfare in a lot of places that none of us anticipated we would be.                              {time}  1800  Again, these are not actions that I necessarily question, but I think they have not been authorized, not been debated, not been examined, and, frankly, the American people have been denied that debate. Also, frankly, they have been denied the opportunity to hold their Members responsible.  Remember, that original Authorization for Use of Military Force was 2001. Almost 80 percent of the Members of this body have been elected since that original authorization. I think they ought to listen to the debate, and, frankly, their constituents ought to be able to hold them accountable.  So I would urge adoption of the amendment, Mr.Chairman, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, although I will not oppose the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr.Palmer). Without objection, the gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of the Cole amendment. I am a great admirer of the gentleman from We have worked together on several bipartisan letters to Speaker Ryan asking that the Speaker bring to the House floor an AUMF to address the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. I value the gentleman's leadership and desire to find common ground with Members on both sides of the aisle.  But it is frustrating, Mr.Chairman, to know that this amendment was made in order while every other amendment to require the House to take concrete action on these wars were denied their right to debate.  Maybe my good friend from Oklahoma is right and Congress has to take baby steps. It needs yet another report on Afghanistan, Iraq, and Its Committees on Foreign Affairs and Armed Services need to be ordered to hold hearings with the Secretaries of Defense and State to review these matters.  But what then?  According to this amendment, nothing.  Now, I have had my fill of Congress doing nothing. I admire the gentleman from I support his amendment. But I am sick and tired of reports. After 16 years in Afghanistan, we need a debate on the future of U.military engagement there, and we need it now.  The gentleman said ``sooner or later.'' Well, after 16 years, we have already arrived at sooner and later. After[[Page H5807]]6 years of military operations in Iraq and Syria, we need to vote on an AUMF to address the fight against the Islamic State, and we need it now.  How much longer will Congress keep sending our brave servicemen and -women to war while it sits on its hands back here in Washington safe and sound?  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, but I demand that the House Republican leadership find the courage to act on these matters now. Our troops and their families deserve more than silence from a Congress that has no qualms about sending them to war but fails to have the political courage to take a vote.

1888,topic-id,494,"Mr.Chairman, I want to commend both the chairman and the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee for their approach to this problem. It is well known in this body that probably the House Armed Services Committee is the most bipartisan committee that we have. The fact that you have tried in the past and the fact that you are willing to work with us here today is deeply appreciated.  I also thank my friend from Massachusetts, and I want to associate myself with his frustration. He has every right to be frustrated. My friend, the ranking member, is correct. This is a difficult job. It will require bipartisan cooperation and bicameral cooperation.  But isn't that what war is about, to achieve a national consensus?  I think that is exactly what Secretary Mattis was asking for: We will go do any mission that you as the Congress and the administration ask us to do, but give us a clear mission and give us your absolute support in carrying that through.  If we have this debate, there will undoubtedly be dissenting views. That is what democracy is supposed to be about, too. So my friends that would oppose the use of force, for instance, in Afghanistan, that voice ought to be heard and that case ought to be made. Frankly, those of us who are supportive of what we are trying to accomplish against ISIS need to make our case and persuade the majority of this House and of the United States Senate to move forward.  So I take this as the first step on a road. Like my friend, it is a baby step. I would agree with his characterization, but at least it is a step. This couldn't have happened without the cooperation of our leadership in the House and certainly without the help of the chairman and the ranking member of the committee. But, also, it couldn't have happened without the persistence of my friend from We have worked together, and, believe me, that is unusual. We don't agree on a lot of issues, but we respect one another.  This is also a question of congressional authority. I think it is a profoundly important constitutional issue, and I do believe we have inadvertently--because of the difficulty of the task--allowed war-making power to slip away from us. That needs to stop. We are responsible to the American people. The Constitution is very clear about where war-making power lies.  Frankly, it ought to be difficult to go to war. It ought to demand a lot of cooperation. It ought to be something that we think is worth setting aside our differences, working together, because we are asking men and women to risk their lives. We are putting them in harm's way, and they deserve to know that we are 100 percent supporting them.

1890,topic-id,691,"Mr.Chairman, I want to advise my friend that I am prepared to close, although, believe me, I could talk about this a long time.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Chairman, I always enjoy hearing the gentleman talk about this. When we agree on things, it is always pleasant. I commend the gentleman from Oklahoma for this amendment because I think it is important that we move forward, even if it is a small step forward.  As I said initially, I am frustrated. I know Mr.Schiff is frustrated, and a lot of other people are frustrated who had amendments that were perfectly germane to this bill that I think should have been debated and that many of us think they are long overdue.  Mr.Chairman, 16 years in Afghanistan is an awful long time. Some of us fear that these wars are becoming endless. They are essentially on automatic pilot. We don't give the attention that I think is appropriate to what is happening, especially given the fact that so many brave men and women have their lives on the line on behalf of our country.  But beyond that, this AUMF in Afghanistan that has now been going on for 16 years has also been used to justify what we are doing in Syria, what we are doing in Iraq, in Somalia, and I could go on and on. This is ludicrous.                              {time}  1815  As the gentleman from Oklahoma knows, before we began to get sucked in militarily in Syria, some of us tried to have a debate on an AUMF in Syria, because we thought the time to debate an AUMF, the time to debate military action, actually should be before we get involved.  Once we are involved, it is a lot harder to have these debates and to raise the questions that are so important as to whether or not some of these interventions are actually the right thing to do. But we skirted that issue, and we continue to put this on the back burner.  As I said, I have no objection to this amendment. I support this amendment. I just think we are at a point where we should be doing much more. We are much further along than to just require a report or to mandate hearings. I am concerned that after these reports and these hearings are done, then what? The gentleman's amendment doesn't require that Congress take up an AUMF or that we actually have to have a vote in so many days or so many months.  So I look forward to working with the gentleman to make sure that not only are these reports and these hearings conducted as we all want them to be, but to continue to press this leadership to do the right thing: to not give away Congress' constitutional responsibilities and to do what is right by the men and women who sacrifice so much for our country.  There are only a small group of people who are directly impacted by these wars, and that is the men and women who are fighting and their families. The rest of us are asked to do basically nothing. I think that Congress has shirked its responsibility. We can't tolerate that.  I hope there is a big, strong bipartisan, if not unanimous vote, for the gentleman's amendment, but this is just the first teeny step in what we need to do. I promise him that he has my cooperation in any efforts to get it to the point where we actually debate these wars and develop AUMFs where people, as he said, can vote for them or against them.  My view of what we should be doing, I know, is very different from the gentleman from Oklahoma, and perhaps even different from the gentleman from California, but that is the kind of genius and the wonder of this place. We can all have different points of view, and we can even differ, but at the end of the day, the majority decides.

1891,topic-id,793,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I want to begin by associating myself very much with the remarks of my good friend from  Frankly, this is an area where we have found common ground because I think we both deeply revere this institution and, frankly, respect the Constitution of the United  When he says that we have shirked our duty, in my view, we have. I think it is absolutely a fair statement to make. I think the gentleman from Washington is also correct that it is hard. This is a very complex, difficult kind of war. It is a new kind of war, its enemies morphing into different forms and different places.  All that is true, but it doesn't excuse us from the obligation to do our job and give those men and women the assurance that they are acting at the direct request and order of the American people in fulfilling the responsibility we have asked them to take.  It doesn't directly relate to this issue, but I felt very much the same way as my friend did at the time about We stretched the NATO alliances so far to get involved in a country where, in my view, we should have never been involved. More importantly, Libya didn't attack It really didn't make a lot of sense to use that kind of instrument to justify a war.  I aim this at no particular President, either the last one or current one, but, frankly, Presidents don't like Congress very much to tell them what they have to do. They want to be able to do it. Well, I am sorry; the Constitution is very clear about that.  One of the reasons we have a Constitution is because we didn't want to live under a system where it is a monarchy as opposed to a It is part of our duty to keep a check on the extraordinary power that we place in the hands of the Chief Executive of the United States, regardless of who that person is, regardless of what party they represent.  My friend makes a good point when he says sometimes we don't trust one another, or we don't want to give the President too much power. We also[[Page H5809]]don't want to take too much responsibility ourselves, sometimes. For that, we ought to look in the mirror. We ought to be willing to take that awesome responsibility that the Constitution entrusts us with and make the tough decisions that the American people send us here to make. I actually think going through this process will be very good for this institution.  My friend is correct, it is a baby step, and I share his frustration. But I think the current administration deserves a chance to be heard and to present a justification, not just inherit an ongoing conflict.  I think the committee of jurisdiction, the Foreign Affairs Committee, deserves the opportunity to hear this.  My friend expresses a concern which, quite frankly, I share, that we will have a hearing and not much more. That would not be where I would propose that we end. I would hope and would work with my friend to make sure that is not where we end.  I think at the end of the day, whatever the deliberation is, whatever the recommendation is for a new AUMF, it needs to come to this floor, and it needs to be open for full debate. If we can't muster a majority to approve that, then we shouldn't be fighting in the places we are fighting if we are not willing to actually vote and use that.  So I am going to pledge to continue to work with my friend and urge the administration, assuming this actually gets in the final bill, to take it as an opportunity to establish a very clear set of objectives, a very clear strategy, a very clear estimate of the budgetary cost, and a very clear analysis of the legal framework under which they are operating.  I think they, and we, owe that to the country. We certainly owe it to the men and women that we have asked to go and do difficult things and risk their lives on our behalf. They do it willingly.

Corporal Ballard had served with the Delaware State Police for 8\1/2\ years and left behind his wife Louise and his daughter  Delawareans are still grieving for the loss of both of these brave men in the line of duty.  As we recognize the entire law enforcement community from across our country during National Police Week, we should honor their sacrifice by serving them as well as they serve us. This week and every week, we must do everything we can to honor our obligations to fallen heroes and their families.  In the wake of these losses in Delaware, I am committed to continuing to[[Page S2946]]work with my colleagues across the aisle and across the country, like Senators Klobuchar, Cornyn, and Senator Blunt, to make sure our officers have the resources they deserve to do their jobs and to come home safely at the end of every shift. That means continuing to champion programs like the Bulletproof Vest Partnership, which literally saves officers' lives. Delaware knows the importance of this long-running program all too well. Two of our Delaware Capitol Police officers who were shot in the line of duty survived due to bulletproof vests provided through this vital and ongoing Federal-State partnership.  I will also continue to work here in the Senate with colleagues to reform the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program to make sure the families of officers who lose their lives or are permanently disabled in the line of duty receive the benefits they deserve.  Chairman Grassley, who has joined us here on the floor, is one of the lead cosponsors of this bill, along with Senators Hatch, Gillibrand, and Klobuchar--is one of many cosponsors. This is a bill that will take important steps in these reforms, and it is just one step away from passing the Senate, and my understanding is it could head to the House of Representatives as early as later today.  Of course, our commitment to serving the men and women of law enforcement has to extend beyond the patrol car and the police station. Building and maintaining trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve is essential to preventing and reducing crime and keeping officers safe. That is why Senator Blunt and I have both taken steps to encourage the strategy of community policing, which helps officers do their job more effectively in partnership with local communities. We have also continued to support local officials who are working to bring Federal resources, expertise, and convening power to help strengthen the bonds between the police and the communities they serve.  In light of all these important efforts, we can't let ideology or partisan politics in this Chamber prevent us from doing our job in support of law enforcement. We will fail those who serve us if we do so. We have to move forward in a bipartisan way to improve and invest in officer safety. That is why I am proud to stand with my colleague and partner from Missouri as cochairs of the Law Enforcement The mission of this bipartisan group of Senators is simple: to bring law enforcement, community leaders, issue experts, and Republicans and Democrats together to share ideas and generate solutions to challenges facing State and local law enforcement. We have hosted more than a dozen briefings and events.  Now more than ever, Senator Blunt and I are committed to this mission. We are on the floor today to honor women and men, like Corporal Ballard and Lieutenant Floyd from Delaware, who put on the uniform and the badge every day, not knowing whether they will come home at the end of their shift. We are here today for their families, whose sacrifice and burden are heavy.  When I attended Corporal Ballard's moving memorial service earlier this month, the most powerful speaker among many was his widow, She stood up, stood tall, and with a smile on her face thanked the 3,000 officers from 36 States across the country who had come to stand in solemn procession and honor Corporal Ballard's sacrifice and pay their respects.  Louise Ballard said:       This is my Stephen's victory, when I get to see men and      women from all over the country who every single day get up      and do a job. A job that's hard, a job that requires heart.  Few jobs are as hard or require as much heart as patrolling the streets and protecting our communities.  This week, together we honor the service and sacrifice of those law enforcement officers whose names have been added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial this year and the hundreds of thousands, even millions, who even today, even tonight, will be on patrol keeping our communities and our families safe.

I am strongly for missile defense. I just want to make sure that it works. In the National Defense Authorization Act of 2015, there is a strong section in that act that requires that it work.  The gentleman's amendment is not supported by the Missile Defense Agency, it is not supported by the  What it is is a vendor's dream, what it is is a defense contractor's dream, because it would enable them to sell stuff to us, the American taxpayer and to the citizens of this country, promising national defense, but not proving it.  We need to fly it before we buy it. We need to test it before we invest in it. We need to make sure that it works before we fork over the dough.  If this loophole were to be established into law, allowing missiles to be flown through this loophole, it would delight the defense contractor industry. This is an amazing breach of what really, I think, has been American law for 150 years.  Back during the Civil War, there was a law passed called the Lincoln And because so many Americans were outraged that the bullets sold to the Union soldiers did not work and the cannonballs did not work and the boots didn't last in the rain, they passed one of the toughest laws ever passed by this Congress, to penalize defense contractors who sold us stuff that did not work.  We need to make sure these missiles work. The gentleman is absolutely correct. The threat from North Korea is real, the threat one day from Iran could be real. We need to make sure these missiles work. And to short-circuit, to obviate a testing requirement would be an appalling thing for us to do.  This has been law since 2015. It is working, it works fine, the Missile Defense Agency is all for it. Let's keep it. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  And to allow contractors to sell us stuff that is unproven, that is not tested, that has not flown before we buy it, oh, my gosh, I wouldn't want to be on that side of that transaction.

1999,topic-id,771,"Mr.President, I noted yesterday that this week we celebrate National Police In particular, we recognize and remember those law enforcement officers who have paid the ultimate price and sacrificed their lives to protect the communities in which they serve. Yesterday, I had the chance to speak about Javier Vega, Jr., a Border Patrol agent who served in South Texas and was tragically killed by two illegal immigrant criminals.  Today, I want to talk about the attack on law enforcement officers in Dallas almost a year ago. Last July, about 800 people gathered in downtown Dallas for a peaceful march. Given the size of the event, dozens of law enforcement officers were on hand to protect the protesters so they could exercise their fundamental constitutional right. Before 9 p.m., the event had been going very well, by any standard. There wasn't any violence reported in the crowd, even though some similar events across the country hadn't been as calm. But in Dallas, it was clear that there existed a mutual respect between the citizens protesting and law enforcement. There were even social media posts of protesters embracing police officers in a show of solidarity and friendship.  Unfortunately, the night would soon be robbed of any enduring image of that sort of positive scene. A man--someone who came that night explicitly to target law enforcement officers--opened fire, killing five officers and wounding seven more--the deadliest day for American law enforcement since 9/11. The officers who lost their lives that day--Brent Thompson, Patrick Zamarippa, Lorne Aherns, Michael Krol, and Michael Smith--will not be forgotten. They, like the other officers on duty that night--many of whom were injured by the gunmen--didn't look the other way or run the other way when the violence erupted. Like the heroes they are, they ran to the danger, not away from the gunshots and the uproar. They, like law enforcement officers across the country, weren't about to shy away from doing their job, even if that meant putting their own lives on the line.  So today, I want to commend the men and women of the Dallas police force, a group of men and women with incredible courage and unflinching valor in the face of danger. This Police Week I am particularly grateful to them and to the officers and first responders all over the State of Texas and all around our Nation who count the costs and choose to serve their communities day after day, often with little thanks or recognition.  As I said last summer, it shouldn't take an event of this scale to jolt our consciences into action. As legislators, we have tremendous opportunities to better support our men and women in blue who risk their lives to protect ours. We have a duty to do all we can to keep them safe and to keep our society safe and peaceful. So as we celebrate Police Week, I hope we can each do our part to better support the men and women serving in law enforcement.  Later today, Mr.President, I plan to introduce a piece of legislation called the Back the Blue Act, along with Senator Cruz and Senator This is legislation that makes clear our support for these public servants who spend their lives protecting us and serving us. The Back the Blue Act would create a new Federal crime for killing or attempting to kill a Federal judge, a law enforcement officer, or a federally funded public safety officer.[[Page S2941]]It would create a new crime for assaulting a law enforcement officer, as well.  There is no justification--none at all--for attacking a police officer. It is an act of anarchy to attack the very people who help keep our society safe and protected.  We need to know and need to show that we value their lives, and we need to make it absolutely clear that we will hold those who carry out crimes against our police officers accountable. The Back the Blue Act sends that message loud and clear.  I think it is important to point out that this legislation would also help make our communities stronger by allowing grant funds to be used for efforts to help foster more trust between police and the communities they protect. This bill would better serve the men and women who work tirelessly in our communities every day. So I would hope our colleagues would join me in supporting it.  We can do more to protect and support our law enforcement officers, and we can start with the Back the Blue Act to do just exactly that.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Perdue).

2011,topic-id,516,"Mr.President, I am delighted to be here during Police Week, along with our colleagues from Missouri, Delaware, Minnesota, and Iowa to celebrate the men and women in blue who put their lives at risk so that our communities can be safer, more stable, more prosperous places.  I am reflecting this week on the terrible experience in Dallas, TX, about a year ago when Chief David Brown inspired the Nation with his response to the terrible tragedy there that took the lives of five Dallas police officers and injured seven more.  Following the attack, Chief Brown made clear that if you want to see change or if you want to protest law enforcement, why not instead join their ranks and be a part of the solution. I am grateful to him for his encouragement of the young men and women who have many opportunities to serve their communities--many in uniform.  The truth is, we can do a lot of good by inspiring confidence in law enforcement and showing our support for them. We saw what was referred to by the former Director of the FBI as the ``Ferguson effect,'' where, in fact, he said it was his view that many police officers were afraid of being criticized unjustly, so they withheld or were reticent in acting in the face of a criminal activity.  We need to make sure that our law enforcement personnel know we are firmly behind them and we will always support them. As Chief Brown liked to point out, if somebody has crossed a line they should not cross, that is an appropriate subject for disciplinary action on a police force.  There is never any excuse for assaulting a police officer. That is the thin blue line between us and anarchy in our society.  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for working with me on the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee just mentioned. This bill will help State and local law enforcement hire more veterans into their ranks. Obviously, that is relevant experience and training that can help our law enforcement departments across the country be better and take advantage of these great patriots who have now taken off one uniform to put on another.  We know there are places in the country where, despite the best efforts of law enforcement, danger is spiking violent crime rates in some parts of the country due to dangerous criminals like the MS-13 gang, a vicious gang from Central America that is wreaking havoc in parts of the country. We can't let our officers face these dangers without knowing we have their backs.  I am delighted to be here with our colleagues celebrating National Police Week and making it clear to the men and women in blue that we unequivocally support them and stand by them and need to let all of our country men and women know that these are true American heroes who deserve our respect and support every day, not just during Police  I yield to our friend and our colleague from  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-05-16-pt1-PgS2938-3.txt,1692,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,16.0,July

Our law enforcement officers are called to some of the most horrific situations and run into harm's way to protect us and our families every day. Almost a year ago, officers responded to the Pulse nightclub shooting, known now as the site of the deadliest mass shooting in our Nation's history: 49 persons lost their lives that night and more were severely injured.  Imagine the scene as the officers responded. One officer said one thing he will never forget is hearing the sound of the cellphones ringing as loved ones called the victims, but, of course, the victims could not answer.  During the most dangerous and most tragic of circumstances, our law enforcement officers may appear superhuman, but they are only human, and responding to scenes like this--or any other horrific scene--no one can really prepare for that.

2125,topic-id,584,"Mr.Speaker, as so often happens here, this bill bears a somewhat grander title than its contents. Medicare part B certainly does need improvement. While I support putting into statute what is already administrative practice, extending a demonstration project that appears to be working and the other provisions that my colleagues have worked on in this bill, I think much more should have happened.  It is especially ironic that, at the very moment we are considering this bill, the United States Senate across the hall is proposing to eliminate healthcare coverage for millions of Certainly, this Republican repeal effort does far more harm to far more people than we can collectively undo here in the House with this rather modest piece of legislation.  And there is one glaring omission from today's Medicare Improvement Act, one subject that the Republican leadership of the House Ways and Means Committee fears. It fears not only doing something about this problem, it fears about even understanding the extent of the problem, and it certainly fears having any public hearings to explore this subject. That is the menace that is affecting millions of people across this country: pharmaceutical price gouging.  This bill fails to address any aspect of soaring pharmaceutical costs of part B medications. For almost a year, a number of us, House Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee, have called on the chairman to at least schedule a hearing about all aspects, all categories of soaring pharmaceutical prices that not only mean financial ruin for too many families, but also burden Medicare and most any type of taxpayer-financed healthcare initiative.  Government-approved monopolies for drug manufacturers are being exploited by charging the sick and dying whatever they might pay for a little more life, for a little more comfort at monopoly prices.  Under longstanding existing law--it has been there before this Congress ever got together--pharmaceutical companies are at least required to provide average sales price data on part B Medicare drugs. Three years ago, the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services found that at least one-third of the more than 200 manufacturers of part B drugs had not submitted any of this average sales price data for some of their products, and an additional 45 manufacturers had not been required to report any data. The Inspector General found that inaccuracies in these average sales price filings may affect taxpayer-financed Medicare payments.  Last month, the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission came before the House Ways and Means Committee and gave its report on It noted that this problem on average sales price data continues, and that it has not been addressed by Congress, as the Inspector General had recommended.  The Republican majority has refused to do anything about this problem. It has blocked an amendment that I offered in committee that simply implemented the recommendation of the Inspector General and of MedPAC to get that average sales price data and to ensure that all part B manufacturers report that data or are penalized at a reasonable level. It would simply have ensured compliance with existing law to protect program integrity and to protect the taxpayer interest. And you can be sure that if the Republicans didn't want to know what the prices were, they certainly didn't want to do anything about the soaring prices and the impact on American families.  So I support the bill, but this is a missed opportunity that we should have employed to address a critical problem.[[Page H6239]]    ",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgH6233-2.txt,303,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,25.0,July

1997,topic-id,2250,"Mr.President, I had a meeting last week in Illinois, and I asked hospital administrators, doctors, nurses, pediatricians, those who are in the substance abuse treatment area, what they thought of the Republican bill. It was all Republicans who passed the healthcare finance act, whatever the name of it is--their version of the healthcare system that they are calling for reform in the House of It was interesting. They were unanimously opposed to it, all of them--hospital administrators, doctors, nurses, pediatricians, across the board.  Why would all the medical providers in my State be opposed to the Republican plan that just passed the House of Representatives? Well, because they have read it. Here is what they found. It threatens the survival of downstate and inner city hospitals. The Illinois Hospital Association came out against the Republican plan and said we could lose 60,000 jobs in Illinois, and we could see cutbacks in services in our hospitals.  I know the Acting President pro tempore from the State of Oklahoma knows what rural hospitals mean to these small towns. It is not only life and death to have access to quality healthcare, they are some of the best paying jobs in town. The thought that those hospitals are going to see services cut back, people laid off is worth sitting up and taking notice.  They also are worried because the Congressional Budget Office never gave an analysis of the Republican plan that passed the House of That is unheard of. When we passed the Affordable Care Act in the U.Senate, we waited week after weary week for the Congressional Budget Office to analyze each of the major changes. We didn't want to make a mistake, and we felt obligated to tell the American people what we were doing to the healthcare system, which is one-sixth of the national economy.  Somehow the Republican leaders in the House of Representatives paid no attention to that and passed a bill without a Congressional Budget Office analysis. Possibly it is because the first version of that bill, which was analyzed by the CBO, found that it was devastating. Twenty-four million Americans would lose their health insurance under the Republican plan in its first phase. Twenty-four million Americans lose their health insurance.  In Illinois, 1 million people--in a State of 12\1/2\ million people, 1 million people living in my State would have lost their health insurance coverage by the plan proposed initially by the Republicans in the House, and we also know it would shorten the lifespan of Medicare, for one thing. We know it allowed for waivers by Governors to eliminate what they call nonessential services in health insurance.  One of them hits close to home. I can remember as a new Senator coming to the floor and watching Paul Wellstone, who used to be at that desk, and Pete Domenici, who used to be at that desk, get up on a bipartisan basis and argue again and again that every health insurance plan in America should cover mental illness and substance abuse treatment. It seems so obvious, and yet they had to fight the insurance industry for years before we finally achieved it. Now when you buy health insurance in America, it covers mental illness and substance abuse treatment. Thank goodness. We need it. We desperately need it. Yet that becomes one of the nonessential elements in the Republican analysis of health insurance.  What are they thinking? Have they listened or read recently about the opioid and heroin crisis in America? I have sat at tables with victims, addicts who, thank goodness, had an intervention, had an opportunity, and now can speak of their addiction in the past tense.  These are amazing young people whose lives were compromised and threatened because of addiction. How did they turn the corner? They turned the corner because of loving families, their personal determination, and the availability of medical treatment under their health insurance plans.  Now the Republicans are arguing in the House of Representatives that we don't need that coverage, we don't need that protection. We do now more than ever.  When I hear the Republican leader come to the floor and criticize the Affordable Care Act, I basically have to ask him, Is this a problem that is of your own creation?  The Republicans, including the leader, have refused to sit down with Democrats and work on a bipartisan solution. In fact, when the Republican leader sat down to determine how the Senate would respond to the House action, he put together a group of, I believe, 12 Republican Senators--no Democrats allowed--to sit down and write the alternative. That is not a good way to start this.  What we ought to do is to say, first, we are not going to repeal the Affordable Care Act; we are going to improve it, and we will do it on a bipartisan basis. If the majority leader wants to suggest that, I would like to be part of it. Many Democrats would like to be part of it. Take repeal off the table before the conversation on repair begins. I think that is essential. Let's make sure that within health insurance in America we have some basics.  First, if you have a preexisting condition, you shouldn't be disqualified from[[Page S2939]]health insurance or you shouldn't have to pay twice the premiums. That is something that is now built into the law that the Republicans want to repeal. Well, I want to make sure that preexisting conditions are protected.  As I have said on the floor before, a couple of weeks ago I had a heart procedure, a catheter procedure, an outpatient procedure. Apparently it worked pretty well. I am standing here talking to you today. I feel good. But a lot of people go through this, and I became a statistic the day that happened. I guess I now have a preexisting condition; so be it. One out of three Americans fit that category. Why would we not protect them in any health insurance reform bill? That seems like the starting point in our conversation. Yet the bill that passed the House, the Republican bill that passed the House allows Governors to basically ask for waivers so that health insurance plans in their States will not cover people with preexisting conditions or allow people with those conditions to have the same premiums. That is not a good starting place. It is a terrible starting place.  Let's try to make sure that if we are going to move forward on real healthcare reform, we do it in a sensible fashion. Let's put forward a bill not like the one that passed the House, but let's put together a bill that has the support of hospital administrators across the Let's put together a bill that protects the Medicaid expansion that is part of the Affordable Care  Medicaid is an essential part of healthcare in America for tens of millions of people. Medicaid--most people think, oh, that is health insurance for poor people. Really? That is not an accurate description. For example, in the State of Illinois, Medicaid provides health coverage for half of the children who are born in my State--prenatal care, postnatal care, and the actual delivery of half of the children in my State, under  That is not the most expensive part of The most expensive part in my State and across the Nation is the fact that Medicaid is there to help your mother or grandmother or your dad or your grandfather when they are in a situation in life where they need a helping hand. They may be in an assisted care facility, and the Social Security check is not enough; Medicare is not enough. Medicaid steps in to make sure they have the quality of care they need. Are we going to eliminate that kind of protection?  Ask disabled people and ask the organizations that represent them what it means to have a good strong Medicaid system. These people rely on Medicaid for maintaining their health through disability, day in and day out.  So when the Republicans propose an $840 billion cut in Medicaid protection across America over 10 years, sadly, they are setting out on a path that could compromise the basic care we need for babies and new moms, for the elderly in assisted care facilities and nursing facilities, and for the disabled who live in our We don't want to see that happen.  It is interesting that my Republican Governor in the State of Illinois seldom comments on Federal legislation. He came out in opposition to the bill that passed the House of He said that this is a significantly bad bill for the State of Illinois, and I agree with him. I am glad he spoke up. I don't know how the seven Republican Congressmen who voted for it in my State can ignore that reality. Our Governor--our Republican Governor--believes it is bad for our State in cutting back The hospitals believe it is bad for our State in the impact that it will have on down-State hospitals. Doctors, nurses, and pediatricians also oppose it.  What can we do? What should we do? First, we ought to try to see what we can do to make the Affordable Care Act work better. We can do that on a bipartisan basis. We want to make sure, as the Senator from Kentucky said earlier, that there are available health insurance programs in every county of every Certainly, one thing we can do is make sure that a public option is there for everyone if they choose it--something that looks like  People respect Medicare is a great program for millions of Americans who are seniors and disabled. Why wouldn't we create a program like Medicare--a not-for-profit, government-operated program like Medicare for people who wish to have it? Those who don't can stick with private insurance if that is their choice, but I believe more and more people will move toward the Medicare option. That is something I would like to put on the table in reforming the Affordable Care  Secondly, we need to address the cost of pharmaceutical drugs in The costs are out of control.  This week I received a publication from the AARP, the American Association of Retired Persons, and they are talking about what is happening to pharmaceutical prices across You don't have to tell seniors or those who buy prescription drugs what the reality happens to be.  Let me give you a few numbers to demonstrate why we need to have a new program to make sure drug prices don't go out of control. According to AARP, Americans spent $457 billion on prescription drugs in 2015, up about 8 percent over the previous year--$457 billion. The rise in prices for the most popular brand name drugs from 2008 to 2016 is over 200 percent. They have more than doubled in that 8-year period of time for the most popular drugs.  The median salary of a pharmaceutical firm's CEO in 2015 was $14.5 million, more than any other industry; $6.4 billion is the amount drug companies spend advertising directly to consumers in the U.annually; $24 billion is the amount drug companies spend per year marketing to doctors. We are one of only two nations in the world that allows direct consumer advertising. Think about what that means.  When you see all these ads on television for drugs with names you can't pronounce, why are they doing it? It is because the drug companies know that consumers across America will write down the name of the drug and go ask the doctor to prescribe it. Many times, the doctor, rather than debate the issue with the patient or suggest they don't need it or should use a generic, will just write out the prescription. What happens? More expensive drugs get into the system, raising the cost of healthcare, raising the cost of premiums for health insurance. It doesn't make us healthier; it just means healthcare is more expensive.  I love to listen to the warnings on these drugs that go on and on and on. One of my favorites was this: Be sure and tell your doctor if you have had a liver transplant. I am thinking to myself, yeah, I think I would probably mention that somewhere along the way to a doctor.  These warnings should give us fair warning that this is inflating the cost of healthcare across It is not making us healthier, and it is running up profits dramatically for pharmaceutical companies. Why is it that exactly the same drugs made in the United States sell for a fraction of their cost in America in places like Canada and Europe? It is a legitimate question. We ought to address it. Do we have the political nerve to do it? I hope so, as part of the Affordable Care Act reform. I hope we sit down and do something on a bipartisan basis to deal with the challenges we face, but first, take repeal off the table.  Let's make the Affordable Care Act stronger. Let's do it on a bipartisan basis. Let's set out to come up with a solution that doesn't do what the House version did, which could eliminate health insurance for millions of people across America and a million people in my State of  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

He originally planned on stepping down in 2019 at the end of his contract, but always putting DePaul first, he decided that wouldn't fit with the university's planning cycle. After leading the university through two successful strategic plans, he said, ``It's best for DePaul if I step aside in the summer of 2017 so that a new leader can assist the institution to name and ambitiously pursue its next set of strategic objectives.''

This month is National Dairy In fact, considering the amount of milk and other dairy products we consume on a daily basis in the United States and beyond, one could argue that we already remember and recognize our dairy farmers every day.  In Minnesota, our dairy farmers produce nearly 10 billion pounds of milk each year. Our dairy farmers, along with their industry colleagues across the country, not only bring billions of dollars to our economy, they are vital to a strong and healthy population.  Our dairy farmers work extremely hard. Many, in addition to their dairy operation, have to maintain a job off the farm to make ends meet.  So, during National Dairy Month, when you drink a glass of milk, have a milk-filled bowl of cereal, eat a piece of cheese or that cup of yogurt, let's stop and remember the hardworking men and women of our dairy industry and their importance to our economy and their commitment to our health.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-06-pt1-PgH4627-6.txt,2253,1745,2017.0,6.0,July

Early denizens worked primarily in local coal mines, many of which closed by the late 1940s. Urbandale was also a so-called street car suburb, where residents could commute to their jobs in the city--Des Moines--via a street car on the Urbandale Line until they were replaced by buses in the early 1950s. Over the years, the community saw homes go up, restaurants and business flourish, and people from all corners of the world pass through, from Presidential candidates to Pope John Paul II, who held mass at Living History Farms in 1979. Urbandale is one of those quintessential Iowa towns where you would want to raise a family. Though the community had only 298 residents in the 1920s, today over 40,000 people call Urbandale home.

1868,topic-id,333,"Mr.President, today Senators Heller, Bennet, Gardner, and I are introducing the Water Conservation Tax Parity This bill would exempt the value of residential water conservation and storm water runoff management rebates from gross income calculations.  California and the western States have been facing a severe drought. Some public utilities, state and local governments, and water management providers offer programs to promote water conservation and storm water management by providing subsidies. These programs help stimulate responsible water use; however, residential participation is essential to their success.  For example, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California has offered a rebate program to encourage residents to replace turf with more water-responsible landscapes. More than 23,000 households have benefited from the turf removal rebates, and the average rebate per household covers 1,500 square feet or about $3,000, which covers about half of the cost to the resident.  Section 136 of the Internal Revenue Code already exempts energy conservation rebates from inclusion in gross income. However, there is no Federal exemption for water conservation or storm water management measures, which may undermine incentives for participation in these programs. These programs are just as valuable as energy conservation programs and should be treated equally in the tax code. This bill would simply exempt water conservation and storm water management rebates from being included in gross income and would be retroactive to 2015. This would maintain the important incentives for resident participation in critical water conservation measures.  This bill is supported by a coalition of organizations and public utilities, including the Western Urban Water Coalition, Alliance for Water Efficiency, American Water Works Association, National Association of Water Companies, U.Water Alliance, Association of Water Agencies, WaterNow Alliance, Western Coalition of Arid States, and National Water Resources This bill is crucial to ensuring residents continue participating in water conservation and storm water management programs.

We ask these brave men and women to uphold the law, but so often this seemingly straightforward mandate sends them into the most difficult and tragic situations that our society faces: terrible accidents, domestic disputes, and the strife that threatens the hearts of our towns and communities. Their bravery and courage is unimaginable to someone like me. The complexity of their jobs and the tolls that it takes on their lives is often underestimated.  Having a safe community offers our citizens more than just peace of mind. It offers them a place to live, grow their businesses, provide a living for their family, and to be not only economically secure but socially secure. Law enforcement officers play a very critical role in community development.  Each generation of our law enforcement community evolves as society changes and their technology and training improve. This allows them to police our communities more responsibly, effectively, and sometimes even to right wrongs of the past generation.

I have heard from Arizonans across the State who work in a multitude of industries--from dairy farmers to call center employees--and the responses I have received are overwhelmingly positive. For example, Matt Mandel, who serves as chief operating officer for SunFed, a company based in Rio Rico, shared his personal story.  Matt wrote:       Fresh produce trade has kept my family working here in the      State of Arizona for three generations.

Other comments I have received through my website include statements like ``I have enjoyed a constant supply of fresh fruits and vegetables in these years of I have also noticed . . . how relatively inexpensive many household items have been since'' and ``We supply parts that cross the border multiple times before they reach final assembly in the U.Free trade is vital to our success and the success of our customers who not only get us where we need to go but protect our shores and vital interests.''  The Arizona Chamber of Commerce noted in its comments on NAFTA:       Agreement is central to the State's economic prosperity.  The NAFTA agreement, that is.       Mexico is Arizona's leading trade partner. Canada is the      State's second leading trade partner.  In an interview focused on the NAFTA renegotiation process, the CEO of Arizona's Hispanic chamber stated: ``We know that Mexican nationals spend over a billion dollars a year in just Pima County.'' That is just one county.  It is hardly surprising to hear such overwhelmingly positive support for NAFTA, considering the benefits it has had on Arizona's economy.  NAFTA 4 AZ has helped to put on paper what Arizonans know all too well: NAFTA plays a critical role in supporting jobs, opportunity, and economic growth. It has been great to hear from people all over the State talking about how NAFTA has helped them and asking the administration to modernize NAFTA, not to end it.  NAFTA 4 AZ submissions, as well as comments submitted to the USTR from Arizona stakeholders, share one common plea: Do not harm the trilateral structure and the reciprocal market access of  Earlier this week the Office of the U.Trade Representative made public its negotiating objectives for Based on what the USTR released, it appears the administration has recognized the importance of this central tenet of I am pleased that it appears that the administration will seek to modernize NAFTA along the well-worn lines of what was negotiated for the now defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership  I think we can all agree that addressing the issues of digital trade and intellectual property in the agreement, which is more than 20 years old, is the key to NAFTA's continued success.

2024,topic-id,829,"Mr.Speaker, as a candidate, Donald Trump made some very big promises on healthcare to the American people. GOP leadership in both the House and Senate have echoed those promises. But the Trump-Ryan healthcare bill and the Senate version of the GOP bill fail to deliver on those promises.  Donald Trump promised healthcare for all of the American people. Even though the ACA expanded health coverage to more than 20 million Americans, Donald Trump said he didn't[[Page H5188]]think it provided enough people with coverage. He said: ``We're going to have insurance for everybody,'' and, ``I'm not going to leave the lower 20 percent that can't afford insurance.''  The Congressional Budget Office says that 14 million people will immediately lose coverage under the Trump-Ryan plan, and 24 million people will lose coverage by 2027. The Senate version of the bill isn't much different.  Trump also promised that Americans would enjoy cheaper health insurance, with ``much lower deductibles.'' His Health and Human Services Secretary, Tom Price, said that ``nobody will be worse off financially.'' But the GOP healthcare plan would cause an increase in health premiums by 15 to 20 percent in the first 2 years alone, according to the Congressional Budget  During the Republican Presidential primary, Donald Trump bragged that he was ``the first and only potential GOP candidate to state that there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.'' But the GOP health plan guts Medicaid more than ever before. It freezes enrollment and unravels the Medicaid expansion.  Donald Trump and the GOP leadership are breaking their promises to the American people. Their healthcare bills take away coverage from millions. Deductibles will go up. Copays will go up.  TrumpCare would gut essential health benefits, which would mean soaring costs for people with preexisting conditions. It will provide worse coverage to those lucky enough to still be able to afford it. And to what end?  They are stripping healthcare from millions of people in order to give a tax cut to the wealthiest Americans who need it the least. They are lining the pockets of the rich while leaving our families out to dry.  The GOP wants to take away healthcare coverage from millions of hardworking Americans who just want to feel secure and know that they and their families will be able to see a doctor and get treated if they get sick, without putting themselves or their families in financial ruin. They are robbing Peter to give Paul Ryan and his cronies a tax cut.  In Arizona, we have seen firsthand the damage that Medicaid cuts can wreak. In 2011, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer cut Arizona's Medicaid funding and froze enrollment. Families who were on Medicaid at the time could only continue to receive benefits if their income remained below the Federal poverty level. A family who worked hard to raise their income even the tiniest amount above the poverty line would lose Medicaid coverage permanently, even if their income went down later.  About 150,000 adults in Arizona lost their Medicaid as a result of those changes. People would get sick and be unable to see a doctor just because they couldn't afford it. In some cases, people were forced to decide between paying for lifesaving care or paying their rent.  If Medicaid expansion goes away under the GOP healthcare plan, around 400,000 Arizonans could lose coverage, according to AHCCCS in That includes 26,700 cancer patients and about 47,000 who are working to overcome different levels of substance abuse, including opioid treatment. People in other States across the country would experience similar devastating outcomes.  Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake witnessed the disastrous effect of taking away healthcare coverage for people in They know more than anyone else how many lives can be ruined.  Some Republicans have already voiced strong concerns about this bill's impact on their constituents. If they are serious about these concerns, it will only take three Republican Senators to take a stand and grind this process to a halt. Unfortunately, so far, Senators McCain and Flake are not among them.  Senators McCain and Flake face a very stark choice: they can do the bidding of Donald Trump and deprive millions of healthcare coverage, or they can take steps to defend the health and financial security of the Arizonans they were elected to represent.  The people of Arizona haven't been shy about letting our Senators know how they feel and why they feel it, but it is time to dial up the pressure. Senators McCain and Flake must understand that they owe it to Arizona families to vote ``no'' on If they don't, Arizona will hold them accountable.  It is time for my colleagues in the House to put pressure on the Senators in their own States to do the right thing and vote ``no'' on this bill.

The Preamble to the United States Constitution stated that its purpose was, in part, to ``establish justice'' and ``insure domestic tranquility.''

They patrol late at night and early in the morning, while we sleep in the comforts of our homes.  And over the past 16 years, our Nation's law enforcement officers have often been the first to respond to terrorist attacks. On that fateful day, nearly 16 years ago, first responders were running into the crumbling towers as everyone else was running out. Following the Boston Marathon bombings in April of 2013, Boston police responded immediately to aid the wounded and implement emergency plans. That legacy has carried on through the recent catastrophes in San Bernardino, Orlando, and too many others.  Sadly, many law enforcement officers have made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf. Just this year already, 50 law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty, including Deputy Sheriff Curtis Allen Bartlett of Carroll County, Virginia, who was killed in a vehicle crash while responding to assist another deputy and a Virginia State Police trooper who were involved in a pursuit.

2155,topic-id,1197,"Thank you, I want to start by thanking you for your service as a law enforcement officer and in And I call you sheriff when I pass by you because I always believe in calling people by their highest title. And as much as it is wonderful, and I am sure the people in your family are proud of your service in the United States Congress, I am proudest of your willingness to sacrifice for the people of Washington as their sheriff.  Kevin Carper was a uniform patrol officer with the Spartanburg County Sheriff's He was not a detective. He was not in management. He was just a regular police officer like the ones we see every day in our towns and cities.  Kevin responded to a domestic violence call. Those who are unfamiliar with law enforcement have a tendency sometimes to refer to those as routine calls. There is nothing routine about a domestic violence call, and everyone in law enforcement knows it.  Off of Airport Road in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Kevin and his partner arrived to find William Seich on the front porch of his small home pointing a large caliber gun at his wife,  Judy was crouched down in the front yard, trying to protect herself, trying to shield herself behind a tree, and William was pointing the gun at her and, alternatively, pointing the gun at law enforcement who had just arrived on the scene.  You know, Sheriff Reichert and Mr.Speaker, it all seems so easy in hindsight. Do you shoot? Do you pull the trigger? Is the gun real? You have split seconds to make these decisions only to have them second-guessed for months, if not years afterward. Is the gun real? Is it loaded?  William Seich finally turned the gun toward his wife and he shot her. As he was turning the gun towards law enforcement, no doubt to shoot them, they returned fire. They struck William As one officer ran toward his fallen wife, Judy, Kevin Carper ran to the front porch to make sure that William Seich didn't shoot anybody else.  As he got on the front porch, Mr.Speaker, he heard the cries of children. Unbeknownst to Kevin and his partner, there were children inside that mobile home, and the bullets from one of the officer's guns had struck one of the children.  William Seich survived and was charged with murder. Both of the little girls ultimately survived, although one was badly injured.  I met Kevin when we were preparing for trial. He was an essential witness, so I needed to prepare him for what would come during this trial. He would be second-guessed. His every move would be scrutinized. In a very real sense, he would not only be blamed for Judy Seich's murder, he would be blamed for shooting one of the little girls inside that home, and then he would be blamed for not doing enough to protect Judy Seich, not making the right split-second decision.  I tried to prepare Kevin for what would be a grueling cross-examination, and it was clear to me his mind and heart were somewhere else. So, finally, I said: Kevin, you didn't do anything wrong. You didn't have a choice.  He said: I know, Solicitor  He had tears streaming down his face in my office.  He said: I know, Solicitor Gowdy, but I shot that little girl.  Objectively, Kevin Carper did everything right that night. He responded to an incredibly tense domestic call. He was confronted with a man holding a gun. Was it a real gun? Was it loaded? All of these thoughts going through his mind; and as soon as William Seich shot and murdered his wife, he returned fire.  Objectively, we know everything he did was right, but it didn't matter how many times I told Kevin: You did the right thing. Deputy Kevin Carper heard me. Father, husband, Kevin Carper had tears streaming down his face at the thought that he would have hurt a child.  Well, we went through the trial, and he was, as you might imagine, an indispensable witness.  Mr.Speaker, he could not have done a better job in that murder trial. Yeah, he was a tough police officer in a uniform, but when it came time to describe walking on the front porch and hearing the cries of children, he became a husband and a father again, and in front of a jury, Sheriff--and you know this is hard for police to do in front of a jury--this tough, brave man broke down in tears, and the jury had a chance to see the humanity of police officers. The jury had a chance to see that ``protect and serve and defend'' part of police officers.  William Seich was convicted, in no small part, because of Kevin Carper's help. In South Carolina, the sentencing takes place immediately after the trial, so there was family to talk to and to prepare them for the sentencing hearing so they could allocute on what Judy Seich's life meant to them and what the proper punishment should be.  Mr.Speaker and Sheriff Reichert, I wanted to tell Kevin what a great job he had done. I wanted to tell Kevin how impressed I was with his humanity. I wanted to tell Kevin--I intended to tell Kevin that he took a cynical old prosecutor and he made him believe again that there are women and men who go into this line of work for all the right reasons. That is what I intended to tell[[Page H4299]]him. But in the hustle and bustle of sentencing, he slipped out the back of the courtroom and we went on with the sentencing hearing.  But I knew that I would see him again and I would have a chance to tell him. I would have a chance to tell his boss: You need to watch that guy, make him a homicide detective. He is really good.  I would have a chance to tell him he did great by those little girls. I knew I would see him again and I would have a chance to tell him again.  And I did see him again, laying beside a roadside, shot to death during a routine traffic stop. He was shot by a man who had been arrested more than 30 times.  If you have ever attended an officer's funeral, the finality of that death hits you the very hardest at the end where they do the radio call: Deputy Kevin Carper, do you read? Deputy Kevin Carper, can you hear us? And, of course, there is silence. And then at the end, it is: Deputy Kevin Carper, you are clear to go home.  I never told Kevin what I should have told him. Deputy Kevin Carper, you were a credit to law enforcement. Husband, father, Kevin Carper, you are a credit to humanity and your family. I wish I had told you when I should have told you.  I hope that all of my other friends in prosecution and in law enforcement now will not wait too long to tell the men and women of law enforcement how grateful they are for their service.

2009,topic-id,835,"Mr.President, I thank my colleagues from Missouri and Delaware for leading this effort to honor our law enforcement officers and particularly those who have been killed in the line of duty.  In 1962, Congress passed a joint resolution proclaiming the week of May 15 as ``National Police Week.''  The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, located here in Washington, DC, is our country's monument to these fallen officers. Carved into the marble walls of the memorial are the names of the more than 20,000 officers killed in the line of duty throughout our Nation's history. Every year, tens of thousands of fellow officers from around the world come to Washington, DC, as part of Police Week to pay tribute to the men and women whose names are inscribed on this wall.  The planned events surrounding Police Week began with the 36th Annual National Peace Officers' Memorial Service, held on the west front of the U.The President of the United States was the keynote speaker, and his presence was a testament to the fraternity of this noble profession. Immediately following the service, there was a wreath-laying at the National Law Enforcement Officers The annual memorial service is an opportunity for all Americans to reflect on the dedication of these public servants and the ultimate sacrifice they have paid for this great  We should also acknowledge the families of the fallen, whose lives have been forever changed by the loss of their loved ones.  During the memorial service, there was a Roll Call of Heroes for the 143 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty last year. Their names will adorn the memorial walls in perpetuity. The list of the fallen include five of my fellow Iowans: Sergeant Anthony Davis Beminio of the Des Moines Police Department; Officer Susan Louise Farrell of the Des Moines Police Department; Patrolman Justin Scott Martin of the Urbandale Police Department; Sergeant Shawn Glenn Miller of the West Des Moines Police Department; and Officer Carlos Bernabe Puente-Morales of the Des Moines Police  We honor these great heroes for laying down their lives to protect their communities in There is no year in recent memory in which so many Iowans have lost their lives in the line of duty.  I would like to specifically address the ambush-style killing of Sergeant Beminio and Officer These officers were heinously murdered by the same perpetrator on the same night while they sat in their patrol cars. While the exact motive of the killer is unknown, he nevertheless sought out these brave men and gunned them down in cold blood.  These ambush-style attacks have become more prevalent since the incidents in Dallas, TX, and Baton Rouge, LA, spanning 10 days last According to a report by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, there were a total of 21 officers killed in ambush-style attacks just last year--the highest total in two decades.  There has been much vitriol written and directed toward law enforcement over the last few years. The notion that the actions of a few bad individuals implicate the entire profession may still, unfortunately, endanger public servants in the area of law enforcement.  This sort of rush to judgment against all law enforcement officers ought to end and end right now. The men and women of law enforcement make great sacrifices every day to protect our families and, of course, all of our fellow citizens. They do so freely, not out of a sense of obligation but because they are dedicated to the cause of justice.  Their devotion merits our attention, admiration, and we are deeply indebted to them. This is why today I am submitting a bipartisan resolution to commemorate Police Week and honor those who have given their lives in this pursuit. I thank my colleagues in the Senate who have cosponsored this resolution with me.  I call on all Americans to remember the fallen and pay tribute to the sacrifices they have made. To quote the motto of the Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary: ``Never Let Them Walk Alone.''[[Page S2947]]  I hope that during Police Week, the Senate will pass my legislation to reform the operations of the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Delays in the award of benefits to the families of fallen officers have become intolerable, and those families deserve to know the status of their applications during the process.

The second makes an allowable use of COPS grants for recruiting and promoting of military veterans as police officers.

1969,topic-id,946,"Madam President, it is unconscionable that the U.Senate will soon be voting on a measure that would force between 22 and 32 million people to lose their health insurance. This vote is particularly unconscionable when you consider that each Member of this Chamber has high quality health insurance that will be there whenever we need it--and we all will, as I recently found out.  I know as well as anyone that we are all one diagnosis away from a serious illness. When I was diagnosed with kidney cancer not too long ago, I had the peace of mind of knowing that I was covered and that insurance would make the cost of treating my illness more manageable. Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have found comfort in having high quality health insurance as they confront serious illnesses and injuries of their own.  Every American deserves that same peace of mind. That is why I am fighting for universal healthcare that is a right for every American, not a privilege reserved only for those who can afford it. This is something we can and should be working on in a bipartisan fashion. There are a lot of great ideas we could be debating and considering to move us toward this bipartisan goal.  Instead, the majority leader and his allies are forcing a vote on TrumpCare, a mean, ugly bill that will deprive tens of millions of people across our country of the healthcare they deserve.  Although some have argued over the past week that this vote is doomed to fail, we can't be complacent. We have to keep fighting because if TrumpCare becomes the law of the land, it would be devastating for tens of millions of people across the country, harming the poorest, sickest, and oldest members of our society. It would undermine protections for Americans living with serious and chronic conditions, who could face a reimposition of yearly and lifetime caps on their care. It would impose an age tax on people 50 to 64 years old, which would allow insurance companies to charge them up to five times more for insurance because of their age. I could go on.  For hundreds of thousands of people in Hawaii and tens of millions more across the country, TrumpCare is not an abstract proposal that would have no relevance to their lives. I have heard literally from tens of thousands of people from across Hawaii about the devastating consequences TrumpCare would have on their lives. Hawaii is a small To think that literally over 20,000 people in Hawaii have contacted my office to tell me the devastation that TrumpCare will bring to their lives--this is because insurance is personal.

Keith's brother, Lester, after working as a custodian for more than 40 years at Anthony School, lost his job and his health insurance. Only a few short months later, Lester had a debilitating stroke that left him permanently disabled. Fortunately, Keith's brother was able to obtain Medicaid coverage and is now a long-term resident at Hale Makua Health Services on Maui, where nearly 80 percent of all patients and residents rely on Medicaid to pay for their necessary care.  Keith was very clear about what would happen if TrumpCare succeeded in making large cuts to  I quote Keith:       It would be devastating.

I don't know what      we would do, where we would be able to move him to.  Alvin, another resident at Hale Makua, was paralyzed in a car accident in 2006. Alvin lived with his aunt and uncle for a short time after his accident, but the complexity of his care was too much for them to handle on their own. Alvin has lived at Hale Makua for almost 11 years now. He gets daily physical therapy and receives the supportive, life-sustaining care he needs. He would not be able to afford to live at Hale Makua without support from  When asked, Alvin had a simple message for people in Washington, DC, who are trying to make huge cuts to  I quote Alvin:       I'm not a politician, but I know that these programs really      help those who are in need.

Let me remind my colleague from Arizona that our country was founded on the principle of religious liberty, and the First Amendment guarantees that right.  In calling for a strategic assessment, this amendment tramples on our Constitution's separation of religion and State, singles out the Muslim religion, its practices and leaders, and it does nothing to keep our Nation safe. In fact, fear-mongering undermines trust and national security, and pits neighbor against neighbor, community against community, and is an insult to our American Muslim communities.  This amendment doesn't even apply its arbitrary surveillance equally, because if it did, it would include assessments of White supremacist terrorism or terrorism committed against abortion clinics and doctors.  Mr.Chairman, our fight against terrorism is not against any religion. It is against the acts that are committed and those who commit the acts. It violates our Constitution and runs counter to who we are as a nation.  Frankly, it is horrifying, and I urge my colleagues to resoundingly oppose it.

2012,topic-id,724,"Mr.President, I rise with my colleagues today in recognition of Police I thank Senator Blunt and Senator Coons for bringing us together, as well as Senator Grassley and Senator  Law enforcement officers play a critical role in keeping our communities safe, and Police Week is all about honoring their dedication and sacrifice and, sadly for so many families, those officers who made the ultimate sacrifice. Our officers are on the frontlines of public safety, and while most people run away from crime scenes or run away from disaster, they run bravely toward it.  In my State, we were reminded all too well of the courageous dedication of law enforcement just this last year when Jason Falconer, an off-duty police officer at a shopping mall spending his free time on his own, encountered a horrific scene of a man unhinged who was stabbing people in the Cloud shopping mall. Falconer didn't even pause. He made sure that he saved the people who were wounded; 10 were wounded that day. So many would have been killed if he had not intervened--an off-duty officer.  I think about Officer Shawn Schneider, who is no longer with us, in Lake City, I met with his family several times. This was a brave officer, a popular officer in a small community. One night he was called to the scene of a domestic abuse case. A young woman, scared, had called. He showed up at the door, and a man unhinged opened the door and shot and killed that officer.  The story behind that officer and the people behind that officer are the ones who carry on his memory--his fellow officers, as we see this week during Police Week, his family, his widow, and their three children. I will never forget sitting in the pews of that church and hearing the story as those three little kids walked down the aisle. There were two young boys and a girl in a blue dress covered in stars. The story was that the last time the family had been in that church and the last time those children had been in that church was for the church nativity play, and their dad, Officer Schneider, was sitting there watching them with such pride. A few weeks later, there they were at his funeral.  Those are the people we remember during this important week. Our job as U.Senators is to treat them in the way that they treat their jobs. They go to work every day without fear or favor. That is what we have to do when we think about police officers.  There are issues, as Senator Coons mentioned, we need to work on--policies and the relationship between officers and our communities. We have to promote more community policing, more training, more recruiting. That is why I am very positive about these bills--the COPS bill I have with Senator Murkowski, where we finally have bipartisan sponsorship for grants that have now helped to place approximately 129,000 police officers on the beat in more than 13,000 State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies.  In that community I mentioned, Cloud, are the recipients of some of the grants we are talking about. That is why Senator Murkowski and I are taking on this issue, to make sure that this program continues to be funded and that, in fact, we reinforce the program.  The bill Senator Cornyn just mentioned that we are leading together to promote the hiring of veterans as law enforcement officers would encourage local police departments to hire and train veterans as cops while providing our veterans with the opportunity to continue to serve their communities.  Yes, we can do all we can to have the backs of our officers and to work with them and our communities, but what we are doing this week is something a little different. We honor them. We recognize their sacrifices, whether it is taking dangerous criminals off the[[Page S2948]]street, whether it is preventing extremist groups from recruiting people in our neighborhoods, whether it is fighting the opioid abuse epidemic, whether it is simply giving a kid a second chance--and they do those kinds of things all the time.  Law enforcement officers are doing some of the hardest and most important work out there. We owe our safety to them, and we thank them for their remarkable service.

2019,topic-id,1081,"Mr.President, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC has as its newest treasure, the National Museum of African American History and It is the work of many and would not be there without its founding director, Lonnie Bunch  I know as a member of the Smithsonian board of regents that Bunch is the single most important person bringing about this magnificent museum and one which will speak to the history of African Americans in this country more than anything else.  We all know that history has seen an enormous amount of pain caused by violence and deaths resulting from racism in When you come into that moving museum, as I have many times, the last thing you would expect is someone who would leave the ultimate symbol of racism, a noose, hanging in it. I know the dismay felt by people of all races when it was found, but probably what has helped the healing the most is the op-ed of June 23, 2017, in the New York Times, written by my friend, Lonnie  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the op-ed, so that all can see it and so that it will be part of the history of the U. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, June 23, 2017]         A Noose at the Smithsonian Brings History Back to Life                        (By Lonnie Bunch III)       The person who recently left a noose at the National Museum      of African American History and Culture clearly intended to      intimidate, by deploying one of the most feared symbols in      American racial history. Instead, the vandal unintentionally      offered a contemporary reminder of one theme of the black      experience in America: We continue to believe in the      potential of a country that has not always believed in us,      and we do this against incredible odds.       The noose--the second of three left on the National Mall in      recent weeks--was found late in May in an exhibition that      chronicles America's evolution from the era of Jim Crow      through the civil rights movement. Visitors discovered it on      the floor in front of a display of artifacts from the Ku Klux      Klan, as well as objects belonging to African-American      soldiers who fought during World War Though these soldiers      fought for democracy abroad, they found little when they      returned home.       That display, like the museum as a whole, powerfully      juxtaposes two visions of America: one shaped by racism,      violence and terror, and one shaped by a belief in an America      where freedom and fairness reign. I see the nooses as      evidence that those visions continue to battle in 2017 and      that the struggle for the soul of America continues to this      very day.       The people responsible knew that their acts would not be      taken lightly. A noose is a symbol of the racial violence and      terror that African-Americans have confronted throughout      American history and of the intensity of resistance we've      faced to any measure of racial equality. During slavery, one      of the main purposes of lynching was to deter the enslaved      from escaping to freedom. But lynching did not end with      slavery; it was also a response to the end of slavery. It      continued from the 1880s until after the end of World War I,      with more than 100 people lynched each year. So prevalent was      this atrocity that between 1920 and 1938, the N.A.A.C.     displayed a banner at its national headquarters that read      simply, ``A man was lynched yesterday.''       Lynching was not just a phenomenon of the American South or      the Ku Klux And in many places, as black people fought      for inclusion in American life, lynchings became brutal      spectacles, drawing thousands of onlookers who posed for      photographs with the lifeless bodies. This collective memory      explains why the noose has become a symbol of white supremacy      and racial intimidation.       So, what does it mean to have found three nooses on      Smithsonian grounds in 2017? A[[Page S3848]]     noose inside a Missouri high school? A noose on the campus of      Duke University? Another at American University?       As a historian, who also happens to be old enough to      remember ``Whites Only'' signs on motels and restaurants that      trumpeted the power of laws enforcing segregation, I posit      that it means we must lay to rest any notion that racism is      not still the great divide.       As someone who has experienced the humiliating sting of      racial epithets and the pain of a policeman's blow--simply      because I was black and in a neighborhood not my own--I would      argue that it answers a naive and dangerous question that I      hear too often: Why can't African-Americans get over past      discrimination?       The answer is that discrimination is not confined to the      past. Nor is the African-American commitment to American      ideals in the face of discrimination and hate.       The exhibitions inside the museum combine to form a      narrative of a people who refused to be broken by hatred and      who have always found ways to prod America to be truer to the      ideals of its founders.       In the process of curating these experiences, I have      acquired, examined and interpreted objects that stir feelings      of intense pain. Anger and sadness are always parts of this      work, but I never let them dominate it. Instead, I use them      to help me connect with the people who have suffered and      continue to suffer immeasurable pain and injustice, while      clinging to their humanity and their vision of a better      country.       I see the nooses in the same way. They are living history.      Viewed through this lens, they are no less a part of the      story the museum tells than the Klan robes, the slave      shackles small enough to fit a child, the stretch of rope      used to lynch a Maryland man in 1931 or the coffin used to      bury the brutally murdered Emmett       If you want to know how African-Americans continue to      persevere and fight for a better America in the face of this      type of hatred, you need only visit the museum, where the      noose has been removed but the rest of the remarkable story      of our commitment to overcome remains. Anyone who experiences      the National Museum of African American History and Culture      should leave with that realization, as well as the      understanding that this story is continuing. The cowardly act      of leaving a symbol of hate in the midst of a tribute to our      survival conveyed that message as well as any exhibit ever      could.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgS3847-3.txt,1383,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,29.0,July

Firing of James Comey  Mr.President, I rise to speak about President Trump's firing of FBI Director James In and of itself, this action by President Trump is seismic and has shaken the very foundation of our government and, I dare say, of our democracy. But just yesterday, the American people were also once again confronted by Presidential actions that raised both alarm and the need for investigation. In a new story, the Washington Post reported that President Trump revealed highly sensitive classified material to senior Russian officials during a meeting last week. According to the Post story, President Trump reportedly revealed information about ISIS that could compromise a partner country's key intelligence sources and enable Russia to, according to the story, ``identify our sources and techniques'' for gathering intelligence.  There could be no greater compromise of American security. The information that President Trump revealed was so sensitive that the United States had previously refrained from sharing it even with our allies.  President Trump's decision to relay some of our most sensitive intelligence with representatives of the Russian Government betrays an astounding lack of judgment. By revealing what is called ``code-word'' information to Russia, President Trump may have compromised key intelligence sources, endangered the fight against ISIS, and undermined the trust of our international partners.  While the President may have the authority to declassify U.intelligence, it is imperative to the safety of our military and intelligence personnel and those of our partners that he do so through a careful and deliberative process. There is no evidence that Donald Trump did that.  Congress must immediately investigate this irresponsible action and take steps to ensure that President Trump does no additional damage to national security in his dealings with This dangerous behavior comes on the heels of the President's reckless decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey, pushing our country ever closer to a constitutional crisis. President Trump's firing of Mr.Comey is disturbingly reminiscent of Watergate's Saturday Night Massacre, when our Constitution was last subject to an executive-branch-induced stress test.  Then, President Nixon fired the independent prosecutor, Archibald Cox, who was leading the investigation into the Watergate scandal and the Nixon campaign's involvement in it. Now President Trump has fired his FBI Director, who was leading the investigation into the Russian interference scandal and the Trump campaign's involvement in it. Mark Twain is purported to have said that history doesn't repeat itself, but it does tend to rhyme. Unfortunately, there is no humor in President Trump's actions.  At first, we were supposed to believe that the President fired Director Comey because of the way he handled the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server, which was unfair to her. That was what President Trump sent his staff out to tell the press and the American people. The official White House statement from Press Secretary Sean Spicer on May 9 said that President Trump acted based on the clear recommendation of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff That was a reference to the now-infamous memorandum by Attorney General Sessions, prepared by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, which cited Comey's ``handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails'' as the reason why the public purportedly had lost confidence in the FBI and on which Attorney General Sessions based his recommendation to the President that he fire Mr. On May 9, Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway said that President Trump ``took the recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General, who oversees the FBI Director.'' Then on May 10, Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the President ``took the recommendation seriously. And he made a decision based on that.'' Even Vice President Pence said that President Trump's decision to fire Comey was based on the Rosenstein memo.  So the American people were being told to believe that President Trump took the unprecedented step of firing the FBI Director in the midst of an investigation of the Trump campaign because James Comey was too hard on Hillary That simply didn't pass the laugh test. Who can forget that Candidate Trump repeatedly called her ``crooked Hillary Clinton'' throughout the campaign? Who can forget that Candidate Trump applauded Director Comey for the way he handled the Clinton investigation? At the end of October 2016, just days before the election and after Comey had reopened the Clinton email investigation, Trump said that Comey had ``guts'' and had ``brought back his reputation.''  But it took only 1 day after Mr.Comey's firing for President Trump himself to admit that reason was utterly false. In an interview President Trump said that Rosenstein ``made a recommendation, but regardless of recommendation I was going to fire Comey, knowing there was no good time to do it.''  So much for the Rosenstein memo. So much for the White House press statement. So much for what Kellyanne Conway said. So much for the words of the Vice President of the United If that admission wasn't enough, President Trump went on to tell everyone what was on his mind when he made that decision. Here is his quote:       And, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to      myself, I said, ``You know, this Russia thing with Trump and      Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats      for having lost an election that they should have won.''  President Trump's statements about the Russia investigation are, of course, untrue. There is nothing made up about the conclusion of the intelligence community that Russia interfered with our election. The allegations of the Trump campaign's collusion with the Russians are serious. That is why the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have been investigating them.  So contrary to what White House senior administration officials and--the President, in fact, admitted that he fired the Director of the FBI precisely because he was overseeing an investigation of the Trump campaign and its ties to According to all of these various reports, the President did so just after Director Comey had gone to Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein[[Page S2942]]and asked for more resources for the Russia investigation.  The firing of James Comey now brings the number of law enforcement officials who were investigating the Trump campaign or his administration when they themselves were fired to three--first, Manhattan U.Attorney Preet Bharara, then Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, and now Director  President Trump himself, in his termination letter to Comey, made no mention of the Clinton email investigation but instead expressly linked the firing to the Russia investigation. Trump claimed that he fired Comey despite Comey having informed the President on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation--a claim that has not been substantiated.  Here is the plain and simple truth: President Trump feared that the FBI investigation into his campaign's possible collusion with Russia was getting too close for comfort, so he fired Director Comey's firing could be nothing less than obstruction of justice masquerading as a personnel action. It is what impeding a Federal investigation looks like. It is what an assault on the rule of law looks like.  If there is one lesson President Trump should have learned from Watergate, it is this: If you are under investigation, don't fire the investigator.  But as disturbing as Mr.Comey's firing is, it gets worse. Days after, President Trump tweeted a veiled threat--one that smacked of witness intimidation. Here is the quote: ``James Comey better hope that there are no tapes of our conversation before he starts leaking to the press.'' Are there recordings? We don't know yet. But if there are, the White House and Justice Department must ensure that they are preserved.  It is clear that President Trump did not learn any of the lessons of Watergate, which only underscores the need for a special prosecutor independent of the White House and Justice Department to get to the bottom of this. The role of a special independent prosecutor is to follow all of the facts wherever they lead. That individual needs to be as far away from the White House as possible.  Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein should not be the one to appoint a special prosecutor. Just 3 weeks on the job, Mr.Rosenstein is now compromised by the questions swirling around his role in the Comey firing: Did Comey meet with Rosenstein and ask for more resources for the Russia investigation? Why did Rosenstein discuss the removal of Director Comey with Attorney General Sessions after Sessions had recused himself from the Russia investigation? Why didn't Rosenstein question Sessions's involvement?  The magnitude of--the decision to appoint a special counsel in these circumstances cannot be made by a political appointee. Instead, I join Minority Leader Schumer's call that the appointment must be made by the highest ranking career civil servant in the Justice Department, someone insulated from politics and the White Until we have an independent special prosecutor appointed, we should not move forward with the confirmation of any replacement for James Comey as Director of the  Additionally, Director Comey should come and testify before Congress, which both Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Warner have already requested, clearly showing the bipartisan support for this. There are too many unanswered questions that only Director Comey can answer.  Finally, while it has been announced that Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein will brief all Senators and answer their questions, we must still hear from Attorney General  We must not lose sight of the fact that a foreign power interfered in our last Presidential election and that the Trump campaign may have colluded with it to win the White This strikes at the heart of our government and our very democracy. Our elections must be fair and free of foreign interference. It is time for both Democrats and Republicans to put love of country ahead of party and to come together and demand the appointment of a special prosecutor who will investigate and follow the facts no matter where they lead.  Mr.President, I would like to conclude my remarks today by expressing my opposition to the nomination of Jeffrey Rosen to be Deputy Secretary of Mr.Rosen has a long history, both in government and in the private sector, of defending private industry against regulations designed to protect the American public. When he first worked for the Department of Transportation, he touted the fact that he was involved in ending or withdrawing 180 potential Transportation Department rulemakings.  He has also been hostile to environmental regulations designed to protect our air and water. He opposed greenhouse gas emissions regulations in his role at the Office of Management and Budget and personally represented the U.Chamber of Commerce in attempting to undermine climate change science in order to fend off potential regulations. Mr.Rosen's firm represented the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and other auto groups against California over rules meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase nonpolluting vehicles.  I will vote no on Mr.Rosen's nomination because our automobile safety, environment, and clean energy future are just too important. I urge my colleagues to join me.  I yield the floor.

The resolution also condemns violence and threats against aid workers assisting those in need and calls on the leaders of South Sudan to cease the fighting so that these resources may reach those who need them.  This resolution focuses on the situation in South Sudan where 7.5 million are at imminent risk. But unfortunately, at least 20 million people around the world are facing severe food shortages as a result of below-average rainfall and conflict. That is equivalent to the populations of the States of Connecticut, Iowa, Utah, Mississippi, Arkansas, Nevada, Kansas, and New Mexico combined. And conflicts in South Sudan, Yemen Nigeria, and Somalia are making bad situations even worse.  People are starving and we cannot stand by and watch.

2108,topic-id,213,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to express my concern about the President's budget, and, in particular, the $610 billion in proposed cuts to Medicaid over the next 10 years.  In my district on the central coast of California, Medicaid provides healthcare to over 280,000 people. These are people that need it the most, including low-income families, children, disabled, and pregnant women.  Clinics and hospitals, particularly in rural communities like my district, rely on Medicaid to provide patients with mandatory and preventative services. Employees from the number one industry in my area--agriculture--rely on those health clinics so that they can stay healthy and ultimately contribute to our economy and our culture.  If Medicaid is cut, as desired in the President's budget, it will hurt not just my community, it will hurt our country.

Bipartisanship is something that should be contagious, particularly as we are talking about a healthcare event which is important and may mean life or death to many of our citizens.  Home infusion is an essential treatment option for individuals suffering from many, many debilitating diseases like cancer, congestive heart failure, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The 21st Century Cures Act, which became law last year, correctly adjusted payments for home infusion drugs and would establish a new home infusion nursing benefit within Medicare beginning in 2021.  However, we have heard concerns that the payment adjustment going into effect before the nursing benefit is implemented could jeopardize access to home infusion in the interim. The bill that Congressman Tiberi from Ohio and I introduced would address that concern by creating a temporary nursing benefit until the new permanent benefit can be implemented.

You all know the statistics, but suffice it to say, if your child had the grade of our infrastructure, they would be going to summer school this summer.  In my district in Colorado, it is the upgrades for Interstate 25 between Denver and Fort Collins for the tens of thousands of commuters each day; it is the backup from skier traffic returning from the mountains on Interstate 70, or our Northwest line commuter rail that is 35 years behind schedule.  Of course, there are people who came within a hair's breadth of missing their flight because of interstate traffic. What is happening to my district and my State is happening across the country.  But it is not just roads and bridges we need to fix. To connect and improve our communities, the true definition of infrastructure includes investments in broadband, 21st century infrastructure, clean water systems, schools, public rail, pedestrian and bike paths, airports, energy efficiency, storage, and transmission to make our country stronger and reduce costs.  Now is the time to act on an infrastructure package that has true investment. It can't just be toll roads or a giveaway to Wall A fully paid-for infrastructure package will be a boon for the country, for our cities, for our towns, for our rural areas, and for the middle class.

The problem, of course, is that terrorist killers have used religious doctrines and concepts from every major religion on earth, including not just Islam, but Christianity, Judaism, Mormonism, Hinduism, Buddhism, for homicidal purposes. Because religion is based on faith and not reason, and because religious texts are not self-explanatory, good people will invoke scripture for good causes and evil people will invoke scripture for evil causes.  We don't need a big government study to teach us something so commonsensical, which the Founders taught us a long time ago. If we want to study the exploitation of religion for terrorism, let's study it universally.  Focusing on one religion not only vastly understates the problem, but exacerbates the problem by fomenting the myth that religious fanaticism and terrorism are unique to the charlatans and predators of Islam when they are common to the charlatans and predators of nearly every religious faith and identification.

Second, I rise to honor fallen Officer Brian Beliso, a U.Immigration and Customs enforcement officer assigned to the Fugitive Operations Unit at the Enforcement and Removal Operations office in San Officer Beliso began his work with ICE in 2007. Very early in his career, Brian distinguished himself as a charismatic leader and a dedicated employee who always went above and beyond in all of his duties.

He was directly responsible for prosecutions of numerous criminal aliens who illegally reentered the country following their deportation.  On June 8, 2016, Officer Beliso died in the line of duty.

Of course, I would also like to thank my Republican colleagues for their months of hard work.

He has put in countless hours and has never stopped working, even in the most trying of times.  John, literally, this moment would not have been possible without you.  I know there are many others whom I wasn't able to name right now, but I want them to know we recognize their efforts, and we are immeasurably grateful for the work they do.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for his work in pushing Congress to have a debate on an  I had offered an amendment as well to the defense bill, along with Mr.Sanford and Mr.Moulton, that would put in place a new consolidated AUMF, and I wanted to describe it.  I know there has been considerable debate over whether this is the right bill for an amendment of this nature. But what we have tried to do in this language is avoid the red lines that both parties seem to have in this debate. As I perceive those red lines, my friends on the Republican side of the aisle are reluctant to--in what would be considered too restrictive a way--tie the hands of the Commander in Chief by putting limits on geography or the introduction of ground troops.  On the Democratic side, we are resistant to the idea of giving the Commander in Chief too much of a blank check.  The way that we have sought to navigate the distance between these two red lines is a resolution that would repeal the old authorizations which no longer really apply to our current situation, replace it with an authorization of use of force against al-Qaida, ISIS, the Taliban, and their associated forces.  It would place no geographic limits and no limits on the introduction of ground forces, but it would have these necessary safeguards. First, it would have a sunset date of 3 years so that we don't again get to a 15-year period where we can't get a vote on an authorization and it goes on beyond its intended life.  But it would also provide that, if a President decided to introduce ground troops in a combat mission, a privileged motion would be in order that any Member could trigger where within a discrete period of time set up by the War Powers Act you could compel a vote to either approve or modify or repeal the existing authority.  That would, of course, not prevent us from taking a vote at any other time, but it would at least allow a vote and some accountability.  So I commend it for people's consideration as a way that we might navigate the distance between the parties. I appreciate, again, my colleague from Oklahoma's efforts to get us to weigh in and consider and live up to our constitutional responsibility.

1965,topic-id,1497,"Madam President, as soon as tomorrow, we could be voting on a motion to proceed to the Republican healthcare plan. What that plan is, I am not sure anybody really knows. My friend the majority whip, when reporters asked him if his own Members would know what they would be voting on, said: ``That's a luxury we don't have.''  We have been on the topic of healthcare for 7 months. Republicans have been talking about repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act for over 7 years. Yet here we are, 1 or 2 days from a vote on the motion to proceed, and we don't even know what the Republicans plan is to vote on. We are potentially 1 or 2 days away from a vote on a bill that would reorganize one-sixth of the American economy and impacts tens of millions of American lives, and no one knows what it is. It is sort of like ``Alice in Wonderland'' around here. It comes down to this bizarre game where the Republican leader has basically said: Let's spin a wheel and see what we are going to vote on. This is no way to treat a matter as serious as healthcare--so near and dear to the lives of so many  I don't know how a single one of my Republican friends can in good conscience vote to proceed to a truncated debate on something as important as healthcare without knowing what bill they will ultimately be voting on. Isn't this the same party that shouted ``Read the bill, read the bill'' from the rafters when the Affordable Care Act was debated? It is completely bewildering.  Maybe we will be voting on the Republican repeal-and-replace bill, which will cause costs to go up and care to go down, which will cause 22 million Americans to lose their insurance, and which will so cruelly exchange healthcare for millions of working Americans for another tax break for the wealthy and the special interests. Maybe we will be voting on repeal without replace, which is even worse, which will cause our healthcare system to implode, creating chaos for 32 million Americans who would lose their insurance and chaos for millions more who would see their coverage diminish or their premiums rise. No one knows what we will be voting on. We know one thing: All the options are bad.  There is no good way out of this. The truth is, the Republicans are completely stuck when it comes to healthcare. Every single version of their repeal-and-replace bill is rotten at the core. Repeal without replace is even worse. The American people don't want tax breaks for the wealthy or the slashing of They don't want to repeal all the progress we made in healthcare without any plan to put in its place.  It is time to start over. It is time to go back to the drawing board--abandon tax cuts for the wealthy, abandon cuts to Medicaid, abandon repeal and run--and come together, both parties, around a set of nonideological proposals to improve our healthcare system. That is what we Democrats want to do.[[Page S4125]]  I have called several Some in their leadership are saying: Leader Schumer doesn't want people to talk to each other and won't let that happen if the bill fails. Well, first, I couldn't prevent it if I wanted to, and second, I don't want to. I want us to sit down and come up with ways to improve No one said it is perfect.  So if the bill fails tomorrow, we will start right away trying to work with our Republican colleagues to stabilize the marketplace and improve the cost and quality of healthcare. Whether they join us in that effort is entirely up to them.              Economic Policies to Help American Families  Madam President, on another matter, today in Berryville, VA, the Democratic Party began presenting our vision for the future of the country. As I have traveled New York State, from upstate, rural, Republican areas, like Sodus Bay, where I was Friday, to suburban Long Island, to the inner-city Bronx, I have found one thing in common: Average families feel they have been pushed around by large economic forces, and they are losing that traditional, American faith in the future. Too many families in America feel as though rules of the economy are rigged against them. They feel as if they are getting a raw deal. And they are right. American families deserve a better deal so this country works for everyone, not just the elites and special interests. Today, Democrats started presenting that better deal to the American people.  There used to be a basic bargain in this country that if you worked hard and played by the rules, you could own a home, afford a car, put your kids through college, and take a modest vacation every year, while putting enough away for a comfortable retirement. I should know. I grew up in that My father was an exterminator, and he worked very hard but managed to--not making a whole lot of money--build a good life for his family. But things have changed.  Today's working Americans are justified in having greater doubts about the future than almost any generation since the Corporate interests and the superwealthy are allowed to spend unlimited, undisclosed money on campaigns and lobbying so they can protect their special deals in And for too long--far too long--government has played along, tilting the economic field in favor of the wealthy and the powerful, taking the burden off them and putting it on the backs of hard-working The result is an economy that has created enormous wealth at the top, while producing less work and less pay for average Incomes and wages have flatlined while everyday costs are skyrocketing.  Democrats, frankly, have too often hesitated from directly and unflinchingly taking on the misguided policies that got us here--so much so that Americans don't know what we stand for. Well, not after today. Democrats are showing the country that we are the party on the side of working people and that we stand for three things: First, we are going to increase people's pay; second, we are going to reduce their everyday expenses; and third, we are going to provide workers the tools they need for the 21st-century economy.  Today we announced three new policies to advance these goals.  Right now, there is nothing to stop vulture capitalists from egregiously raising the price of lifesaving drugs without justification. We are going to fight for rules to stop prescription drug price gouging and demand that drug companies justify price increases to the public. And we are going to push for empowering Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for seniors.  Right now, our antitrust laws are designed to allow huge corporations to merge, padding the pockets of investors but sending costs skyrocketing for everything from cable bills and airline tickets to beer, food, and healthcare. We are going to fight to allow regulators to penalize big companies if they are hurting consumers and to make it harder for companies to merge if it reduces competition.  Right now, millions of unemployed or underemployed people--particularly those without a college degree--could be brought back into the labor force and retrained to secure full-time, higher paying work. We propose giving employers--particularly small businesses--a large tax credit to train workers for unfilled jobs, with a requirement to hire that worker at a good wage once the training is complete.  In future weeks, we will offer additional ideas, from rebuilding rural America to fundamentally changing our trade laws to benefit workers, not multinational corporations. Now, we are in the minority in both Houses of We know that. We cannot delude anyone that this Congress will begin passing our priorities tomorrow, but this is the start of a new vision for our party. This set of economic policies will form the backbone of our agenda, and we welcome our Republican colleagues to join with us in any of these ideas they might find acceptable.  ``A better deal'' is not just a slogan; it is a mission. It is about reorienting government to work on behalf of people and families. It is not going to be the work of only one It shouldn't be the work of one party. As I said, we welcome any Republicans willing to work with us on these issues because there is an American imperative and a moral imperative to do what we are doing here.  If that torch, held by the lady in the harbor of the city in which I live--that symbol of optimism and hope for the future--starts flickering, it is a different America, an America no one will like.  American families deserve a better deal, a government that has their back and helps make the economy work for them. That is how we will restore the fundamental optimism that defines the American spirit.  I yield the floor.

1998,topic-id,887,"Mr.President, by now we have all had the chance to read the report in the Washington Post that alleges stunning behavior on the part of the President in a meeting with the Russian Ambassador and Russian Foreign  According to the report, the President revealed classified information about a terrorist threat to officials of a foreign government. The President didn't share it with just any government; the report states he shared it with the Russian Government, a global adversary that has violated the sovereignty of peaceful nations, propped[[Page S2940]]up dictators and human rights abusers, including Iran and Syria, and has been widely proven to have interfered in our elections and the elections of our allies in  If this report is indeed true, it would mean that the President may have badly damaged our national security, nothing less, and in several ways. First, the act of a disclosure of this type could threaten the United States' relationships with allies that provide us with vital intelligence and could result in the loss of this specific intelligence source.  We rely on intelligence from our allies to keep America safe. America can't have eyes and ears everywhere. If our allies abroad can't trust us to keep sensitive information close to the vest, they may no longer share it with us. That undermines key relationships and, even more importantly, makes us less safe.  Second, if accurate, such a disclosure could damage our interests in the Middle We do not collaborate with Russia in Syria or elsewhere in the Middle East for the simple fact that we have diverging interests. Russia, for example, has worked with Iran to prop up the brutal Assad regime. Sharing vital intelligence with Russian officials could allow the Russians to pursue or even possibly eliminate the source or figure out how the ally conducts operations, including any against Russia or Russia's allies in the region.  Third, if the report is true, the President's alleged carelessness with classified information will further damage the relationship between the White House and the intelligence community--an essential relationship for the security of The intelligence community needs to be able to trust the President and trust that he will treat classified information with caution and with care. Our intelligence professionals put their lives on the line every day to acquire information that is critical to our national security and critical to keeping Americans safe. They have done a very good job.  If the reporting is accurate, in one fell swoop, the President could have unsettled our allies, emboldened our adversaries, endangered our military and intelligence officers the world over, and exposed our Nation to greater risk.  Given the gravity of the matter, we need to be able to quickly assess whether this report is true and what exactly was said. So I am calling on the White House to make the transcript of the meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister and Ambassador available to the congressional Intelligence Committees as soon as possible. The White House should make the transcript of the meeting available immediately to the congressional Intelligence If the President has nothing to hide, he should direct that the transcript of the meeting be made available.  The Members who sit on those committees have the necessary clearances to review the transcript and any related summary of the President's meeting with the I agree with the senior Senator from Maine that this briefing should happen immediately. Those committees would be able to help establish the facts before we grapple with the potential consequences.  Last night, the administration issued several overlapping denials. Some questioned the overall veracity of the account. Some took pains to specifically deny certain accusations but not others. This morning, the President tweeted a version of events that undercut his advisers' carefully worded denials and seems to confirm the reports that he had shared the information in question.  Following so closely after Mr.Comey's firing, which was rationalized to the press and the American public in several different ways over the course of a week, this administration now faces a crisis of credibility. The President has told us that we cannot take at face value the explanations of some of his key advisers, but the events of the past week have taken this to an untenable extreme. The timelines and rationales in the administration contradict one another. The truth, as it were, sits atop shifting sands in this administration.  We need the transcripts to see exactly what the President said, given the conflicting reports from the people in the room. Producing the transcripts is the only way for this administration to categorically prove the reports untrue.  Mr.President, there is a crisis of credibility in this administration which will hurt us in ways almost too numerous to elaborate. At the top of the list is an erosion of trust in the Presidency and trust in America by our friends and allies. The President owes the intelligence community, the American people, and the Congress a full explanation. The transcripts, in my view, are a necessary first step. Until the administration provides the unedited transcript, until the administration fully explains the facts of this case, the American people will rightly doubt if their President can handle our Nation's most closely kept secrets.

2097,topic-id,373,"Mr.President, I am expressing sentiments for myself and on behalf of Senators Wyden and Murray, as a fair reading of the Affordable Care Act, ACA, makes clear, 1462, the Marketplace Certainty Act, is not necessary to provide a permanent appropriation for the payment of cost-sharing reductions under the The ACA already prescribes that such payments are to be made from such a permanent appropriation pursuant to 31 U.S.1324. This is because an essential component of the ACA's system for ensuring the availability of affordable health insurance coverage is its two-part package of subsidies: tax credits and cost-sharing reductions. Whereas the premium tax credits make it more affordable for an individual to purchase health insurance, the cost-sharing reductions make healthcare more affordable by reducing the often daunting costs, such as copayments and deductibles, that even those with health insurance must pay to obtain healthcare, ACA, sections 1401, 1402, 26 U.S.36B, 42 U.S.18071. The ACA directs the Secretary of the Treasury to ``establish'' a single, integrated ``program'' to ``make advance payment'' of both subsidies to insurance companies, who are accordingly mandated to reduce individuals' premium payments to insurers, and their cost-sharing obligations to healthcare providers. To assure insurers and covered individuals that these equally essential funds will both be available, the act provides that requisite payments are to be jointly made from a permanent appropriation, 31 U.S.1324, rather than be subject to the year-to-year whims of the annual appropriations process.  Despite the fact that the current permanent appropriation in section 1324 plainly covers these cost-sharing reduction payments, pending litigation brought by the House Republican leadership--which is currently being held in abeyance in the D.Circuit Court of Appeals--and the current administration's mixed signals as to whether it will continue to make these payments required by law, could generate instability in individual insurance markets. 1462 removes all basis for any further questions about what is already clear from a fair reading of the ACA as a whole: both subsidies are to be funded from the same permanent appropriation. In addition, the amendment includes provisions that will strengthen the existing subsidy provisions, and, in light of developments since the ACA was enacted in 2010, make insurance more affordable for beneficiaries and help stabilize State-level individual insurance markets.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-29-pt1-PgS3854.txt,1901,WE NEED TO FIX OUR FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE,2017.0,29.0,July

South Sudan faces a famine of Biblical proportions which compels us to act. As the world's newest country, South Sudan's entry on the world stage has been fraught with disaster. A drought caused by climate change, which has become all too familiar in this part of the world, has, since December 2013, been coupled with politically and ethnically fueled violence which has destroyed the infrastructure as well as the economy.

Incompetent and/or corrupt governments fail to address the needs, and civil unrest devolves into violence. Countries are destabilized.

Due to the drought and high temperatures, Montana has turned into a tinderbox. Unfortunately, fires have sparked all across our State, some 24 of them--which changes by the hour, I might add. Across Montana, over one-quarter million acres have already burned, and many of these fires continue to rage. Montana is burning, and our heroic firefighters are protecting lives, our lands, our homes, our way of life.

Trenton's bravery and sacrifice will not be forgotten.                         Lodgepole Complex Fire  Madam President, communities across the State are coming together to protect their homes and livelihoods, and families are concerned about their homes, property, and health. The largest fire is the Lodgepole Complex fire in Garfield This afternoon, 30-mile-per-hour winds ballooned the Lodgepole Complex to more than 230,000 acres. Over the weekend, the fire jumped the highway, and as of today it is nowhere near containment.  The Lodgepole Complex fire is made up of three different fires that have turned Eastern Montana's farm and grazing land into an ashtray, leaving an unknown number of farms and ranches with an uncertain future, forcing families to evacuate and communities to join local fire departments, with anyone willing and able to join in the firefight.  Sadly, Montana is used to this. Fire season has been as common as the autumn and the spring. As I stand here, nearly two dozen uncontained, large fires are raging in It has taken more and more resources to fight fires, and these resources are becoming more and more difficult to come by.  Places like Garfield County are being forced to ask for donations to get volunteer firefighters the fuel they need to save lives and protect property, and this is unacceptable. Protecting our communities from disaster and coming to help our fellow Americans in their time of need is a fundamental pillar of government.  I was pleased to see Governor Bullock declare Montana a fire emergency, which will go a long way to bring much needed resources into our Last night, the regional director of FEMA denied emergency assistance for the Lodgepole fire, so this afternoon, I called Administrator Brock Long of FEMA to make sure he heard from me about the situation on the ground and asked him to cut loose much needed relief into  Firefighters from all levels of government have bravely fought fires across our Folks across Federal, State, and local agencies have been working around-the-clock to contain the havoc. Montana's communities are strong, tight-knit, and they always persevere, but they expect the government to have their backs. Congress can assist these communities by changing the way we fund fighting wildland fires. Fires are a devastating natural disaster and should be treated that way. We need to raise the disaster cap so that we can budget for the real cost of fighting fires, making sure the folks on the ground have the resources they need to keep our communities safe.  As an example, Forest Service resources are already stretched thin. When a fire starts, they are forced to take money they use for managing the forest and use that for fighting fires. Twenty years ago, firefighting took up about 20 percent of the Forest Service budget. In 2016, more than half of the[[Page S4128]]Forest Service budget was spent on fighting fires. This is not sustainable.  When Montana's communities are burning, I don't want a bureaucrat in Washington, DC, weighing the pros and cons of sending help to these communities. We want the fire to be contained. As Montana burns, Congress cannot afford to wait. We need to act and allow catastrophic wildfires to be treated as what they are--natural disasters. It is the least we can do for the rancher in Jordan who lost his cattle, the rancher in Sand Springs who no longer has a fence around his pasture, or any Montanan who is forced to leave the home they have known because a fire may be descending upon them.  Fire season is always a testament to the strength of Montana's communities. Everyone works together, they put aside their differences, and they play their part to achieve a common goal. Neighbors open their homes to displaced families; churches and community centers turn into places to get food and other essentials. Congress can learn a thing or two from these Montana communities.

2111,topic-id,293,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I stand in this Chamber today in strong support of H.3178, a package of bipartisan policies centered on improving care for Medicare beneficiaries across several areas.  In particular, H.3178 includes a bill that I introduced with my friend and colleague from New Jersey, Mr.Bill Pascrell, that provides a temporary transitional payment for home infusion providers.  The 21st Century Cures Act created a new reimbursement benefit for home infusion therapies beginning in 2021. This new temporary transitional payment will bridge the potential gap in care for beneficiaries, and home infusion providers will continue to administer these therapies without going bankrupt.  This legislation includes other good public policies that further encourage giving seniors the choice to receive more care in the comfort of their own homes, as well as expanding access to providers, particularly in rural and in needy areas.  I would like to thank my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee for their support. I would also like to thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for their commitment to working on this issue, especially Michael Burgess, as well as Chairman Emeritus Fred Upton, who helped pave the way for these policies with the passage of the 21st Century Cures  Madam Speaker, I would like to conclude with a commitment that this is not an end for policies encouraging care--especially drug infusion--in the home for patients who choose to do so. We look forward to working with the administration and clarifying current rules to ensure we successfully implement both this legislation and future policies to ensure inclusion of payment for all drugs needed by the home infusion patient community.

Officer Corvinus is survived by his daughter.  Deputy Sheriff Ryan Sean Thomas of the Valencia County Sheriff's Department was responding to a call for service on December 6, 2016, when his patrol car left the roadway between Los Lunas and Belen, and overturned. He was ejected from his car. He is survived by his wife, daughter, and a baby boy after he died.

Russia Investigation  Mr.President, the White House and President Trump face yet another crisis--perhaps the biggest in his chaotic term so far. According to the Washington Post and other outlets, President Trump disclosed highly classified information to the Russian Foreign Minister and Russian Ambassador to the United States in the Oval Office last week. This is utterly stunning.  Congress needs to find out exactly what happened, on a bipartisan basis, but we can tell already that President Trump's behavior in this incident is very dangerous. It is dangerous to our national security institutions, dangerous to the men and women overseas who are serving their country and risking their lives. Many other outlets have confirmed the Washington Post article, and they have cited several sources.  Assuming it is true, the President has endangered our relationship with a partner who gave our security agencies this information. That has ripple effects that will risk similar relationships with other countries. It also could put our sources at risk.  While his national security team denied the news reports this morning, the President was on Twitter contradicting them. He claims he has the right to tell the Russian Foreign Minister anything he wants. I can't think of any parallel in history for the President's dangerous lack of discretion or his dangerous misunderstanding of how to handle classified national security information.  As the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Corker put it this way: The White House is in a ``downward spiral,'' and he said it needs to get it ``under control.'' Senator Corker is a senior I know the Presiding Officer and I serve with him on the Foreign Relations He is a man I respect very much, and I hope the White House will listen to Chairman  It is very strange that the President chose to meet with the Russian Ambassador at the center of the Trump campaign's contacts to Russia or to allow the Russian press with their electronic equipment into the meeting at the Oval Office, but let's put these strange and dangerous events in the context of the last several weeks and months.  America's intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the U.election and that they favored the Trump campaign. Now the President is hosting senior Russian officials in the Oval Office and disclosing highly classified information--information that[[Page S2949]]puts future intelligence and maybe lives at risk.  The day after he fired the FBI Director, President Trump admitted on camera to NBC News that he did so in part because he is frustrated at the FBI's investigation into Russian interference and potential Trump campaign contacts. Congress must get to the bottom of this. Republicans and Democrats must come together for real oversight. Based on what I see now, President Trump's actions call into question his fitness for office and further underscore the imperative for independent investigations.  It is not an exaggeration to say our Nation faces a constitutional crisis. Our Constitution is based on rule of law. In the United States, no man or woman is above the law, not even the President of the United Our constitutional democracy is remarkable for many reasons. One is that Presidential action has threatened the fabric of our democracy only a few times in our history. President Nixon's Watergate scandal was one of them, and I believe we face another one today.  President Trump's firing of the FBI Director in the middle of an investigation into the campaign that put him in office and the President's bizarre behavior since should concern all Americans regardless of party. The only rational explanation is that he has something to hide, that he wants to disrupt the investigation into Russia's interference in our election. What possible reason could the President have for wanting to hinder this investigation? It should be his highest priority to ensure it never happens again. Instead he calls it ``fake news.''  Now, here is what we know. Early in the new administration, the White House Chief of Staff asked the FBI to publicly disavow reports that the FBI was investigating Trump campaign ties to This attempted political interference was wrong.  The White House next set its sight on House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes, who was investigating Russian interference in the election. Representative Nunes made midnight runs to the White House to view documents that he said validated the President's claims that he was wiretapped.  While the information did not ultimately prove that, Representative Nunes still chose to go public with classified information before discussing it with his committee. This was circus-like behavior, which ultimately forced Representative Nunes to recuse himself from the committee's investigation. But it was also serious. It showed that the White House was willing to go to great lengths to interfere with the House investigation into the  Next, the President fired Acting Attorney General Sally At the time, he claimed it was for refusing to defend his Executive order barring Muslims from the country. In the end, her analysis was correct. The Federal courts found the order to be unconstitutional.
