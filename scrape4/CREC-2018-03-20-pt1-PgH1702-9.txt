                   CELEBRATING WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of Women's History 
Month. Every March, we celebrate the trailblazing women who have 
enriched our history, our society, and our communities.
  This month, it is important to recognize the hardworking women in 
today's workforce. Today, more than 70 percent of women work outside of 
the home, and these women account for nearly half of the workforce, 
while 40 percent of women are their family's top earners.
  Because of tax reform, the women of America's workforce will be able 
to keep more of their hard-earned cash to spend on their families, 
rather than sending it to Washington. Additionally, working moms and 
their families will receive double the child tax credit to ensure they 
have the means to care for their children.
  Mr. Speaker, to the naysayers who claimed that tax reform would only 
benefit rich men, I say that is categorically false. Tax reform already 
has and will continue to empower the wonderful women in America's 
workforce to make history worth recognizing.
