                  RESTRICTING ABORTIONS AFTER 20 WEEKS

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Pain-Capable 
Unborn Child Protection Act, a measure that will restrict abortions 
after 20 weeks.
  Substantial scientific evidence has proven that abortions inflict 
pain on unborn children who have reached the age of 20 weeks. It has 
also been proven that, at 20 weeks, an unborn child is capable of 
surviving outside the womb.
  Just last week, I had the honor of meeting Micah Pickering, who had 
been born prematurely at 20 weeks. Micah is now a vibrant 5-year-old 
boy who is living a full and healthy life.
  Currently, the United States is one of only seven countries that 
allow abortions after 20 weeks. This bill is a commonsense measure that 
will protect our next generation and end the egregious practice of 
late-term abortions.
  During my time as a member of the New York State Assembly, I was the

prime sponsor of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and was 
honored to champion this bill in an effort to protect the most 
vulnerable in our society.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to protect the sanctity of 
life by voting ``yes'' on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.
