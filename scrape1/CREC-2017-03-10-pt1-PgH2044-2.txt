                             SNAP INTEGRITY

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to continue the 
discussion on the Agriculture Committee's findings from hearings 
conducted to ensure that SNAP--or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program--is meeting the needs of those it is intended to serve. After 
individual resources, family support, and community programs, SNAP is 
critical to supporting nutritional needs.
  The program integrity within SNAP is critical for both the 
functioning and the long-term sustainability of the program. Jessica 
Shahin of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service emphasized in testimony:
  ``As vital as the program is to so many, and as well as it operates, 
we can all agree that it can do even better. And it is up to all of 
us--the Federal Government, the States, and the local providers--to 
work together to improve it by holding ourselves accountable. FNS is 
committed to continually improving the integrity of SNAP.''
  Mr. Speaker, opportunities for SNAP program integrity improvements 
includes defining clear program goals and metrics that generate program 
improvement and reduce SNAP fraud rates through innovative State and 
Federal strategies and technologies.
