               TRIBUTE TO JOANI SLAWSON AND JAMES YAQUES

 Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I often praise the talents and 
goodwill of Floridians across my home State, and today is no different. 
Ms. Joani Slawson, a music teacher at Saturn Elementary in Brevard 
County, and Mr. James Yaques, of Palm Beach Central High School, have 
been nominated for a Grammy award. Their passion for teaching coupled 
with their musical talent is rightly being recognized as they are both 
semifinalists for music educator of the year.
  As the Grammy process continues, I, along with my fellow Floridians, 
will be rooting for Ms. Slawson and Mr. Yaques. I wish them, their 
respective schools, and their students all the best.
