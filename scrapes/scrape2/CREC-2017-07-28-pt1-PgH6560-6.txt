            WASHINGTON STATE BOY SCOUTS JAMBOREE TROOP 3218

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize two groups of 
young men, the Boy Scouts Jamboree Troop 3218 and the Grand Columbia 
Council, both from Washington State, as they recently attended the 2017 
National Scout Jamboree.
  In the 107 years since its founding, the Boy Scouts of America have 
instilled the values of hard work, responsibility, resourcefulness, and 
citizenship into the hearts and minds of thousands of young American 
men. The National Scout Jamboree brings together first class scouts 
from all 50 States to participate in a variety of Scouting traditions 
and to celebrate their organization.
  The Boy Scouts of America have made a marked difference in our 
Nation, in Washington State, and in my Fourth Congressional District 
through the schools and values they teach our young people. I have no 
doubt that these young men will continue to be leaders in their 
families, careers, and communities.
  Please join me in thanking these troops for their commitment to 
American values, service, and leadership.
