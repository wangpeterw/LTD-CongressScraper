                         REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, a little over a month ago, I attended the 
funeral of Javon Wilson. Javon was the grandson of my good friend, 
Congressman Danny Davis, and he was just 15 years old when he was shot 
and killed in Chicago.
  At the funeral, Javon's best friend remembered their talks. ``We were 
going to be the ones that never died . . . if we get shot, we were 
never going to die,'' he said.
  No child should grow up in a world where gun violence is so common 
that this talk seems normal.

  This week, we turn the page to a new Congress. There is no reason 
that commonsense measures like universal background checks, making gun 
trafficking a Federal crime, and reinstating the ban on military-style 
assault weapons should fall victim to partisan gridlock.
  Together, we have the opportunity to save lives and make our 
communities safer. This is a priority for me and my constituents, and I 
look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to make progress on reducing gun violence and building a safer future 
for all our children.
