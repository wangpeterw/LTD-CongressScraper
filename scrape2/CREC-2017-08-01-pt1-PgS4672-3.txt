     his second Conn Smythe Trophy in 2 years;
       Whereas goaltender Matt Murray dazzled throughout the 
     playoffs, becoming the first goaltender to win 2 Stanley Cups

     final 126 minutes, 52 seconds, and setting a rookie record 
     with 2 shutouts in the Final series;
       Whereas goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury contributed to the 
     defensive prowess of the team throughout the Stanley Cup
