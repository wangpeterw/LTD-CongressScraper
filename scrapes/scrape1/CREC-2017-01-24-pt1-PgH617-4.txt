         WOMEN'S RIGHT TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT HEALTH

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of every 
woman's right to make her own informed decisions about her health, 
including access to family planning and reproductive health care.
  While the rest of the world moves forward, we are turning the tide 
clock back to the era of ``Mad Men.'' However, unlike President Trump 
and my Republican colleagues, I have heard the voices of hundreds of 
thousands of people I marched with last Saturday.
  I accept the overwhelming research opposing the outrageous policies 
that President Trump and the Republicans in Congress have placed at the 
center of their agenda, policies like the global gag rule and H.R. 7, 
the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. These dangerous and 
irresponsible policies are a disgraceful attack on women's rights 
domestically and throughout the world.
  Let's get this straight, Madam Speaker. What this is about is keeping 
low-income women from accessing the health care they so rightfully 
deserve.
