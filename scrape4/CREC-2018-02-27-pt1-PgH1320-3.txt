                     HONORING REVEREND BILLY GRAHAM

  (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
ministry of Billy Graham. Billy Graham shared a simple message of the 
good news of salvation through Jesus. He never tired nor wavered from 
the story of how, as humans, we all have a relationship problem with 
God because of sin in our lives. But God loves us so much that He 
doesn't give up on us. In fact, God has offered us an escape from the 
punishment due for our sin through the free gift of salvation, a gift 
that we can receive but we cannot earn because Jesus paid the price for 
our sins when He gave his life on the cross. Jesus overcame death; and 
through faith in Christ, we can, too.
  Billy Graham shared this message out of a deep love for God and his 
fellow man. Not for fame. Not for fortune.
  I thank God for the ministry of Billy Graham and the example he 
lived. May God comfort his family and a grateful nation as we mourn his 
loss, and may we never tire of sharing the good news of Christ.
