              THANKING SHERIFF JOHN SANNER FOR HIS SERVICE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. Emmer) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and thank recently 
retired Stearns County Sheriff John Sanner for his service to the 
people of Minnesota. For the past 33 years, Sheriff Sanner has watched 
over our community, ensuring our safety and the safety of our loved 
ones. In 1984, he started out as a patrol deputy and was elected 
sheriff 20 years later.
  After the horrific abduction of Jacob Wetterling in 1989, Sheriff 
Sanner was one of the main officers on the case. He worked for more 
than 26 years searching tirelessly for Jacob, hoping to finally give 
Jacob's family an answer. Years went by and, soon, decades, but Sheriff 
Sanner never gave up on Jacob or the Wetterling family. He stood by 
them until the case was finally solved just this past year, proving his 
dedication to his job and to the people he served.
  Sheriff Sanner, I speak on behalf of all Minnesotans when I say thank 
you. We wish you a long, peaceful retirement spent with your family.
