  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend hisremarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week The Post and 
Courier of Charleston announced that South Carolina is thefifth most 
popular State for new residents. In an annual study conducted by United 
Van Lines, South Carolina achieved being in atop place for people 
looking to relocate, whether for a job, retirement, or temperate 
climate.
  The Post and Courier detailed that the moving company this week said 
60 percent of the trucks in South Carolina dropped offhousehold goods 
for newcomers, placing it among the top destinations for those seeking 
a new home. The article also reveals thatrecent data from the Census 
Bureau confirms the Palmetto State is gaining significantly.
  I am grateful to Governor Nikki Haley, incoming Governor Henry 
McMaster, Secretary of Commerce Bobby Hitt, and everyone whoworks each 
day to promote South Carolina as a great place to live, work, and raise 
a family. We have a probusiness mindset. Weare military friendly. We 
have communities that promote job creation. We have a State that is 
ready to welcome transplants.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his 
actions, never forget September the 11th in the globalwar on terrorism.
