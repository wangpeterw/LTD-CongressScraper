             THE FARM BILL MUST PROTECT NUTRITION PROGRAMS

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, every day, over 162,000 people in my county 
of Mecklenburg are considered food insecure. Worse, 47,000 of those are 
children who risk going to bed hungry every night.
  No one should have to wonder where their next meal will come from.
  In 2015, I founded the Adams Hunger Initiative to bring together a 
coalition of advocates in Mecklenburg to end hunger in our community.
  For over 3 years, we fought to protect important anti-hunger programs 
like SNAP, expand public-private partnerships, and find creative ways 
to the systemic issues that leave families hungry.
  The coalition will visit Capitol Hill to continue advocating for our 
priorities.
  During National Nutrition Month, we sent a letter to the chairman and 
ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee urging protection for 
SNAP benefits in the upcoming farm bill.
  Thirty-five thousand households in Mecklenburg and 20.3 million 
nationwide rely on SNAP to put food on their family's table.
  As Congress considers the next farm bill, we must protect nutrition 
programs for those who need them most and ensure that no one in 
Mecklenburg or in America goes hungry.
