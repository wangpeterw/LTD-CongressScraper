                   30TH ANNIVERSARY OF DAMIANI STORES

 Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Damiani 
Stores on their 30th anniversary of providing south Florida with 
exceptional service and quality men's clothing. With three locations 
serving the south Florida area, Damiani is an example of a successful 
local business, one that started by selling suits out of the owner's 
vehicle in 1987. They uphold a strong, longstanding reputation of 
prestige in our community, and I have no doubt they will see many more 
years of continued success.
