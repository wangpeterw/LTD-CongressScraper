                              S. Res. 380

       Whereas, on December 2, 2017, the University of Charleston 
     Golden Eagles won the National Collegiate Athletic 
     Association (referred to in this preamble as the ``NCAA'') 
     Division II Men's Soccer Championship at Swope Soccer Village 
     in Kansas City, Missouri, which was the first national 
     championship in the history of the University of Charleston;
       Whereas the University of Charleston men's soccer team 
     finished their historic season with a record of 21 wins, 1 
     loss, and 2 ties by securing a victory over the Lynn 
     University Fighting Knights in the national championship;
       Whereas the University of Charleston men's soccer team has 
     become a symbol of pride and success to the University of 
     Charleston and the surrounding communities in West Virginia;
       Whereas the University of Charleston men's soccer team did 
     not allow a goal in 5 games throughout the NCAA Division II 
     Men's Soccer championship tournament, becoming just the 
     second team to shutout every opponent in tournament history;
       Whereas the Golden Eagles held their opponents scoreless in 
     19 of 24 matches in 2017, with All-American goalkeeper Paulo 
     Pita registering 16 shutouts, the best in NCAA Division II 
     Men's Soccer championship tournament history;
       Whereas Paulo Pita was recognized as the 2017-2018 NCAA 
     Division II statistical champion for Goals Against Average;
       Whereas the University of Charleston Golden Eagles earned 
     the 2017-2018 Division II men's soccer statistical 
     championship title for Goals Against Average and Shutout 
     Percentage;
       Whereas the University of Charleston Golden Eagles won the 
     championship in the first season with Dan Stratford as head 
     coach;
       Whereas this championship follows 3 seasons with Dan 
     Stratford as an assistant coach, in which the Golden Eagles 
     reached 3 consecutive NCAA Division II Men's Soccer Final 
     Four tournaments and appeared in 2 National Championship 
     games;
       Whereas Thomas Vancaeyezeele became just the second athlete 
     in the history of the Golden Eagles to be named National 
     Player of the Year after leading the University of Charleston 
     men's soccer team to the national championship, anchoring a 
     defense that allowed just 8 goals in the 2017 season and 
     trailed just twice in 24 matches;
       Whereas the University of Charleston men's soccer team 
     started the 2017 season with 15 consecutive wins, cruising to 
     their fourth straight Mountain East Conference regular season 
     title and fourth straight NCAA Division II Men's Soccer 
     Atlantic Region title, losing just one match all season;
       Whereas Paulo Pita, Thomas Vancaeyezeele, Patrick Guier, 
     Will Roberts, Kieran Bywater, and Armando Tikvic were all 
     named as All-American players;
       Whereas the coaching staff of the University of Charleston 
     men's soccer team was named the United Soccer Coaches 
     National Staff of the Year for NCAA Division II Men's Soccer; 
     and
       Whereas the University of Charleston men's soccer team 
     should be praised for the historic season of both athletic 
     and academic accomplishments: Now, therefore, be it

     Division II Men's Soccer Championship;
