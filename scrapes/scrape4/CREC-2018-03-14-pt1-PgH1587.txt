                          PUBLIC SCHOOLS WEEK

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Public Schools 
Week.
  A quality public education is among the most important gifts we can 
provide to our children.
  As a product of a terrific public school, where my son also attended 
and graduated from 30 years later, I understand the challenges our 
local schools, administrators, and teachers are facing in public 
schools.
  Ninety percent of American children attend public school, making the 
local school district in most communities the largest and most 
significant employer.
  I had and will continue to be a strong advocate for public schools 
throughout our communities and throughout our Nation.
  Throughout my time in office, I have called for responsible increases 
in education and resources to our public schools, that are increasingly 
having to take on unfunded mandates and face many of the societal 
challenges that are now brought into the school districts.
  As a former member of the New York State Assembly Education 
Committee, I fought against a very unfair school aid formula that 
indirectly and unfairly impacted our upstate public schools.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the public schools and 
thanking those teachers, administrators, and custodians who provide 
guidance and provide leadership and a lifetime of memories to our 
students.
  Communities are stronger and schools are better when we work together 
to support public education.
