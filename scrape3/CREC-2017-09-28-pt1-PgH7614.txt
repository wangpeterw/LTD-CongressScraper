  Mr. RUSH changed his vote from ``yea'' to ``nay.''
  Mr. WENSTRUP changed his vote from ``nay'' to ``yea.''
  So the bill was passed.
  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
  Stated against:
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I 
been present, I would have voted ``Nay'' on rollcall No. 543.


                          personal explanation

  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, on rollcall Nos. 542 (passage of H.R. 3823), 
and 543 (passage of H.R. 2792) I did not cast my vote. Had I been 
present, I would have voted ``Yea'' on both these votes.


                          personal explanation

  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, September 28, 2017, I was 
unable to be present for recorded votes. On September 28, 2017, had I 
been present, I would have voted ``No'' on rollcall No. 541, the 
Democratic Motion to Recommit; I would have voted ``Yes'' on rollcall 
No. 542, H.R. 3823, the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway 
Extension Act of 2017; I would have voted ``Yes'' on rollcall No. 543, 
H.R. 2792, the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017.
