                      MEDIA IGNORES FACTS ON DACA

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, President Trump's recent decision to 
end the unconstitutional DACA program has received unfair criticism by 
the liberal media.
  When reporting on President Trump's decision to end the DACA program, 
outlets such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CBS all 
included former President Obama's criticism of the announcement. What 
is not being reported is that then-President Obama stated over 20 times 
before issuing DACA that executive amnesty is an overstep of executive 
authority and is unconstitutional.
  To use former President Obama's criticism of the termination of DACA 
without also noting that he, himself, considered DACA unconstitutional 
is biased reporting designed to promote a pro-amnesty agenda. It is no 
wonder that the media's credibility with the American people is now at 
a record low.
