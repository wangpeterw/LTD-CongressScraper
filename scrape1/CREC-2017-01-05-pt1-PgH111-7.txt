               OUR NEW ADMINISTRATION WILL SUPPORT ISRAEL

minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I stand today to express my extreme 
disappointment in the Obama administration's betrayal of Israel. The 
administration's destructive decision to undercut Israel has given 
leverage to anti-Israel boycotters and anti-Semites across the world.
  This act screamed of personal vengeance and hostility, directly 
harmed American interests, and undermined peace in the Middle East. It 
was a cowardly and foolish parting shot for an administration that 
flagrantly ignores serious global challenges--Syria, Aleppo, ISIS, 
Iran, China, Russia, and the list goes on.
  By abstaining from the vote to censure Israel, President Obama vetoed 
the U.S.-Israel alliance and violated the faith of the American people. 
I look forward to a new day, to a new administration that will support 
Israel and refuse to abandon our allies on the world stage.
