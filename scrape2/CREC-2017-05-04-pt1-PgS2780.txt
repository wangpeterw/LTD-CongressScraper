    SENATE RESOLUTION 158--RECOGNIZING THE CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL 
               SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CINCO DE MAYO HOLIDAY

  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Bennet, Ms. Cortez Masto, 
Mr. Cruz, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Franken, Mr. Gardner, Mr. Heinrich, Mrs. 
Murray, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Udall, Ms. Duckworth, and Mr. Cardin) 
submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 158

       Whereas May 5, or ``Cinco de Mayo'' in Spanish, is 
     celebrated each year as a date of importance by Mexican and 
     Mexican-American communities;
       Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday commemorates May 5, 1862, 
     the date on which Mexicans defeated the French at the Battle 
     of Puebla, one of the many battles that the Mexican people 
     won in their long and brave fight for independence, freedom, 
     and democracy;
       Whereas the victory of Mexico over France at Puebla 
     represented a historic triumph for the Mexican government 
     during the Franco-Mexican war fought between 1861 and 1867 
     and bolstered the resistance movement;
       Whereas the success of Mexico at the Battle of Puebla 
     reinvigorated the spirits of the Mexican people and provided 
     a renewed sense of unity and strength;
       Whereas the French army, which had not experienced defeat 
     against any of the finest troops of Europe in more than half 
     a century, sustained a disastrous loss at the hands of an 
     outnumbered and ill-equipped, but highly spirited and 
     courageous, Mexican army;
       Whereas the courageous spirit that Mexican General Ignacio 
     Zaragoza and his men displayed during that historic battle 
     can never be forgotten;
       Whereas, in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo symbolizes the 
     right of a free people to self-determination, just as Benito 
     Juarez, the president of Mexico during the Battle of Puebla, 
     once said, ``El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz'', meaning 
     ``respect for the rights of others is peace'';
       Whereas the sacrifice of Mexican fighters was instrumental 
     in keeping Mexico from falling under European domination 
     while, in the United States, the Union Army battled 
     Confederate forces in the Civil War;
       Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder that the 
     foundation of the United States was built by people from many 
     countries and diverse cultures who were willing to fight and 
     die for freedom;
       Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a reminder of the 
     close ties between the people of Mexico and the people of the 
     United States;
       Whereas Cinco de Mayo encourages the celebration of a 
     legacy of strong leaders and a sense of vibrancy in 
     communities; and
       Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder to provide more 
     opportunity for future generations: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) recognizes the historic struggle of the people of 
     Mexico for independence and freedom, which Cinco de Mayo 
     commemorates; and
       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
     Cinco de Mayo with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
