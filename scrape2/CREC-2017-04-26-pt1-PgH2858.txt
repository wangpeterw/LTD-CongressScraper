                    EXTEND CONRAD 30 WAIVER PROGRAM

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Conrad 30 
Waiver program set to expire at the end of this week. This program 
helps match medically underserved communities, both rural and urban, 
with much-needed doctors. Currently, foreign medical students studying 
here using J-1 visas must return to their home country and wait 2 years 
before they can apply to work in the United States. This makes no 
sense.
  The American medical education system attracts the best and the 
brightest and produces the best medical graduates in the world. When so 
many of our communities are struggling to attract medical 
professionals, we should be creating incentives for these newly trained 
doctors to stay.
  Through the Conrad 30 program, a limited number of new physicians can 
stay if they can commit to work 3 years in underserved communities. 
Continuing the Conrad 30 Waiver program is a commonsense step towards 
helping underserved Americans. I am proud to introduce H.R. 2141 with 
Congressman Issa of California to extend and expand this program.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the same.
