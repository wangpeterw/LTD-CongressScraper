              remarks to the longmont chamber of commerce

       I rise today to honor the Longmont Chamber of Commerce on 
     its 130th anniversary. For more than 100 years, this chamber 
     of commerce has been an important resource for businesses of 
     all sizes in the Longmont area.
       Colorado's Northern front range has experienced significant 
     growth within the past few years, with an influx of residents 
     moving to this region. Longmont, which sits in Weld and 
     Boulder counties, is now home to nearly 100,000 people. The 
     community's strong manufacturing, agriculture, and innovative 
     technology companies have all contributed to Longmont's 
     development.
       The Longmont Chamber of Commerce has been an active 
     participant in helping all industries succeed and grow. 
     Annual events, like the ``Unity in the Community'' event, 
     draw more than 1,000 representatives from business, 
     government, and nonprofit organizations. In addition, 
     Longmont has received multiple recognitions for its ability 
     to problem solve, and make their community a better place to 
     live for all residents. In 2006, Longmont received the All-
     America City Award from the National Civic League, and in 
     2008, was named as one of the Top 100 Best Places to Live by 
     Money Magazine.
       The Chamber of Commerce will continue to play a critical 
     role in the growth and development of Longmont, as the Front 
     Range sees an increase in population and business endeavors. 
     Longmont is fortunate to have a dedicated organization like 
     the Chamber helping its residents grow their businesses. 
     Congratulations to the Longmont Chamber of Commerce on 
     reaching this significant milestone.
