  RECOGNIZING THE CAROLINA YOUTH DEVELOPMENT CENTER'S NEW PARTNERSHIP

 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and 
congratulate the Carolina Youth Development Center, Cummins, Inc., and 
the Hootie and the Blowfish Foundation on its new partnership to 
provide youth aging out of foster care an independent living 
transitional house. The Carolina Youth Development Center has been a 
blessing to our State for over 200 years with their bold mission. They 
work tirelessly to empower and equip South Carolina's most vulnerable 
children by providing a safe environment, educational support, and 
career readiness.
  Carolina Youth Development Center has an impressive 227-year history 
of serving the community's most vulnerable children and families, 
dating back to its founding as the Charleston Orphan House in 1790. The 
agency remains steadfast in its commitment to youth in foster care and 
continues to lead the way, changing lives and transforming 
communities.
