                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God and Father of humanity, guide our lawmakers with Your Spirit of 
truth and love. During days of difficulty, help them to remember that 
You will never leave or forsake them. Lord, provide them with the 
wisdom, courage, and patience to do what is best for our Nation and 
world. Give us all grace to maintain our faith and freedom with 
righteousness, fostering peace and good will for the glory of Your 
Name. Hasten, Lord, that perfect day, when pain and death shall cease 
and Your just rule shall fill the Earth with health, light, and peace.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
