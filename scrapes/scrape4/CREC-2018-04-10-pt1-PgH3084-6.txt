                        ASSAD'S MURDEROUS ATTACK

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, the Syrian 
Assad dictatorship mercilessly used chemical weapons of mass 
destruction on the last rebel-held stronghold near Syria's capital, 
Damascus, murdering over 50 innocent people, including

women and children. This comes exactly 1 year after the chemical 
weapons attack that resulted in President Donald Trump's launching of 
Tomahawk cruise missiles at the air base that launched the chemical 
weapons attack.
  Assad's actions are a clear violation of international law and human 
rights, and the world must stand against this indiscriminate massacre.
  I am grateful for the leadership of President Donald Trump, United 
Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, and National Security Advisor John 
Bolton to address this threat to protect American families.
  I stand with Ambassador Haley in calling for the United Nations to 
adopt a resolution that would condemn the continuing use of chemical 
weapons in Syria in the strongest terms and to establish a new body to 
determine responsibility for chemical attacks anywhere in the world.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
