             HALLE THOMPSON LIVES AMONGST THE HEAVENLY HOST

  (Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, the image beside me is of a 
young lady named Halle Thompson, who was tragically killed in a car 
crash in my district. I penned this letter to her parents:
  ``Dear Mr. and Mrs. Thompson,
  ``Ryan, Janna, my own heart is rended as I pen this letter of 
encouragement and condolence.
  ``Your beautiful daughter Halle is, no doubt, in the presence of our 
beloved lady and our loving, forgiving Savior. You are each, no doubt, 
surrounded by the angels of Christ, as you endeavor each day to endure 
the grief of your loss, even as you present a strong and determined 
front to honor the life and spirit of your daughter.
  ``I have personal insight relative to your pain, having lost my own 
firstborn, my beautiful Daniela, long ago on the 10th day of November 
1990.
  ``I wish to compassionately convey it has come onto my heart that 
your Halle is present at this moment with my own Daniela, looking upon 
you both with adoration as you prayerfully honor and respect our Lord's 
mysterious will.
  ``Please know that my prayers are with you and that my own quiet 
service to America and our fellow man is dedicated this day to the 
beautiful Halle, angelic now, as she lives amongst the Heavenly Host.
  ``Respectfully, I remain, your humble servant.''
