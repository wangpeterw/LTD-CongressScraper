U.S. Navy tradition: the change of command at NSWC Crane, a vital 
military command in my district in southern Indiana, located on the 
Navy's third largest base in the world.

Oesterreich, and family, to southwest Indiana, we say good-bye to 
Captain J.T. Elder, who has steered this premier center of excellence

defense. I wish Captain Elder and Cynthia fair
