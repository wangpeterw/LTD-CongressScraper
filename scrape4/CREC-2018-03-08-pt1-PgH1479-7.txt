                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY

  (Mr. CAPUANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I, too, am here to recognize International 
Women's Day.
  We all know that women have made some progress over the years: the 
Family and Medical Leave Act, the Lilly Ledbetter Equal Pay Act. We 
have made progress, but we know there is more to do.
  This Congress and this President have to improve the Family and 
Medical Leave Act. We have to make sure the laws that we have are 
enforced, equal pay is made, and equal actions happen in the workplace. 
We are not doing it, and we all know that.
  And the truth is--when I am home--I tell people, when you look to 
Congress to lead, it is always a mistake. Most of the progress in this 
country comes from the bottom up. We are almost always last. I will 
give you an example.
  Years ago, George Bush vetoed the Family and Medical Leave Act four 
times. I was the mayor of my city, we did it on our own. The Federal 
Government didn't make us do it, and the State didn't make us do it.
  So I am here today to simply ask all Americans, at every level, to do 
what you can to equalize opportunity and treatment in this world. We 
don't have to wait for our government. There are people like me, Rosa 
DeLauro, and others who are going to continue to push, and we will make 
progress. But we all have our own individual responsibilities, and I 
call on all Americans to do that.
