           RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE

  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of privilege 
of the House and offer the resolution that was previously noticed.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.
  The Clerk read as follows:

                               Resolution

     Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, 
                                             of high misdemeanors.
       Resolved, That Donald John Trump, President of the United 
     States is unfit to be President and is impeached for high 
     misdemeanors, and that the following articles of impeachment 
     be exhibited to the Senate:
        Articles of Impeachment exhibited by the House of 
     Representatives of the United States, in the name of itself 
     and of the people of the United States, against Donald John 
     Trump, President of the United States, in maintenance and 
     support of its impeachment against him for high misdemeanors 
     committed as President constituting harm to American society 
     to the manifest injury of the people of the United States:


                               article i 

       In his capacity as President of the United States, 
     unmindful of the high duties of his high office and the 
     dignity and proprieties thereof, and of the harmony and 
     courtesies necessary for stability within the society of the 
     United States, Donald John Trump has with his statements done 
     more than insult individuals and groups of Americans, he has 
     harmed the society of the United States, brought shame and 
     dishonor to the office of President of the United States, 
     sowing discord among the people of the United States by 
     associating the majesty and dignity of the presidency with 
     causes rooted in white supremacy, bigotry, racism, anti-
     Semitism, white nationalism, or neo-Nazism on one or more of 
     the following occasions:
       On August 15, 2017, Donald John Trump made a widely 
     published statement characterizing a group of anti-Semites, 
     bigots, racists, white nationalists, and Ku Klux Klansmen who 
     rallied in Charlottesville, Virginia, as ``very fine 
     people''.
       On August 7, 2017, hate groups returned to Charlottesville, 
     Virginia, at the statue of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate 
     general, chanting ``You will not replace us!'' Since this 
     event on October 7, the President has made many widely 
     published statements about many things including, the 
     National Football League, but has not made one widely 
     published statement condemning the hate groups for returning 
     to the place where an innocent person lost her life at the 
     hands of hate.
       On November 29, 2017, Donald John Trump shared 3 videos 
     posted by a leader of a British political party considered by 
     many to be an extremist group. The videos purported to show 
     various violent acts committed by Muslims, and were entitled: 
     ``Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!''; ``Muslim 
     Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!''; and ``Islamist mob 
     pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!''. The 
     clearly inferable intent of the post was to demonstrate the 
     alleged propensity of Muslim immigrants to engage in violent 
     acts. Even if the videos showed what they purport to show, in 
     sharing these videos with his 43,800,000 followers on 
     Twitter, Donald John Trump's dissemination of such material 
     evinces an invidious intent to create division within 
     American society.
       In all of this, the aforementioned Donald John Trump, by 
     his statements, unmindful of the high duties of his high 
     office and the dignities and proprieties thereof, and of the 
     harmony, respect, and courtesies necessary for stability 
     within the society of the United States, has undermined the 
     integrity of his office, has sown discord among the people of 
     the United States, has brought disrepute, contempt, ridicule 
     and disgrace on the Presidency, has acted in a manner 
     antithetical to the cause of a just society, has betrayed his 
     trust as President to the manifest injury of the people of 
     the United States, and committed a high misdemeanor in 
     office.
       Therefore, Donald John Trump by causing such harm to the 
     society of the United States is unfit to be President and 
     warrants impeachment, trial, and removal from office.


                              article ii 

       In his capacity as President of the United States, 
     unmindful of the high duties of his high office, of the 
     dignity and proprieties thereof, and of the harmony, and 
     respect necessary for stability within the society of the 
     United States, Donald John Trump has with his statements done 
     more than simply insult individuals and groups of Americans, 
     he has harmed the American society by publicly casting 
     contempt on individuals and groups, inciting hate and 
     hostility, sowing discord among the people of the United 
     States, on the basis of race, national origin, religion, 
     gender and sexual orientation, on one or more of the 
     following occasions:
       On January 27, 2017, Donald John Trump issued Executive 
     Order 13769 providing for a partial shutdown of immigration 
     from mainly Muslim countries, to fulfill a campaign promise 
     that read as follows: ``DONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT ON 
     PREVENTING MUSLIM IMMIGRATION (New York, NY) December 7th, 
     2015--Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete 
     shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our 
     country's representatives can figure out what's going on'', 
     thereby casting contempt upon Muslims, inciting hate and 
     hostility, and sowing discord among the people of the United 
     States on the basis of religion.
       On July 26, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public statement 
     substantially as follows: ``After consultation with my 
     Generals and military experts, please be advised that the 
     United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender 
     individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. 
     Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming 
     victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical 
     costs and disruption that transgender in the military would 
     entail'', and thereby casting contempt on transgender 
     individuals, inciting hate and hostility, and sowing discord 
     among the people of the United States on the basis of gender.
       On September 23, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public 
     statement substantially as follows: ``Wouldn't you love to 
     see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our 
     flag, to say, `Get that son of a B-I-T-C-H off the field 
     right now, out, he's fired? He's fired!' '' thereby casting 
     contempt on professional football players who engaged in 
     constitutionally protected protests pertaining to allegations 
     of police misconduct with regard to racial minorities, as 
     well as casting contempt on the professional players' mothers 
     by calling the mothers ``B-I-T-C-H-E-S'', effectively calling 
     these mothers dogs, thereby inciting hate and hostility, and 
     sowing discord among the people of the United States on the 
     basis of race and gender.
       On September 30, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public 
     statement substantially as follows: ``They want everything to 
     be done for them when it should be a community effort'', in 
     the aftermath of Hurricane Maria thereby casting contempt on 
     Puerto Rican citizens of the United States, inciting hate and 
     hostility, and sowing discord among the people of the United 
     States based on national origin and race.
       On October 3, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public 
     statement substantially as follows: ``I hate to tell you, 
     Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of 
     whack because we spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico, that's 
     fine, we've saved a lot of lives'', but Donald John Trump did 
     not make similar comments about Texas or Florida in the 
     aftermath of Hurricane Harvey or Hurricane Irma, treating the 
     Puerto Rican citizens of the United States disparately, 
     thereby casting contempt on Puerto Ricans, inciting hate and 
     hostility, and sowing discord among the people of the United 
     States based on national origin and race.
       On October 19, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public 
     statement substantially as follows: ``The Fake News is going 
     crazy with wacky Congresswoman Wilson (D), who was SECRETLY 
     on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!'', 
     thereby casting contempt on an African-American Member of 
     Congress, inciting hate and hostility, and sowing discord 
     among the people of the United States based on gender and 
     race.
       On October 21, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public 
     statement substantially as follows: ``I hope the Fake News 
     Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that 
     she, as a representative, is killing the Democrat Party!'' 
     thereby casting contempt on an African-American female Member 
     of Congress, inciting hate and hostility, and sowing discord 
     among the people of the United States based on gender and 
     race.
       On October 22, 2017, Donald John Trump made a public 
     statement substantially as follows: ``Wacky Congresswoman 
     Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican 
     Party, a disaster for Dems. You watch her in action & vote 
     R!'' thereby casting contempt on an African-American female 
     Member of Congress inciting hate and hostility, and sowing 
     discord among the people of the United States based on gender 
     and race.
       In all of this, the aforementioned Donald John Trump has, 
     by his statements, brought the high office of President of 
     the United States in contempt, ridicule, disgrace and 
     disrepute, has sown discord among the people of the United 
     States, has demonstrated that he is unfit to be President and 
     has betrayed his trust as President of the United States to 
     the manifest injury of the people of the United States, and 
     has committed a high misdemeanor in office.
       Therefore, Donald John Trump, by causing such harm to the 
     society of the United States, is unfit to be President, 
     warrants impeachment, trial, and removal from office.
