                   RECOGNIZING TANIA PRATNICKI YOUNG

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a large number of 
dedicated autoworkers who live and work in Michigan's Seventh 
Congressional District. Today I want to recognize one of the truly 
exceptional ones, Tania Pratnicki Young, the plant manager at Dundee 
Engine Plant in Dundee, Michigan. Tania has been the plant manager 
since 2013 and recently reached a remarkable milestone: 40 years with 
the company.
  The Fiat Chrysler plant employs about 700 people and produces engines 
for various Dodge and Jeep products, including the Jeep Cherokee. Under 
Tania's leadership, Dundee was the first U.S. facility to be awarded 
silver status for implementing the principles of World Class 
Manufacturing. It shows her commitment to excellence in productivity, 
quality, and safety.
  Tania calls Dundee ``the family plant.'' I have had the privilege of 
touring the factory floor with her and was impressed by the efficiency 
of the plant and the friendliness of her team. Thanks to people like 
Tania Pratnicki Young, the auto industry is thriving in Michigan.
  Tania, congratulations on your 40-year anniversary.
