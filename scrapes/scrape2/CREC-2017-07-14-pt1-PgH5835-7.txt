                      COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING

  (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate for the victims of 
human trafficking and for the law enforcement and organizations who are 
on the front lines combating this growing problem. Human trafficking is 
a growing problem in Illinois where we rank ninth in the Nation in 
reported trafficking cases.
  Cases are on the rise nationwide. As a father of three and 
grandfather of 11, I am angry. We must wipe out this evil before it 
does any more harm.
  I am proud that Republicans and Democrats came together to pass three 
antitrafficking bills this week.
  Our work is far from over, but these bills are vitally important to 
help protect American families.
