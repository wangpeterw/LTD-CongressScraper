                      HONORING FRED KOREMATSU DAY

  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1

hardly imagine a more relevant time to celebrate his fight for freedom 
and equality.

are silent today, you would have been silent

  This great institution is facing an enormous test of our commitment 
to liberty and justice for all. Let our children and grandchildren look 
back and see that we passed that test.
