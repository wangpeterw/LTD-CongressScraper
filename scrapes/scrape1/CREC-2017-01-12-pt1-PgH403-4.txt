  CELEBRATING THE150TH ANNIVERSARY OF SAINT JAMES PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 150th 
anniversary of the Saint James Presbyterian Church ofGreensboro, North 
Carolina.
  As the third oldest African American church in Greensboro, Saint 
James is rich in history and tradition. Under theleadership of Reverend 
Dr. Diane Givens Moffett, Saint James embraces the theme: 150 Years, 
Celebrating Our Walk-in Faith andService.
  It is rare but wonderful to find a group of individuals who have 
thoroughly enriched their community through dedicatedservice and good 
works. It has been my unique honor to represent the good people of 
Saint James Presbyterian both in NorthCarolina and in the Congress for 
more than 30 years. Saint James has helped make Greensboro a more just 
and peaceful community,and for that, I am immensely proud.
  Congratulations, once again, Saint James, on your anniversary--a 
century plus five decades. I look forward to witnessing themany ways in 
which Saint James will continue to thrive during its next 150 years.
