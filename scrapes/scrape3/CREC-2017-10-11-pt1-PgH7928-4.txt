                         REFORMING THE TAX CODE

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about our efforts here 
in the people's House to reform our Tax Code and reduce the burden of 
the Federal Government on every American. Right now, Americans know 
that our Tax Code is unfair, it is too long, and it is too complicated.
  It has been 30 years since we have made meaningful reforms, and the 
time for that change is now. House and Senate Republicans have 
announced reforms that will make the Tax Code simpler, with more than 
90 percent of filers being able to do their returns on a simple 
postcard.
  We have asked to make the Tax Code fair for middle class Americans, 
lowering their rates and doubling their standard deduction. We have 
asked to give relief to low-income Americans by eliminating the lowest 
10 percent bracket completely and cutting the 15 percent bracket to 12. 
We have asked to crack down on tax avoidance by ending the dozens and 
dozens of loopholes that only the wealthiest taxpayers and corporations 
can take advantage of.
  Mr. Speaker, we have a unique opportunity to do so much for 
hardworking families across America. I hope that my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle will join us, offer solutions, and make this a 
bipartisan effort to give the American people the relief they deserve.
