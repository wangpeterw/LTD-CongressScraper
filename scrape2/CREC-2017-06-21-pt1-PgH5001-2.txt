                HONORING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM CHAD MULDER

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Arrington) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to a friend 
and an American hero.
  Chief Special Warfare Operator William Chad Mulder was a Navy SEAL 
and a highly decorated combat veteran receiving, among other honors, 
three Bronze Stars with Valor. He was a brother; he was a husband; he 
was a father; and he was a friend. William Chad Mulder, or ``Bill,'' as 
his friends knew him, concluded his mission here on this Earth June 9, 
2017.
  If anybody was ever born for battle, it was Bill Mulder. He seemed to 
come hardwired with a soldier's spirit. All who knew him felt safer on 
account of his service to our country. Bill was the ultimate warrior.
  Those of us who grew up with Bill in my hometown of Plainview, Texas, 
also knew him as the epitome of a Plainview Bulldog. He was 
tenderhearted, but he was tough. He was as caring as he was courageous, 
and he was as fun-loving as he was fearless.
  To his wife, Sydney: Thank you for loving Bill so well.
  To his children: His tender heart and his warrior spirit will live on 
through each of you.
  We are praying for all of you, and on behalf of Plainview High 
School, the class of 1989, and all of us who were fortunate enough to 
call Bill our friend, we are proud of you, Bill. You served with 
distinction and honor.
  Thank you for dedicating your life to keeping us safe. We will miss 
you, buddy.
