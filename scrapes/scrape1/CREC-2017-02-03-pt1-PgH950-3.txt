                       TRIBUTE TO DAN HALLIBURTON

  (Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a 
stalwart public servant. Dan Halliburton started his public service 
career as a law enforcement officer, eventually retiring in 2009 from 
the Ohio State Highway Patrol with over 32 years of service.
  But he didn't stop there. He felt the call to serve more, and in 
2010, Dan joined my team, tasked with representing the largest 
geographical and most rural district in the State of Ohio.
  Very quickly, Dan distinguished himself as a man of and for the 
people. He expertly managed my transportation so that we could be out 
amongst the people I represent. He built lasting relationships with 
local elected officials, law enforcement, and business owners. But what 
set Dan apart, was his genuine care and concern for the people of 
Appalachia. It was reflected in the high level of service he provided 
them.
  So on behalf of the hardworking people of eastern and southeastern 
Ohio, Godspeed to Dan Halliburton and his family as he begins his well-
deserved retirement.
