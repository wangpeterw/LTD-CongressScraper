                    NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National 
Hispanic Heritage Month. Each year, Americans observe National Hispanic 
Heritage Month from September 15 to October 15 to celebrate the 
contributions of Americans of Hispanic descent to our Nation's diverse 
history and culture.
  Our central Washington communities are blessed to include a growing 
number of Hispanic Americans, and I have witnessed firsthand the many 
ways Hispanic Americans strengthen our communities and our way of life. 
Hispanic Americans have greatly contributed to our country's history. 
These Americans have enhanced our economy through entrepreneurship, and 
many have served our Nation honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces.
  America is truly the world's melting pot where people of diverse 
backgrounds and cultures come together as one people united by shared 
values. We cherish our unity and diversity. In the upcoming month, we 
will celebrate Hispanic Americans' patriotism and the traditions they 
add to American culture.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring National Hispanic Heritage 
Month.
