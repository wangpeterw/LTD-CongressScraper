                        TRIBUTE TO ALEX LUPSAIU

 Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Alex Lupsaiu for his hard 
work as an intern in my Washington, DC, office. I recognize his efforts 
and contributions to my office, as well as to the State of Wyoming.
  Alex is a native of California. He attended the University of 
California, Los Angeles, and the University of Oxford, where he studied 
philosophy. He has demonstrated a strong work ethic, which has made him 
an invaluable asset to our office. The quality of his work is reflected 
in his great efforts over the last several months.
  I want to thank Alex for the dedication he has shown while working 
for me and my staff. It is a pleasure to have him as part of our team. 
I know he will have continued success with all of his future endeavors. 
I wish him all my best on his journey.
