                      TWO-STATE SOLUTION IN ISRAEL

  (Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we are going to be taking up a resolution 
that is designed to reflect our discontent with the resolution of the 
United Nations. I am totally in favor of expressing our discontent. I 
think we ought to cut our funds to the U.N. until such time as 
Resolution 2334 is repealed.
  But the resolution today, at four different places, refers to our 
push in the United States for a two-state solution in Israel. Look, 
Hebron is in what was the promised land. David ruled from there for the 
first 7 years he was King over Israel. Hebron is part of the two-state 
solution going to the Palestinians. How did the Palestinians deserve 
the land that was given as the promised land 1,600 years before 
Muhammad even existed?
  I can't vote for the resolution when we are advocating what Joel 3 
says will bring judgment down upon our Nation for trying to partition 
Israel--can't do it.
