                       MENTAL HEALTH AND THE ACA

  (Mrs. NAPOLITANO asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)

  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, one of ObamaCare's most critical 
successes was increased mental health services.
  Because of ACA, over 48 million are now covered by mental health and 
parity laws. Insurance companies can no longer denycoverage for 
patients needing mental health services, but we do need tougher 
enforcement on this, as well as the insurance rateincreases.
  The ACA expanded Medicaid, the single largest payer of behavioral 
health services, to a new population. That has allowedover 1.6 million 
Americans to gain access to substance abuse treatment.
  Last month, we signed into law reforms to mental health and substance 
abuse grants and services. Repealing ACA would harmthose advances. ACA 
should be strengthened, not repealed, so more Americans have access to 
lifesaving mental health services.
  We must move mental health forward, not back. Support ACA.
