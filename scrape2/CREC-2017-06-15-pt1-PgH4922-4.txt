                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Almighty God, thank You for giving us another day. In Your presence, 
dark nights of challenges are dispelled by the dawn of Your love, and 
You know our needs before we express them.
  Thank You for daily providing our lawmakers with guidance and 
strength.
  We pause to thank You for the courage and sacrificial service of our 
Capitol Police. Forgive us when we take their daily courageous service 
for granted.
  Forgive us also when we seem to forget that words matter and can 
become seeds that will bring a bitter harvest.
  Bring speedy healing to our brother Steve Scalise, and all those 
injured in yesterday's shooting. Bring peace and solace to all those 
affected by yesterday's tragedy.
  Today, use the Members of this people's House as instruments of Your 
peace, bringing unity from division, light from darkness, joy from 
sadness, and hope from despair.
  Dear God, continue to bless America, and may all that is done this 
day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
