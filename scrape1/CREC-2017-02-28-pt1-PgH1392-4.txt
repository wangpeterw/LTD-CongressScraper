           By Mr. PRICE of North Carolina:
       H.R. 1239.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       As described in Article 1, Section 1, ``all legislative 
     powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the 
     United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of 
     Representatives.''
       Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the Constitution provides 
     Congress with the authority to ``provide for the common 
     Defense and general Welfare'' of Americans.
       The intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the 
     United States government, including those under Title 50 of 
     the United States Code, are carried out to support the 
     national security interests of the United States, to support 
     and assist the armed forces of the United States, and to 
     support the President in the execution of the foreign policy 
     of the United States.
       In the Department of Education Organization Act (P.L. 96-
     88), Congress declared that `` the establishment of a 
     Department of Education is in the public interest, will 
     promote the general welfare of the United States, will help 
     ensure that education issues receive proper treatment at the 
     Federal level, and will enable the Federal Government to 
     coordinate its education activities more effectively.'' The 
     Department of Education's mission is to ``promote student 
     achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by 
     fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.''
