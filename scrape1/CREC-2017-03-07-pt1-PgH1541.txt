                         HONORING REILLY RENKEN

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Reilly Renken, a remarkable young lady making a big difference in 
central Illinois.
  Just after she was born, Reilly was diagnosed with a rare genetic 
abnormality, along with a form of epilepsy that severely impacts her 
neurological development. Her parents were told by numerous specialists 
that she would need support for the rest of her life and that she would 
likely never read or write. But Reilly proved them wrong. While her 
genetic makeup is one of a kind, she also has a one-of-a-kind 
personality.
  Despite the obstacles she has overcome, Reilly was determined to be a 
cheerleader. Now she is an integral part of the cheerleading squad at 
Glenwood Middle School in Chatham, Illinois.
  Cheering on the Titans has become one of Reilly's greatest joys, and 
her presence on the squad has been a joy for her teammates as well. 
They will tell you that they wouldn't be the squad they are without 
Reilly and her positive attitude. She brings life to their practices 
and they always count on her to make them smile.
  Reilly is a true inspiration. She shows all of us what is possible 
when we put our minds to something. Thanks to her, students at Glenwood 
Middle School have learned the importance of celebrating our 
differences.
  Way to go, Reilly.
