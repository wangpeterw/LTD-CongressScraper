                      ARE WE LOSING OUR DEMOCRACY?

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, are we losing our democracy?
  CNN has censored and refused to air an ad by Trump for President, 
claiming that it is inaccurate. Of course, that is their opinion and 
they are entitled to it. What they are not entitled to do is violate 
the Constitution's protection of free speech.
  Where are all the editorial boards of the media who rightly advocate 
for free speech? Why are most silent?
  To censor a political ad because CNN disagrees with it is to threaten 
our democratic form of government.
