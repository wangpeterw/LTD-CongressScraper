                           CRUELTY TO ANIMALS

  (Mr. ROSKAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, cruelty to animals is a scourge, and there 
is no worse example than animal fighting that is for so-called pleasure 
and definite profit.
  I am pleased today to introduce the Parity in Animal Cruelty 
Enforcement Act, which is to close a loophole.
  Animal fighting is prohibited in the United States, but it is allowed 
in some U.S. territories. This is important for us because what we have 
is a situation where animals are manipulated, drugged, and put into 
situations where their aggression is heightened. It is disgusting.

  I am pleased to join with friends on the other side of the aisle--
Messrs. Blumenauer and Nolan--and Representatives on the Republican 
side--Messrs. Rodney Davis, Yoder, and Knight--to come together on a 
bipartisan basis to address this trouble. I ask for cosponsors.
