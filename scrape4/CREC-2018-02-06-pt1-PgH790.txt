           CONCERNS REGARDING THE NEW NUCLEAR POSTURE REVIEW

  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, with all that is going on in Washington, 
D.C., these days, it is really hard to keep up with some things that 
are amazingly consequential. One item that is flying below the radar 
screen is the new Nuclear Posture Review from the Trump administration. 
They are talking about expanding our nuclear arsenal, embarking us on a 
path of spending $1.2 trillion.
  Not only do we have more than we need already that we can't afford to 
use and pay for; we are talking about other elements here that are 
disturbing: developing new destabilizing nuclear weapons; being able to 
use nuclear weapons in nonnuclear situations, for example, responding 
to cyber attacks when you might not even know who did it.
  We still have all these land based ballistic missiles in silos on 
hair-trigger alert. We just saw the vulnerability there in Hawaii with 
the recent mistaken threat of an attack send a whole state into panic.
  We need to take a hard look at how to do this right before it is too 
late.
