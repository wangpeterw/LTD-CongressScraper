                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Father in Heaven, Holy is Your Name. You brought light from darkness 
and order from chaos. You can bring order to our Nation and world. Use 
our lawmakers to fulfill Your purposes. May they become Your merciful 
hands to reduce the pain and discord in our world.
  Lord, use their daily experiences of joy and sorrow, pleasure and 
pain, victory and defeat for Your glory. Protect them with Your shield 
of love as You fill their hearts with Your peace. May they not let evil 
talk pass their lips but strive to speak the truth in love. Infuse them 
with the spirit of kindness, compassion, and forgiveness.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
