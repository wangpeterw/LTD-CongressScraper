                         RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DAY

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on Religious Freedom Day, to 
recognize the importance of religious freedom throughout the world and 
to celebrate the 232nd anniversary of the passing of the Virginia 
Statute for Religious Freedom.
  As a Catholic, my faith plays a significant role in every aspect of 
life and fosters a respect for the religious rights and freedoms of 
others.
  Fundamental American values, among which are commitments to religious 
freedom and human rights, will always be cornerstones of both U.S. 
domestic and foreign policy.
  Written by Thomas Jefferson, the Virginia Statute for Religious 
Freedom is the forerunner of the First Amendment protection for 
religious freedom and the principle of separation of church and state.
  As a member of the Religious Minorities in the Middle East Caucus, I 
will continue to advocate for the rights of individuals to express 
their feelings without living in fear of violence and persecution.
