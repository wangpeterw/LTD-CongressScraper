After completing basic training at Parris Island, South Carolina, he was assigned to the USS Bennington in June 1953.  On May 26, 1954, the USS Bennington was sailing off the coast of Rhode Island for aircraft carrier qualification when hydraulic fluid from a forward catapult caught fire. The resulting explosion caused massive damage to the forward portion of the ship. It resulted in over 200 casualties, including 103 sailors and marines who lost their lives that day.

12789,topic-id,284,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2742, the Modernizing the Interstate Placement of Children in Foster Care  Children who cannot be safely returned home deserve to be placed in the best setting possible for them, regardless of the State where the setting is located; and no child should have to wait to move to that best setting because it is across the State line.                              {time}  1715  Separation from a parent or long-term caregiver is always traumatic for a child. Even if relatives come forward right away, it may take months to get licensed, months in which the child may bond with the foster family. When the relative lives in another State, the licensing process can often take as long as 6 months, so that might mean 6 months in foster care. Sometimes our well-intentioned efforts to protect children actually do them more harm.  H.2742 provides States with resources to automate this process so that social workers no longer have to photocopy documents and submit them on paper through a succession of offices.  Last year, the National Foster Youth Institute organized a listening tour in Representative Vicky Hartzler's district; and during a meeting with child welfare professionals, they described the challenges they face when relatives are identified in different States and they are unable to quickly place the child with family and must keep the child in foster care. The judges, social workers, and families specifically requested Members of Congress to change the law and asked the National Foster Youth Institute to please advocate for change. I look forward to communicating with Representative Hartzler and her constituents about this legislation.  I ask my colleagues to support the legislation sponsored by Representatives Walorski and Davis, H.2742.

12738,topic-id,246,"Mr.Speaker, today is National Missing Children's This day of recognition was started by President Reagan in 1983 to raise awareness of the threat of child abduction, and reminds us today that we still have work to do.  Following the tragic murder of 9-year-old Amber Hagerman in 1996, Congress authorized the AMBER Alert system to create a coordinated alert system to assist law enforcement in finding abducted children in the important first hours after an abduction. Since its inception, more than 800 children have been recovered through the use of the AMBER Alert system.  However, the original legislation did not include Indian Tribes as eligible users of the program, and we saw the tragic effects of this exclusion when 11-year-old Ashlynne Mike was abducted and murdered on the Navajo  For this reason, I have introduced the AMBER Alert in Indian Country This act will include our 567 Federally recognized tribes as partners in the AMBER Alert Program to ensure that everyone is able to utilize this important tool. My bill is a bipartisan effort and it is endorsed by criminal justice, child safety groups, and Indian Tribes around the country.  Mr.Speaker, the AMBER Alert has helped many families experience the joy of being reunited with an abducted child. It is time we extend this alert to Indian Country so that no child is outside the jurisdiction of this vital program.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so we can continue to protect our children.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgH4592-3.txt,99999999999999,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,25.0,July

13016,topic-id,624,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying resolution.  Congressional Review Act resolutions must follow a prescribed form according to law. This rule provides for consideration of H.111 in keeping with that form.[[Page H6226]]  Madam Speaker, we are here today to prevent Federal overreach by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, also known as the According to the D.Circuit Court, this unaccountable government agency has more unilateral authority than any single commissioner or board member in any other independent agency in the United States  On July 10, 2017, the CFPB exercised that vast authority by issuing a 776-page final rule that restricts the ability of consumers to enter into arbitration agreements. The CFPB's misguided rule effectively eliminates arbitration clauses, instead forcing consumers into significantly more burdensome court proceedings. Eliminating this overbearing rule is a big win for consumers.  Arbitration is an alternative to the judicial system, and it often results in a better outcome for consumers. According to the CFPB's own study, arbitration can be up to 12 times faster than litigation. This study also found that a class action lawsuit's average payout was just $32 per person, not even close to the $5,389 awarded on average from arbitration.  Moreover, it costs less for consumers to file an arbitration complaint than it does to file a new complaint in Federal court, making the arbitration system more accessible to all  Arbitration allows parties to use an independent mediator, instead of hiring expensive lawyers, to settle a dispute. While the rule promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a bad deal for consumers, it is a huge win for trial lawyers, who make an average of $1 million per case.  The legislation being considered today would eliminate the CFPB's prohibition on an individual's right to enter into contracts that include arbitration agreements.  The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to eliminate a rule from the executive branch, and prevents a substantially similar rule from being proposed in its place.  Checks and balances between the three branches of government are the cornerstone of our The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to exercise our Article I authority and stop executive overreach that was never intended by the original legislation.  The Congressional Review Act is a powerful tool because it only requires 51 votes to pass in the To date, Congress has passed 14 CRAs that have been signed by the One by one, we have eliminated Obama administration rules that harm Americans and small businesses across this country.  Despite the work we have ahead, these CRAs are important to bringing regulatory relief to millions of President Trump campaigned on a promise to end government overregulation that hurts Americans and small businesses. He turned those words into action by signing an executive order that requires two regulations be eliminated for every new regulation that is proposed.  President Trump has exceeded those expectations in his first 6 months. For every new proposed rule, he has eliminated 16 regulations.  Unfortunately, he has limited tools to rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, because it was designed to be unaccountable under Dodd-This is an agency that continues to be run by an unchecked The structure of the bureau has even been ruled unconstitutional by the judicial branch.  A few weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed legislation to restructure the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, restoring congressional oversight duties and moving the agency back under the regular legislative appropriations process.

13032,topic-id,1055,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been a continuous example of Federal overreach. Once again, bureaucrats in Washington have created a rule that will hurt consumers and make their lives more difficult.  The last 8 years of overregulation have crippled our economy. Today, we have a chance to end this antiarbitration rule and empower consumers with an alternative to spending years in a courtroom.  We can't let concerns about the trial lawyer lobby impact the way we treat consumers. Trial lawyers love this rule enacted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because they will be the biggest beneficiaries. They will walk home with the big winnings, while the individuals who have been harmed walk away with little.  Arbitration allows harmed individuals to receive payouts on the merits of their case without enriching the pockets of trial lawyers at the same time. This legislation is for consumers. It is for the average American who relies on our financial system every day.  Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Sessions and Chairman Hensarling for bringing this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues now to vote ``yes'' on the resolution, and then to vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 468 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       Sec 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     2933) to promote effective registered apprenticeships, for      skills, credentials, and employment, and for other purposes.      The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All      points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.      General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not      exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair      and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and      the After general debate the bill shall be      considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.

The previous      question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and      amendments thereto to final passage without intervening      motion except one motion to recommit with or without      instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports      that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the      next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the      third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,      resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.2933.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not[[Page H6232]]     merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the      previous question is a vote against the Republican majority      agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer      an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should      be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

Although many of these are regulated under the Controlled Substances Act, current law does not specifically authorize the transportation or administration of such substances away from their registered location. Currently, the Controlled Substances Act does not specifically authorize the transportation and the administration of controlled substances away from the location registered with the Drug Enforcement  In order to ensure appropriate oversight of this practice, H.1492 would establish a separate registration process for mobile practitioners who are already registered with the DEA and in good standing.  For a practitioner to transport and administer controlled substances pursuant to this new registration, he or she must be licensed, registered, or otherwise permitted by the State in which the substances are administered to carry out such activity at the location where it occurs.  In addition, the practitioner must limit the time of transport to not more than 72 consecutive hours and return any such substances not administered to their registered location from which they were obtained.  Further, the practitioner must maintain records of the transporting and administering, and DEA would maintain the authority to deny or revoke a registration.

12900,topic-id,240,"Mr.Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to cut waste and strengthen our military installations.  This amendment would require the Department of Defense to ensure that there is not usable space available on a military installation before entering into expensive leases or purchasing additional property.  To put this into context, you wouldn't lease space in a parking lot if you already had room in your own garage to park your car.  This amendment is needed because, while asking for another round of base realignments and closures, the Department of Defense leased more than 6,000 buildings in fiscal year 2015 instead of using available space that it already owns.  That sounds like a waste to me.  My Congressional district is home to the Rock Island Arsenal, and we're proud to have it as part of our community.  It houses the Army's only remaining foundry and employs more than 6,000 hardworking people.  But like many of our military installations, it has room for more.  We should be using facilities like the Arsenal to their full potential, especially when it means we can reduce overall costs.  That's why I'm offering this amendment today.

12836,topic-id,204,"Mr.Chairman, this straightforward and bipartisan amendment would provide important clarity for the recreational marine industry as it relates to workers' compensation coverage.  For decades, Federal law stated that individuals who build, dismantle, or repair recreational vessels less than 65 feet could be covered under State workers' compensation law instead of the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation  Under the Democrat-controlled Congress in 2009, the law was simplified by eliminating the size limitation, which allowed more employers to purchase State workers' compensation.  Unfortunately, in 2011, the Department of Labor issued a burdensome and confusing rule creating a new definition of recreational vessel. This change contradicted legislation passed by the Congress in 2009, and effectively denied recreational vessel repair workers access to more affordable State workers' compensation insurance.  This regulatory confusion and uncertainty is reducing access to affordable workers' compensation policies and also hurting the overall recreational repair industry.  Our bipartisan amendment increases strong protections to ensure that no vessel used for commercial or military purposes is inappropriately excepted from the Federal requirements.  This amendment would provide regulatory relief for small businesses, including those in coastal Alabama, while also ensuring the maritime workers receive the protections they need.

He served in the Justice Department and in the private practice of law. He served as Deputy General Counsel at the Department of He also has been involved in the Department of Commerce, where he was General Counsel and Deputy He is well familiar with government. He served in public positions and also brings private experience as a lawyer to the position of Deputy Secretary of  I do want to point out--as I pointed out to Mr.Sullivan and as most members of our committee did--that he will find himself home alone for a period of time, in that the Trump administration has not submitted to Congress nominees for important positions at the Department of Yes, I have confidence in the career people at the Department of State, but there are times that we have to have a confirmed person in control in order to advance policies. So it is important--from embassy security, to fighting terrorism, to helping with the humanitarian challenges we have around the world and the administration of our missions in all the countries around the world--that we have a team in place. The Trump administration has been slow in providing us with qualified individuals to fill these positions. Thus far, the administration has decided to treat the State Department as an inconvenience rather than as a critical national security asset.  Secondly, I want to express my concern about something that will make Mr.Sullivan's job a lot more difficult--the international affairs budget for fiscal year 2018 that the administration is unveiling today. Although we are still receiving details, as I look at the massive spending cuts to vital national security, it is impossible to conclude this is anything but an ``America alone'' budget--one that, if enacted, will have disastrous effects on our standing in the world.  Let me repeat one more time that the money we spend on development assistance, on diplomacy, and that we spend in regard to helping our allies around the world and countries around the world is part of our national security budget. It is part of our national security budget, and yet the President's fiscal year 2018 budget would compromise national security.  As Secretary Mattis has said--often quoted on this floor--if you don't give the Secretary of State and the State Department the resources they need, you better be prepared to give them more ammunition and more soldiers because it is going to be more costly for them to defend.  It is very disappointing that the budget slashes critical support to our allies in their efforts to defeat terrorism, including zeroing out counterinsurgency support in Afghanistan, Iraq, and It will slash funds to support the defense needs of countless foreign partner countries and offer them the unpalatable option of going into debt to the United States to get the defense equipment and support they need. This is certain to damage our security, counterterrorism, and security interests with these countries and prove a golden opportunity for Russia and China to take the place of the United This is serious business. If we don't help countries that are part of our coalition against terrorism, if we don't give them the resources to help us, then, quite clearly, our enemies will move in. As we know, Russia has done many things against U.interests. The voids will be quickly picked up by Russia and  This is a budget proposal that cuts support to European allies to counter Russia's aggression--precisely when Russia's assault on our democracy and the democracies of our European democracies has reached a fever pitch. At a time when the United States should be standing up for our allies and partners in Europe, this budget zeros out the Assistance for Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia--AEECA--account and eliminates the European Reassurance Initiative altogether. This was an initiative that was set up to counter Russia's influence in Europe, and we are going to zero that out?  This is a budget proposal that walks away from the promotion of democratic values. It slashes funding for human rights and democracy programs abroad and hollows out the ideas, initiatives, and institutions on which U.leadership and international order rests, like the United Nations  In his remarks in Saudi Arabia this past weekend, President Trump applauded Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees. Yet draconian humanitarian funding cuts would harm these very friends and allies who are hosting millions of refugees. What an inconsistent message. It also eliminates the U.emergency food aid program at a time of famine in Africa and the Middle If these budget cuts are implemented, many people around the world will die as a result of diminished resources and support that would result. We can't let that happen.  It is a budget proposal that undermines our ability to deal with pressing national security challenges, including development assistance, humanitarian aid, and climate change. The administration's budget proposal slashes more than 30 percent from our foreign assistance budget and dramatically cuts support for critical programs to save the lives of mothers in childbirth, feed hungry children, educate young people, train farmers, and the like. These programs exemplify U.values and promote the power of democracy and the importance of protecting human rights.[[Page S3080]]  America's trademark is its values, what we stand for, our leadership globally, and this budget would compromise our ability to promote American values.  This is a penny wise, pound foolish budget, as the security challenges that will grow from these humanitarian catastrophes will dwarf the cost of helping to address the challenges before they metastasize into failed states and havens for extremism. If we don't help, we will have to pay on the other end.  When we fail to help countries provide the stability they need to take care of their population, they become a breeding ground for terrorists. We then have to respond with the use of our military, and it is much more costly. It costs people their lives.  Climate change--perhaps the most pressing national security challenge that faces the globe in the 21st century--receives less than just neglect; this is a budget that actively provides a catastrophic effect on climate-induced instability. We will not be able to respond to our international obligations in regard to climate change.  I understand that for Mr.Sullivan, if confirmed, this is the budget proposal he has to accept and defend; however, both he and Secretary Tillerson should be put on notice that I--and I think I speak for a number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--consider this budget dead on arrival. I would call on him to consider how, if confirmed, he will work with the Senate to develop a more serious budget proposal over the coming months that safeguards and promotes American interests in the world, that deepens our partnerships and alliances, that is sufficient to meet the challenges of an increasingly aggressive Russia and increasingly assertive China on the world stage, that provides our Nation the tools it needs to address the pressing humanitarian crises and challenges, and that supports and defends our universal values in the best tradition of our  That is what we need to do as a We are the ones who will pass the budget.

Bonnie has not only been a trusted member of my staff but a very close family friend.  Bonnie was born and raised on a turkey farm in Leck Kill, She is the youngest of four children. She first began her public service career in county government at what was then known as the Northumberland County Mental Health and Mental Retardation Department, where she touched the lives of people in her community.  In pursuit of a college degree, Bonnie attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania and graduated cum laude with a degree in education. After graduation, she worked as a special education teacher.  Bonnie's passion for helping others steered her career to the Pennsylvania State While working in the Pennsylvania Senate, she was asked by her supervisor if she was interested in working on my father's transition team after he was elected Governor of Pennsylvania in 1986. This transition job offer was supposed to be temporary, but Bonnie would spend the next 30 years working in State government for both then-Governor Casey and then me, when I got to State government years later.  She worked as the Governor's executive assistant for 8 years, and of course she wore many hats, managing the Governor's staff, scheduling events, and resolving constituent issues, but her most important role was providing support to the Her dedication and loyalty earned her the respect of her fellow employees in the Governor's office as well as those she worked with outside of the office.

When I was elected State treasurer in 2004, Bonnie began work with the Treasury Then, finally, when I was elected in 2006 to the Senate, I asked Bonnie to serve as director of constituent services. I knew that her dedication to public service and compassion for others would make her an excellent director. She led the office of constituent services for 10 years with distinction.

I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which is a necessary response to alleviate the strain on certain bankruptcy courts that have experienced a significant increase in bankruptcy filings over the past decade or more.  Importantly, this legislation adopts the recommendations of the Judicial Conference of the United States, the national policymaking body of the federal courts, and does not impose additional fees on ordinary consumer debtors or small businesses.  As the Conference notes in support of this measure, while bankruptcy filings have decreased nationwide, the bankruptcy courts that would receive permanent or new judgeships under this legislation ``have seen weighted filings increase by more than 55 percent.''  Furthermore, without this legislation, all 14 temporary judgeships covered by this bill will lapse later this month on May 25.  Allowing a lapse in these judgeships would have potentially crippling effects on the bankruptcy system.  For example, five of the six authorized judgeships of the U.Bankruptcy Court of the District of Delaware--the preferred venue for corporate reorganization under Chapter 11--are temporary.

13050,topic-id,1154,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, Chairman Goodlatte, for his work on this matter and for yielding the time. I appreciate his leadership in bringing this forward.  I rise in support, Mr.Speaker, of this resolution, 76, offered by the gentleman from Maryland, the minority whip, Mr.We have very much a regional partnership that is essential for Metro, and this resolution today reflects that. It lends congressional approval to the new interstate compact between Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia to establish an independent State safety oversight program, in this case known as the Metro Safety  The previous iteration of the Metro safety oversight body was known as the Tri-State Oversight Commission, and in response to various accidents, inadequacies, and outright failures, the previous Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Foxx, used the authority that we in Congress, together, working with our regional delegation together, gave him to temporarily take over the safety oversight role of Metro through the Federal Transit But it was only meant to be temporary control. We still need a permanent body to provide this invaluable safety oversight for WMATA, and the passage of this legislation in the House today brings us one important step closer to that goal.  I also would like to mention that, because we had not done this in the timeframe initially allowed, the FTA did give notice to the Metro Safety Commission it had to be in place on or before February 9, and when it wasn't,[[Page H5898]]they suspended some of our Federal funds.  Now, with this today, we hope this initial withholding, which equated to $8.9 million and is expected could total $15 million, that now that can move forward.  I have a letter that I include in the Record, which is signed by our regional delegation in support of now releasing those funds                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 2017.     Elaine Chao,     Secretary, U.Department of Transportation,     Washington,       Dear Secretary Chao, As representatives of public transit      customers in the Commonwealth of Virginia, we write to      express our concerns regarding the Federal Transit      Administration's (FTA) February 10, 2017 decision to withhold      federal transit grant money in response to incomplete efforts      to establish a new State Safety Oversight Program (SSOP) for      the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).       On February 8, 2016, the FTA gave notice that the      Metropolitan Safety Commission (MSC), a new SSOP to succeed      WMATA's Tri-State Oversight Commission, must be in place and      certified by the FTA on or before February 9, 2017. On      February 10, 2017, with no new SSOP certified, the FTA      announced it would exercise its authority to withhold five      percent of federal funds authorized in fiscal year 2017 under      the Urbanized Area Apportionments Program (49 U.S.5307).      The initial withholding equated to $8.9 million, and is      expected to total $15 million if he withholding continues to      the end of the current fiscal year. This withholding will not      just impact funding for WMATA, but for broader infrastructure      maintenance throughout Virginia, Maryland, and Washington,      D.      The decision to withhold these federal funds has created      significant uncertainty amongst state and local governments      in terms of budget planning and stability. Should the      withholding of funds continue throughout the remainder of the      fiscal year, the governments and their transit systems will      be faced with a number of difficult decisions about the      manner in which they allocate their limited resources. Under      a worst-case scenario, they would be forced to make cuts to      state of good repair efforts or reduce service to their      respective communities, either of which would be harmful to      our constituents. We agree safety must be a top priority, but      eliminating funding for infrastructure repair would directly      contradict a SSOP's stated goal.       Given the FTA must engage in this process with 29 other      transit agencies nationwide by 2019, we appreciate the      complexity of the issues that were considered in making the      decision to withhold these funds. However, we must      emphasize--as many of us have expressed previously either      directly to you, your predecessor, or the FTA--that the      timing of both the notice and the deadline set by FTA were      arbitrary in that there seemed to be little or no      consideration of the legislative calendars of the Virginia      General Assembly or the General Assembly of       The FTA timetable effectively gave Virginia and Maryland      less than one full legislative session to negotiate amongst      each other and the District, draft the proposal, navigate it      through the respective lawmaking bodies, and sign it into      law. The unreasonable requirements FTA put forth were not      simply for the SSOP to have a legal foundation by the      February 2017 deadline, but to have the program fully      certified by FTA, which necessitates months of work after      passing legislation, including, but not limited to,      appointing commissioners, hiring staff, and leasing office      space. We are therefore led to believe that FTA either set      their requirements without providing fair consideration to      the unique institutional challenges that exist within the      jurisdictions, or the FTA set them with a deadline so      unrealistic that failure was unavoidable.       Given the concerns we have raised in this letter regarding      FTA's shortsighted approach to this matter, and in light of      the demonstrated progress which has been made, we      respectfully request that your office work with the FTA to      explore a compromise in which part of these withheld funds      can be released as a show of good faith, as the jurisdictions      continue their work to construct a stable       Lending further justification for this request is the real      progress that has been made with respect to organizing the      At the time this is written:       Virginia, Maryland, and the District (the jurisdictions)      have each enacted legislation to enter into an interstate      compact to form the MSC;       The jurisdictions have submitted a detailed draft      certification plan to FTA for review (though FTA has not yet      provided formal feedback on the plan);       Joint resolutions have been introduced in both the House of      Representatives and the Senate to grant Congressional      approval to the MSC compact;       The Senate has passed its version of the joint resolution;       The House Judiciary Committee, which has sole jurisdiction      over the joint resolution, has ordered the House's parallel      version of the resolution to be reported favorably to the      full House; and       We are requesting that the measure be taken up for      consideration as soon as possible.

But we must find an equitable solution to this      matter.       We look forward to partnering with you, Madam Secretary, as      well as the FTA to ensure safety remains the top priority in      all transit systems and that reforms are made to accomplish a      transit agency that provides safe, reliable service to our      constituents.

12965,topic-id,481,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.2266, the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017, which would make 14 temporary bankruptcy judgeships permanent and authorize four additional bankruptcy judgeships.  I introduced this bipartisan legislation together with the support of Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte, along with Regulatory Reform,[[Page H4247]]Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee Chairman Marino and Ranking Member H.2266 warrants the support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for several reasons.  To begin with, this measure reflects the recommendations of the Judicial Conference of the United States with respect to the judicial resource needs of our Nation's bankruptcy courts. These recommendations are themselves based on a comprehensive survey of all judicial circuits.  This analysis consists of two components. The first is premised on a case-weight formula devised by the Federal Judicial Center that is intended to provide a more accurate and useful measure of judicial workload than a mere count of case filings.  The second component considers a broad array of other factors, including the nature of a court's caseload, filing trends, demographic considerations, geographic issues, and economic aspects, among other items.  Taken together, the resulting analysis provides a reliable basis upon which Congress may assess the necessity of authorizing additional judgeships and extending temporary judgeships.  In addition, H.2266 addresses an immediate need. All of the temporary judgeships addressed in H.2266 will lapse as of May 25, which is just a week away.  Once a temporary judgeship lapses, any ensuing vacancy may not be filled, which presents a serious concern. As the Judicial Conference warns, these bankruptcy courts would ``face a serious and, in many cases, debilitating workload crisis if their temporary judgeships were to expire.''  This is particularly true with respect to the Eastern District of Michigan, which has a weighted caseload well in excess of the minimum necessary to trigger additional judicial resources.  Although Congress has previously extended temporary bankruptcy judgeships from time to time, some have also lapsed as a result of Congress' failure to timely act. So to avoid future lapses in judicial resources, my legislation converts 14 of these temporary judgeships to permanent status.  Finally, I am pleased to report that H.2266 pays for all of these judgeships without having to require consumer debtors to bear that expense. The cost of this legislation is offset by increasing the quarterly fees that the largest 10 percent of chapter 11 debtors pay to the United States Trustee System Fund, a proposal initially made by the Obama administration as part of the President's budget request for 2017.  Specifically, the fee increase would apply only to chapter 11 debtors that have quarterly disbursements in excess of $1 million and only during the period when the fund has less than $200 million.  For all of these various reasons, I support this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

13000,topic-id,408,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.1842, a bill that is intended to address gaps in our child protection laws.  Now, this bill makes a number of changes to the Federal criminal code that, unfortunately, makes the same error that was previously made. It results in the expanded imposition of mandatory minimum sentences. I don't know where we get this notion that mandatory minimum sentences are a solution.  H.1842 amends section 2250(d) of the criminal code, which provides for an enhanced penalty for sex offenders who commit a crime of violence while in noncompliance of sex offender registration and reporting requirements.  In addition to the Federal crimes of violence already included in that statute, this bill would add State crimes of violence as predicate offenses that, in turn, would require the imposition of a mandatory 5-year prison sentence to be served consecutively to any sentence imposed for failing to register or comply with sex offender registration and reporting requirements.  H.1842 would also add prior military child sex offenses to several recidivist sentencing provisions, most of which carry mandatory minimum penalties of at least 15 years or life, itself.  Perhaps we should expand coverage of enhanced sentences for the offenses added by this bill, but we should do so without expanding the number of mandatory minimums. The judges, not the Congress--not us--are in the best position to impose sentences for even the most offensive criminal violations because they know the facts and circumstances of each case.                              {time}  1700  There is an increasing bipartisan, national recognition that mandatory minimum sentences are not only unfair, but they are also counterproductive. Instead of expanding the coverage of mandatory minimums, we should be eliminating them. Individuals convicted of serious offenses will still receive appropriately lengthy sentences, but they will not be set on a one-size-fits-all basis.  We want to examine the facts, the circumstances in each case, and the judge is in the best position to do that. We should not be assuming that we can sit here and pass these national laws that will not help and will make it difficult for judges to do their work.  Unfortunately, this bill takes the opposite course, and that is why I must oppose it. I encourage my colleagues to think about what we are doing here and oppose H.1842.

13065,topic-id,521,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.76.  This resolution would grant the consent and approval of Congress for Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact establishing the Washington Metrorail Safety  I support this bipartisan measure for several reasons.  Most importantly, this Commission will help improve the safety of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority--also known as WMATA, which provides transportation services for millions of people each year.  Last year alone, nearly 180 million riders traveled on WMATA's commuter rail system. In fact, more than 760,000 riders used that system on just a single day in March of last year.  Unfortunately, there have been a series of serious safety violations at WMATA in recent years, some of which have tragically led to deaths and injuries.  Even though such dangerous conditions are obviously inexcusable, they nevertheless have persisted for many years. There are numerous causes, which range from aging infrastructure, years of neglected maintenance, uncertain funding, and poor oversight and management.  In response to these critical concerns, the District of Columbia--together with the states of Virginia and Maryland--have each passed legislation agreeing to enter into an interstate compact establishing an oversight commission dedicated to improving the safety of  Clearly, this undertaking will help ensure WMATA's passengers and workers--as well as the many communities that WMATA serves--have a safe, efficient, and reliable mass transit system.  In addition, H.76 warrants our support because it implements Congress' 2015 directive to the states to establish legal and financially independent state oversight authorities responsible for the safety of fixed rail transit facilities within their respective jurisdictions.  By granting our consent and approval of the interstate compact to be established pursuant to this Resolution, we are fulfilling our responsibility to help ensure the safety of our Nation's rail system.  Finally, prompt consideration of H.76 is imperative not only because of ongoing safety concerns, but also because of financial concerns that serve to exacerbate the safety concerns.  When Congress issued its 2015 directive, it did so with strings attached. A state's failure to comply with this directive would result in a suspension of federal rail transit funding.  Accordingly, the Transportation Department's Federal Transportation Authority suspended its distribution of federal transit funds to the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia earlier this year and it continues to do so until the new safety commission is established.  Thus, every day that goes by without action on this Resolution, is another day that these jurisdictions are deprived of critical federal funding.  So, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting the immediate passage of H.76.  The safety and reliability of our Nation's commuter rail transit system should be the standard for other metropolitan areas to aspire to. Unfortunately, much improvement is necessary to reach this critical goal.  H.76, however, will hopefully provide an important opportunity to address the system's safety shortcomings.  In closing, I want to thank Representative Steny Hoyer, the esteemed author of this critical legislation. His commitment and leadership are to be commended.

12986,topic-id,1458,"Mr.President, it was quite edifying to be sitting here listening to the Democratic leader speak this morning during the morning remarks, expressing his concern for healthcare, rural hospitals, and talking about his concerns about delivering healthcare to the poor. It is indeed ironic because at a time when ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, is literally in meltdown with unaffordable premiums and deductibles, we are not seeing any help whatsoever from our Democratic colleagues. I would suggest, rather than rail against the President's budget, they ought to be engaged in a more constructive process of working with us to make sure we can deliver on the promise of affordable healthcare to all  Of course, there is the matter of the President's budget itself. I remember that President Obama's last budget got voted on here in the U.It got one vote--one vote. A President's budget is not binding on the The Congress passes a budget resolution, both houses, and we anticipate doing that again.  The President's budget is really a statement of the President's priorities. Frankly, there are some things in the President's proposed budget that I think are worthwhile--things like securing our border. At the end of the day, it is the job of Congress, though, to pass a budget that reflects the priorities of our country.  I think it is worth pointing out that several aspects of the President's budget are encouraging and a welcome change from the previous administration. For one, it balances in 10 years. I would love to have our Democratic colleagues express some concern for the fact that we continue to spend money we don't have and impose the burden of repaying that money someday on future generations. To me, that is one of the most immoral things we do in this country; we spend the money today, and we leave the debt to our children and grandchildren to pay that back, which they must at some point. So when the President proposes a budget that actually balances in 10 years, I think that is a good thing. What a welcome relief from a White House budget anchored around overspending and growing the size of government, which we have seen for the last 8 years.  The other thing the President's budget does is reverse the defense sequester. This is the artificial cap we put on defense spending.  Of all the things the Federal Government does, national security is the 1 job. You can't outsource that to anyone. It is our 1 responsibility to keep the country safe and to keep America strong. Under the Obama administration, there was a cap put in place that prevented increased military spending, and indeed we saw cuts to the military of about 20 percent during the Obama years.  One thing that President Trump has done, which I find a welcome sign, is to properly resource our military so we can better defend against increasing threats around the world. It is simply irresponsible for us to allow our men and women in the military to operate on slashed budgets and outdated equipment. They can't even train and be ready for the next fight. The best deterrent to war and the best assurance of peace is a strong The President's budget reflects a better understanding of the threat environment ahead, and for that I am grateful.  So rather than railing against the President's budget, which he knows will not be passed into law--because no President's budget ever becomes law; it is a proposal of the President's priorities. As I said, there is much to like among the President's priorities--balancing the budget, emphasizing national security spending, and the like. Ultimately, we will have to come up with a budget ourselves. So I find the Democratic leader's railing against the President's budget, which he knows will not become law as written, somewhat ironic.                            Border Security  Mr.President, on another matter, I have the privilege of serving as the chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Border Security and It is a role I take seriously in light of the many challenges our Nation faces when it comes to security and trade along our southern border.  The Texas-Mexico border makes up more than 60 percent of the total U.southern border. That means Texas is at the epicenter of the national security conversation when it comes to border security and protecting communities that thrive on cross-border trade, not to mention the U.economy that reaps 5 million jobs as a result of binational trade with Mexico alone.  Later today, the subcommittee will have a chance to examine this important topic and consider ways that Congress can help the Trump administration make America safer and our borders stronger. In particular, I look forward to hearing from Chief Ron Vitiello, who is currently Acting Deputy Commissioner for Customs and Border He actually is the head Border Patrol agent for the Federal Government, a man who has spent many years on the frontlines and knows from experience the challenges that exist in securing the border.  Customs and Border Protection agents and officers face a range of challenges every day, working in some of the most inhospitable environments and remote locations, often without adequate resources or equipment. They work tirelessly to combat drug trafficking, arms smuggling, illegal immigration, and human trafficking, while simultaneously working to facilitate legitimate trade and travel between Mexico and the United  I spoke a little bit about this yesterday in light of NAFTA's importance to the Texas and U.economy. Texas is a first port of entry for many goods and many people coming from all over the world, and it takes a solid team of Customs and Border Patrol professionals and good leadership to manage the border and the many ports of entry along it. I am grateful to Chief Vitiello for his hard work and look forward to his testimony this afternoon.  This administration has made clear that securing the border is a top priority, and I agree with that. I am confident that with topnotch leaders like Secretary Kelly of the Department of Homeland Security and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, we will finally make real progress toward getting it done.  The appropriations bill that was recently signed into law included the largest increase for border security technologies and infrastructure improvement in more than a decade. Fortunately, the President's budget supports increased investment in border security and immigration enforcement, as well, including new infrastructure and technologies to help us achieve operational control of the southern border. This focus on border security is a welcome change from the previous administration, and I am glad we now have leaders who will take the need to achieve true border security seriously.  I have always said that border security ultimately is a matter of political will. The Obama administration didn't have it; the Trump administration does. With the political will and with the guidance of experts like Chief Vitiello and others who tell us exactly[[Page S3079]]what the Border Patrol needs in order to secure the border, I am confident of our ability to get it done.  I will just relate the conversation I had with the Chief of the Rio Grande Border Patrol sector, Chief Manny Chief Padilla long served in the Border Patrol in many different places along the border.  Of course, the border is very different in San Diego than it is in the Rio Grande Valley of For one thing, Texas has virtually all private property along the border and, of course, is separated by the Rio Grande River from  What Chief Padilla has said to me, which I believe is absolutely the case, is that it takes three different things to secure the border. It takes infrastructure. You can call it fencing, like the Secure Fence Act that we passed a few years ago that almost all of our Democratic colleagues voted for. It takes things like levy walls, which we have in Hidalgo County and the Rio Grande But it also takes technology and personnel because we know that no piece of infrastructure alone is going to provide the security we need. But fundamentally we need to regain the people's trust and confidence that the Federal Government will carry out its primary responsibility to protect our citizens and defend our borders.  Border security is complex. It is multifaceted and requires an approach that includes air, sea, and land. That is why we need a multilayered approach to border security that includes infrastructure, like the President talks about frequently when he talks about the wall. It takes technology, and it takes the men and women in the Border Patrol who do the dangerous but important work of keeping our border secure and keeping our country safe.

12838,topic-id,534,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment that is offered by my good friend from Alabama (Mr.Byrne).  I would just note that this is an amendment that has been around the last couple Congresses, and the intent clearly is to carve out a larger exemption from the longshoremen's act which is a law that goes back to 1927.  I would note that if that is the intent, the language of this amendment actually is kind of like legislating with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel because by carving out a larger exemption for recreational vessels above or beyond 55 feet long, basically there is a whole series of Coast Guard rules and regulations that have been enforced by the Coast Guard for many years that this amendment, unfortunately, is going to sweep up and undermine, including the rules related to alcohol on board vessels, waste management, Coast Guard inspection categories, vessel sales to non-U.citizens, tonnage taxes, and safety management systems.  The Coast Guard is out there every single day making sure that these rules which really protect our ports and make sure that particularly foreign, large, super yachts are paying their fair share, in terms of the costs of environmental protection, and boating safety is enforced. That is, again, what this amendment will undermine.  That is why last year the Coast Guard issued a statement pointing out the fact that because of the broad sweep of the language of this amendment, it is really undermining some key missions that the Coast Guard has been doing for decades for the American people.  So I would note that, at the outset, obviously there is, I think, another[[Page H5837]]issue which is just as significant which is undermining the longshoremen's act which goes back to Calvin It recognizes the fact that the folks who are engaged in longshoremen activity but also shipyard construction are engaged in a very high-risk type of occupation.  The longshoremen's act was a recognition that State workers' compensation systems, because of the fact that they varied up and down in terms of protections, really required a Federal minimum standard. That is really something that has obviously withstood the test of time over the last 90 years.  Again, if you look at the data, people who were involved in shipyard work, their risk of injury is much higher than many other occupations.  I am a proud Representative from a district that has the second largest employment level in shipbuilding according to the American Shipbuilding Association, and these folks are dealing with processes, equipment, and parts that, again, really are much higher risk than even aerospace or other forms of manufacturing.  Mr.Chairman, I think what we ought to do is stick to the Coast Guard definition of what a recreational vessel is because that has been on the books for many years, and it is something that I think all of us should listen closely to in terms of evaluating this amendment.  I think also we should recognize that we can build a great American shipbuilding sector in this country for commercial and recreational vessels, but we should not do it on the backs of worker protection.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-14-pt1-PgH5836-2.txt,1836,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,14.0,July

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.  The Clerk read as follows:       Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that      the President shall immediately disclose his tax return      information to the House of Representatives and the American      people.       Whereas, President Nixon explained that ``People have got      to know whether or not their President is a crook'' when he      invited the Joint Committee on Taxation to audit his returns      after the Internal Revenue Service gave him an unwarranted      tax discount;       Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every      President since Gerald Ford has disclosed his tax return      information to the public;       Whereas, the Chairmen of the Committee on Ways and Means,      Joint Committee on Taxation, and the Committee on Finance      have the authority to request the President's tax returns      under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;       Whereas, pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the      Constitution, often referred to as the Origination Clause,      the House of Representatives has the sole authority to      initiate legislation that raises revenue for the national      government, and the Committee on Ways and Means is      considering a comprehensive reform of the Tax Code;       Whereas, according to media reports analyzing President      Trump's leaked 2005 tax return, we know that had his own tax      plan been in place, he would have paid an estimated mere 3.48      percent rate instead of a 24 percent rate, saving him $31.3      million;       Whereas, according to The New York Times, the President      used a legally dubious tax maneuver in 1995 that could have      allowed him to avoid paying any Federal taxes for 18 years;       Whereas, President Trump holds ``interests as the sole or      principal owner in approximately 500 separate entities,''      according to his attorneys, and the President's tax plan      proposes to cut the tax rate on such ``pass-through''      entities from 39.6 percent to 15 percent;       Whereas, one analysis estimated that President Trump would      personally save $6.7 million from two tax breaks included in      the Republicans' first tax cut, which they misleadingly call      the American Health Care Act;       Whereas, without the President's tax returns, the American      people cannot determine how much he will personally benefit      from proposed changes to the Tax Code;       Whereas, an ABCNews/Washington Post poll found that 74      percent of Americans would like President Trump to disclose      his tax returns and the most-signed petition on the White      House website calls for the release of the President's tax      return information to verify compliance with the Emoluments      Clause, with more than 1,097,000 signatures as of date of      this resolution;       Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns could      help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016      election better understand the President's financial ties to      the Russian Federation, Russian businesses, and Russian      individuals;       Whereas, after breaking his pledge to make his tax returns      available, President Trump instead presented a one-page      letter from a law firm giving him a clean bill of health on      any business dealings with Russians, but failed to note that      the very same law firm boasted of the ``prestigious honor''      of being named ``Russia Law Firm of the Year'' for 2016;       Whereas, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director      James Comey, before he was fired by President Trump, publicly      confirmed that the Bureau has been investigating potential      ties between President Trump's campaign and Russia since July      and that the Russian President Vladimir Putin favored a Trump      electoral victory;       Whereas, President Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor,      Jared Kushner, met during the Presidential transition at the      behest of the Russian Ambassador with Sergey Gorkov, a      graduate of a school run by the successor to the KGB and who      was appointed by Vladimir Putin to head a Russian state-owned      bank that is on the U.sanctions list;       Whereas, Mr.Kushner proposed establishing a secret back      channel of communications directly to Vladimir Putin, even      considering the use of Russian embassy facilities to do so;       Whereas, Attorney General Jeff Sessions falsely stated      during his Senate confirmation hearing that he ``did not have      communications with the Russians,'' when in fact he met at      least twice during the campaign with Russian Ambassador      Sergey Kislyak;       Whereas, former Director Comey testified before the Senate      Intelligence Committee that President Trump had asked him in      the Oval Office about ``letting Flynn go,'' referring to the      investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael      Flynn's business ties to Russia;       Whereas, President Trump stated on May 11, 2017, that he      had decided that he was going to fire Comey because of ``this      Russia thing'';       Whereas, former Director Comey, on June 8, 2017, testified      that Special Counsel Robert Mueller could investigate whether      President Trump's actions with regard to Director Comey and      the Flynn investigation constituted obstruction of justice;       Whereas, in 2013, President Trump said, ``Well, I've done a      lot of business with the They're smart and they're      tough,'' and President Trump's son, Donald Trump, Jr., told a      news outlet in 2008 that ``Russians make up a pretty      disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets'';       Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the      nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, the President has      refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses;       Whereas, the Director of the nonpartisan Office of      Government Ethics said that the President's plan to transfer      his business holdings to a trust managed by family members is      ``meaningless'' and ``does not meet the standards that . . .      every President in the past four decades has met'';       Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the      Constitution for the express purpose of preventing Federal      officials from accepting any ``present, Emolument, Office, or      Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state'';       Whereas, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.,      has hired a ``director of diplomatic sales'' to generate      high-priced business among foreign leaders and diplomatic      delegations;       Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax      returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the      information public;       Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means used the authority      under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in      2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51      taxpayers;       Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means has now voted      three times along party lines to continue to cover-up      President Trump's tax returns;       Whereas, the House of Representatives has now refused nine      times to act on President Trump's tax returns;       Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether      or not their President is operating under conflicts of      interest related to international affairs, tax reform,      Government contracts, or otherwise;       Whereas, the House of Representatives undermines its      dignity and the integrity of its proceedings by continuing      the cover-up of President Trump's tax returns: Now,      therefore, be it;

12917,topic-id,945,"Mr.Speaker, you can certainly observe, as all the Members can, the many troubling events that are reflected in the resolution we just had read and why they do arise to the privileges of the  Under clause 1 of rule IX, questions of the privileges of the House are: ``those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.''  This resolution seeks to protect the integrity of the proceedings of the House, and I believe that it is therefore privileged. There is just not an issue that is more fundamental to the integrity of this House, the people's House, than the faith the American people have in our democracy.  That sacred faith is being undermined. It is under assault right now by President This House must act to protect the integrity of its proceedings.[[Page H5014]]  Now, I know that there are many Members here who are eager to avoid a direct up-and-down vote on the specific question of covering up the Trump tax returns, and that there have been nine previous times when Members have come to the floor and presented resolutions that were focused on trying to get those returns and to end the coverup.  Recognizing the Speaker's prior rulings nine times against considering this measure, I have, today, offered a different resolution, taking a new approach that I bring to the Speaker's attention. Unlike the last nine resolutions, my resolution does not direct the Committee on Ways and Means to meet and consider action on these secreted tax returns.  I believe it should not be ruled out of order on the grounds that were used the previous nine times that this type of resolution was blocked. This coverup of the Trump returns must end, and that is why I have taken a different approach.  Pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the United States Constitution, what we know as the Origination Clause, the House of Representatives has the sole authority to initiate legislation that raises revenue for the national government.  As the Speaker knows, that means the House Ways and Means Committee, on which I serve, on which Mr.Pascrell, who I know wants to comment on this point of order, is concerned, for this House to exercise with integrity its authority to originate tax legislation. This is authority that it solely possesses. The American people should know how the President and his family might personally benefit from the tax legislation, either in their direct personal income or through the many business intermediaries with which they work. I believe some 500-plus entities reported on their financial disclosure statement.  President Trump, we know, has bragged publicly about his ability to bend the Tax Code to his whim in the past. He has said only he can ``fix it.''  And the question is: Will he fix it for himself, or fix it for working families? Will he enrich the middle class with jobs, or simply enrich himself and other billionaires like him?  While recently Mr.Trump has provided us a single page of clues concerning the contents of his tax plan that they now say will be provided fully in September, he has not given us much detail. But he does give us a few clues off that one page. One is his proposal to repeal the alternative minimum tax. We know if that had been the law, if that Trump proposal had been in effect for the one year, 2005, that we have his return, he would have paid about the amount that an employee does on their Social It would have saved him $30 million.  I understand that there are many here that simply don't want to look under the rock to see what is contained in those returns. And there are many who believe that Mr.Trump is the golden ticket to more prized tax breaks, to more ending of consumer protection, and they have been rather quiet about the tax return issue, about the conflicts of interest, and about the potential foreign collusion.  But after all the resolutions presented here on the floor, nine, plus the amendments that I have offered in the Ways and Means Committee that have been rejected, I can say that, while there has not been progress yet on the House floor, there has been progress.  Mr.Trump has responded.

13023,topic-id,644,"It once included the State of Colorado, or part of it.  Madam Speaker, I think Republicans are just scared. They are afraid to leave town this week without doing another favor for Wall Street, and this proposal to undermine consumer rights is the next gift that they want to bestow on the big banks.  Republicans can never seem to find their voice, no matter how outrageous the latest Trump tweet might be. They cannot pass meaningful legislation on other subjects, but they feel compelled to answer when Wall Street comes ``a calling,'' as it has on this bill.  Only last month, Republicans approved a bill to give Trump the power to fire the chief cop on the beat; that would be the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who Trump could now dump for actually trying to do his job of protecting consumers from abusive financial practices.  Of course, we see daily that Trump thinks the White House is just a new venue for the latest sequel of ``The Apprentice,'' with him declaring ``you're fired'' to one person after another, no matter how much damage he does to our national security or to the economic security of families that are struggling to make a go of it all over  Well, today's Republican gift to Wall Street is about denying any effective remedy to those who are abused by big banks. A bank can rightfully go to court if a consumer abuses it, and that happens every day in courts across America, with good reason, because it is not a one-way street.  But in the non-negotiable, deceitful fine print at the back of the contract, the bank can deny the consumer the very same opportunity to go to court if that consumer is abused. It is called arbitration, but what it really means is that if a consumer has been treated wrong, neither a judge nor a jury can ever evaluate the facts and conclude for the consumer.  Since usually the arbitrator depends upon the same bank or group of banks to get repeat business, the arbitrator has an incentive to rule against the consumer and for the bank. Often arbitration is little better than going to the bank's own attorney and asking: Do you think your client did anything wrong? And if so, should they do any more than say ``I'm sorry''?  Arbitration is the very scheme that Wells Fargo relied upon to obstruct any opportunity for ordinary consumers who tried to hold their bank accountable for creating accounts to which they never gave any consent and charging them for it. Wells Fargo used those arbitration clauses to kick the consumers out of court and to continue its fraud against consumers across America for another 2 years. That is the kind of practice that we will have more of if this legislation is approved.  You know, in the Military Lending Act of 2007, Congress showed the good sense to try to protect our servicemembers who are defending our country all over the world in certain of their loan agreements from having a lender impose a mandatory arbitration agreement. And what, today, we should be doing is supporting similar protections for other Americans who can be exposed to the same type of abuse.  Today's bill to undermine consumer protection is opposed by The Military Coalition and 29 other servicemember and veterans groups representing millions of people. This sorry bill is also opposed by a number--I think literally hundreds of consumer, civil rights, labor, and community groups.  All we are saying in rejecting this bill is to give consumers their day in court, give them the same rights the banks want. In fact, treat consumers as if they were banks because they should be treated with the same dignity and the same rights; and we do that by rejecting this bill and rejecting it soundly.

Yet far too often, they do not get the recognition and credit they deserve. This is especially true when it comes to our Nation's atomic veterans.

Frankly, Serbia is not only keeping NATO at arms' length. As we speak, it is continuing to rearm with Russian weapons. In a deal reached on December 21 of last year, Russia agreed to give Serbia six surplus MiG-29 `Fulcrum' fighter aircraft, 30 T-72 tanks, and 30 BRDM-2 armored reconnaissance vehicles. Rather than forcing Belgrade to pay for these items worth more than $600 million on the open market, the Kremlin just gave them to And, now Serbia is seeking Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.

Our alliance, enshrined in the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1953, has been a pillar of stability and security for both of our countries. That alliance is especially important in light of the grave threat just 35 miles from Seoul: the dangerous regime controlled by dictator Kim Jung-un in North  America grieves with the Warmbier family over the tragic death of their young son, His unjust detention, abuse, and death haunts all of us.

But, unfortunately, the project is in jeopardy due to this time lag.  Current Federal Energy Regulation Commission regulations allow a licensee 2 years to begin construction of a hydroelectric project once the license has been issued. The FERC may extend the deadline for an additional 2 years, but this may only be done once.  If construction has not begun on the project by the expiration of the second extension, the Commission will terminate the license, risking all of the hard work and planning that had been put into the project development.  I introduced this legislation to further extend the deadline for construction at the Cannonsville site, because the second FERC-granted extension will expire shortly, and construction has not yet begun.  By allowing for additional time for commencement of construction, we can help protect downstream communities and ensure the safe development of a clean and renewable energy project on this New York City-owned facility.

12954,topic-id,1216,"Mr.President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues Act with my colleague Senator Chuck This legislation addresses the significant challenges associated with prosecuting those who manufacture and traffic deadly synthetic drugs, including synthetic opioids, like clandestinely produced fentanyl, and synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones.  Synthetic drugs pose an increasing threat to our They hit our communities in cycles and cause devastation. For example, in Corpus Christi, TX, there were 31 EMS calls in 1 day related to synthetic drugs. In Syracuse, NY, 18 individuals were taken to the emergency room in a 24-hour period after taking synthetic marijuana, and in Cincinnati, OH, a shocking 174 overdoses occurred over 6 days. These overdoses were largely attributed to heroin laced with carfentanil, a synthetic opioid that is 100,000 times stronger than morphine.  In 2012, Congress outlawed many synthetic drugs, but manufacturers did not stop producing them. Instead, they began producing controlled substance analogues which mimic the effects of controlled substances, such as opioids, marijuana, PCP, and  The new drug, even though it has an effect on the body that is similar to a controlled substance, may no longer be illegal under Federal law because it is not listed in one of the five schedules of the Controlled Substances Consequently, these drugs are shipped to our country and marketed as legal alternatives to illegal drugs.  This makes enforcement efforts difficult.  Synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, are deadly. Since 2015, 130 deaths have been linked to the drug in the Bay area of Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that more than 15,000 deaths in 2015 involved synthetic opioids other than methadone, which includes fentanyl. That is equivalent to 42 deaths per day.  Like other synthetic drugs, illicit fentanyl and its analogues are clandestinely produced, and primarily enter the United States in one of three ways:  (1) Chinese chemists produce and ship it to the United States via international mail;  (2) Mexican drug traffickers produce it with precursor chemicals from China and smuggle it across the Southwest Border; or  (3) Chinese chemists produce and ship it to Canada, where it is smuggled across the northern border.  The point is, regardless of the type, synthetic drugs pose a deadly and quickly evolving public health threat.  It is clear that the current system for scheduling controlled substances and prosecuting controlled substance analogues is not able to keep up with the speed with which new synthetic drugs are produced or to prevent the deaths they cause.  That is why the Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic Drugs Act to provide the Department of Justice with new tools, using a multifaceted approach.  First, the bill immediately controls 13 fentanyl analogues that law enforcement has come into contact with. These substances have already caused 162 overdose deaths in the United  Second, while the existing Federal Analogue Enforcement Act allows prosecutors to charge those who manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substance analogues, the law contains definition of a controlled substance analogue that is vague and often misinterpreted. As a result, court cases using this law result in a drawn out and expensive battle of the experts.  Moreover, because because controlled substance analogues are not listed as federally controlled substances, even if a prosecutor in one case successfully proves that a substance is a controlled substance analogue, this ruling is not applied across the board. A different person charged with manufacturing the exact same substance in another case is not automatically guilty of a crime. Instead, the prosecutor in the new case has to reprove that the substance in question is an analogue all over again.  Therefore, to ensure that prosecutors do not have to reprove that a substance is an analogue each and every time it appears, the bill establishes a new schedule  The legislation authorizes the Attorney General to add new synthetic drugs, including fentanyl and other analogues, to this new schedule, and make them illegal through an expedited, temporary scheduling process.  It also authorizes the Attorney General to permanently schedule these substances, either in schedule A or in another schedule, like schedule This provides the Attorney General with the maximum flexibility needed to better combat these dangerous drugs.  Those found guilty of manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing schedule A substances would be subject to existing schedule III penalties, or a maximum of 10 years imprisonment for a first offense.  The Department of Justice has told my staff that this approach will allow them to act quickly when new and dangerous substances threaten our communities.  Recognizing that the vast majority of synthetic drugs originate from outside of the United States, the legislation imposes criminal penalties for the illegal import and export of substances designated as schedule It also authorizes penalties for those who manufacture or distribute these substances while intending, knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe they will ultimately be imported into the United  Third, the bill maintains the ability of prosecutors to charge defendants using the Federal Analogue Enforcement Act, but clarifies the definition of a controlled substance analogue within the  Specifically, the language clarifies that the chemical structure of the substance must be similar to that of schedule I or II controlled substance to be considered a controlled substance analogue. On top of this, the substance must also have a stimulant, depressant or hallucinogenic effect on the body that is similar to a schedule I or II controlled substance or the person manufacturing, distributing or dispensing[[Page S3365]]the drug must represent or intend for the drug to have an effect that is similar to a schedule I or II controlled substance.  If prosecutors successfully prove a substance is a controlled substance analogue under the new definition, those who traffic the drug could face higher penalties than those assigned to schedule A, because the penalty would be associated with the drug it mimics.  Finally, those trafficking these substances do not market them as synthetic drugs. Instead, they mislabel the products, which are often sold at gas stations and convenience stores. To prevent this from happening, the bill requires all schedule A substances to be properly labeled and establishes civil penalties for failure to do so.  This provision will allow civil enforcement action to be taken to remove mislabeled products from the shelves of gas stations and convenience stores.  I want to close by sharing the story of one of my constituents, a young man named Connor Unfortunately, a synthetic drug known as Spice claimed his life. Connor took one hit of the drug, which, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, is a mixture of herbs and spices that is typically sprayed with a synthetic compound chemically similar to THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. His brain swelled, causing him to go into a coma, and he never woke up.  Sadly, Connor's story has become all too common. And this is unacceptable. That is why I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues Law enforcement must have the ability to swiftly bring those who manufacture, distribute, and dispense these deadly drugs to justice.  I look forward to working with and obtaining feedback from my colleagues and other stakeholders on this bill, which provides new and necessary authorities to combat synthetic drugs.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-06-08-pt1-PgS3364.txt,1332,BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIP ACT OF 2017,2017.0,8.0,July

Some of these challenges that face families across the country touch my constituents in Hawaii as well. I would like to share a few of their stories and their challenges here today in the hopes that Congress and this administration take action and do the right thing for them and for our country.  We are a nation of immigrants. Andres Magana Ortiz's story is not a new one. It is not one that will surprise anyone.                              {time}  1730  In fact, it will be quite recognizable to most of us. No tradition is as American as telling the stories of our relatives and ancestors who, against all odds and great difficulties, found and made a home here on our shores.  But while our family histories remind us of how far we have come, Andres' story demonstrates the progress that we have yet to make and who is hurt and affected by the lack of that progress today.  Andres Ortiz came to Hawaii seeking the American With hard work, perseverance, and a little luck, Andres demonstrated what we, as Americans, know to be true and that we strive for: if you work hard, you can succeed and get ahead.  Andres started a new life in 1996 picking coffee--backbreaking, tough work, for anyone who has done it before--in the Kona region on the island of He proved himself smart and capable, and he was soon promoted to supervisor. By 2010, he saved enough to buy his own coffee farm. Today, he owns 20 acres of coffee trees, and manages another 150 acres for his neighbors.  Andres quickly earned a reputation as a knowledgeable and skillful farmer. When an invasive beetle, called the coffee berry borer, began to ravish our Kona coffee farms and trees, Andres began a pioneering system to help his community track and eradicate this infestation, even before our U.Department of Agriculture took action. Now, this infestation was not just a small matter. It was something that cost our farmers millions of dollars.  Our country offered Andres the means to become an entrepreneur, and he paid us back in full: he started a business, he creates jobs, he takes care of his workers, and he is a leader in our community. Andres is not a legal resident of Hawaii, but Hawaii owes him a debt for his contributions.  Managing the coffee farm is a family affair for He is a proud husband and father of three children. His wife and kids are all American citizens, and his kids only know Hawaii as home.  Andres embodies the spirit of the American Dream, and serves as an example of why we should welcome courageous, hardworking immigrants into our community. The reality that Andres faces now, sadly, is far different.  If Andres is deported to Mexico, as is supposed to happen in just a few days, his family, their farm, and Kona coffee growers are going to face an uncertain future. Without Andres to run the business, his family could lose their farm and lose their home. Their neighbors will lose a friend and a business partner. Brenda, his wife, will be without her husband, and their three children will be without their father.  If Andres is forced to leave, the law will keep him from his family for 10 years. Should the family move to Mexico with Andres, they will have to learn a new language and a new culture. His daughter will have to drop out of college at the University of Hawaii and begin a new life in another country. Relocating to Mexico would deprive them of the benefits afforded to the citizens of this country.  Now, unfortunately, Andres's story is not a singular one. Unfortunately, there are more.  Just last week, Graham Ellis of Waimea, a 67-year-old British national and leukemia patient, heard a knock on his door. It was two Department of Homeland Security agents who have come to begin the deportation process back to the U.after Graham had made Hawaii his home for over 36 years. After a few short minutes of conversation in front of his wife, Dena, who is an American citizen, Graham agreed to turn himself in at a field office in Honolulu the following day.  Now, like Mr.Ortiz, Graham is a pillar within our community in But unlike Mr.Ortiz, Graham had already made the decision to return to the U.because he feared that deportation was inevitable under the heightened threats faced under our current immigration policies. Graham had made the decision to leave by the end of summer, thinking that these remaining months would give him time to get his affairs in order, and say good-bye to the community and the home that he grew to love for so long.  A circus performer by training, Graham spent much of his life in Hawaii teaching children from low-income and at-risk communities circus arts, bringing smiles and laughter to their faces and their lives.  He served on the Puna Community Council, and was the founding president of the Kalapana Seaview Estates Community  In his remaining final months, he had planned to make a trip to Kauai, where he would instruct his last group of young, passionate students at a 2-week[[Page H4692]]superhero-themed circus camp before shutting it down for good.  Our immigration system is broken. We need a pathway to citizenship for immigrants to ensure people who deserve to be here can find a way to be a part of our great country. We need real immigration reform that keeps families together and integrates hardworking, tax-paying immigrants into our community. We need to preserve, protect, and restore the values that underlie the greatness of our country.  I stand with Andres and Graham and the millions of hardworking immigrants who built our great Nation; and I stand with these immigrants who live in my community, who live in my district, and who have a proven record of upstanding contributions to our community.

I urge Chairman Goodlatte to give positive consideration to this bill that has been referred to his committee. I urge Secretary Kelly, the Department of Homeland Security, to revisit their policy and their decision and to put a halt on Mr.Ortiz's deportation. He is not just a number. He is not just a statistic. He and his family are facing this reality today.  It is always the right time to do the right thing, and I urge these leaders to do that right thing.

12964,topic-id,549,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We are here today to address an imposing threat to one of the foundational aspects of our economy, the national bankruptcy system. A well-functioning bankruptcy system provides relief to consumers, allows businesses to reorganize, preserves jobs, maximizes the value of assets, and ensures the proper allocation of resources. Our bankruptcy judiciary is the heartbeat that keeps this system moving. If that judiciary is strained and undermanned, that system will grind to a halt, eliminating the essential benefits it provides and sending repercussions throughout the economy.  There are presently 29 temporary bankruptcy judgeships in the bankruptcy system with a lapse date of May 25. These temporary judgeships comprise more than 8 percent of the current bankruptcy judgeships nationwide. After May 25, 2017, these judgeships are at risk of being permanently lost, resulting in larger caseloads shared by fewer judges and causing further strain on our judiciary system.  The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017 converts 14 of the existing temporary judgeships to permanent status and creates 4 new permanent bankruptcy judgeships in districts with some of the highest caseloads in the country. In fact, since the enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, when a majority of the temporary judgeships were created, these districts have seen weighted filings increase by more than 55 percent.  This bill is based on a comprehensive study of judicial resource needs conducted by the Judicial Conference and is supported by the Administrative Office of the U.The Conference has assured us that its request comes only after it has taken steps to maximize all other alternatives to reduce judicial workloads. Moreover, the Conference has demonstrated that, while a district may have a permanent judgeship, it will not be filled unless completely necessary.  Importantly, this bill will not present any new costs for the taxpayers. The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act includes an increase in the quarterly U.Trustee fees for large chapter 11 debtors, excluding small businesses. This fee increase is directly tied to the balance of the United States Trustee System Fund and will only be applied when the balance of the fund falls below a $200 million threshold, thereby ensuring that the Office of the U.Trustee is properly funded.  These temporary bankruptcy judgeships were first set to lapse in 2010. Most have been extended for over 12 years, and some even longer. Despite this committee's efforts to address the issue, to date there have been only limited, short-term fixes. Additional permanent bankruptcy judgeships have not been authorized since 1992.  The time has come for Congress to address bankruptcy judgeship needs more permanently. We need a bankruptcy system that has a sufficient number of judges to be able to manage the caseloads in a just, economical, and timely manner. The efficiency of this system is too important to our economy to risk. This bill helps ensure that we have such a system.  I would like to thank Ranking Member Conyers for his efforts on this issue. I would also like to thank Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee Chairman Marino and Ranking Member Cicilline for joining me as original cosponsors of the bill.

12999,topic-id,444,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  For victims, the effects of child sexual abuse are devastating. It disrupts the victim's development and increases the likelihood that he or she will experience other sexual assaults in the future, and it is, likely, one of the most underreported crimes in the United That is why we have to do all we can to prevent these crimes. We promote prevention by closely monitoring sex offenders and by imposing recidivist enhancements on those who have shown a proclivity to abuse children.  H.1842, the Strengthening Children's Safety Act of 2017, closes two significant loopholes to help accomplish these goals.  First, the bill closes a loophole in the statute that criminalizes a sex offender's failure to register. Under current law, a sex offender who fails to comply with registration requirements is guilty of a crime. An enhanced penalty applies to offenders who, while in noncompliant status, commit a Federal crime of violence, a crime of violence under the D.Code, a military code crime of violence, a Tribal crime of violence, or a crime of violence in any territory or possession of the United This is logical since offenders who have been convicted of both crimes against children and crimes of violence are deserving of more severe punishment.  However, significantly, this provision fails to include offenders who have been convicted of crimes of violence under State laws. It makes no sense that a person convicted of a crime of violence under the D.Code is subject to an enhanced penalty, while a person who committed the same offense in Virginia would not be. Given their propensity for violence, these offenders, regardless of what U.jurisdiction convicts them, must be held accountable when they fall off the radar.  The bill further ensures that those offenders who have been previously convicted of sex crimes under the Uniform Code of Military Justice are exposed to the same recidivist enhancements as those convicted of the same crimes in Federal, State, and Tribal courts. The way the U.Code is currently written, many of these Federal recidivist statutes unintentionally fail to cover significant sex crimes committed under military law, including certain child pornography offenses. Again, it is important that repeat offenders are subject to the same sentencing enhancements, no matter where they were convicted, in order to protect our children.  H.1842 is commonsense legislation that closes loopholes in Federal law, promotes uniformity, and will help keep our children safe.  I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Ratcliffe), a member of the Judiciary Committee, for introducing this important bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

H.76 grants Congress' approval to the Metrorail Safety Commission Interstate Compact, an interstate compact entered into recently by the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of  The safety record of the D.C.-area Metrorail system and other public transit systems in our country has been a matter of increasing concern for some time. To better address public transit safety needs, including metrorails, Congress included in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century, or MAP Act or MAP-21, and the Fixing America's Surface Transportation, or FAST Act, provisions strengthening the Federal Transit Administration's safety oversight authority and related safety requirements for public transit systems.  Pursuant to these acts and through the Metrorail Safety Commission Interstate Compact, Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia have committed to establish a new Washington Metrorail Safety Commission to act as the State safety oversight authority for the Metrorail system. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has informed the Judiciary Committee that the new compact's provisions satisfy the requirements of the relevant Federal statutes.  The jurisdictions completed, in March of this year, their adoption by legislation of their respective compact instruments. In the meanwhile, however, due to delays in the adoption of the instruments, the FTA invoked on February 9, 2017, authority to suspend the distribution of transit funds to the jurisdictions until the new safety commission is established.  By passage of H.76, we can hasten the day by which Metrorail safety will be improved and funds obligated for other impacted transit systems in the compact jurisdictions can be made available for release.

12730,topic-id,725,"Mr.President, I rise today to join my colleagues to discuss the heroin, fentanyl, and opioid crisis that has devastated communities across our I want to thank the Senator from West Virginia for giving us the floor today and for his continued leadership in working to combat this crisis. It is going to take an all-hands-on-deck approach, with Members of both parties and at all levels of government working with those on the frontlines to find solutions.  We recently received near final information on the number of lives lost last year and the specific substances involved in New Hampshire as a result of this crisis. What is clear is that the threat continues to evolve and grow. In 2016 alone, there were 477 confirmed overdose deaths in New That is an increase from 439 deaths in 2015 and 326 in 2014. Already this year, there have been 73 confirmed overdose deaths in my State, with another 86 suspected cases awaiting final toxicology results.  In recent months, we have seen new deadly challenges that are emerging. A few weeks ago, I met with members of the Drug Enforcement Agency in New Among the topics we discussed was the spread of a dangerous synthetic drug, carfentanil. Carfentanil is 100 times stronger than even fentanyl. It is killing people faster, and we are seeing its deadly use rising in New We have seen six confirmed deaths from carfentanil in the past few weeks.  During my meeting with the DEA, I heard from those on the frontlines about the dangerous impacts it has on their lives as well. Carfentanil and other fentanyl compounds are so dangerous that they can put first responders at risk if they are exposed.  It is clear that we must do more to support those struggling and those on the frontlines to stem and ultimately reverse the tide of this crisis. We need more resources to address this problem because people are dying. What we cannot do is institute policies that would make matters worse.  I am encouraged that the Trump administration has discussed the severity of this crisis, but their actions so far don't match their words. The President's budget that was announced this week would have devastating consequences on efforts to combat this crisis. This budget includes hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services It also cuts the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas This is a program that provides key support to law enforcement officials on the frontlines.  I am particularly disturbed by this administration's continued attacks on Medicaid has been critical to ensuring that Granite Staters struggling with addiction have access to treatment and recovery services. The drastic cuts to Medicaid in the President's budget proposal go above and beyond even the devastating cuts included in the dangerous TrumpCare bill that passed through the House of This budget proposes cutting $610 billion to Medicaid, which is on top of the $839 billion cut in TrumpCare also ends Medicaid expansion, which experts have said is the 1 tool we have in combating this crisis.  TrumpCare undermines the requirement that insurance companies must cover mental health and substance use disorder services. According to yesterday's CBO report, this could lead to out-of-pocket costs totaling thousands of dollars for people seeking these services. In the midst of this crisis, we need to be strengthening prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts and giving stronger support to those on the frontlines, but these recent actions by this administration show that President Trump is failing to live up to his own words on this deadly epidemic. And cuts to programs that help people in the throes of addiction are irresponsible, unacceptable, and unconscionable.  I am grateful to many of my colleagues for reaching across the aisle to propose policies to address this epidemic. This is an issue that rises above partisanship, and this is work we need to be doing because the lives of the people of our States depend upon it. I am going to continue to work with my colleagues on solutions, while standing firm against proposals that would pull us backward.  I again thank Senator Manchin for his leadership on this issue.

13011,topic-id,776,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday President Trump laid out his budget request for next year. It represents the most draconian disinvestment in our country by any President in modern history, and it is littered with broken promises and fundamental errors in simple math.  It is a budget that makes very clear that this President is not fighting for working Americans and their families, and, in fact, he is breaking his promises to make their lives better. It is shockingly devoid of the basic policy details necessary to back up its deficit-cutting bravado. It includes an accounting discrepancy so large--over $2 trillion--that it can only be characterized as willfully hiding the ball from the American public, an exercise in extreme incompetence, or both.  The purpose of a budget is to lay out the most complete description of a President's governing vision for the country. By that measure and many others, this budget is an embarrassment. It is no wonder that it has already been panned by Members on both sides of the aisle in this My Republican friend, Representative Mike Simpson, was absolutely right when he said of proposals like this one that the House can't pass this budget. Nor will it. It is dead on arrival in Congress because Democrats and Republicans both understand that we can't provide economic security to the American people and keep them safe from threats if we gut our investments in doing both. That is what the President's budget would do.  As The Washington Post eloquently pointed out, the Trump budget ``is fundamentally at odds with what Trump told voters.'' President Trump promised middle class American workers he would fight for them and their families. If implemented, his budget would make it harder for them to send their kids to college, access job training to get ahead, or even just stay in the middle class, and devastate seniors' long-term care. The dramatic cuts he makes to nutrition assistance, elimination of heating assistance during the winter months and Meals on Wheels will hit low-income Americans and seniors hard, particularly in rural communities.  And those, Mr.Speaker, are just a selection. He is breaking his campaign promise not to cut Medicaid and Social Security, taking $1.4 trillion out of Medicaid over the next 10 years, without offering a policy to achieve those cuts, and slashing funds for the Social Security disability insurance programs that serve 10 million Frankly, the President made fun of those with disabilities during the course of the campaign, and now he cuts billions of dollars from the ability of the disabled to maintain some degree of dignity and health.  President Trump also pledged that the American taxpayer would not pay--would not pay--for the border wall he wants to build. Of course, his budget asks the U.taxpayer to pay for that wall. When it comes to keeping Americans safe from threats overseas, President Trump's budget fails miserably as well, cutting the budgets for diplomacy and foreign aid that complement the work of our military in combating ISIS and other terror groups. Additionally, it punishes middle class Federal employees in every congressional district in our country for choosing to serve their country by cutting their pay and retirement benefits.  One after another, the budget breaks the President's promises. At every turn, it undermines our long-term security and prosperity by ignoring the critical lessons from past Republican administrations when it comes to basic economics. Like past Republican budgets, the Trump budget relies on discredited theories of how economic growth would result from tax policies. Unlike past attempts, however, the Trump budget double counts its fantasy supply side boost in an accounting error so large it could pay for the Pentagon 3 years over.  Mr.Speaker, we know this budget will go nowhere in I believe there will not be a Republican in the House of Representatives, Mr.Speaker,[[Page H4509]]who will offer this budget on the floor of this It does tell us, however, a lot about this President and his priorities. Former Vice President Biden has been known to say: ``Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget.''  President Trump has now shown us his budget, and none of us should be surprised. So now it is up to Democrats and Republicans in this House and in the Senate to work together to agree on a budget resolution and move appropriations bills through regular order. Let us hope we can do that. The American public would expect us to do that, and our country needs us to do that.  We must not disinvest in those things that have made America great and will enable us to lay the groundwork for another century of American leadership.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgH4508-2.txt,566,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,24.0,July
13053,topic-id,390,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I was tempted to stop at that podium. One of my Republican predecessors used to come over here a long time ago and speak to Democrats from this podium and then walk back and speak to his Republican colleagues.  This is truly something that both podiums support. It is a bipartisan effort. I was privileged to work with Congresswoman Comstock's predecessor, Frank Wolf, and we worked arm in arm, hip to hip, shoulder to shoulder for a decade with Republican administrations, both the Reagan administration and with the first Bush administration, and this truly is a bipartisan effort to enhance America's subway.  I say ``America's subway'' because not only do our people use it that live in the region, but millions of Americans who come to Washington, D.C., to see their Capital use their Metro system. I am proud to be the sponsor of this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  People throughout the National Capital region depend upon Metro to get to work, reach family and friends, and access shopping and entertainment, as so many of my colleagues have already said. It is the lifeblood of the area's economy. Nobody probably knows that better than Gerry Connolly, who was the head of one of the largest subdivisions in our region and knows how critically important Metro is to our region.  Metro--I have referred to it as the ``ties that bind the Washington metropolitan area together''--is used by millions of visitors to our Nation's Capital who come from across the country. It is critical to the functioning of our Federal Government, with Federal employees making up nearly 40 percent of its ridership. They and many military personnel rely on Metro to get to their offices and duty stations on time so they can serve the American people.  As anyone who spends time in this city knows, Metro has had its share of challenges in recent years, including, of course, safety issues that have prompted an ambitious overhaul of safety procedure and infrastructure, which was absolutely necessary and too long in coming.  Safety must continue to be Metro's number one priority both for its passengers and for its employees.

13102,topic-id,1954,"Mr.Speaker, this Special Order is for the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and I am so proud to be a vice chair of that caucus and to lead the Special Order hour with my colleague, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.Raskin).  We do this once a week, and we try to take up topics that we think are of great interest across the country to our constituency. So I am very proud to have the Congressional Progressive Caucus leading the way on so many issues that are important, from education to transportation, infrastructure to, of course, today's topic, which is the tax plan that was released yesterday by President  The tax plan that was released yesterday--and I have to start by saying I am not sure this is actually the plan. I am not sure that a one-page document constitutes a plan. This is not even a two-sided document. It is a one-sided document. This is what we are reacting to. And it is similar to the tax plan that candidate Trump spoke about during the campaign.  So we will do our best with what has been put forward as a plan, but this plan, in our estimation, when you look at what it contains, really amounts to nothing more than a one-page document full of handouts to the rich.  The Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, yesterday said, during a press conference, that one thing that this President has done very well--this is a quote: ``One thing this President has done very well is listen.''  Mr.Speaker, I have to disagree with that. Two weekends ago, there were 190,000 Americans in red States and blue States across the country who were on the streets asking for the President to release his tax returns in the same way that every other President of the United States has done in modern history. Unfortunately, this President has not listened. As a candidate, he said he would release his tax returns. As a President, he has refused to do so.[[Page H2931]]  He didn't listen when women and their allies took to the streets in the biggest march in American history to demand that he respect women, protect Planned Parenthood, and support equal rights for women.  And this President certainly didn't listen to the millions of Americans who were outspoken in their opposition to the Republican healthcare plan that essentially took $1 trillion off of the backs of working people and folks who need health care across this country and transferred it to the wealthiest in our country.  The reality is this President, unfortunately, has not been listening to the American people. If you look at that healthcare plan, just as an example, only 17 percent of the American public actually supported This President has not been listening, to now put forward another plan on health care that again suggests that we should actually take away essential health benefits from people, take away the opportunity for people to have preexisting conditions covered, and, once again, leaving an additional 24 million Americans stripped of their health care.                              {time}  1630  So in this tax press conference yesterday, it became very clear that the administration doesn't have really an idea of exactly what the plan is going to look like, except for the fact that it will be good for business.  Secretary Mnuchin said:  ``Under the Trump plan, we will have a massive tax cut for businesses. . . .''  Despite all of President Trump's broken promises, we have to believe that this may actually be true. Let's not forget that the Secretary of the Treasury was a C-level executive at Goldman Sachs and his loyalties have been with Big  The tax plan, as we have been given it on this one-page document, is a gift-wrapped tax cut to the highest earners and corporations. The claim is that it was written to create jobs and spur economic growth and help low- and middle-income families, but what it really does is drastically reduce tax rates for Big Business to just 15 percent. That tax break isn't just for cooperations; it is also for pass-through firms.  Let's be clear about what pass-through firms are. Pass-through firms are entities that wealthy people and companies use in order to funnel money and have lower tax rates. Among these companies is The Trump  This is why, in asking for the President's tax returns, this is not just an ask that doesn't have any meaning. It is not a partisan ask. We have 190,000 Americans in the streets in red States and blue States asking. When we know what is in the President's tax returns, then we have the ability to make sure that we understand, as the American people, whether any plan he proposes is in the interest of the American people or whether it is in his own financial interest.  According to the Center for American Progress, 70 percent of partnership and S corporation income goes to the top 1 percent of U.households by income. So when you propose a tax cut for these pass-through entities, we are talking about a tax cut for the people in the top 1 percent of this country. We are not talking about a tax cut that benefits middle class, working families.  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities provided a specific example where a lawyer making $1 million a year could funnel their income through that pass-through and could actually save $180,000 a year. There is no doubt that this President would himself benefit from this tax plan, although we can't say exactly how much, because we haven't seen the tax returns and we don't know exactly which financial interests he has and how much he would benefit.  However, his own lawyers reported that nearly all of his 500 or so businesses are--don't be surprised--pass-throughs. If we accept this assertion from his lawyers that his assets are worth more than $10 billion, then this tax plan or tax ploy, depending on how you want to see it, would actually save the President of the United States millions of dollars, but it would not benefit millions of working families across this country who actually need to see our tax system reform so that it is more fair.  When asked how these tax cuts were paid for, Secretary Mnuchin said they would be so effective at bolstering the economy that it would pay for itself. Now, we have seen trickle-down economics before in this country, and it is a nonsensical idea that this tax plan would bolster the economy. We have seen the disastrous effects of trickle-down economics specifically on low-income and middle-income families.  The Tax Foundation estimates that reducing the business rate for companies and pass-throughs to 15 percent would actually reduce revenue in this country by $3.5 trillion over 10 years. They also found that, at the very best, the plan would only spur enough growth to pay for less than half the cost of the tax cuts. Low-and middle-income Americans would ultimately pay the price, not Big  Now, this is similar to what we saw in the healthcare plan. In the healthcare plan, if you remember, what we saw was a proposal to cut $880 billion from Medicaid and take that money and essentially give a trillion dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest. So if you were in the top 4 percent of income earners in this country, you would have gotten a tax cut of about $200,000 a year. But if you were in that age that we like to call seniors, between 50 and 64, you would have an age tax and you would have to pay up to $15,000 more on your premiums. So that is why some of my colleagues across the aisle actually called that healthcare plan a downpayment on a tax plan. It was supposed to be the beginning of a tax reform plan that, again, moved more money to the wealthiest in our country.  We are seeing a State-level microcosm of this playing out right now in the State of Kansas where the State passed massive tax cuts, including exempting pass-throughs from State taxes.  The result?  More than 333,000 residents changed their income to funnel through pass-throughs in the first year alone.  What happened in Kansas when this was pushed through?  State revenue went down by an additional almost 2 percent, costing $206 million in 2013 and $472 million the following year.  Today, the State faces a $1.1 billion shortfall, and residents are paying the price in lost programming and services. But the promise that was made at the time that this plan was pushed through in Kansas--the same kind of plan that is being proposed today at the Federal level--the promise that was made was that it would kick-start the economy. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, that hasn't happened either. Economic growth in Kansas is happening at just half the national average.  Because here is the thing: tax cuts don't just pay for themselves, and there are plenty of experts on both sides of the aisle that will attest to that. A sheet of paper is not a plan, and everyone knows it.  When reporters pressed Secretary Mnuchin and the National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn for details, they failed to provide anything of substance. A reporter asked Cohn three times what the tax cut would look like for a family of four making $60,000 per year.  I have a lot of those families, Mr.Speaker, in my district. I believe we have those families in red States and blue States, working people across this country who believe that America should be and must be a land of opportunity for people who work hard. Maybe they are not the richest people in the world. Maybe they are not the richest top 1 percent in this country. But they work hard, they earn a good living, and they deserve to have fairness in our tax plan.  Now, when Mr.Cohn was asked three times by this reporter what the tax cut would look like for a family of four making $60,000 a year, he replied it is ``gonna mean a tax cut'' three times in a row. Instead of getting answers, though, and when he was pressed, reporters were told over and over again that they would get more information later and that the administration is in ``robust talks.''  Well, I am a Member of the House, and supposedly those robust talks are happening with the House and the We all represent the people of the United We want to all be a part[[Page H2932]]of the conversation, and we demand to know specifically, as we look at this plan, how this President, his family, and his Cabinet will benefit from the tax plan. That is only fair, Mr.Speaker, that we understand exactly how this tax plan would benefit the person who is proposing the tax plan.  Is this tax plan for the American people to see relief, or is it for the President and his best friends to see relief?  The reality is that this is about an issue of trust. The American people deserve to know whether they can trust this President and this administration to act on their behalf. So far, unfortunately, this administration has continued to throw the middle class under the bus, whether it is threatening to cut funding for Meals on Wheels, which is part of the budget proposal in cutting the CDBG programs, or whether it is in proposing a healthcare plan that cuts vital health care from millions of So we are intent to stay extremely vigilant.

Their bill repeals a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule which cuts down on those companies' abilities to use so-called forced arbitration clauses which prevent cheated or defrauded consumers from going to court. In other words, they prevent the victims from going to court. They want to handcuff the customers, not the megabanks that took them to the cleaners.

12990,topic-id,1315,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss the Federal Communication Commission's welcome proposal to end utility-style regulation of the internet by reversing the 2015 open internet order.  Anyone who has followed the hyperbolic debate about net neutrality has likely heard that the FCC is moving to squelch competition, limit consumer choice, raise prices, and perhaps even destroy the internet. That is my favorite one. At least that is what some activists and crusading late-night comedians claim. But none of this is true--none of it.  Rather, the FCC is reviewing the light-touch regulatory environment that, from the outset, facilitated the kind of innovation that produced the internet and expanded internet access to millions of Americans over the course of many years.  In order to understand this complicated issue, we need to be honest about what led us to where we are today; that is, the FCC's 2015 open internet order. The Obama-era FCC claimed that its order implemented net neutrality, or the equal treatment of all data over the internet, but that isn't quite right. The actual change was far broader than that.  The FCC reclassified broadband internet access service as a title II telecommunication service, instead of a title I information service. That might sound like a small change, but this soundingly small--some might even say soundingly innocuous--change applied a whole host of New Deal era regulations that were meant to apply to monopolistic telephone companies, monopolistic utility companies, and they applied those to the internet.  It subjected 21st century technology to the same rules that governed rotary telephones in the 1930s. Why, then, did the FCC do this? It wasn't because a free and open internet was harming The activists and entertainers clamoring for more government control of the internet claimed that it was under attack by predatory internet service providers but, strangely enough, none of them actually provided evidence for that very serious assertion.  If you are going to make that claim, back it up, point to evidence. Instead, they speak about imaginary or hypothetical harms. The 400-page order uses words like ``may,'' ``could,'' ``might,'' or ``potentially'' not just here and there, not just a few times but several hundred times. Nor did the FCC issue the open internet order because Congress told it to.  On the contrary, nearly 20 years ago, our colleague Senator Wyden, along with then-Senator John Kerry and others, expressly argued against the drastic action that would later be taken by the FCC in 2015. After passing the bipartisan Telecommunications Act in 1996, this group of Senators affirmed[[Page S3081]]the internet's status as a free and open information service, stating that ``nothing in the 1996 Act or its legislative history suggests that Congress intended to alter the current classification of Internet and other information services or to expand traditional telephone regulation to new and advanced services.''  Finally, the FCC did not intervene because it had evidence of market failure. When the FCC issued its order, the internet was still an explosive source of growth and innovation throughout America and throughout the world--as it had been for decades--when greater and greater numbers of Americans gained access to the internet for the first time. Perhaps, because of this inconvenient fact, the FCC hardly considered the possible economic effects of its regulations. The FCC's chief economist at the time went so far as to say the rules were an ``economics-free zone.''  What the internet does need is regulatory certainty, which is why I recently introduced the Restoring Internet Freedom Act, along with several of my colleagues. This bill would fully repeal the FCC's 2015 internet takeover. More importantly, it would prevent the FCC from interfering with the internet in the future unless such actions were specifically authorized by  We shouldn't stop there. Instead of waiting for regulators and activists to find new excuses to restrict the internet, we should open it further to extend more choices to American consumers. In other words, we should ensure that Federal policy promotes competition.  As we know from experience, heavy-handed regulations like the FCC's order tend to favor large, deep-pocketed companies over startups that can't afford an army of lobbyists in Removing these regulatory barriers will allow upstart entrepreneurs to compete with incumbents for consumers' loyalty. Those consumers--ordinary Americans and their families--will benefit from the improved service and lower prices that this kind of competition inevitably creates.  Most American households currently have access to at least one internet service provider. Many have access to two or more, which might look like a competitive market exists for those households, but regulations can keep these different options from being adequate substitutes for one another.  The government restricts access to valuable resources that could be used for high-quality internet services. According to a 2012 report by the Obama administration, the Federal Government is sitting on upwards of 60 percent of the best radio spectrum, so-called ``beachfront'' spectrum, which could be put to use for commercial internet services like 5G wireless broadband.  Meanwhile, excessive permitting, licensing, and environmental impact regulations delayed broadband deployment over Federal and public lands, especially in the  Finally, the Office of Management and Budget found that private parties spend nearly $800 million each year to comply with FCC paperwork requirements. The bill for this ends up being paid entirely by ordinary American families.  Thankfully, my colleagues in the Senate have already identified many of these problems and have done work to address them. Senators Klobuchar and Daines have spent considerable time on policies to streamline broadband internet deployment through their ``dig-once'' proposals. Senator Heller is a champion for reducing barriers for deploying broadband throughout the Senators Thune and Nelson, the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, have introduced measures in the past to free up radio spectrum held by Federal agencies and organizations.  These are just a few of the many thoughtful ideas to reduce barriers to entry and increase competition, which has the potential to improve quality and bring down prices. The bipartisan nature of these policies demonstrates a clear understanding that improvements can be made, and everyone should be able to agree that more competition is better for American consumers, especially those in rural or low-income housing.  Everyone should also be able to agree that consumers should be protected from unfair and deceptive business practices. Thankfully, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission already enforce fair rules that protect Americans' enjoyment of a free and open internet.  The combination of competition and strong enforcement of antitrust and consumer protections provides the benefits of an innovative marketplace while avoiding problems that come from tired, anti-consumer, outdated regulations like title II and like the 2015 open internet order.  For the sake of American consumers and innovators--not for entrenched business interests--I hope to work with partners in the House, Senate, and the FCC to promote competition in the technology sector, including among internet service providers. If that means underperforming companies have to work a little harder for their customers, that is all the better, because the end result of lively competition is more investment and innovation by businesses, which translates into more choices and better service for consumers.  I encourage my colleagues, regardless of party or ideology, to work with me on this project. If they are truly interested in a better internet--not just government intrusion and control for its own sake--I am sure they can help me identify other barriers to entry to the information superhighway.  For now, a good start to ensure that American consumers and small businesses benefit from the internet is to repeal the FCC's 2015 internet takeover, enforce antitrust, unfair, and deceptive practice standards, and encourage competition among internet firms. Only then can we guarantee an internet that is free and open for everyone.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

13085,topic-id,199,"Mr.Speaker, last weekend I was honored to join the Kinsley, Kansas, Summer Food Service Program at the Kinsley-Offerle Junior-Senior High It always makes my day when I walk into a room filled with children I delivered in the past decade and their moms.  Like those programs in communities in my district and around the country, these folks serve free breakfast and lunch, and the program is sponsored by the school district. It is great to see this local partnership, this community coalition coming together to help their children.  We live in the most prosperous country in the world, where we have annually produced a tremendous abundance of food, yet it continues to amaze me that we have the level of hunger that we do, especially among our own children.  Good nutrition is too important for the development of these young minds not to ensure, through the communities and programs like these, that they are well fed. Whether you are in the largest ag-producing district in the country, like mine in Kansas, or a city on the coast, we have no excuses.  I thank programs like these for their role in raising a healthy generation.

13086,topic-id,174,"Mr.Speaker, in the last 2\1/2\ centuries, 119 of our Nation's educators have tragically lost their lives while serving both their students and their communities, a terrible sacrifice they didn't expect when they followed their calling to help our young people.  The National Teachers Hall of Fame in Emporia State University, in my district, built a memorial honoring those who have lost their lives while pursuing their educational calling. Founded in 2014, the memorial was built to honor those who had taught students, ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade, and has now been expanded to honor fallen educators at all academic levels.  While the National Teachers Hall of Fame is regionally recognized, our country still lacks a national memorial for those that have lost their lives while serving our students. By recognizing this memorial, we don't have to spend a dime of Federal funding, but we have a place to remember these men and women.  I have introduced a bill, H.2711, that will do just that. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-13-pt1-PgH4858.txt,99999999999999,MEDICAL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,13.0,July

12758,topic-id,1208,"Mr.President, climate disruption is a seminal challenge of our generation. It affects everything from our farms to our forests to our fishing. We see the impact in disappearing glaciers, melting permafrost, shrinking ice sheets, raging forest fires, dying coral reefs, migrating animals and insects, and more powerful storms.  The world is changing right in front of us. It is appropriate to call this climate disruption because our climate is broken, and it is affecting so many things that we value. In response, communities across the globe are transforming their energy economies--from increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, vehicles, and appliances to replacing a carbon-polluting fossil-fuel-energy economy with a renewable and clean-energy economy.  How much do you know about the changes under way? Let's find out. Welcome to episode 4 of the Senate Climate Disruption  Here we go. First question: Atmospheric carbon dioxide is at its highest level in at least how many years? Is it 88 years? Is it the highest level in the last 8,000 years? Is it the highest level in the last 800,000 years, or is it the highest level in the last 80 million years?  Think about your answer.  The correct answer is C, 800,000 years.  In September 2016, we reached a historic milestone. The carbon dioxide readings for the planet reached 400 parts per million. For perspective, before the industrial revolution, before we started burning fossil fuels in massive quantities, that number was about 280 parts per million.  Here is something that is even scarier. The rate is going up faster and faster. In 1965 and 1975, it was going up at about 1 part per million per year. Then, a couple of decades later, it was 2 parts per million per year, and the last 2 years, it has gone up at a rate of 3 parts per million per year.  As the human civilization, we have to turn this around. We have to not only slow it down, but we have to turn it around and lower those levels of carbon dioxide if we are going to save our blue-green planet.[[Page S4664]]  Question 2, which Governor announced that he or she will hold a global climate summit here in America next year?  Is the answer Jerry Brown? Is the answer Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan, Governor Susana Martinez of New Mexico, or Governor Rick Scott of Florida?  The answer--now that you have decided which one you think is right--is A, Governor Jerry Brown of He announced on July 6 that he will bring together entrepreneurs, mathematicians, professors, climate experts, and others from around the world in September 2018 for a summit to ``combat the existential threat of climate change.''  This meeting is being viewed as a very significant undertaking to keep the conversation going forward, because in the absence of the United States being deeply involved in the Paris Agreement, the United States has to be involved in many other ways. This issue is too big, and the challenge is too great for us to be sitting it out.  Let's turn to question 3. The world's first floating wind farm is being constructed off the coast of which country? Is it Germany? Is it off the coast of the United States? Is it Scotland? Or is it France?  I might point out that, when we see a floating wind farm, we are talking about a wind farm in which the sea floor is deep enough that it can't be anchored; that is, the turbine cannot be anchored on the sea floor. There is a hint, a little clue.  Do you have your answer?  The correct answer is C,  The Peterhead wind farm, off the coast of Scotland, is using revolutionary technology to harvest wind power in waters that are too deep for wind turbines to be anchored on the seabed.  The wind farm's first turbine was just towed into place. Once finished, it will include five 6-megawatt turbines. By the way, those are much larger turbines than the ones we have on land in the United The blades will be 246 feet long. Together, the group of turbines will be able to power 20,000 homes by the end of the installation.  Maybe we will see some of those appearing off the coast of the United States in the future.  Let's turn to question 4. Glacier National Park in 1910 had 150 glaciers. How many are there today? Are there 200? Are there 150? Are there 25? Or are there 10?  What is the answer?  The answer is C, 25.  Here we are in just a century, and we have gone from 150 glaciers in Glacier National Park to only 25 left. According to Dan Fagre, a USGS research ecologist, ``within 20 years, the bulk of the remaining glaciers will be too small to be considered active glaciers.''  When these glaciers are gone, it will have a significant impact on Montana and its economy. They typically put off a significant amount of water in late August and early They feed streams that would otherwise dry up. They provide cool water that plays a critical role in the life cycles of both insects and fish. If you are planning to see the glaciers in Glacier National Park, go soon.  Let's turn to question 5. Tesla, the electric car company, is set to install the world's largest grid-scale battery in which country? Are they going to install that battery in China, in Australia, in Mexico, or in Spain?  If you had time to ponder the question and develop your answer, the answer is not China, which you might expect because China is so large and is so engaged in renewable energy today, nor is it Mexico or It is  Australia has embraced renewable energy. In 2016, renewable sources produced more than 17 percent of the country's electricity. South Australia has raced ahead of the rest of the country in embracing renewables, particularly wind power.  Until now, it has not been able to adequately store the energy generated by the region's wind farms. Later this year, Tesla will install the world's largest lithium-ion grid-scale battery and pair it with one of the wind farms, in a major leap forward for large-scale renewable energy use.  The idea is that the 129-megawatt-hour battery, which is capable of putting out 100 megawatts of power at a time, will help stabilize South Australia's electrical grid and provide backup power if there is a shortfall.  More and more, as we have wind on the grid and as we have solar power on the grid, batteries are being turned to as a strategy to even out the flow of electricity.  There you have it, folks. Five questions in episode 4 of the Senate Climate Disruption They are questions ripped right from the headlines. Facts on the ground are changing fast, as climate disruption increases and communities across the globe are responding. We are racing the clock. There is no time to spare.  Stay engaged in the fight to save our beautiful blue-green planet. In the near future, I will bring you episode 5 of the Senate Climate Disruption  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Freeing Syrians from the brutality of ISIS is but one part of a complex, grinding civil war that began with the Assad regime's heinous violence against civilians and has endured for over 6 years, with over 400,000 Syrians killed, 6 billion Syrians displaced within Syria, and over 4.5 million forced to flee as refugees.  We now have over 500 U.troops deployed to Syria to advise and assist Syrian opposition forces. However, we have yet to have a clear, comprehensive political strategy that describes what the end goals are for U.involvement and how we hope to achieve those goals.  This amendment requires just that, and follows a similar effort I led with General and Representative John Bacon on Iraq that received bipartisan support in the Armed Services Committee last year.  This amendment requires a comprehensive political and military strategy for U.policy in Syria to be submitted by the Departments of Defense and State to Congress and the American people within 90 days of enactment.

12847,topic-id,415,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to this pernicious antilabor amendment that would do nothing but make it easier for U.S.-owned but foreign-flagged cruise ship operators to exploit and abuse the seafarers they employ.  The right for seafarers to seek maintenance and cure for injuries, illness, and damages at sea has been a part of U.maritime law for as long as U.ships have flown the flag on the high seas.  The effect of this amendment is clear: it would restrict foreign seafarers employed on foreign-flagged cruise ships from filing claims for damages or expenses related to personal injury, illness, or even death, in a U.court.  This provision is completely contrary to a general maritime law principle that has been around since at least the 12th century, a principle that has remained applicable because of the international nature of shipping and the plain fact that, even today, ship operators maintain considerable leverage over individual seafarers.  This provision also violates an international convention that the U.has ratified. Under the Shipowners' Liability Convention, national laws or regulations have to be interpreted and enforced to ensure equality of treatment to all seafarers, irrespective of nationality, domicile, or race. This amendment would shred that international obligation.  It is also contrary to the principles and terms defining seafarers' rights under the International Maritime Labor  It is also worth mentioning that the amendment before us may be unnecessary because, in many cases, seafarer contracts contain binding arbitration clauses.  In any event, it makes no sense to deny access to U.courts for foreign[[Page H5839]]seafarers seeking compassion for maintenance and cure claims. The cruise lines can easily avoid frivolous lawsuits. All they need do is honor their longstanding customary responsibility to pay for the care and recovery of the seafarers they employ when they are ill or injured.  In closing, no one has provided any evidence--much less, compelling evidence--to justify the reversal of longstanding seafarer protections. In the absence of evidence, the House should reject this unwarranted amendment.  This vote is purely to injure seafarers, purely to disobey maritime conventions to which we are a party, purely to disobey laws of the sea from the 12th century that we have obeyed since we obtained our independence from England, for no purpose other than to help often American-owned--not always--but foreign-flagged cruise ship lines.  There is no purpose for this amendment. The House should reject this amendment as it has in the past.  Mr.Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Chairman, it sounds nice to say they can go home to their country from which they came, where presumably the foreign-flagged ship operates, but that is not the case. These are often American-owned ships or European-owned ships, and they are flagged in a country of convenience--Liberia, Panama, or wherever--where the worker may have no connection whatsoever, where the ship, for that matter, has no real connection other than flying the flag of convenience, and where there may not be a very decent court system.  That is why the practice has been, since before our independence--it has worked well the entire history of our country--that a foreign citizen working on a ship that calls in the United States, if denied the maintenance and cure that the ship is supposed to take care of someone on the high seas, then they can sue in an American court. We have always done this. There has been no showing of hardship whatsoever.  Yes, some rich cruise line operators would like, perhaps, to get rid of this obligation, but that is no excuse.

Now known as atomic veterans, these GIs were placed in extremely dangerous areas and were constantly exposed to potentially dangerous levels of radiation in the performance of their duties. They were sworn to secrecy, unable to even talk to their doctors about their past exposure to radiation.  Thankfully, Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.Bush recognized the atomic veterans' value and service and acted to provide specialized care and compensation for their harrowing duty.  In 2007, our allies, Great Britain, New Zealand, and Australia, enacted their versions of this amendment by authorizing a medal to honor their atomic veterans who served with the United  Regrettably, the Pentagon remains silent on honoring the service of our atomic veterans, arguing that to do so would diminish the service of other military personnel who are tasked with dangerous missions.

12922,topic-id,646,"Mr.Speaker, I think we need to define a few terms here what we are talking about. We are talking about tax returns. What does that mean? It doesn't mean the 1040. It doesn't mean the 278.  In this particular case, Mr.Speaker, we are talking about close to 12,000 pages of tax returns; that is what we are talking about, the integrity of the House, the integrity of myself and you. I know you are a person of integrity. And I say it like it is, so I am not blowing smoke. That is why this is important.  So a 2-page, 3-page 1040 doesn't mean anything to what we are doing; 12,000 pages, just on this President's tax returns.  The stunning potential conflicts of interest are piling up. Every day, we[[Page H5015]]all read about it. The President was told by the Ethics Commission, divest yourself of your holdings. That doesn't mean you give your money away, your assets away. It means what it says, you divest.  But I think that there is nothing more of a threat to the integrity of our House than ignoring our duties, to provide a check and a balance to the executive branch. To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to request the President's tax returns. Give the American people the transparency that they deserve.  In addition, it is reported that the President's hotel in Washington received $270,000 from Saudi Arabia when they were here to lobby against the bill allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue the Saudi  Now, last week, the District of Columbia and Maryland filed a lawsuit against the President, arguing that he is violating the anticorruption clauses in the Constitution by allowing his businesses to accept payments from foreign governments and other government entities. We have no way of knowing whether the President or his firms have received Russian income or loans or entered into Russian-linked partnerships. In fact, you are going to read a lot about that this week. There are hearings going on as we speak. A certified letter from paid attorneys does nothing to assuage these concerns.  Two weeks ago, we heard from the former Director of the FBI, James Comey, who confirmed that the President tried to influence him to stop the Russian investigation.  Isn't it great that we live in a body where they can't stop us? The President can't stop us. We can only stop ourselves.  The legislative branch has the responsibility and authority to check the executive branch, and section 6103, you have heard me say that number many times, section 6103 of the Tax Code, which allows for the examination of tax returns--that authority, put in place specifically so Congress could examine conflicts of interest following that scandal which we all know about in 1923.  Nothing could be more of a threat, to me, to the integrity of the House and our Members, than ignoring our duty to fully examine the personal financial entanglements of this President or any President, and particularly those, at this time, which we are reading about, that he may have with the Russian entities and individuals or whether he abused the tax laws of this country.  We have a right to know who our public officials are and what investments they have made, and every member of the executive branch of government--and this was made clear in the decision in 1924, particularly Interior Secretary Fall at that time, to examine his tax records, and that is how people were brought to justice in 1924.  It also protects the privacy of the very taxpayer. And we are having exceptions. We have exceptions to that. Three years ago, we had an exception in the Ways and Means  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

13017,topic-id,3936,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying legislation, H.111, disapproval of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's arbitration rule.  Before turning to the underlying legislation, I want to raise concerns about the bulk of the work this week, which is the so-called minibus appropriations bill, in which this body will seek to spend over $700 billion of deficit expenditures. That funding bill combines four major appropriations bills and represents more than half of discretionary spending. It includes our spending for the legislative branch, veterans, energy and water, and the Department of  Unfortunately, there is additional deficit spending that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided to put in the bill, providing $1.6 billion to build a border wall, directly contrary to the promises President Trump made on the campaign trail that another country would pay for the wall. Republicans are seeking to pass the bill to you, Madam Speaker, and our fellow taxpayers to pay for this wall, in direct violation of President Trump's promise.  They also stripped out a bipartisan amendment by Representative Lee that would end the 2001 AUMF and require Congress to come up with a new Authorization for Use of Military Force within 8 months that was placed into this bill in committee. Representative Lee's amendment was stripped out by the Rules Committee despite it being in the committee mark and despite bipartisan support to require an Authorization for Use of Military We really need to start making some decisions about the direction of our military. Representative Lee's amendment would have forced Congress to have that discussion.  Congress, unfortunately, seems to only work--or works best--when we are on the clock, the day or two before the expiration of funding, the day or two before an arbitrary time limit. This would apply a similar test to force Congress to have a discussion around the Authorization for Use of Military  I have full confidence that, had that time not been met, Democrats and Republicans could have provided additional short-term extensions for the Authorization for Use of Military Force until such time Congress could come together to pass a new one, agree with the Senate, and send it to the President's desk.  Now on to the matters at hand.  This underlying resolution of disapproval weakens consumer protections while protecting big banks rather than consumers. This rule was crafted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to help restore consumer rights and give consumers the ability to join together when they are taken advantage of by big banks.  Instead of debating ways to improve consumer protections or increase access to financial services, my colleagues instead have brought a Congressional Review Act resolution that would stop our own financial safety mechanisms from taking any future action on arbitration clauses in consumer financial products.  Now, we have all seen these arbitration clauses. You might need a magnifying glass because the font is small, the contract is large. Even sophisticated consumers often don't know that by unilaterally signing those rights away, they are removing their ability to address their grievances in court. In many cases, removing the ability to have any justice because when you have a large class, each of whom suffers a small amount of damage, even the cost of administering an arbitration claim can be prohibitive if the claim per affected individual is $50, $75, or $100. Absent these kinds of protections, you give broad license for big banks to rip off large numbers of consumers and take a small amount of money from each of them. That is what this rule is intended to prevent.  The House Financial Services Committee did not hold any hearings on this rule. It didn't go through committee. It appeared just a few days ago when it was introduced. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau didn't have the opportunity to testify about their studies or their findings, or the process they went through to finalize the rule, including input from the general public.  Congress has authorized the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to examine the use of arbitration agreements by financial institutions and[[Page H6227]]consumer contracts; and, if necessary, to take appropriate steps to limit the use of them, to prevent arbitration agreements from being forced on consumers. In any particular case, both sides can certainly agree to arbitration. Given the choice, many consumers will choose arbitration. This is about forcing consumers and giving them no alternative but to give away their rights to sue in a court of law in favor of an arbitration process.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that 90 percent of arbitration agreements built into the fine point of financial consumer products actually do prohibit class action lawsuits. In cases involving credit card issuers, companies being sued used the arbitration clauses buried in the fine print contract to block class action lawsuits 65 percent of the time.  Again, even with the lower costs of administering an arbitration case, it is prohibitive if the claim per person is relatively small. So we are talking about situations where people are illegally ripped off of $20, of $100, of their annual credit card processing fee illegally charged. Their redress, absent a class action, is essentially nonexistent because even though the cost of pursuing an arbitration case is significantly less than the courts, they still can either take up an enormous amount of time or, if you hire outside counsel, thousands of dollars. Thank goodness, not the hundreds of thousands of dollars that a full court case can entail, but certainly thousands of dollars.  And if you were deprived of $30 or $50, are you just supposed to accept it? Or can hundreds or thousands of people who were ripped off band together and seek justice, as this rule would allow for?  Long before the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took any action, the Department of Defense already recognized that forced arbitration clauses in consumer loans to servicemembers stripped away the rights of servicemembers and ultimately banned forced arbitration clauses in consumer loan products made to servicemembers. We don't want people taking advantage of members of our military. So, too, we don't want anybody taking advantage of members of the American public.  But we know that big banks don't want consumers to have more power when it comes to financial products. They prefer the deck remained stacked against consumers, even when a bank or a credit card company breaks the law.  When it comes to financial service products, most consumers are entirely at the mercy of our financial institutions. These arbitration clauses are buried in pages and pages of small print and disclosures that are very technical for people with a college degree, no less a high school degree, no less not even graduating from high school. The consumer doesn't have the ability to modify the contract before they sign it--take it or leave it--or negotiate on any type of footing equally with the bank. They are left with a take-it-or-leave-it choice. According to the Bureau study, more than 75 percent of consumers surveyed did not know whether they were subject to an arbitration clause in their agreements, and less than 7 percent knew that those clauses limit their ability to bring a claim to court. That means 93 percent of the people who sign these agreements don't even realize they are signing their right to sue away, and that is because they are buried in fine print, are unclear, and run contrary to the fundamental American principle of the ability to seek justice when you are wronged.  This final rule restores consumer rights to band together when there is a systemic and widespread form of misconduct by a bank. This resolution of disapproval would stop consumers from even knowing if others were harmed in a similar manner by the same bank or lender so they could potentially band together.  I am glad that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau final rule actually gave some power back to consumers. And now here we have the Republicans trying to take that power right away and give it back to the big banks.  Madam Speaker, I would like to include in the Record a letter signed by 310 organizations that include civil rights, faith-based, and consumer advocacy groups that support the arbitration rule.                                                    July 12, 2017.     Re Final Rule on Arbitration     Monica Jackson,     Office of the Executive Secretary, Consumer Financial          Protection Bureau, Washington       The 310 undersigned consumer, civil rights, labor,      community, and non-profit organizations write to state our      strong support for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau      (CFPB)'s final rule to limit pre-dispute binding mandatory      (or forced) arbitration clauses in consumer finance      contracts. The rule, which will restore consumers' ability to      band together in court to pursue claims, is a significant      step forward in the ongoing fight to curb predatory practices      in consumer financial products and services and to make these      markets fairer and safer.       Lenders and other financial services companies use forced      arbitration to push consumers out of court and into a private      arbitration system that is tilted against them. Forced      arbitration eliminates the right to a civil jury trial,      limits discovery, restricts or prohibits public disclosure of      proceedings and outcomes, and makes meaningful appeals      virtually impossible. It also often prohibits consumers from      banding together in a class action to hold the company      responsible.       Recent scandals again demonstrate the very real harm forced      arbitration causes consumers. Reports show that customers had      been trying to sue financial services institutions over      fraudulent accounts going back a number of years. However,      some banks forced those customers into secret, binding      arbitration by invoking fine print in consumers' legitimate      account agreements to block them from suing over reasons as      outrageous as fake accounts, also helping to keep the scandal      out of the public eye. Even in cases where widespread fraud      has been exposed, banks continue to invoke these fine-print      clauses to kill lawsuits stemming from their illegal acts and      block consumer recovery.       The CFPB's thorough arbitration study further documents how      forced arbitration blocks consumer access to courts,      shielding banks and lenders from meaningful accountability      for their unlawful behavior. Finalizing the proposed rule      will restore crucial class action rights that deter systemic      abuses and bring much-needed transparency to consumer      financial arbitration. The CFPB Study Data Shows That Forced Arbitration Eliminates Consumer             Claims and Shields Companies from Accountability       The CFPB's study verified the prevalence of forced      arbitration clauses--including class action bans--in consumer      financial contracts and found that this practice impacts tens      of millions of consumers. Yet it also revealed that consumers      typically have no idea they are signing away their right to      sue in court when they participate in the financial      marketplace.       The most obvious impact of forced arbitration clauses is      that they block most consumer claims from going forward at      all. Class action bans prevent consumers from bringing      complaints of fraud or other abusive or deceptive practices      in financial services because the individual value of these      claims is often too small for a single consumer to afford to      bring alone. Without the option to join together in a class      action, just 25 consumers with claims of under $1,000 pursued      arbitration each year. In a county of over 320 million, these      numbers leave no doubt that class action bans effectively      wipe out consumer claims and thus shield corporate wrongdoers      from liability. In the few claims that went to arbitration,      the study also confirmed that forced arbitration      overwhelmingly favors industry over consumers. Class Actions Provide Great Benefit for Consumers Cheated by Systemic              Wrongdoing and Deter Risky or Illegal Conduct       The data makes clear that class actions provide a practical      way for groups of consumers who have suffered the same kind      of abuse from the same corporate wrongdoer to join together      to attempt to hold the financial institution accountable. The      CFPB study found that 34 million consumers received a total      of $2.2 billion in cash payments, debt forbearance, and other      in-kind relief from 2008-2012--not including any attorneys'      fees or court costs.       These findings were echoed in an empirical study by      disinterested academics, which found consumer class actions      against illegal overdraft fees ``deliver[ed] fair      compensation to a significant portion of class members.''      Several major banks settled class actions that claimed the      banks had purposely reordered consumer transactions to      maximize the amount of overdraft fees charged to the      consumer. This study found that plaintiffs in these cases      recovered up to ``65% of damages, with the variation based      largely on the strength of the class's claims and the      likelihood of winning certification of the class.'' Yet      unknown thousands of other consumers subject to similarly      unlawful overdraft fee practices likely got little or no      relief when class actions against their banks were dismissed      due to arbitration clauses.       Even assuming that their claims would be fairly resolved in      arbitration, leaving 34 million consumers to find their own      attorney, establish the individual facts of their case, and      take time off work to attend an arbitration will never be      more efficient than pooling time and resources between      millions of[[Page H6228]]     consumers harmed in the same way by the same bank or lender      to challenge abusive practices. Indeed, additional empirical      scholarship demonstrates that most consumers are unaware when      they have been harmed, unaware that the harm violates a law,      or have decided that filing individual claims is not worth      their time and expense.       Collective action is critically important, not only for      enabling those already victimized to obtain justice, but also      for deterring bad behavior and preventing harm to other      victims. While each individual consumer may only lose $25 or      $50 to a fraudulent charge or illegal fee, for example,      unlawful practices implemented at a systemic level can add up      to millions or more in ill-gotten gains for banks and lenders      who violate the law. Government enforcers have limited      resources, and the prospect of class actions helps ensure      that banks and lenders obey legal requirements that protect      consumers.     The Rule's Reporting Requirements Add Crucial Transparency to                               Arbitration       Our organizations strongly support the proposed provision      to begin shining a light on individual arbitrations through      reporting requirements. Unlike our legal system, which is      built upon hundreds of years of precedent, common law      principles, and statutory standards of fairness and ethics,      arbitration firms have few constraints on their practices and      scant record of their proceedings. The substantially shorter      history of consumer arbitration has nonetheless produced both      anecdotal claims of unethical behavior and documented      systemic abuses by unregulated arbitration films.       The rule's reporting requirements will lend crucial      transparency and accountability to a previously opaque      system. Increased transparency can help consumers make      informed decisions when choosing how to pursue their claim,      in line with well-established principles of the free market.      Data collected by the CFPB will also help other government      entities, as well as the general public, ensure that      arbitrators operate within the law and treat all parties      fairly. The Rule is in the Public Interest and for the Protection of Consumers       Because forced arbitration undermines compliance with laws      and creates an uneven playing field between corporations that      use forced arbitration and those that allow for greater      consumer choice in dispute resolution, it is in the public      interest and in the interest of consumer protection to      prohibit or strictly curtail the use of forced arbitration      clauses in consumer financial contracts.       We commend the CFPB for finalizing its rule to restore      consumers' right to choose how to resolve disputes with      financial institutions and address the public harm caused by      forced arbitration, as thoroughly documented in its three-     year, comprehensive study.

13018,topic-id,585,"Madam Speaker, this letter, which I think my colleagues will find convincing, has 310 groups that have signed on in support of this rule, including groups from across the ideological spectrum, across the States, many faith-based groups, and many others, including from my friend from Colorado's and my home State, the Interfaith Alliance of Colorado; the National Council of Jewish Women, Colorado Section; the NAACP State Conference of Colorado; the Colorado Fiscal Institute; the Colorado Council of Churches; the Colorado Alliance of Retired Americans, and many others.                              {time}  1245  So I am glad that this will appear in the Record for all of Congress to see. I will encourage my colleagues to read this letter and see who signed it before casting your vote on the repeal of this rule, the Congressional disapproval resolution. So this will appear in the Record, and I know that my colleagues will study that Record before making their decision.  Prior to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal consumer protection laws were enforced by a number of different regulators and different agencies. This was uneven and, after the 2008 financial crisis, I was personally glad that we were able to pull together the efforts to protect consumers in the Consumer Financial Protection  But despite their success, Republicans have been going after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ever since. Despite record profits by banks and Wall Street, here we are trying to go back to a time when there was nobody to keep them in check. Despite the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau returning nearly $12 billion to harmed consumers, the Republicans continue to attack the agency.  This is entirely the purpose that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created, this type of rule. Congress specifically authorized the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to study forced arbitration agreements, and determine what steps were necessary.  The Bureau undertook an extensive rulemaking process that had public comments. I hope my colleagues across the aisle who support this repeal were active in that public comment process because that was an important time to be heard. The banks participated in that, consumer groups, and so many other stakeholders before the final rule was issued.  My colleagues across the aisle have not offered any evidence in support of this resolution of disapproval. Why are you seeking to strip rights away from consumers in this fashion?  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that just 400 consumers per year pursue claims in arbitration, with only 16 receiving any cash relief. Again, when you are ripped off of a relatively small amount of money, you don't have redress in the courts as a sole plaintiff. You don't have redress--I shouldn't say you don't; you technically do--you don't have an economic form of redress in the courts, and you don't have an economically viable form of redress through arbitration.  So the only true mechanism, if you have a million people, each of whom are deprived of $20 or $50, the only realistic legal mechanism is a class action lawsuit, which this rule would protect.  There is also no evidence to show, no studies--I would challenge my colleagues to cite them if there are--to show that removing this type of clause can somehow increase costs to consumers.  Frankly, this resolution of disapproval is just a giveaway to big banks at the expense of you, me, everybody who has a credit card, everybody who has a loan--the wrong direction for the country.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgH6225-6.txt,1910,AUTHORIZING USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL,2017.0,25.0,April

Madam Speaker, for months now we have been debating bills that hurt hardworking Americans--bills that kick millions, tens of millions, of people off health insurance; bills that gut safety and environmental protections that would keep our air clean; bills that prioritize the interests of Wall Street over Main  This is not what my constituents want. It is also not what the constituents of many of us want. Madam Speaker, for this reason, Democrats have unveiled an agenda to increase wages, reduce costs for everyday expenses, and give workers the training they need to compete in 21st century jobs.  Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Pocan's Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills Act, H.2933, which would promote effective apprenticeships that would give students and workers more opportunities to find good-paying jobs.  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote of the previous question.

I hope in that time we can focus on strengthening the economy and empowering consumers rather than taking away consumers' rights, like this bill does.  We should focus on fixing our broken immigration system to create more economic growth and reduce our deficit, and we should create jobs and make sure that more people are covered by healthcare, not less.  Instead, here we are, spending time on the floor of the House stripping away consumer protections and spending American taxpayer money on an unwanted border wall, in direct violation of President Trump's promise.

13048,topic-id,536,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.76. This very important legislation grants congressional consent and approval to Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact under Article I, section 10 of the Constitution, establishing the Metrorail Safety Importantly, Federal transit funds have been suspended by the Federal Transit Authority until Congress grants its assent to these amendments to the WMATA compact, as H.76 would do.  I want to thank my friend, the distinguished minority whip, Steny Hoyer, for taking the lead on this measure, and all of our colleagues in the Virginia and Maryland delegations and District of Columbia delegation for supporting it in such a strong, bipartisan, and cross-Potomac River fashion. I am proud to join them.  Mr.Speaker, I did want to take a moment to say a word about the Metro system.  WMATA is not just the Metro that serves the Washington area. It is truly America's Metro system. It is the second largest system in the Nation, behind only New York It is 117 miles long. It has 91 stations, and it includes more than 12,000 employees.  It is critical to the functioning of the Federal Government because it moves more than 40 percent of the Federal workforce every day to and from work and also during the day for various missions that people go on during the normal workday. It is essential to national security. If we didn't have the Metro system, what is already one of the most traffic-plagued and congested regions in the country would be absolutely paralyzed.  It is also the mechanism that moves millions of Americans who come from all over the United States, all of our constituents here in Congress, to visit us. That is how people get to the White House and the Capitol and go to the Pentagon and go to see NIH and visit the museums and the battlefields and so on.  So the Metro is critical not just to the people who live and work here every day and make the Federal Government go, but also to all American citizens who rely on the efficiency of the Federal Government and come to Washington to petition for redress of grievances and to partake in the processes of government.  I am thrilled that this legislation, responding to the safety needs of the system, is moving forward with speed now. It is essential that we continue to invest in the Metro, to upgrade its safety, to upgrade its efficiency and its reliability.  The Federal Government was instrumental in the creation of Metro at the beginning, along with Virginia, Maryland, and the District of We all send representatives to the board of The Federal Government has representatives on the board of We are equal partners in it, and I want to make sure that everyone here in Congress feels deeply invested in the success of Metro, which, after all, gets a lot of our staffers to work every day.  With passage of H.76, Congress reaffirms its fundamental commitment to America's Metro system. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the swift passage of this resolution.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-17-pt1-PgH5894.txt,99999999999999,GRANTING CONSENT AND APPROVAL OF CONGRESS TO ESTABLISH WASHINGTON,2017.0,17.0,June

13063,topic-id,244,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, when I was a kid in high school, they built the Metro system here. It was a great feat of bipartisan leadership when they built the Metro, and it changed my life. It was the jewel of our region, and it opened up, to at least one kid, the Capitol, the White House, the museums, the National Gallery, the Hirshhorn, the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial, and it was really a spectacular and resplendent addition and feature to the Virginia, D.C., Maryland region.  In the intervening years, there has been inadequate investment in safety, efficiency, and reliability in the Metro system, and we need to bring the Metro back to its original glory and we must make sure that, above all, it is safe for the people who ride it. The safety and security of the passengers is essential.  So passage of this resolution will ensure the establishment of the safety commission to assume effective oversight of this system and to allow for the disbursal of Federal transit funds to Maryland, Virginia, and D.for essential transit services.  I urge all of our colleagues to support this bipartisan measure.

13002,topic-id,598,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1842, the Strengthening Children's Safety Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, there are few things more shocking to the conscience or sickening to the soul than crimes against children--the most innocent, the most vulnerable members of our society.  In my time as a Federal prosecutor, the child exploitation images that I was forced to review as part of the evidence were, by far, the most disturbing and difficult part of that job. All of these years later, I still can't erase those depraved images from my mind, and I doubt that I will ever be able to do that.  But crimes against children should stick with us, they should haunt us, and then they should spur us to take action. If we do anything here in Congress, it should be working to protect children. We talk all day long in this Chamber about the future of this country. Well, Mr.Speaker, the children are the future of this country. We need to put our words into action.  So today I am introducing H.1842, the Strengthening Children's Safety Act of 2017, a bill which closes two sets of loopholes in Federal child exploitation laws to make sure that all dangerous sex offenders are treated the same and are subject to the same enhanced penalties under the law.  Right now, Mr.Speaker, current law establishes minimum national standards for sex offender registration and notification in all 50 States, in the District of Columbia, in U.territories, and Tribal jurisdictions. If a sex offender knowingly fails to register or update a registration, that individual faces a fine and imprisonment of up to 10 years.[[Page H4404]]  There is also an enhanced penalty of 5 to 30 years imprisonment if the offender, while in that noncompliance status, also commits a crime of violence under Federal law, under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the law of the District of Columbia, Indian Tribal law, or the law of any territory or possession of the United  But here is the problem, Mr.Speaker: Right now, only individuals committing crimes of violence under these Federal, military, and Tribal laws are subject to the enhanced penalty, while individuals committing the same crimes of violence under State law are not.  Mr.Speaker, hopefully, we can all agree that child predators committing crimes of violence should be subject to the same enhanced penalties, regardless of whether these crimes are being charged in Federal court or at the State level. So this bill adds similar State crimes of violence to that list to ensure that the enhanced penalty applies equally to all dangerous offenders.  Mr.Speaker, the second portion of H.1842 addresses enhanced sentences for individuals with prior sex offenses. Fortunately, our child exploitation laws consistently do call for higher sentences any time a defendant has a prior conviction for Federal or State sex offenses. But currently, these sentencing provisions do not consistently include all similar sex offense convictions that arise under the Uniform Code of Military  H.1842 amends those Federal child exploitation laws to include all child sexual exploitation offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice in the recidivist provisions, as appropriate. Again, I think it is critical, Mr.Speaker, that we close this loophole to ensure that all prior child exploitation convictions are penalized for repeat offenders.  Many issues in Congress these days are partisan, but it is my sincere hope, Mr.Speaker, that Members on both sides of the aisle today will be able to come together to support stronger protections for children who are sexually abused. Mr.Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important bill.  ",CREC-2017-05-22-pt1-PgH4402.txt,2268,PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TAX PLAN,2017.0,22.0,July
12811,topic-id,488,"Mr.President, today I would like to recognize an outstanding small business located in my home State of As many of my colleagues in the Western Caucus can tell you, catastrophic wildfires are a cause for major concern and costs for large swathes of the West, particularly in the summer months. This month's small business has found their specialty in helping to control these large wildfires in a safe and efficient manner. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor Hillcrest Aircraft Company as the U.Senate Small Business of the Month for August 2017.  Hillcrest Aircraft Company is based out of Lewiston, ID, and is a utility helicopter company with a broad spectrum of work. Hillcrest Aircraft Company was founded by local pilots in 1946. Jerry Wilson partnered with the company in 1959, eventually becoming the sole owner in 1972. Jerry's son, Gale Wilson, is the current president of the company, and his son, Keith White, serves as vice president. The Wilson's legacy of promoting a strong work ethic coupled with strict safety requirements has built the company into a premier helicopter business. In 1968, Hillcrest became the first certified Bell customer service facility in Idaho, and 1 year later, in 1969, they became an approved FAA repair station. Their main focus, however, is aerial firefighting. Whether they are transporting firefighters to remote areas or dropping hundreds of gallons of water on a raging fire, Hillcrest prides itself on protecting communities from dangerous wildfires. In fact, they have fought fires in all of the lower 48 States during their 60-plus years of experience. On top of aerial firefighting, Hillcrest flies for power and timber companies, photographers, videographers, and even fish planters. Their comprehensive background in a variety of industries, dedication to operational safety, and commitment to strict ethical standards continue to keep this family-owned business busy around the clock.  Hillcrest has always put safety first, and in 2015 and 2016, they were rewarded for their efforts. Hillcrest achieved the necessary requirements for the International Standard for Business Aircraft Operations, IS-BAO, Stage I registration by implementing a safety management system, SMS, in 2015 and Stage II registration in 2016. This safety standard acknowledges the company's efforts to improve their safety risk profile and operating efficiency. Hillcrest was one of the first rotary-wing-only operators to achieve the IS-BAO Stage  The future is bright for Hillcrest Aircraft Company as they continue to expand their business. Just a couple of months ago in June, Hillcrest opened their very own fixed base operation, FBO, at the Lewiston-Nez Perce County I would like to congratulate Gale Wilson and his family, along with all of the employees at Hillcrest, for the hard work they do in trying conditions while still keeping their commitment to safety.

12888,topic-id,519,"Mr.Chair, I rise in support of Congressman Lamborn's amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act to require the President, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Director of National Intelligence to report to Congress on the use of commercial aircraft by the Government of Iran for illicit activities. I am proud to be the lead Democratic co-sponsor of this bipartisan amendment, along with Lamborn, Roskam, Zeldin, and  As we are all aware, U.firms have reached multi-billion-dollar agreements to sell or lease hundreds of aircraft to Iran, supposedly to help bring the country's fleet into the 21st century. I am deeply concerned, however, that these aircraft, intended for civilian use, could instead be used for nefarious purposes, such as transporting fighters to Syria or weapons to Iran's proxies, Hamas and  Iran is the world's leading sponsor of terrorism, with a longstanding record of human rights violations. Its support of radical groups throughout the Middle East poses a threat both to our greatest ally in the region, Israel, and also to U.interests.. For this reason, we must keep a watchful eye on Iran's actions, including how it uses dual use exports from the United  If Iran is indeed only using American-made commercial aircraft for legitimate purposes, there should be no concern that a report confirming this would have an adverse effect on American trade. If Iran is using aircraft to conduct illicit activities, we must be made aware, and we must hold Iran accountable.  I am also proud to have co-sponsored another amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that will help hold Iran accountable for it actions. This bipartisan amendment, offered by my Nevada colleague, Kihuen, would extend a presidential reporting requirement to ensure that we have an integrated strategy between the Administration and Congress to deter Iran's nuclear weapons program.  Two years ago today, the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Iran agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA), which aimed to ensure that Iran's nuclear program would be exclusively peaceful and that Iran would never obtain a nuclear weapon. I was not a Member of Congress when the JCPOA came to the floor for Congressional approval, but had I been, I would have opposed the agreement. However, I have said since before I first came to Congress that now that the JCPOA is the law of the land, the United States must demand that Iran abide by it completely, and that any cheating or subversion should be dealt with swiftly.  Both the Lamborn and Kihuen Amendments that I have co-sponsored are manifestations of this principle. If Iran is directly violating the JCPOA by developing a nuclear weapons program, the Administration and Congress must be ready to respond. And if Iran is violating[[Page H5851]]the spirit of the JCPOA by taking advantage of new streams of commerce to wage war in the Middle East, it should not matter what financial ties U.companies have to the regime.  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote for the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes both the Lamborn and Kihuen  ",CREC-2017-07-14-pt1-PgH5836-2.txt,99999999999999,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,14.0,June

13020,topic-id,506,"Madam Speaker, I rise today to call on all of my colleagues to support this resolution and the underlying legislation, H.111.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's antiarbitration rule will cause a great deal of harm to consumers, including consumers who wish to settle a dispute with a firm in a timely and effective fashion, as well as other consumers who will see their options and choices diminished and their costs increased by this rule.  The CFPB's rule will hurt the very people the CFPB claims it is supposed to help by depriving individuals of the efficient and effective process of arbitration. The CFPB itself acknowledged that arbitration is 12 times faster, on average, than class actions.  In today's fast-paced economy, hardworking Americans may want to pursue a quicker option than becoming a party to costly and time-consuming litigation that can take years.  Not only are class actions burdensome in terms of time, but they often produce negligible benefits for the plaintiffs in question. In fact, class actions reviewed in the CFPB study resulted in an average recovery of only[[Page H6230]]$32 per class member. This is so minuscule that the firms being sued are forced to charge their customers additional fees, which fees may be larger than the initial recovery to cover the costs of the firm's legal fees. This often leaves customers worse off financially than if they had never chosen to settle their dispute.  Contrast this negligible or nonexistent relief and headache it causes consumers with the average $5,300 of relief that consumers obtained through arbitration in the cases that the CFPB reviewed in its own study. Contrast the $32 average individual recovery as well with the average $1 million that plaintiff lawyers make per settled case.  Madam Speaker, consider also the fact that 87 percent of class actions generate no benefits for consumers whatsoever because they are dismissed by the Court or settled with the named plaintiff only.  In addition to the direct harm the CFPB's antiarbitration rule will cause to consumers, it will also have negative effects on a variety of companies and firms that will have to prepare themselves for falling victim to costly litigation. In light of that, they will be unlikely to direct any financial resources toward providing their customers even the option for arbitration.  In addition, many firms are unavailable to survive such costly litigation, meaning they will either go out of business or be forced to stop offering certain products and services.  How will this benefit consumers?  It won't. It will make their purchases costlier and the products and services they need more difficult to find.  If you want to help ensure consumer recoveries and justice--and we all do--depriving them of the most efficient and most remunerative option is not the answer. Sadly, that is precisely what will result from the CFPB's misguided, anticonsumer rule.  The CFPB's antiarbitration rule will close the door to recovery for consumers, but open the door for million-dollar trial attorney's fees. The underlying legislation considered today will reopen the door to consumer recovery.  ",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgH6225-6.txt,2158,1230,2017.0,25.0,June

12985,topic-id,2088,"Mr.President, first, the Senate's thoughts and prayers go out to everyone in Manchester, Such violence is particularly heartbreaking when it happens, as it did in Manchester, at a concert with so many young people there to enjoy.  We mourn the families of the victims of last night's terrorist attack. We hope the perpetrators are quickly found and brought to justice. I saw on TV a mother waiting, trying to email and text her daughter. She got no answer. She was wondering where her daughter was. It brought back the horrible memories for me after 9/11, the day after, when I went up there and saw hundreds of people holding up signs: ``Have you seen my wife Evelyn?'' ``Have you seen my son John,'' not knowing if they were alive or dead. Most of them ended up being dead.  We hope and pray that mother, and all the other mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters who are waiting for news that maybe their child, their relative, is alive, will find them alive. Our prayers go out to them.                          Russia Investigation  Mr.President, now, on another matter completely, last night, it was reported in the Washington Post that President Trump attempted to enlist the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, and the Director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Rogers, in helping the administration push back against reports in the press about an investigation into the President's campaign and its potential ties to  According to the same reporting, White House staff may also have ``sounded out top intelligence officials about the possibility of intervening directly'' with the FBI and Mr.Comey to get them to drop the investigation into General  If these reports are accurate, it is another piece of now-mounting evidence that this White House has no interest--no interest--in allowing the Russia investigation to proceed without partisan interference, and the White House seems to have little respect for the principles of the rule of law. We have not quite seen anything like it in a very long time.  Such allegations only reinforce the correctness of the decision to appoint Special Counsel Mueller to oversee the investigation and should strengthen our resolve to ensure that he is insulated from interference from this White Such allegations also strengthen, again, the need for an independent, nonpartisan FBI  With all these reports of attempts to interfere with the investigation, we cannot have an FBI Director who has a political background, who doesn't seem right down the middle, who doesn't[[Page S3077]]seem to be a Director's Director, a prosecutor's prosecutor, an investigator's investigator. No politician or candidate with insufficient impartiality should be selected by the President or confirmed by the We Democrats will stand very strongly for that.  Given the almost daily reports about potential meddling and misconduct by this administration, Congress must exercise its oversight authority in order to keep this administration in check. Both the executive branch and the congressional investigations must proceed. This is not about politics or political advantage. When a foreign power, particularly an enemy of our country like Putin and Russia, tries to interfere in your elections--and will probably do it again in the future--we have to know everything that happened, who participated, and make sure it doesn't happen again.  If people who participated in it--if there are such people--get away with it this time, many more will do it next time. So this is an issue of national interest, national security, and even the future of our democracy. I remind colleagues that in our Constitution, the Founding Fathers worried about foreign interference in our government. When I read that in high school and again in college, I said: Well, that doesn't seem real. It is all too real today, showing both the wisdom of the Founding Fathers and the need for strong oversight.                         The President's Budget  Mr.President, now, on the budget, today, the President will release his full budget for fiscal year 2018. From all indications, the Trump budget will seek deep cuts to programs that help the middle class and working America while providing more handouts to the rich. It will cut to the bone programs that help the elderly, the poor, while adding money for an unnecessary, ineffective border wall that continues to have bipartisan opposition.  To make all the math work, the Trump budget makes entirely unfounded assumptions about economic growth. In short, the Trump budget takes a sledgehammer to the middle class and the working poor, lavishes tax breaks on the wealthy, and imagines all of the deficit problems away with fantasy math. The Trump budget exists somewhere over the rainbow, where the dreams of Nick Mulvaney, Paul Ryan, and the Koch brothers really do come true.  Of course, these dreams are a nightmare for the average working We expect the Trump budget will make deep cuts to the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Let me ask, How many people in America want to cut cancer research when it has done such good? Well, President Trump evidently does. It is his budget.  They kneecap research that develops new cures, damaging our ability to contain or prevent the outbreak of disease. We are all living longer and healthier, in part because of this research. We want to stop it, cut it back, so we can give tax breaks to wealthy people who, God bless them, are doing great already?  We expect the Trump budget will gash programs like Meals on I even read in the paper this morning that the head of the Freedom Caucus said that even for him some of these cuts were too great. The SNAP benefits, making sure no kid goes to bed hungry in America--this is We have always done this. The Children's Health Insurance Program, cruelly ripping away the lifelines from Americans who need it the most, the children, the working poor, the elderly.  We expect the Trump budget will cut transportation funding, education funding, and programs that help students repay their student loan debt. One of the great problems in America, the debt on the backs--the burden on average kids getting out of college, middle-class kids, we are going to make it harder? What is going on here? What is going on in the White House with this kind of budget?  Our college kids, when they get out, they need to be able to live real good lives and not have this burden of debt on their shoulders which they are struggling under now. We are going to make it worse. We also--it is amazing but true. The Trump budget will break President Trump's promise to protect Social Security and Medicaid from cuts, both of these. He promised over and over again he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicare was not cut here, but Medicaid is and Social Security is. On Social Security, the budget will cut Social Security disability benefits to many Americans who have earned them and paid for those benefits. You can say: Well, it doesn't cut old-age benefits for the elderly. If they get away with this, the elderly will be next on the chopping block because the goal, it seems, of this budget is to cut everything you can so you can give even more tax breaks to the wealthiest people--the Koch brothers type of thinking.  It will also seek hundreds of billions of dollars--additional cuts--in The budget cuts Medicaid on top of the cuts that were made in the House bill for What will that do? Medicaid has become a middle-class program. For sixty percent of the people in nursing homes, Medicaid funds it.  What are we going to tell a couple with three kids? Say, they are 40 or 45. They have three kids. They are saving for college, they are struggling, but at least they know that mom or dad, who needs help, is in a nursing home. If this budget passes, that family is going to have a terrible choice: Take hundreds of dollars a month out of their own budget and give it to pay for the nursing home or find a place for mom and dad to live, maybe at home. Maybe there is no room in the house. It is awful. That is what they are doing.  What else will it hurt? Opioid addiction. Much of the progress we are trying to make on opioid addiction comes through Medicaid because they give treatment. We need law enforcement--I am a tough law enforcement guy; you know that--but we also need treatment. I have had fathers cry in my arms because their sons--in this case, it was both sons--were waiting online for treatment and died of an overdose. What a burden a parent has to live with. We should cut that and cut it to give more tax breaks to the rich? It is an America turned upside down--this budget.  How about rural areas? I represent New York It is known for its big city, New York We have other great cities upstate, but we also have the third largest rural population in So I am very familiar with rural In many of my counties in upstate New York--and this is true in rural counties throughout America--the largest employer is the rural hospital. That hospital is the only hospital around for miles and miles and miles if, God forbid, you have a stroke and you have to be rushed there to get better.  Well, go talk to our rural hospitals. These rural hospitals are the beating heart of our local economy, employing hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of people. Well, nearly one in three rural hospitals today is at risk of closure. It is more expensive to run a rural hospital. People in rural areas are entitled to the same healthcare, so that means buying all these fancy machines. In an urban area, those machines can run 24/7 and get the reimbursement back, but in a rural area they can't. There are not that many people, but they get some help.  The Trump cuts to Medicaid would cause a whole bunch of these rural hospitals to close and many more to lay off employees, hurting healthcare in rural America, and hurting jobs in rural America--places that need help.  The Trump budget on top of TrumpCare, which seeks more than $800 billion in cuts to Medicaid, would decimate healthcare options for rural Americans and pull the plug on many of these rural hospitals. Some of my colleagues will be talking more about that this morning.  When you add all of it up, the Trump budget is comic-book-villain bad. Just like comic books, it relies on a fantasy to make all the numbers work. It is the kind of budget you might expect from someone who is openly rooting for a government shutdown. Haven't we heard the President say that? It is the latest example of the President breaking his promises to working This budget breaks promise after promise after promise that the President made to what he called the forgotten America, the working men and women of He said that he would help them, and this budget goes directly against them.  In his speech to Congress, for instance, earlier this year the President[[Page S3078]]called education ``the civil rights issue of our time,'' but his budget guts vital school programs, our future, our kids. He said: ``Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope,'' but his budget slashes funding at the NIH and CDC where they do this research. And he said: ``Save Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it,'' but his budget cuts Social Security disability insurance and ends Medicaid as we know it.  The Trump budget is one giant, brazen, broken promise to the working men and women of It completely abandons them. Fundamentally, this is a deeply unserious proposal that should roundly be rejected by both parties here in I am optimistic that is what will happen.  We should follow the same blueprint we did in the 2017 budget: Both Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, in a bipartisan way, everyone compromised. We should get together, negotiate a serious proposal that maintains our commitments to the middle class and actually sets up our economy to grow.  We cannot let the President turn America inside out with his budget. We have to stand together, Democrats and Republicans, and reject it for the sake of middle-class and working The Trump budget hopefully will not see the light of day.  I yield the floor.

I want to thank the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr.Walden from Hood River, Oregon, as well as the Health Subcommittee chairman, Michael Burgess from Lewisville, I appreciate Burgess for yielding me time on this bill that is mine, that I presented several years ago, Mr.Speaker, that we are finally getting a chance to support today.  I wish to express my full support for H.1492, the Medical Controlled Substances Transportation Act of 2017. This legislation represents commonsense reforms that will ensure certainty and regulatory clarity, while recognizing the needs of doctors, patients, and law enforcement alike. I hope Members on both sides recognize the need for not only this legislation, but will be in support.  Currently, physicians and other DEA-licensed medical practitioners are barred from transporting controlled substances from one practice setting to another. This is particularly strenuous on physicians who travel for their jobs. For example, team physicians at both the college and professional level have been particularly affected by the lack of clarity in the current law.  Physicians who travel with teams to away games carefully practiced transporting medicines--and they have done so for decades--in a manner that they believed to be in compliance with DEA regulations. Recently, however, there has been uncertainty surrounding this issue, as a number of teams have found themselves being challenged by the Drug Enforcement  Those physicians who had, for years, been in compliance, or felt like they were in compliance, were unable to provide players with proper medical care after many injuries while they were at an away game.  H.1492 will allow physicians to obtain a separate mobile registration with the DEA for the ability to transport these very specific substances for medically relevant reasons directly related to the care of patients between practice settings. This registration allows for physician transport, up to 72 hours, while maintaining updated records of transport and the administration of these controlled substances. Such allowances would ensure that physicians whose practices are inherently dynamic have the necessary provisions to provide care to their patients regardless of the setting.  I would like to thank the Drug Enforcement Administration for working with me and my office for the last 5 years on this important issue.

Journalists and citizens risk their lives every day to report what is happening inside Caracas and around the country. We see that tensions are growing, and government security forces shoot first and don't even bother to ask questions later.  Maduro continues to keep political prisoners like Leopoldo Lopez under lock and key to send a strong message to those trying to question his actions. Just yesterday, we saw reports that government buildings in western Venezuela are being set ablaze. Make no mistake: It is the failed Chavismo policies and the authoritarian actions of Nicolas Maduro that have brought all of this pain and suffering upon the Venezuelan people.  Press reports show that of 800,000 businesses that opened during the Chavez regime, nearly 600,000 have shut down. Both the Obama and Trump administrations have sanctioned senior officials in the Venezuelan Government for their associations with narcotrafficking, money laundering, and other illicit activities.  Just today, Reuters released an exclusive report that the Venezuelan Government is in possession of 5,000 shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles that are typically used to shoot down low-flying planes and helicopters.  Last week, Spanish authorities interdicted a shipment of 6 tons of cocaine from Venezuela en route to their shores. With the recent sanctions of Vice President Tareck El Aissami, under the Kingpin Act, it has become clear that Venezuela's Government is[[Page H4499]]acting as a narco-state and facilitating the shipment of narcotics throughout the region. These sanctions are not against the Venezuelan people but are carefully crafted and targeted towards the individuals who are committed to destroying the lives of millions of innocent civilians in exchange for money and power.  Last week, the U.Department of the Treasury sanctioned members of Venezuela's Supreme Court for their rulings that stripped power away from the National Assembly, further consolidating Maduro's authoritarian regime. Maduro and his cronies continue to get rich as they traffic money and drugs while doing nothing to help the millions of suffering people in They continue to loot the country as reports regarding the worsening situation continue to make front-page news throughout the region. Maduro's tactics are making it impossible to survive.  Multiple news reports confirm a growing health crisis as people lack access to basic medicines, and infant mortality rates and preventable diseases such as diptheria, malaria, and the Zika virus are all on the rise. In addition, nearly every day we hear of young children whose lives are cut short, whether it is from a bullet from Maduro's thugs or the lack of access to food, water, and basic services.  That is why I am grateful for the efforts of my colleagues here tonight who have supported several initiatives in Congress that work to hold these thugs accountable. My colleagues and I have held hearings, sent letters, and met with our allies in the region to work together to try to bring sound relief to the Venezuelan people.  Meanwhile, instead of focusing on the economy, Maduro is staging mock military exercises and stoking fears by spreading propaganda of U.S.-led invasion.  The truth about Maduro is clear, and the international community is starting to unify against him. The OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro has wisely called for Venezuela's suspension from the OAS unless it frees its political prisoners, accepts humanitarian aid, and holds elections without delay.  I believe we need to work together with our allies around the world and continue to insist Maduro abide by international norms and give the Venezuelan people the freedom they deserve.  I thank my dear friend from Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and the other Members here tonight for their relentless commitment to these important issues.

On January 27 of this year, we saw President Trump sign his executive order, quite expeditiously, on a travel ban that specifically targeted the Muslim community, with seven countries, where 90-plus percent of the population practice  It was an interesting moment for me. My wife and I were having dinner with a few friends of ours in the district, and one of them had asked me: Well, how is this ban going to affect you? How is it going to affect your district?  At the moment, I wasn't really sure, but then I got a call only a few minutes later by my district director. Our first constituent was identified as coming back on a United Arab Emirates flight back from Iraq and was scheduled to land the next morning: a girl who had graduated from the University of Central Florida and lived a very productive life as a legal resident in central Florida for the last 6 years after her graduation.  So we went the next day--early the next morning because, if anything, my legislative experience in the State legislature has told me: go to where the action is, go to where the controversy is, and do what you can to help.  First, we went to Customs and Border Protection, and we got no response. We actually got surprise responses of what were we even doing there, because this was not a matter they were prepared to handle.  So we went to the airport and were greeted by Greater Orlando Aviation Authority officials who were very helpful and understood that these were central Floridians who had been flying for 20 hours and were just about to arrive back into Florida, where they lived.  That morning, I also met a young man who was a citizen from an area just north of the district, who was waiting for his two parents to come in on the same Emirates flight. We found out that the constituent and the two parents were three people who were held back and questioned.  Throughout the day, we would get updates, but what we found out is there was very little information because there was very little understanding by Customs and Border Protection about how to implement this very vague order. The court had just ruled that it was potentially unconstitutional.  So working with our local officials after hours of building up, hours of waiting with the families, hours of press starting to arrive, hours of TV coverage, and hours of protest, right when we were in the middle of doing interviews, that is when the families were finally released, after 7 hours of being questioned without water, without food, after a 20-hour flight.  You could not have scripted this to make the point of how misguided this ban was than what happened. Right in front of TV cameras from across central Florida, first, the two parents came down--parents of a citizen who hadn't seen his parents in over 5 years.  The scene was traumatic: crying, hugs, and welcomed by cameras wondering what had happened to these two individuals. These were simply two citizens of Iraq trying to come over to visit their son, who had already been given visas to come on over.  A few minutes later, our constituent finally arrived as well. She also had been held for 8 hours without water, without food, after a 20-hour flight, and a barrage of questions.  After that, we saw public opinion change sharply in central Florida as people saw these were the alleged people that were getting extreme vetting: people who were visiting their son in central Florida, longtime residents, who only had productive lives in central  A few weeks later, we had the deportation force memo come down. I was shocked. We sent out letters to our sheriffs, we sent out letters to our schools, asking if they were planning on participating in this deportation force that President Trump had called upon to help implement and enforce our immigration laws.  We called immediately a round table, where we invited immigrant groups, we invited law enforcement groups, and so many others to talk about the issues that were happening.  Two of my three sheriffs immediately said they weren't planning on participating, that this was a Federal issue. A third ended up going from fully participating to, a day later, walking back that position, to just picking up folks who had been accused of violent felonies.  Then our schools responded very quickly after they were posed with a scenario--a situation that was going down the very same day: a citizen, a young woman of Mexican descent, whose parents were also legal immigrants, was asked in front of their classmates about her status.  Afterwards, there were a lot of finger-pointing and excuses that these were questions that were being levied to determine whether she needed to participate in the ESEA program. But at that moment, it was just more of this anti-immigrant rhetoric that was coming out of so many areas in central  But like that incident, which was covered at length, minds and hearts changed in central There was an apology given to this young woman who was a citizen, and they changed the policy so that no one would be asked about immigration status in front of their peers, even if it was for something as harmless as the ESEA program.  With our sheriffs clarifying their policies to not join this DHS call for deportation force, we were proud once again to have an inclusive society in central Florida where we welcome everybody. We are such an international community, home to the best theme parks in the world, a world-class convention center and hotels, and we welcome everybody from across the globe.  Then, in addition, I just received a letter from a constituent. Her daughter had grown up, gotten a job, fallen in love, and had a bright future ahead of her. But she worried because her daughter's boyfriend potentially could be deported because he is on an H-1 visa.  These types of policies breaking up families don't serve any interest in helping people pursue the American Dream and don't serve any interest in protecting our economy and protecting growth in central Florida, where we have such a large cattle industry and where we have such a large citrus industry.  Finally, we have so many DREAMers, young students, who live in central Florida, who are working and striving, rising up in our society, and helping people along the way, immigrants who potentially could be one of 40 percent of creators of Fortune 500 companies that have been created here in America, one of the 65,000 servicemen and -women who are immigrants, who serve in our United States military. And we find that, with every 100 immigrants, we are creating 120 new jobs because our country has been founded and created on growth and equality.                              {time}  1745  So I would like to see a few things happen, things that I believe Democrats and Republicans can agree on. First, let's make sure to ratify the DREAMer program, the Deferred Action program. You have bipartisan cosponsorship for this bill. This is something we could get done, especially for[[Page H4693]]our veterans and those serving in our U.military.  In addition, I believe that we need to relook at the H-1 visa program, the farmworker program. We need to acknowledge the reality that we have had for the last 150 years of agriculture here in the United States, which is that we rely on many of our immigrants coming from Mexico and Central and South America to help with our agriculture. This has been going on for over a century.  What we can do is simply go from a 1-year to maybe a 3-year or 5-year program. I know our immigrants' rights community would support it. I know our agriculture communities would support it; and we wouldn't have people unwittingly not getting back to their country of origin after the 1-year visa expires, when they just want to go back and come back again to help out as seasonal labor.  Then thirdly, there is an arbitrary cap on highly skilled workers here in this country. We train them in Ivy League schools, in brilliant schools in Texas, California, Florida, and across this And then, because of an arbitrary cap that no one wants to change because of the hot-button issue of immigration, then we send them on their way, back to their countries of origin, rather than keep them here and harness their talent for the future of our economy.  Canada has even got word of this and welcomes these folks. When they realize their visas are up, they beg them to come to Canada to help start new businesses.  So these are some of the ideas that we can fix, that we could all agree on, that both parties can agree on. And of course, in the end, we need a comprehensive immigration reform. But, in the meantime, let's get some things done that we all agree on and move our country forward.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii, one of the most beautiful States of the Union, for her leadership.

12902,topic-id,702,"Mr.Chairman, my constituents are discouraged. They are fed up with political elites who have failed to represent them, and with special interest groups who, too often, put impractical dogma before practical policy.  In the Rust Belt region I represent in upstate New York, the impact of this has been devastating: devastating job losses, economic stagnation, and the massive out-migration of people and jobs, the largest in the  In my district, Mr.Chairman, decline has bred despair, which has spurred a host of other problems. In light of all this, I was elected to Congress with a strong mission to reverse the tide and to revitalize our upstate communities to the greatness and innovation they once experienced.  I am the voice for my constituents who have been left behind, and I am fighting to bring my district back on path toward individual prosperity and economic revival.  Mr.Chairman, my amendment uniquely achieves both. There is nothing new or groundbreaking about my amendment. Simply put, it reinstates a domestic sourcing provision for stainless steel flatware that was in law for 30 years without issue. My amendment adds stainless steel flatware back into the Berry amendment.  For 30 years, American-made flatware was covered under However, the provision was removed in 2006 after Oneida Limited, the only Berry-compliant manufacturer, ceased domestic operations.  In the void left by Oneida's departure came Sherrill Manufacturing, a company in my district that, since 2008, has produced 100 percent American-made flatware. And since 2008, Sherrill has been among the top providers of flatware to the Department of Defense and GSA, fulfilling more than $6.8 million in Federal contracts over an 8-year period.  All these products are being produced in the formerly closed factory using refurbished Oneida Limited equipment, and also providing jobs for many of the same employees who lost their jobs from Oneida's closure after decades of service to that same closed factory. In fact, GSA has repeatedly found Sherrill's flatware to be offered at fair and reasonable prices, which is why the agency already purchases flatware from Sherrill, independent of any domestic sourcing requirement.  Some domestic sourcing requirements may raise costs. No evidence has been submitted to support the claim that my amendment will do that. This alone should allay any concerns that taxpayers would be on the hook for overly expensive flatware, should my amendment be adopted. But if it isn't enough, then there is this:  My amendment retains all existing waivers under Berry, which means that, if Sherrill's flatware becomes too expensive or is of poor quality or insufficient quality, the DOD can find other sources.  Ultimately, Mr.Chairman, whenever we can create domestic sourcing opportunities that reduce our military's dependence on imported goods and strengthen domestic supply chains without significantly raising procurement costs, we should. And this is what my amendment does.  Reinstating the Berry amendment's domestic sourcing requirement represents a clear continuity in Federal procurement policy, not a stark divergence. As I said, this provision was in effect for 30 years.  Thus far, there is one Berry-compliant manufacturer that happens to be in my district and there should not be a problem with that, as we hope many more producers return to the United States, where their businesses were founded to provide robust competition.  I also support this amendment for the simple reason that it is good policy. It gives a leg up to a robust domestic supply chain that spans five States while reducing our military's logistical dependence on imports.  Moreover, for the 30-year history of the Berry amendment's flatware provision, there was only ever one domestic producer. Under the Berry amendment, this is all that is required. And in Sherrill's case, we know it is a producer that has a track record of offering flatware at market rates.  Mr.Chairman, in districts like mine across the country that have rusted-out factories that line the landscapes of far too many of my communities, today we have an opportunity to fix this problem and restore the once great Empire State and our Nation to the manufacturing strength it once enjoyed. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure.  Mr.Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.Lipinski), my colleague, for some comments.

12898,topic-id,806,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Chairman, I fully agree with the gentleman from Washington when he expresses his appreciation to the members of our committee. Each one of the 62 members of our committee has contributed to the bill that is here before us today and, as the Chair knows, we have had more amendments considered over the last 3 days than ever before for a National Defense Authorization bill. So Members of the whole body have contributed in many ways.[[Page H5860]]  I also agree with the gentleman that our staff on both sides of the aisle, led by Jenness Simler and Paul Arcangeli, have done a terrific job in helping to manage this process and to shape and guide what has been historic levels of interest by Members on particular provisions.  Mr.Chairman, I think that you would find among our committee virtually, if not unanimous, agreement on two points. One is we live in an increasingly dangerous world. The second one is we have done deep damage to our military because of the budgets cuts, the continuing resolutions, the erratic nature of funding over the last few years.  Certainly, the members of our committee who go out and actually talk to the people who serve have heard, seen, witnessed firsthand airplanes that can't fly, ships that can't sail, training that has not gone on, movers--we are trying to save money for the military, so we are hiring cut-rate movers, and members of the military are experiencing incredible damage to their household goods as they are shuffled about from place to place involuntarily. Sometimes there are movers with criminal records who can't actually get on the military base they are supposed to be delivering to. I mean, just example after example of how these cuts have affected the men and women who serve.  And as Secretary Mattis says, the only reason we are doing so well around the world is because they have sucked it up and borne the burden. Deep damage that this bill starts to reverse.  I appreciate all the Members who support fixing our planes, getting the training, having ships that sail, better missile defense, all the things that are in this bill.  I am not going to engage in a detailed discussion about the budget. The gentleman and I discuss this frequently.  I would just say, Mr.Chairman, I believe the first obligation of the Federal Government is to defend the country. Article I, section 8 says that Congress has the power and the responsibility to raise and support armies, provide and maintain navies, provide the rules and regulations for the military forces of the United That is our job, and I think that is our first job.  So I agree that some of the cuts that have been proposed in other domestic programs, discretionary programs, are inappropriate, and we ought to evaluate each of them on their merits. And that continues to be my point when it comes to defense.  We evaluate our obligations to the country and to the men and women who serve, based on the merits of this argument. We don't tie it to other domestic programs. We do not say we are only going to increase defense to fix our planes if we can increase the EPA an equal amount. We don't tie it to other things.  The obligations to the men and women who risk their lives stand on their own, and that, at least in my view, is our first obligation.  Now, when we start talking about budgets, we get into all sorts of conversations about how mandatory spending is really where more than two-thirds of the budget is; how that is what has been growing; how defense is down to about 16 percent of the budget, and as it has been shrinking, the deficit has been going up. Obviously, defense is not the cause when it comes to deficits.  We can also, when we talk about tax, start talking about economic growth and this lackluster growth that the economy has suffered, at least over the last 8 years, and the need to get things going to help with the deficit.  Lots of issues to discuss, but the issue before us today is how we fulfill our responsibilities to the men and women who serve and to the country that is relying on us to protect them from missiles, to help protect them from terrorist attacks, to support the men and women who are actually performing those missions.  I think this bill advances that cause. A number of Members on both sides of the aisle have contributed to it. I think and hope it deserves the support of most all Members of the House, and I urge support for this en bloc package.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

12906,topic-id,470,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I have tremendous respect and admiration for the gentlewoman from New York and her efforts to represent her district, her people, and try to make life better. It kind of relates to some of the conversations Mr.Smith and I were just having about tax policy, about industrial policy, about regulations, about how we have, in this country, become less competitive internationally than we should.  However, I must oppose this amendment because the bottom line is that it is not a matter of national security where the DOD buys its knives, forks, and spoons.                              {time}  1030  If Members needed further evidence of the wide range of issues which we deal with in the National Defense Authorization Act, this bill is a key example.  I think the gentlewoman accurately described the history. The Berry amendment was passed in 1940 to make sure that food and textiles were procured from the United States to support our military efforts.  In the 1970s, they put in a specialty metals provision, and attached to that was a comma that said ``including flatware.'' So then it turned out there wasn't anybody here at home that made flatware because of these international competitive issues, and DOD came to us more than a decade ago and said, ``Would you please get rid of that portion of the Berry amendment?'' and we did.  Now the question is: Are we going to start adding back specific sorts of items which DOD may buy and say you can only buy it from one place, whether or not it is critical to our country's national security?  Now, the gentlewoman mentioned that GSA is buying some spoons and knives and so forth from this manufacturer, and that is great. If we do, I hope that happens, and I hope more jobs come to her district. But to put into Federal law that the only place the Department of Defense can buy its knives and forks and spoons is from this one company, I think, starts to get us into micromanagement of industries and takes us away from the focus of this bill, which should be the troops, what is the best thing for them.  So with all my admiration for the gentlewoman, I oppose this amendment. We cannot go down the road of adding category after category after category of items to help our districts at the expense of our troops and the best use of dollars when it is not a matter of vital national security. I just don't think that the knives and forks we use qualify as vital national security.  Mr.Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.

12908,topic-id,714,"Mr.Speaker, this is a procedural motion that, in my view, should be rejected.  We could spend all day and night arguing provisions that prohibit what is not in the bill. There is nothing in this bill that authorizes a border wall. The focus of the bill is the men and women who serve our Nation in the military and the national security of the United And that is what I want to take a moment to talk about.  I would suggest that all of us think back just to the events of the last 10 days. On July 4, North Korea launched what most observers believe is an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching parts of the United And we know they already have nuclear weapons.  On July 9, Iraqi Prime Minister al-Abadi went into Mosul to celebrate the ousting of ISIS with U.advisers, U.airpower, and U.intelligence.  Also, this week, the Chinese navy conducted drills in the Mediterranean on their way to conduct joint exercises with the Russians in the  This is just a taste of the world we live in, and there are provisions in this bill that address every one of these incidents, from more missile defense to getting more ships in the water faster and cheaper, to supporting our efforts against ISIS, al-Qaida, and terrorist groups.  But there is another event this week that I hope we all keep in mind. On Monday, July 10, a KC-130 crashed on its way across the country, resulting in the death of 15 marines and one sailor. We do not know what caused this crash, but the early evidence indicates that there was a catastrophic failure when it was cruising at altitude.  It will be fully investigated. But in the meantime, I think we always have to remember that, even on routine training missions, even on routine deployments, the men and women who serve are risking their lives for us. We owe them the best equipment, in the best shape, with the best training that our Nation can provide. Unfortunately, that is not what they have been getting.  This year, our committee has heard testimony that, under the budget caps, the Army is outranged, outgunned, and outdated. More than half the Navy aircraft cannot fly. More than half the planes in the Air Force qualify for an antique license in the State of More than half the planes the Navy has can't fly. Unfortunately, accident rates are going up.  Sometimes I have heard the argument that: Well, we are not going to give them any more money until they can pass an audit or they can do this and that or the other thing.  But as everybody rushes out to get on their airplanes, just think about this: What if the board of directors of your airline decided that they are not going to spend any more money repairing planes until there is a bookkeeping problem solved in headquarters?  Yet that is exactly what we have been doing to our military. We have not been giving them the planes and other equipment in good repair.  Every year for 55 straight years, Congresses and Presidents of both parties have passed into law a National Defense Authorization There is a lot of credit to go around, including the Members on both sides of this aisle who have contributed to this product. I am very grateful for what they have done. But what I am really grateful for are the men and women who serve and inspire us, the men and women who are counting on us.  Mr.Speaker, I would just say, whatever our differences on other issues, which we will have time to debate in another time and place, whatever our differences about what is in or not in this bill, we need to put those differences aside and continue to support the men and women who serve and defend us.

12782,topic-id,1574,"Mr.Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.2742) to amend title IV of the Social Security Act to require States to adopt an electronic system to help expedite the placement of children in foster care or guardianship, or for adoption, across State lines, and to provide funding to aid States in developing such a system, and for other purposes.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:                               H.2742       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Modernizing the Interstate      Placement of Children in Foster Care Act''.     2.       The Congress finds that--       (1) when a child in foster care cannot return safely home,      the child deserves to be placed in a setting that is best for      that child, regardless of whether it is in the child's State      or another State;       (2) the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children      (ICPC) was established in 1960 to provide a uniform legal      framework for the placement of children across State lines in      foster and adoptive homes;       (3) frequently, children waiting to be placed with an      adoptive family, relative, or foster parent in another State      spend more time waiting for this to occur than children who      are placed with an adoptive, family, relative, or foster      parent in the same State, because of the outdated,      administratively burdensome ICPC process;       (4) no child should have to wait longer to be placed in a      loving home simply because the child must cross a State line;       (5) the National Electronic Interstate Compact Enterprise      (NEICE) was launched in August 2014 in Indiana, Nevada,      Florida, South Carolina, Wisconsin, and the District of      Columbia, has since expanded into Illinois, Virginia, Rhode      Island, California, Alaska, Nebraska, and Georgia, and is      expected to be expanded into additional States to improve the      administrative process by which children are placed with      families across State lines;       (6) States using this electronic interstate case-processing      system have reduced administrative costs and the amount of      staff time required to process these cases, and caseworkers      can spend more time helping children instead of copying and      mailing paperwork between States;       (7) since NEICE was launched, placement time has decreased      by 30 percent for interstate foster care placements; and       (8) on average, States using this electronic interstate      case-processing system have been able to reduce from 24      business days to 13 business days the time it takes to      identify a family for a child and prepare the paperwork      required to start the ICPC process.     3. STATE PLAN       (a) In General.--Section 471(a)(25) of the Social Security      Act (42 U.S.671(a)(25)) is amended--       (1) by striking ``provide'' and insert ``provides''; and       (2) by inserting ``, which in the case of a State other      than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States      Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, not later than      October 1, 2027, shall include the use of an electronic      interstate case-processing system'' before the 1st semicolon.       (b) Exemption of Indian Tribes.--Section 479B(c) of such      Act (42 U.S.679c(c)) is amended by adding at the end the      following:       ``(4) Inapplicability of state plan requirement to have in      effect procedures providing for the use an electronic      interstate case-processing system.--The requirement in      section 471(a)(25) that a State plan provide that the State      shall have in effect procedures providing for the use of an      electronic interstate case-processing system shall not apply      to an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or tribal consortium      that elects to operate a program under this part.''.       (c) Effective Date.--       (1) In general.--The amendments made by subsection (a)      shall take effect on the 1st day of the 1st calendar quarter      beginning on or after the date of the enactment of this Act,      and shall apply to payments under part E of title IV of the      Social Security Act for calendar quarters beginning on or      after such date.       (2) Delay permitted if state legislation required.--If the      Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that State      legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) is      required in order for a State plan developed pursuant to part      E of title IV of the Social Security Act to meet the      additional requirement imposed by the amendments made by      subsection (a), the plan shall not be regarded as failing to      meet any of the additional requirements before the 1st day of      the 1st calendar quarter beginning after the first regular      session of the State legislature that begins after the date      of the enactment of this For purposes of the preceding      sentence, if the State has a 2-year legislative session, each      year of the session is deemed to be a separate regular      session of the State legislature.     4.

12784,topic-id,707,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.2742, Modernizing the Interstate Placement of Children in Foster Care Act, which I introduced along with the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.Danny Davis), my friend.  We know full well the importance of a stable home environment for a child's development and success later in life. Unfortunately, we don't live in an ideal world. We have seen too many instances when abuse, neglect, physical or mental illness, addiction, incarceration, or death necessitates removing a child from their home.  Right now, in my State of Indiana, there are more than 10,000 children in the foster care system than there were 18 months ago. This is due in large part to the opioid epidemic that has swept across our country. Our child welfare system is under unprecedented strain.  Yet, in spite of this great need for foster care and adoption, if a child needs to be placed in another State, caseworkers from both States must literally print and fill out hundreds of pages of paperwork and mail them back and forth. This cumbersome process takes months, and just one missing page can set it back even further. These are precious months that an at-risk child is stuck in limbo, waiting for the certainty of a more permanent home. It is time to bring this process into the 21st century.  Luckily, there is an effort underway already to do just that. In November 2013, five States, including my home State of Indiana, and the District of Columbia, launched the National Electronic Interstate Compact Enterprise, or This is a cloud-based electronic system that allows for the electronic exchange of data between It started as a pilot project, but the results have been crystal clear: placement wait times dropped by a month and a half, States spent less time and money on copying and mailing, and caseworkers saved valuable time.  NEICE is now effective in 16 States, including Mr.Davis' home State of Illinois, but we can't stop at 16. As it stands today, if a child in my district in South Bend, Indiana, needed to be placed with their grandparents just 11 miles away in Niles, Michigan, the two States would have to undertake that arduous paperwork process because Michigan is not a part of NEICE yet. All States need to be a part of this system in order to realize its full benefits.  That is where the bill before us comes in. H.2742 represents a very important investment in the future of at-risk youth.

Sharon Pierce is the president and CEO of The Villages of Indiana, the largest not-for-profit child and family services provider in my State and a supporter of H.2742: ``The NEICE system is going to be invaluable in helping both the public and private sector child welfare agencies reduce considerably the length of time[[Page H4966]]a child needs to wait for a forever family.''  This isn't just a good government bill, Mr.Sure, we are reducing costs and paperwork and we can attach all sorts of numbers and dollar figures to that, but the most important thing we are doing here is we are giving at-risk youth a more permanent home sooner. We are giving them hope sooner. We are giving them a chance to actually thrive sooner.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''  I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

12975,topic-id,266,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to take this time to highlight H.758, the GI Internship Program I am a cosponsor of this important legislation with my colleague from Illinois, Brad If implemented, this bill would expand the use of the existing post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to include internships as an option in place of a traditional degree program.  The GI Internship Program Act would allow veterans to gain practical skills and work experience to help ease[[Page H2992]]their transition back into the civilian workforce. Under current law, the post-9/11 GI Bill only allocates money to veterans for traditional postsecondary education in the classroom, but for many veterans this is a path not meant for them.  For example, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were over 300,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs at the end of 2016. This gap could be filled by the veterans who use their post-9/11 GI benefits as a stipend to support them while receiving on-the-job training as high-skilled technical workers.  Further, these jobs can be filled at no additional cost to the employer because the cost would be covered by the preexisting GI This bill would allow businesses all over the U.S., both large and small, to meet their employment needs and help our skilled veterans to enter the civilian workforce.  As long as employers comply with the program and intend to hire the veterans after the internship is over, the veterans will continue to receive funding. This bill is a win for American job growth and, most importantly, a win for our veterans.  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-01-pt1-PgH2991-5.txt,2115,GI INTERNSHIP PROGRAM,2017.0,1.0,July
