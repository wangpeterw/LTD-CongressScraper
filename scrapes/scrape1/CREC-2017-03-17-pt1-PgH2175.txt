                        LOSING MEDICAID COVERAGE

  (Mr. SABLAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, as this week and the week before have 
passed, I watched Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle debate 
the better parts of either the Affordable Care Act or its replacement, 
the American Health Care Act.
  For the people I represent, the people of the Northern Marianas and 
of the insular areas, none of this matters to us. None of those 
mandates, none of those subsidies ever applied to us. The one thing 
that did apply to us was Medicaid--not expansion, not the regular 
program, but the block grant for Medicaid--which has now just been 
completely taken out of the bill before us.
  There are 14,000 participants on Medicaid in the Northern Marianas. 
Over 10,000 are children and students. Come October 1, 2019, they will 
no longer have access to health care because they lose their Medicaid 
coverage.
