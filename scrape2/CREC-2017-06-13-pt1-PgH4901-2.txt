              AVON GROVE RED DEVILS WIN STATE CHAMPIONSHIP

  (Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Avon Grove 
Red Devils men's lacrosse team on their State championship victory.
  The Red Devils finished the season with a 23-2 record, beating 
Philadelphia area powerhouse Conestoga in the PIAA Class 3A title game 
with a thrilling 5-4 victory.
  Sophomore Zach Augustine was one of the heroes, scoring the game-
winning goal in double overtime, a moment that he described as 
``unbelievable.''
  This redeeming victory for them comes 3 years after a heartbreaking 
loss for the Red Devils in the 2014 State title game. Senior midfielder 
Doug Jones, a freshman on that 2014 team, said: ``I remember as a 
freshman saying to myself that I wanted to get back here. We knew we 
had one goal: to win this. It means the absolute world to us.''
  I applaud the commitment displayed by these young men, both to each 
other and to their community. Congratulations to the Avon Grove Red 
Devils team, the coaches, their families, and the faculty, staff, and 
students that made this championship so special.
