                   BLACK APRIL AND THE FALL OF SAIGON

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, April 30, marks 42 years 
since the fall of Saigon, commemorated as Black April in Vietnamese-
American communities across the United States.
  Along with Congresswoman Lofgren, Congressman Correa, and other 
colleagues, I introduced a resolution in remembrance of this event, 
recognizing the service of U.S. Armed Forces and South Vietnamese 
forces, and honoring the contributions and sacrifices of Vietnamese 
Americans.
  This community, started by refugees, has prospered and thrived, 
giving so much back to this country. They continue to fight tirelessly 
for the basic human rights of people in Vietnam. I will continue to be 
a voice for Vietnamese Americans in Congress and for the rights of the 
people of Vietnam.
