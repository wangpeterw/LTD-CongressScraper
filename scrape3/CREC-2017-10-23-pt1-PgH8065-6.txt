minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is United Nations Day. As we 
reflect on the value of global partnerships to solve problems, I want 
to recognize the 40th anniversary of the international global health 
organization known as PATH, Program for Appropriate Technology and 
Health.
  PATH is headquartered in Seattle, and since its founding, it has been 
an incredible force for good. It is a place that I had the opportunity 
to work at for many years in the 1990s.
  PATH works in more than 70 countries, improving health for 150 
million people each year. PATH has made a difference in countless 
lives, from stopping preventable deaths of mothers and children to 
keeping people safe from infectious disease outbreaks.
  PATH has also helped make Washington State a global center of 
development for lifesaving health equity, innovations, and solutions. 
In 2013 alone, this global health industry generated $5.8 billion in 
direct economic impact and employed more than 12,500 people.
  PATH collaborates with governments, the private sector, and NGOs to 
advance more than 100 health strategies and technologies. It has saved 
$14 million per year doing things like preventing undamaged vaccines 
from being discarded.
  Congratulations to PATH.
