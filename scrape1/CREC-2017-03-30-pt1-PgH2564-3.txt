                 RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FROZEN FOOD MONTH

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize March as National 
Frozen Food Month.
  In my district, growers count on our food processors to ensure that 
their agricultural products make it from farms to kitchen tables.
  Jobs in agriculture depend on the ability to transport our products 
to buyers across the country and around the world. In my district, 
there are over 6,000 jobs in the frozen food industry, ensuring that 
families across the U.S. can enjoy Washington's agricultural products.
  As a farmer and a former State director of agriculture, I understand 
how important frozen foods are to enable timely delivery and freshness, 
despite seasonal changes. Freezing reduces food waste and increases 
safety and affordability. Freezing also allows Americans to have access 
to the diverse array of food products they enjoy every day.
  Join me in celebrating National Frozen Food Month and all those who 
work to ensure that the U.S. has the safest, most reliable, and most 
affordable food supply in the world.
