   70TH ANNIVERSARY OF NATIONAL URBAN SECURITY TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY

  (Mr. DONOVAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the 70th 
anniversary of the National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, also 
known as NUSTL.
  Located in New York City, NUSTL has been a critical asset in 
protecting our homeland since 1947. It began as a lab to measure 
radioactive fallout. Now as part of the Department of Homeland 
Security's Science and Technology Directorate, it has been transformed 
into a one-of-a-kind testing and evaluation laboratory for the first 
responder community.
  I have had the opportunity to visit NUSTL and saw firsthand the 
impressive work being done on a daily basis. It is constantly 
developing and testing new tools that ensure the brave women and men on 
our front lines can protect our homeland, and it is critical they have 
the resources needed to continue their innovative work.
  I thank the dedicated women and men of NUSTL for their services. 
Congratulations on this important anniversary. I look forward to 
continuing to celebrate your remarkable accomplishments for years to 
come.
