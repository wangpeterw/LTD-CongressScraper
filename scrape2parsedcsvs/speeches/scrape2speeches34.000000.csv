1804,topic-id,250,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to support H.2825.  Mr.Speaker, first I want to thank my colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee for adopting my amendment to provide $45 million to reimburse local law enforcement at airports. There has been an increase in the tax at airports, including at my home airport of LAX, and this funding is vital to keeping our airports secure and our economy moving.  Both sides compromised to move this bill forward, and the programs in it are critical to the security of our ports, our borders, and our homeland. Going forward, we can do more to add more funding at the ports.  I represent America's port, the Port of Los Our ports are the Nation's largest border crossings, so we must invest in funding security at the ports.  The port security grants I proposed in my committee are crucial to the cyber and physical safety programs at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, and without increased funding, they have been forced to stop several innovative and important projects. I will continue to fight for increased port security funding. I am determined to fill the staffing and funding gaps in maritime security and give our ports what they need to be safe and efficient.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this reauthorization, but we have more work to do.

1623,topic-id,144,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to shed light on the issue of fraud and abuse in the Medicare program.  Medicare is absolutely critical for seniors in my district and across the country. Not only is Medicare fraud an affront to hardworking taxpayers, it hurts the millions of seniors who rely on the program.  Last week, the HHS inspector general announced the largest healthcare fraud takedown in history: 412 defendants were charged nationwide, including more than 80 cases in Florida, for Medicare fraud totaling about $1.3 billion in losses. That is why I introduced much-needed legislation to strengthen penalties against those who commit fraud in the Medicare program.  The Medicare Civil and Criminal Penalties Update Act, H.3245, cracks down on Medicare fraud and abuse by increasing civil and criminal fines. We must ensure the Medicare program is strong and sustainable for today's and tomorrow's beneficiaries.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-18-pt1-PgH5925-2.txt,1838,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,18.0,July
1626,topic-id,461,"Mr.President, yesterday was Sunday, April 23.  In Connecticut, April 23 is a solemn day. It is the day when we pause to remember and reflect upon the lives lost and the lives forever altered by one of the worst workplace disasters in Connecticut history, the collapse of the L'Ambiance Plaza construction site in  On almost every April 23, I have stood with laborers, families, officials, and others at the L'Ambiance memorial park to recognize the heartbreaking loss. It is a somber, sobering moment.  On that day--30 years ago yesterday--workers were constructing a 16-story apartment building using a process known as the lift-slab method. This method allows floors to be built at the base of a building and then hoisted up, one by one, using hydraulic lifting technology. This process was at work at L'Ambiance Plaza when things went horribly wrong. Due to shortsightedness and failures by the building's developers, the massive concrete slabs that formed several upper floors gave way, crushing the floors below like pancakes, all within seconds.  Twenty-eight workers lost their lives. Nearly 2 dozen others were seriously injured. Those who survived the collapse demonstrated tremendous bravery and unity in the days afterward as a massive rescue and recovery operation ensued. The techniques deployed in that operation were later put to use at the World Trade Center on 9/11.  In the aftermath of the tragedy, the lift-slab method of construction used in Bridgeport ended nationwide, thankfully. Still, however, the pain and grief continues for the families who lost loved ones.  Today, in recognition of this grave anniversary and in memory of the victims, I enter into the Record their names: Michael Addona, Augustus Allman, Glenn Canning, Mario Colello, Francesco D'Addona, William Daddona, Donald Emanuel, Vincent Figliomeni, Herbert Goeldner, Jr., Terrance Gruber, John Hughes, Joseph Lowe, John Magnoli, Rocco Mancini, Richard McGill, Mario Musso, Nicholas Nardella, John Page, Guiseppe Paternostro, Angelantonio Perugini, John Puskar, Jr., Anthony Rinaldi, Albert Ritz, Michael Russillo, Reginald Siewert, William Varga, Frank Visconti, and Scott  We must honor their lives--and the lives of many other American workers killed or injured in the workplace--by ensuring that employees are able to work at facilities that are safe and secure, free from needless dangers and hazards. We can achieve that realistic goal through strong regulations, meaningful oversight, and effective enforcement.  On this day, I pledge to continue fighting for workers and workplace safety. I pledge to fight against efforts to roll back safety rules and against efforts to hamper agencies tasked with enforcing those rules.[[Page S2488]]  I strongly urge and challenge my colleagues and this administration to demonstrate their concern for their constituents and all American workers by publicly adopting this same pledge.  We owe nothing less to the 28 victims of the L'Ambiance Plaza disaster.

1824,topic-id,1479,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to join my colleagues. We can see there are numerous colleagues on this side of the aisle who are speaking, just as my colleague from Vermont just did with great passion or my colleague from Massachusetts did with great passion and as I am sure my colleague from Minnesota will. We have all been home for the weekend talking to our constituents. We are all back here now with the CBO news, and we are here because we are very concerned about the next steps the Senate might take in this healthcare debate.  When I was at home, I heard some unbelievably positive stories about healthcare. I was at a hospital in our State, Virginia Mason, which has been one of the leaders in reducing healthcare costs by utilizing new efficiencies. They have improved the return time of getting lab results to patients by 85 percent; they have increased productivity in some areas by 90 percent; they have reduced liability insurance premiums by 76 percent. They have innovated. They have innovated. They have innovated. They talked about the direction healthcare should go, and not once did they mention cutting or capping Medicaid as a solution.  I also talked to a community health center which, under the Affordable Care Act, was actually able to expand in a community. They literally cut in half the uninsured, and they are delivering great adult dental access to thousands of people in a county that didn't have good access to dental care. They are making great progress.  I talked to a veteran who served our country, who literally got out and is now going to school but without the help of Medicaid would not have been able to cover her healthcare expenses.  I met a woman on the street who told me her husband had lost his job. She never thought they would be on Medicaid, but when he lost his job, they went on Medicaid, and they depended on that to provide healthcare for themselves and their children.  I met a gentleman who also said he, too, lost his job, and after that came down with a serious, life-threatening illness, and it was only Medicaid that saved him.  So what do we know today that is different than last Friday? We now have some CBO numbers. We know the numbers. We know the numbers: that 22 more million Americans, as a result of this bill, if it is passed, would be uninsured; 15 million of them on Medicaid; and $772 billion in Medicaid cuts. We know we thought it was heartless. Now we see the numbers that say cutting that many people off of Medicaid is, in my opinion, as my colleagues have also said, not something we should be pursuing as a nation. It leaves us to ask about not just the impact of this on individuals, as I just mentioned--because I believe there is a much better way to go with innovation--but what it also does for the individual market. A lot of this debate started because people thought the individual market hadn't seen some of the benefits of the employer-sponsored system. Well, why not talk about the individual market?  If 7 percent of the way people access health insurance, the individual market, was having a problem, why not talk about ideas to improve the individual market? Instead, we have a bill from the House and the Senate that beats up on the Medicaid population as if they are the culprit. If you want to improve Medicaid and delivery services and help decrease costs, let's do that. There are so many innovative ideas, but just cutting people off Medicaid to solve the individual market problem doesn't even make sense to me.  We now have, as of last Friday, too, the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities' assessment, talking about how this would raise individual premiums in the individual market. They gave some examples. For example, in West Virginia and Nevada, a 60-year-old with an income of $36,000 would pay respectively, $5,000 and $4,000 more than what[[Page S3760]]they are paying now. In Alaska, a 60-year-old making $45,000 would pay $5,777 more than what they are paying now for premiums. So the notion that this bill is driving down costs is just a fallacy.  We have heard from Republican and Democratic Governors talking about this. They sent us a letter saying the first thing we should do is focus on improving our Nation's private health insurance system. Where did the Governors ask that you come and beat up on Medicaid? They didn't say that. They didn't say: Please beat up on Medicaid, have a big party covering people on Medicaid as a partner with us for 65 years and then leave us stuck with the bill. They didn't say that. They say:       Medicaid provisions included in this bill are problematic.      Instead, we recommend Congress address factors we can all      agree need fixing.  That is a pretty clear message, I believe, from Republican Governors who are saying this is not the way to fix healthcare.  Also, last week, a nonpartisan study by the George Washington University found that the House-passed bill would have a huge economic impact on our country. States' economies would shrink by $93 billion, compared to what they would be without the bill. Business output would be cut $148 billion. The study notes that the bill, combined with normal economic cycles ``could contribute to a period of economic and medical hardship in the U.S.''  That report also talks about job loss throughout the country, saying that individual states would see more than $1 billion in lost gross State product, just because of the number of people who wouldn't be covered, the number of healthcare providers who would no longer be there, the loss of healthcare infrastructure and then the impact on the healthcare system overall for uncompensated care. These are costs we can't afford.  As my colleague Senator Sanders mentioned, there are all these healthcare organizations that have now come out saying they don't support this Senate-drafted bill. The Academy of Family Physicians knows about caring for the Medicaid population. They are seeing so many patients, and they know what this challenge is. The American Psychological Association doesn't support this bill. Other healthcare associations, such as the Catholic Health Association, do not support this bill. I have a long list.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list of healthcare-related organizations and others that don't support this legislation.

1825,topic-id,400,"Mr.President, I hope my colleagues understand that there are those here who are very willing to talk about how we can improve our healthcare system, but we are not going to make poor Americans the scapegoat of our healthcare challenges.  A gentleman named Joe Baker, president of the Medicare Rights Center, I think, said it best. He said:       You or someone you love is going to need You may      not need the nursing home care . . . but you may rely on      community-based services, like home care, that will allow you      to stay in your home and out of a nursing facility. Medicaid      is the lifeline that covers many of the benefits that      Medicare does not provide.  Now why did I read that? Why did I pick a guy who is the head of a Medicare organization? Because he knows what his individual organization participants need in a healthcare delivery system. Everybody knows--everybody knows the people of America are living longer and as they age they need more healthcare. To our colleagues who want to reduce those costs, we are ready to come and talk about how we are going to reduce those costs.  I have talked about how I authored a community-based ``rebalancing'' program--the kind of rebalancing that helped our State save more than $2 billion. If we did that in every State, we would be saving billions of dollars, but the notion that we are going to proceed in the next 24 hours or so on a motion, after we have a CBO report that says this would have a devastating impact on millions of people with Medicaid, is not the right way to go.  Taking this out on the poor people of America who need Medicaid will make it worse for us as well. It will raise our rates, return the costs to where they were, and not help us solve this problem for the future. I hope our colleagues will understand that so many people are raising so many concerns about this. Yes, it is about economics, but there are also personal stories of people, such as our colleague from Hawaii who said: You never know. You never know when an individual situation is going to affect you, and you want to make sure there is healthcare to help you get through that crisis.  Thank you. I yield the floor.

1656,topic-id,1498,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce a resolution to mark World Refugee Day, and to address the ongoing displacement crisis across the globe. War, conflict and persecution have forced millions of people to leave their homes, creating more refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced people than at any other time in history. Today, there are more than 65 million displaced men, women, and children worldwide, the highest level ever recorded in history. To put this number into perspective--if the global displaced population were a country, it would be the 21st largest country, more populated than the United Kingdom.[[Page S3653]]  The global displacement trends we are witnessing now, due to conflict, severe human rights abuses, and climate change, are not going away. U.leadership in responding to these crises, whether it is the immense suffering of refugees from South Sudan or the plight of the internally-displaced in Syria and Iraq, is critical. How we respond--or whether we respond at all--will undoubtedly shape the landscape and the lives of future generations for years to come.  The United States has a long and proud history of providing safe harbor to the world's most vulnerable refugees--women and children, survivors of torture and other violence, and those with severe medical conditions. This included after World War II and after the fall of Saigon, when we resettled hundreds of thousands of refugees.  At the same time, we take the security of our citizens seriously. That is the reason the United States has the most rigorous refugee screening process in the world, involving the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and National Counter Terrorism The process includes biometric checks, medical screenings, forensic testing of documents, DNA testing for family reunification cases, and in-person interviews with highly trained homeland security officials.  The U.Refugee Resettlement program has been and should remain open to those of all nationalities and religions who face persecution. The Trump Administration's proposals that would have the U.State Department disqualify refugees from protection based on their nationality or religion fly in the face of the very principles this Nation was built upon. They also contradict the legacy of leadership our country has historically demonstrated, and dishonor our shared humanity.  It is clear, however, that the Trump Administration is determined to undermine longstanding American tradition and values, and in doing so they weaken our National security. As we all know, one of President Trump's first executive orders sought to drastically reduce the number of refugees entering the United States and turn away refugees from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and This un-American policy, rooted in fear not fact, cannot be tolerated. We collectively must reject the misplaced notion that some refugees are more deserving of protection than others.  Again and again, the Federal courts are signaling to the White House a real need for the President to immediately rescind his discriminatory executive order targeting Muslim refugees and travelers. Even while stayed by the courts, President Trump's executive orders have made America less safe, damaged our relationships with our allies, and harmed countless numbers of law-abiding citizens, travelers, and their families. America is a compassionate nation steeped with a history of welcoming immigrants and refugees.  I was proud to join Members of Congress who filed legal briefs in opposition to the President's discriminatory executive orders, along with HIAS in Silver Spring, Maryland, whose motto is to ``welcome the stranger'' and ``protect the refugee.'' Recently the U.Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit provided a valuable check and balance on the President's authority. The court correctly pointed out that the President's most recent Executive Order ``speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination'' which violates the Establishment Clause of the First No American president is above the law.  Turning away refugees--whether they are from Syria or Somalia, Burma or Iraq, whether they are Muslims or Christians, Hindus or Jews--means turning our backs on the international humanitarian system and the mechanisms of stability and security that are the bedrocks of international order. Refugees remain powerful ambassadors of the American Dream and our Nation's founding principles of equal opportunity, religious freedom, and liberty and justice for all.  The Trump Administration again revealed its determination to erode American leadership with the release of its Fiscal Year 2018 Budget request. Their FY18 budget represents a wholesale repudiation of U.global leadership on virtually every critical matter, including humanitarian assistance and protection of the most vulnerable populations. The President's budget called for a 44 percent cut in humanitarian assistance--a truly horrifying reduction made even more appalling given the level of global need. According to a group of leading NGOs, the human cost of these cuts could be staggering. The proposed 18 percent cut to the Migration and Refugee Assistance account could result in over 3.5 million refugees and internally displaced persons not receiving assistance globally, including about 1 million in the Middle East and 1.1 million in  The United States has been a beacon of hope for so many around the world for centuries, and it is imperative that we remain so for others in this century, and beyond. We need to be unified on this and the United States must lead by example. It is a universal human desire to live in peace and security and to create a better life for our families and loved ones. We must do our part to facilitate that. We need to keep our doors--and our hearts--open to those who so desperately need safe harbor.                              195       Whereas World Refugee Day is an opportunity to acknowledge      the courage, strength, and determination of women, men, and      children forced to flee their homes due to conflict,      violence, and persecution;       Whereas according to the United Nations High Commissioner      for Refugees (referred to in this Resolution as ``UNHCR'')--       (1) there are more than 65,600,000 displaced people      worldwide, the highest level ever recorded, including nearly      22,500,000 refugees, more than 40,300,000 internally      displaced people, and 2,800,000 people seeking asylum;       (2) children account for 51 percent of the global refugee      population, millions of whom are unable to access basic      services, including education;       (3) 10,300,000 people were newly displaced due to conflict      or persecution in 2016;       (4) more than 5,500,000 refugees have fled Syria since the      start of the conflict, and more than 6,300,000 people are      displaced inside Syria;       (5) since January 2014, more than 3,000,000 Iraqis fleeing      violence have been internally displaced, and 257,000 refugees      have fled to neighboring countries;       (6) South Sudan has the world's fastest-growing refugee      crisis, which is now the largest refugee crisis in Africa,      with more than 1,800,000 refugees, including 1,000,000      children;       (7) increasing violence in Guatemala, El Salvador, and      Honduras has led to a growing number of unaccompanied child      refugees, who are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence,      human trafficking, and kidnapping; and       (8) ongoing conflict, violence, and persecution have      resulted in the displacement of millions in Ukraine,      Colombia, and the Central African Republic;       Whereas 84 percent of the world's refugees are hosted in      developing regions, with more than 28 percent hosted in the      world's least developed countries;       Whereas refugees who are women and children are often at      greater risk of violence, human trafficking, exploitation,      and gender-based violence;       Whereas the United States resettlement program is a life-     saving solution critical to global humanitarian efforts,      which reflects American values, strengthens global security,      and alleviates the burden placed on front-line host      countries;       Whereas refugees are the most vetted travelers to enter the      United States and are subject to extensive screening checks,      including in person interviews, biometric data checks, and      multiple interagency checks;       Whereas refugees contribute to their communities by      starting businesses, paying taxes, and sharing their cultural      traditions; and       Whereas refugees contribute more than they consume in      state-funded services, including schooling and health care:       Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) reaffirms the bipartisan commitment of the United      States to promote the safety, health, and well-being of the      millions of refugees;       (2) recognizes those individuals who have risked their      lives working individually and for nongovernmental      organizations and international agencies, such as UNHCR, to      provide life-saving assistance and protection for people      displaced by conflict around the world;       (3) underscores the importance of the United States Refugee      Resettlement Program as a critical tool for United States      global leadership;       (4) calls upon the United States Government--       (A) to continue providing robust funding for refugee      protection overseas and resettlement in the United States;       (B) to uphold its international leadership role in      responding to displacement crises with humanitarian      assistance and protection of the most vulnerable populations;      and       (C) to alleviate the burden on refugee host countries      through humanitarian and development support while      maintaining the[[Page S3654]]     United States' long-standing tradition of resettling the most      vulnerable refugees regardless of their country of origin or      religious beliefs;       (5) reaffirms the goals of World Refugee Day; and       (6) reiterates the strong commitment of the United States      to seek to protect the millions of refugees who live without      material, social, or legal protections.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgS3652.txt,,CONTINUING RESOLUTION,2017.0,20.0,May

1668,topic-id,2322,"Mr.President, last night, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the investigation into Russia's alleged meddling in the election last fall and any related misconduct. Robert Mueller is perhaps the single-most qualified individual to lead such an investigation, in my view, and he is certainly independent.  As a former FBI Director--the longest serving FBI Director since Edgar Hoover--he, by any measure, has the experience and the credibility and the credentials to conduct a nonpartisan investigation and come to a conclusion based on the facts alone. We could use some conclusions based on facts here in Washington, with the relentless torrent of rumor, gossip, and suspicion but very few facts. It is clear to me that Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein felt this was in the best interests of the Department of Justice and the country, and I trust his judgment on the matter.  I do think there is a related concern now that a special counsel has been chosen; that is, the proliferation of hearings and contact with witnesses and the principals over this Russia matter that while certainly legitimate in terms of doing oversight, which is our responsibility as the legislative branch, we can't--and shouldn't--intrude or perhaps undermine inadvertently the investigation being conducted by the executive branch and the special counsel. I think this is something we should talk about as a Senate because I know each committee that has some jurisdictional hook on this issue wants, of course, to do its job, but I think, if we don't deconflict between committees, as well as between the role of the Justice Department and the special counsel, we could risk inadvertently harming the investigation. I trust no one would want to do that intentionally.  Sometimes, having served myself--as has the distinguished Presiding Officer as the former attorney general of Alaska--it is interesting, this is my first legislative role in government. I have been here for a while now, and I am starting to get the hang of things, but the fact is, sometimes I think legislators are confused about their role when it comes to investigations. They are not the Legislators are not the Department of They can't investigate a counterintelligence matter or a criminal matter. That is simply within the exclusive purview of the executive branch.  What we can do and what we must do, in my view, is to continue to conduct a bipartisan oversight investigation into these matters for our own purposes, which are legislative purposes, not executive branch or prosecutorial purposes. Now that Director Mueller has been appointed as special counsel and will be doing that on behalf of the Department of Justice and the executive branch, I think it is really important for us to again consider whether this proliferation of hearings and running down every rabbit trail that happens to pop up is really in the best interests of getting to the bottom of this matter.  I believe it is our duty--and this would be the case no matter who was in the White House--to get the facts and to conduct our legitimate oversight investigation here but in a way that cooperates with or certainly at least coordinates and deconflicts with the Department of Justice's investigation under the auspices of Director In the meantime, I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee on a broad bipartisan basis to conduct the kind of investigation that is entirely appropriate so we can get to the bottom of this matter. The American people, of course, deserve nothing less.                         Healthcare Legislation  Mr.President, on another matter, the Senate continues to work toward repealing and replacing ObamaCare, unfortunately, without any help whatsoever from our Democratic colleagues, even though they know ObamaCare is failing the millions of people who buy their insurance in the individual market. Premiums are skyrocketing because of adverse selection and deductibles are so high they are effectively denied the benefit of having insurance in the first place. One would think an elected Senator representing those constituents would care enough about it to try to do something about it, but our Democratic colleagues, because they are so tied to ObamaCare and they feel like they have to defend it at all costs, I think it has blinded them to the failings of ObamaCare, certainly in the individual market. There ought to be some basis for us to work together in the best interests of all our constituents and the entire country.[[Page S3032]]  Some of our colleagues have said: Well, we would be revisiting ObamaCare even if Hillary Clinton had been elected, and that is absolutely true because ObamaCare is failing millions of Americans, and it is our responsibility, on a bipartisan basis, to do something about it. So far, the politics of the day seem to be carrying our Democratic colleagues along with it. I hope at some time the fever breaks and they will see fit to do their duty, as we are attempting to do our duty, which is to replace ObamaCare with affordable healthcare that preserves individual choices and doesn't continue to exacerbate and aggravate the national debt and our financial status in the country.  ObamaCare, we now know, was oversold. At the time, the President said: If you like your policy, you can keep your policy; if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor; and, oh, by the way, a family of four will see a reduction in their premiums of $2,500 a year. None of those claims proved to be true.  Again, the Presiding Officer was a former attorney general, as I was in my State, and we had a Consumer Protection When people misrepresented the services or product they sold, we sued them. We went after them for consumer fraud. ObamaCare, to me, is one of the largest cases of consumer fraud I have ever seen, and people deserve better.  It is time to do away with this government-mandated, top-down approach that doesn't work. It is time to provide the American people with more affordable options. That is what we are trying to do. One would think that would be something all of us would want to do.  ObamaCare has taken a heavy toll on folks in my It is estimated that more than one-third of our counties are down to just one health insurance provider this year, and the ones that are there are saying that unless something changes, they are going to see double-digit increases in premiums for 2018. They are down to one provider because everybody else has decided they have lost enough money and they want to get out while they can. To have one provider is not about more options and choices and better coverage, it is an unworkable path forward for our Nation's healthcare needs.  Fortunately, every member of the Republican conference is now working together to do away with this unworkable healthcare plan and replace it with healthcare that helps American families get the coverage they need at a price they can afford. Why wouldn't we all be interested in providing the healthcare they need at a price they can afford?  The House has taken the first critical step, and I know my colleagues and I are eager to do our part. Since the Democrats refuse to lift a finger, we are going to have to do this with 52 Republicans, and it is not easy, but just because it is hard is no excuse for not succeeding. We must succeed in the best interests of our constituents.  This isn't just a matter of taking something that is OK and making it better; this is taking something that is failing and, if we fail to act, will continue to drag Americans by the millions down with it.  It is important to understand the trials that Americans have faced under ObamaCare so we can move forward in a direction that supports families across the country. One of my constituents wrote me recently and told me that his premiums were going up by about 50 percent. To make matters worse, his doctors wouldn't accept patients on ObamaCare plans. That is a theme we have seen across the country: healthcare options dwindling while prices keep getting higher. The cost of his healthcare keeps going up, and his salary isn't going up at the same rate. He is losing disposable income, even though he has a job. So he is literally poorer as a result of This isn't helping him, this is hurting him, and all because his monthly payment for health insurance is climbing. So he is living from paycheck to paycheck, and of course he is worried about the future, which is the reason he contacted me.  Unfortunately, this gentleman is representative of the unintended consequences brought about by All of our offices get a lot of calls, a lot of emails and letters just like his. He is not on the exchanges because he wants to keep his doctors, and he is employed with employer-provided health insurance. To many in America, this would be a huge blessing, but unfortunately ObamaCare did nothing to help people like him. His premiums are going up so high, he is concerned about being able to put food on the table for his family. What a tragedy. What a disaster. This is truly a manmade disaster, and it is a crystal clear example of just how flawed ObamaCare really is.  This constituent of mine ended his letter to me by calling on Congress to fully repeal ObamaCare, and that is exactly what we will do. He is not alone in calling for change. Many Texans have been writing and calling in, and have been for some time, to tell me their ObamaCare story. It is making their lives harder, as I mentioned, with skyrocketing premiums, higher deductibles, and fewer choices of doctors and healthcare providers. These are the folks I was sent here to represent and whom I am fighting for, and each of us, I know, is doing their part--at least on this side of the aisle--to fight for our constituents who are being hurt by the status quo.  The status quo is not acceptable. I know it is not acceptable to our colleagues across the aisle, but they are so frozen in place by their own politics that they can't even step across the aisle and work with us in areas where we might agree. I hope this happens at some point, but it is not happening right now.  So we are going to repeal and replace ObamaCare and come up with the very best healthcare plan that we can--again, one that preserves choices, brings premiums down, and makes it more affordable.  Here is the final reason why we need to do this: We promised. We promised. In the last elections, we promised. There is a reason why, when ObamaCare passed, there were 60 Democrats and today there are 48. It is because in every intervening election we have made the perils of ObamaCare an issue, and in every election our friends across the aisle have lost Senators because they simply can't defend the status quo.  But beyond elections, I believe there is a time to engage in electioneering and there is a time to govern, and now is the time for us to govern responsibly. But it does have political benefits, too, because if people think you are doing a good job and if people think you care about them, then, they are likely to reward you politically. But that is not the main reason we should do it. We should do it because it is the right thing to do and because people are hurting and people are anxious and concerned about their future, living paycheck to paycheck, with ObamaCare taking a bigger and bigger bite out of their ability to provide for their family.  So we are going to get this done. Just because it is not easy isn't an excuse for not doing it. We can't complain that it is too hard because that is what we asked our constituents to send us here to do--to do the hard stuff, not the easy stuff--to do the hard stuff. This is hard, but it is not impossible. It is imminently doable. But it takes political will and commitment not just to keep our promise but, then, to do the dead-level best of our abilities to come up with a plan that actually believes not in more government control but in more individual control over your healthcare choices and to bring competition back into the marketplace, to let the market set rates and quality rather than the government determining this from Washington,  One thing I truly believe is that competition makes things better for consumers. It brings down prices and it improves service because in a competitive environment where people have choices, they are going to go to the choice which serves their interests the best. They are going to reward the people who are doing the best job of delivering what they need and what they want at the price they can afford. It has a way of regulating the insurance market better than anything Washington, DC, could do--particularly by command and control of programs like  So we are going to get it done, and we are all working together. We would continue to invite our colleagues across the aisle not to sit on their hands, not to do nothing but to do what they can, working with us in a[[Page S3033]]nonpartisan or bipartisan way to help save the people who are currently being damaged and hurt by the failures of ObamaCare but then to help us build something better, something more durable than what we have seen with  I yield the floor.

(3) The Department of Defense submitted a report on the      management of military technicians in December 2016 that      finds that 12.6 percent of the military technician (dual      status) positions were administrative in nature, and      recommended a conversion of 4.8 percent of such positions to      positions of Federal civilian employment.       (4) The Chief of the National Guard Bureau testified before      Congress in April 2017 that a conversion of 20 percent of      military technician (dual status) positions to positions of      Federal civilian employment would degrade readiness, but that      a lower number could be converted with minimal impact. The      Chief of the National Guard Bureau also testified that the      Department of Defense had not conducted an analysis of the      associated costs and benefits of a conversion of 20 percent      of military technician (dual status) positions to positions      of Federal civilian employment.       (b) Postponement of Deadline for Completion of      Conversion.--Notwithstanding the deadline otherwise specified      in paragraph (1) of section 1053(a) of the National Defense      Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (10 U.S.113 note)      for the completion of the conversion of military technician      positions as described in that subsection, the deadline for      the completion of such conversion shall be 180 days after the      date on which the Secretary of Defense transmits to Congress      under paragraph (6) of subsection (c) the report of the      working group required by paragraph (5) of that subsection.

(2) Co-chairs.--The co-chairs of the working group shall be      the following:       (A) The Director of the Army National       (B) The Director of the Air National       (C) The Chief of the Army       (D) The Chief of the Air Force       (3) Members.--The members of the working group shall      include the co-chairs of the working group and such other      personnel of the Department of Defense as the Secretary shall      appoint from among organizations and elements of the      Department with an interest in full time support of the      reserve components of the Armed Forces, including the      National Guard Bureau and the Adjutants General of the            (4) Duties.--The working group shall undertake a      comprehensive review of full time[[Page S2918]]     support of the reserve components of the Armed Forces,      including the following:       (A) An identification of the missions, purposes, and      objectives of military technicians (dual status) in support      of an operational reserve force.       (B) A review of the posture of current military technician      (dual status) positions, and of their current role in meeting      the objectives identified pursuant to subparagraph (A).       (C) An analysis of potential restructurings of the      workforce of military technicians (dual status) in order to      identify a restructuring that fully aligns military      technician (dual status) positions with objectives for full      time support of the reserve components.       (D) An identification of the military technician (dual      status) positions whose conversion to positions of Federal      civilian employment under title 5, United States Code, would      best ensure the achievement of objectives for full time      support of the reserve components.       (E) An assessment of the impact on the readiness of the      National Guard for domestic operations of the conversion of      positions identified pursuant to subparagraph (D) as      described in that subparagraph.       (F) An assessment of costs and potential savings associated      with the conversion of positions identified pursuant to      subparagraph (D) as described in that subparagraph.       (5) Report to secretary of defense.--Not later than 180      days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the working      group shall submit to the Secretary of Defense a report on      the comprehensive review undertaken pursuant to paragraph      (4). The report shall include the following:       (A) A comprehensive description of the review and the      results of the review.       (B) The percentage of military technician (dual status)      positions whose conversion to positions of Federal civilian      employment under title 5, United States Code, would best      ensure the achievement of objectives for full time support of      the reserve components of the Armed Forces as an operational      reserve.       (C) A transition plan for implementing a new force      structure for full time support of the reserve components,      including for the conversion of positions as described in      subparagraph (B) which mitigates any risks to readiness      identified pursuant to paragraph (4)(E).       (D) Recommendations for the reform of personnel management      policy for military technician (dual status) positions that      address--       (i) the eligibility of military technicians (dual status)      for civilian retirement upon retirement from the Armed      Forces; and       (ii) the process for appealing employment decisions.       (E) Recommendations for reforms of compensation and      benefits policies for military technician (dual status)      positions in order to provide military technicians (dual      status) with parity in compensation and benefits with other      Federal civilian employees of the Department of Defense under      title 5, United States       (6) Transmittal of report to congress.--The Secretary shall      transmit to the congressional defense committees the report      of the working group under paragraph (5), together with such      discussion and recommendations in connection with the report      as the Secretary considers appropriate. The Secretary shall      publish the report, and any such discussions and      recommendations, in the Federal Register at the time of      transmittal.

1744,topic-id,316,"Mr.President, under current law, twenty-percent of our military dual-status technicians in the National Guard, Army Reserve, and Air Force Reserve will become federal civilians on October 1st. This will leave the state Governors to respond to wildfires, floods, and other natural disasters with twenty-percent fewer people. The benefits of this conversion are unclear. In fact, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau testified that no formal analysis has been conducted as to whether there is any benefit at all. It seems prudent to me to take a pause, bring all of the affected stakeholders together, and figure this problem out before we take any irreversible action. Today, I'm introducing the ``Armed Forces Reserve and National Guard Dual-Status Review and Modernization Act,'' to do exactly that.  As I've studied this situation, I understand there are a number of valid concerns involved. The current statutory construct for dual-status military technicians is nearly 50 years old and the role of the Reserve components has changed dramatically just in the past 15 years, let alone the last half-century. I agree we should update the statute to better meet the needs of the total force and my bill addresses this concern. Similarly, many Guardsmen and Reservists feel that personnel management practices under this aging construct doesn't fit the needs of a 21st century workforce. My bill addresses those concerns as well.  Most importantly, the bill ensures that there is no adverse impact to the Guard's ability to respond to domestic emergencies on October 1st, by postponing that date until Department of Defense leadership conducts a thorough, comprehensive review on the requirements of a 21st Century total force, and how our current structure should be aligned to meet those requirements. This will allow Congress to make an informed and measured judgement on how to update current law. I urge my colleagues to give this matter their full consideration and support.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-05-11-pt1-PgS2917.txt,2138,MAY IS AN IMPORTANT MONTH TO HOOSIERS,2017.0,11.0,April

The Huntley Project was one of the first Reclamation projects in Montana and led to the development and success of agricultural land in much of the surrounding area. As agriculture is Montana's 1 industry, it is critical that farmers and ranchers have irrigation projects set in place that are able to provide a reliable supply of water for their crops.  Leading by example is the way we do things in Montana, and this project shows how the dedication and ingenuity of our farmers and ranchers works. It has led to economic development for the area and beyond and transformed farming areas to be even more fruitful for our farmers and ranchers.  Our farmers and ranchers have made it through the tough times because of determination and have overcome many challenges. This anniversary celebrates more than an irrigation project but honors the determination and ambition of the Montana farmer and rancher. Congratulations again for the 110th anniversary of the Huntley Project, and thank you to everyone who has made it a success.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-27-pt1-PgS3797-2.txt,2138,HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION,2017.0,27.0,May

The UASI program provides critical Federal support to local law enforcement in large metropolitan areas to help them protect their residents and visitors. I was the police chief in Orlando when Orlando was initially approved for UASI funding, and, therefore, I know firsthand how critical such Federal support is to Orlando and other large metropolitan areas.

1802,topic-id,956,"Mr.Speaker, as Secretary Kelly acknowledged before the Committee on Homeland Security last month, the threat of terrorism has metastasized around the country. Whether it is New York City, the largest municipality in the country, or some other small town in the middle of Arkansas, the potential is about the same, in my view, for a lone-wolf attack. That was how the Secretary described it last week, and I could not agree with him more. The demands on local law enforcement are even more increasing, ever changing, and more complex.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and our ranking member for their vision and commitment to keeping our homeland safe. Do we have any greater purpose?  Reauthorization of the Department is long overdue and I commend the Chairmen and Ranking Members for their commitment to working together, in a bipartisan fashion, to accomplish what had not been possible for so many years.

My constituents in Florida know, all too well, the truth of the Secretary's words.  No city in America can afford to go backwards; to lose ground on preparedness.  The demands on local law enforcement are ever increasing, ever changing, and more complex than ever before. The federal government must continue to be a strong partner to local law enforcement who are our first line of defense.  I thank the Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security for his support of this program  The bill would also require the Government Accountability Office to perform an independent review of the risk formula and award[[Page H6113]]processes for the UASI program, as well as the State Homeland Security Grant  The preparedness of urban areas and the threats they face has changed since the programs were created after the 9/11 attacks, and this report will assess the current process used to collect and evaluate threat information in order to ensure grant funds are provided where they are needed most.  I am also pleased that this bill would reject a proposal, put forth earlier this year by President Trump in his first budget, which called for transitioning almost 1,100 Transportation Security Officers currently staffing airport exit lanes to security checkpoints.  The elimination of exit lane staffing in budget proposal is problematic for a few reasons.  First, exit lane staffing responsibilities and expenses would be shifted to local airport authorities. The primary responsibility for security of the traveling public should remain in the hands of the  Second, elimination of such staffing would directly contradict the statutory language of the Bipartisan Budget Agreement of 2013 that requires TSA to monitor passenger exit points from the sterile areas of airports.  As a former Captain of the Airport Division of the Orlando Police Department, and a 27-year veteran of law enforcement, I can tell you: There is no question about it. TSA is responsible for exit lane staffing.  Eliminating federal exit lane staffing would not enhance our nation's security, and doing so would be a contravention of the existing statutory requirement.  I offered an amendment in the Homeland Security Committee, which was accepted, that explicitly authorizes funding at the Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 level for exit lane coverage through Fiscal Year 2019.  As a result, the bill before us today sends a clear message to the Administration that we will not stand for TSA attempting to foist its Congressionally-mandated duties onto its local partners.

Chairman Michael McCaul,     Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives,          Washington       Dear Chairman McCaul: New York City remains the nation's      top terror target because of its large population, historic      landmarks, iconic tourist destinations, and unique      international status. The New York City Police Department      (NYPD) is steadfast in fulfilling our mission to protect      millions of New York City residents, as well as the millions      of people who work in and visit our city each year.       The NYPD supports the new funding levels proposed in the      PREPARE These levels reflect a willingness to ensure      that Law Enforcement is equipped with the tools to keep our      communities safe. The bill demonstrates an understanding that      we are safest when federal resources are focused where the      threats are.[[Page H6114]]       The PREPARE Act would provide a crucial investment in      homeland security preparedness, both for the safety of New      York City and the entire nation. This investment is      particularly important in light of the recent events in      Europe and the expressed goals of a variety of groups seeking      to recruit individuals from within our borders to carry out      mass casualty attacks. Federal funding is essential to allow      law enforcement to adapt to the new challenges by developing      innovative technology and enhanced preparedness programs,      like the NYPD's Counterterrorism Bureau Training       I strongly support passage of the PREPARE Act and urge you      to continue to place the highest priority on protecting New      York and other high-threat urban areas.

This legislation will play an important role in      helping our nation's fire and emergency service personnel to      respond to the escalating number of threats that we face.       As recent events have shown, the terrorist threat presents      a wide variety of tactics and techniques. For any type of      terrorist attack, local first responders will be the first      on-scene and will have to provide an immediate response. This      fact means that local first responders must be ready to      respond to explosives; active shooter incidents; complex,      coordinated attacks; and threats of biological or chemical      terrorism. The federal government can provide valuable      training and equipment as incentives to help states and local      governments develop multidisciplinary approaches to future      threats.       Title VI of the substitute amendment has a number of      provisions that will help local first responders, including:       Annually authorizing $800 million for the Urban Areas      Security Initiative (UASI) program and $600 million for the      State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) from Fiscal      Year (FY) 2018 through FY 2022.       Allowing the use of SHSGP and UASI funds to develop medical      preparedness and surge capacity in case of a biological      attack, including medical kits to protect first responders      and their families;       Protecting the grant programs, like SHSGP and UASI, from      consolidation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency      without congressional authorization;       Authorizing a grant program to help emergency response      providers plan, train and prepare for complex, coordinated      attacks;       Expanding the role of the Chief Medical Officer to      authorize the development of policies to protect first      responders from the medical effects of acts of terrorism; and       Protecting the Office of Emergency Communications, which is      a valuable resource for improving public safety      communications interoperability, from elimination or      consolidation without congressional authorization.       The IAFC appreciates your leadership in ensuring that local      first responders are prepared to mitigate the increasing      number of threats facing our nation. An effective response by      local first responders at the beginning of a terrorist attack      will help save lives and reduce the success of an act of      terrorism.

It would strengthen the Law      Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Activities requirement that      is in existing law by fostering enhanced engagement among law      enforcement practitioners and key offices within DHS      including the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement and            The bill also takes productive steps to help Federal,      state, and local partners share information on cyber threats.      Ensuring effective collaboration and preparedness regarding      cyber threats is becoming more important, and the PREPARE Act      would be helpful on this front by encouraging the timely      analysis and sharing of threat information.       We commend your consistent and aggressive efforts to find      ways for Congress to foster improved collaboration and      coordination by Federal, state, local, and private entities      to protect the homeland. We have made great progress, but we      have much more work to do. The PREPARE Act is the latest      example of your dedication to this purpose, and we look      forward to working with you and your colleagues to ensure      effective legislation is enacted.

Michael McCaul,     House Homeland Security Committee, House of Representatives,          Washington,       Dear Chairman McCaul: As Vice Presidents of the Major      County Sheriffs of America (MCSA) in charge of Homeland      Security and Government Affairs, we write to thank you for      your leadership and support of local law enforcement through      the FY18 grant authorizations found within Title VI of H.     2825, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act      of 2017.       MCSA is an association of elected Sheriffs representing the      nation's largest counties with populations of 500,000 people      or more. Collectively, we provide public safety services to      over 100 million residents and have a unique understanding of      the national security challenges facing our nation.       Since September 11, 2001, our country has made great      progress in our nation's ability to prepare for, respond to      and prevent terrorist attacks; however, in an era of deep      budget cuts and reduced federal funding, state and local law      enforcement do not have sufficient funds by themselves to      support the homeland security mission.       Federal funding such as the Homeland Security Grant Program      (HSGP) which includes the Urban Areas Security Initiative      (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) work to      address gaps in local agency capabilities for responding to      terrorist threats in the homeland. Authorizing UASI at $800      million and SHSP at $600 million is critical to our efforts.      Local capabilities that have been built in part through UASI      and SHSP funds are not self-sustaining and require consistent      federal support to maintain a level of vigilance against      threats.

1745,topic-id,1059,"Mr.President, today I am introducing a bill to improve the safety oversight of products that affect every single family on a daily basis. Whether it's shampoo or shaving cream, lotion or make-up, hair dye or deodorant, personal care products are a part of our everyday lives. I thank Senator Collins for her support and hard work on this important legislation.  However, even though our bodies absorb many chemicals in these products through our skin and even our nails, their ingredients are largely unregulated. It's time to modernize our safety oversight and correct this problem. Most people assume these products have up-to-date federal oversight, but in reality the Food and Drug Administration's authority to do so is sorely outdated--in fact, it's based on a law from the 1930s that has changed little over the past eight decades. There are questions about the safety of some ingredients in these products, which not only leads to health concerns but also causes uncertainty for companies working to innovate and expand domestically.  Over the last several years, Senator Collins and I have worked with a wide group of stakeholders that represent both industry and consumer groups. Those stakeholders include small and large companies, doctors, consumer advocates, patient advocates, scientists, and the Food and Drug Together, we have drafted bipartisan legislation that puts commonsense measures in place and has the support of both industry and consumer and health organizations.  The Personal Care Products Safety Act sets up a process for reviewing the safety of ingredients in personal care products. The bill requires manufacturers to register so consumers know who produces personal care products sold in the United  The legislation also modernizes authority for the Food and Drug Administration so the agency is better equipped to deal with public health concerns, such as being able to recall contaminated products if companies choose not to do so voluntarily. The updated system is completely paid for by industry fees. Companies will provide information about the ingredients in their products to the Food and Drug Administration, and attest to their safety. Many companies manufacturing in the United States currently follow strict voluntary standards for manufacturing under proper conditions, but the lack of federal standards leaves this to chance. Under this legislation, the agency sets Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines to ensure companies meet minimum requirements. Companies will also need to report adverse health events related to their products to the Food and Drug  Last year, we heard about WEN shampoo, a product that was causing significant hair loss. Among those affected were children, including a little girl named Eliana who lost all of her hair after using She shared her story with my office and several of my colleagues. What's shocking is that the company received more than 20,000 reports of this happening, but under current law WEN had no legal obligation to tell the Food and Drug Under this legislation, companies would be required to do so.  Another example of concern is the ongoing use of formaldehyde, also called methylene glycol when mixed with water, in the popular hair treatment called a Brazilian blowout. Formaldehyde is released into the air during[[Page S2919]]this beauty treatment. It can cause shortness of breath, headaches, and dizziness in the short-term. Over the long-term, formaldehyde has been linked to cancer.  I am also greatly concerned about the effect on the health of salon professionals who are constantly exposed to a variety of chemicals daily. In addition to reviewing the safety of chemicals they may be exposed to, this legislation also ensures that the salon products they use are properly labeled with ingredients and warnings.  The Food and Drug Administration will be required to evaluate at least five ingredients per year for safety and use in personal care products. In addition to reviewing the latest scientific and medical studies, the agency will consider how prevalent the ingredient is, the likely exposure, adverse event reports, and information from public comments. Public input will be critical to the review process. There will be opportunities for companies, scientists, consumer groups, medical professionals, and members of the public to weigh in on, not only the safety of particular ingredients but also, which ingredients should be a priority for review. After review, the Food and Drug Administration may deem an ingredient safe, unsafe, or safe under certain uses or under certain conditions. The agency will also have the authority to require warning labels as needed for certain ingredients and limit the amount of an ingredient that may be used in personal care products. For example, some ingredients may only be safe for use by adults or when used by professionals in a salon or spa setting.  The Personal Care Products Safety Act is the result of many diverse groups working together with the common goal of modernizing the federal oversight system to ensure the safest products possible are on the market. We have worked closely with small businesses to ensure that the legislation recognizes their needs and supports their growth. This legislation incorporates changes to increase flexibility for small businesses, particularly those making low-risk products. The bill recognizes the unique nature of the handmade cosmetic industry and meets their needs to encourage growth and innovation.  I am pleased that the major organizations representing these small businesses (Handmade Cosmetic Alliance, Coalition of Handcrafted Entrepreneurs, Handcrafted Soap and Cosmetic Guild), have said that the provisions within this legislation ``afford producers in the handmade cosmetic industry the opportunity to continue to innovate, grow, create jobs and produce safe, quality handmade products in communities across the nation.''

1746,topic-id,738,"Mr.I rise today to join with my colleagues in introducing a rescission bill to nullify President Trump's Executive Order 13798, titled ``Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty.'' Unfortunately, this Executive Order does not live up to its title. Instead, it furthers the aim of this administration to diminish critical protections for women, minorities, and LGBT  I am deeply troubled by Section 3 of the Order, which paves the way for the Trump administration to roll back protections to preventive health services under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), especially for women and LGBT individuals. Through new regulations issued pursuant to this Order, companies could use ``conscience-based'' objections to deny their employees coverage for preventive services that they have a right to under the This means that because of their employers' moral objection, women could lose access to contraception, and those in the LGBT community could lose access to essential services, including cancer screenings or counseling for domestic violence.  I respect that we all have religious and moral convictions, but it is wrong to put employers' religious views above individuals' rights to access basic health care. I also note that this section of the Order invites members of the President's Cabinet to eliminate an accommodation President Obama administration made allowing religiously affiliated nonprofit employers, including large universities and hospital systems, to opt out of providing their employees with contraception coverage based on religious objections.  Importantly, women working for objecting employers can receive contraception coverage directly through their insurance companies. Seven federal courts of appeals have upheld this accommodation in the face of religiously based challenges. But with this Order, the President signals that his administration is likely to do away with the accommodation, which would deny contraception access to women whose bosses want to make this important and intimate decision for them.  The Order also directs the Attorney General to issue guidance to all agencies on ``religious liberty protections in Federal law.'' This language is concerning as it opens the door for the Attorney General to eliminate protections in federal rules and regulations for LGBT individuals and minorities. The Attorney General's duty is to enforce and protect the civil rights and constitutional freedoms of all This Order's direction for guidance that could change the implementation of critical rules affording equal treatment for all in America is a disturbing step backward. For example, there are rules protecting same-sex spouses' ability to visit their partners in the hospital and ensuring that LGBT individuals have equal access to federally funded emergency housing. Under this provision, however, new religious exemptions may be implemented to weaken these protections. Shelters could turn LGBT families away because of who they love. As the Human Rights Campaign has described, this provision opens the door to a ``license to discriminate'' even where basic services funded with government dollars are at stake.  This Executive Order opens the door to weakening the enforcement of longstanding tax laws against individuals, houses of worship, and other religious organizations engaging in political campaign speech. Notably, the Johnson Amendment was proposed by Lyndon Johnson in 1954 and is part of our tax code. It prohibits 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entities, including churches, from engaging in political campaign activity on behalf of candidates. The Johnson Amendment does not bar nonpartisan voter education and registration activities, which are important to a strong democracy, nor does it prohibit speech on moral issues.  The President has promised to repeal the Johnson Doing so could have a significant impact on political campaign fundraising and would change the current tax consideration for certain political contributions. While repeal of the Johnson Amendment is something only Congress has the power to do, this Executive Order clearly indicates the administration's intention to undermine the separation[[Page S2920]]between tax-exempt charities and religious organizations and political campaign activity in the tax code.  It remains to be seen whether the President and the administration will implement this Order in ways that will realize our worst fears about the kind of discrimination it could enable. But we know for certain that this Order represents a disturbing statement of principles and values. Instead of seeking even greater protections from discrimination, this administration has set the stage to undermine protections, especially for women and LGBT individuals. That is not what our country stands for.  Mr.President, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the bill I am introducing today to nullify this troubling Executive  Thank you.

1826,topic-id,1353,"Thank you, Mr. I rise to talk about the effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Before I begin, I thank Senator Hirono for sharing her story and for leading us all here in the discussion tonight.  I thank the Presiding Officer who has been listening, and I appreciate that. I really do.  In recent days, we have finally gotten to see the plan that 13 Republican Senators have been working on in secret and behind closed doors. I really thought the Senate bill would be better. I thought it would be better than the House version that was passed. Even Senator Burr said of the House bill that it was ``dead on arrival'' in the Senate, but, unfortunately, the Senate plan is just as bad.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office announced just today that, under the Senate plan, 22 million more Americans would be uninsured. That has consequences. Perhaps worst of all--and partly because this causes the reduction in the number of Americans who would be covered--the bill ends the Medicaid expansion and cuts the[[Page S3761]]funding for the Medicaid Program by nearly $800 billion--a program that has been a vital part of our social fabric since 1965.  This bill--and I do not like to say this--is mean. The President said that of the House bill. I do not like to characterize something that way, but it is mean and would have far-reaching effects for millions of Americans across the country.  This past weekend, I hosted a healthcare forum in Burnsville, It is a suburb that is south of Minneapolis, of the Twin It was on the importance of Medicaid and how the Republican plan's devastating cuts would affect Over 230 people showed up to share their stories about how Medicaid changed their lives, and it was very moving.  I think it is really important to tell this in terms of people, not in terms of numbers, although the numbers are pretty stark. Brandon and his mom spoke, Brandon and They are both from  Brandon was born 15 weeks premature. He weighed just 1 pound 13\1/2\ ounces. He was so small that his parents' wedding rings could slide on his arm. He was also born with cerebral palsy and hydrocephalus, which is a condition that causes fluid to collect in Brandon's brain, which results in brain damage.  Brandon, who is now 17, got up with a walker at the event. He told me that he was taken immediately to the Mayo Clinic in He was born in the Twin Cities, but Mayo said that his case was too complicated to handle, so they sent him back to the Twin Cities, to Gillette, which is a children's hospital. It is a great children's hospital, a great hospital. Within 24 hours of his birth, the hospital told Brandon's parents that his costs were already over $1 million--a terrifying addendum to what must have been a harrowing, harrowing experience.  Over the years, Brandon has needed 38 surgeries--surgery to reduce the fluid in his brain. He has a shunt. He has had surgeries to straighten out his legs. He has had eye surgeries and more. He has also needed extensive physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and across his lifetime, he has needed other interventions to help him do basic tasks, like eat and now walk. He could not turn over. He could not do the things that babies do, that we parents and grandparents relish in every day.  But guess what. He is thriving. In fact, he just passed his first college course at Dakota County Technical He proudly told me and the rest of us that he received an A-minus, and he hopes someday to get a job at Gillette, the Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare, which is the very place that provided him with the unique and high-quality care that he has needed over the years. All of this has been possible because Brandon and his family were able to get health insurance through  Sheri, Brandon's mom, said: ``If we didn't have Medicaid, Brandon probably wouldn't be here''--meaning at our forum--``and he wouldn't be doing as well as he's doing.''  Brandon similarly noted:       Kids with special needs are referred to as ``special      needs,'' and I like to think I'm pretty special. I also like      to think our needs are also special depending on the kind of      care we need and that's what Medicaid provides.  I really believe that all of us here tonight must do all we can to protect these kids and protect their families and everyone who relies on Medicaid, and I sincerely believe that means we have to defeat this bill.  My colleague Senator Hirono stated last week: ``We are all one diagnosis away from a serious illness.'' That is the case. Do you know what else? We are also just one accident away from a life-changing injury.  Another Minnesotan, Deborah, shared her story with my office. She described for me a car crash and the subsequent traumatic brain injury that she survived in 2012.  She explained:       It was just another day. I was on my way to work. I lost      control of my SUV after sliding on a patch of ice and slammed      into a concrete median.  Her whole life changed at that moment. She had to relearn basic tasks--reading, walking, talking, and eating--but all of it was possible because of the home- and community-based services she was able to receive through  She said:       Without the services funded by Medicaid, my goal of      returning to paid employment would be impossible. I honestly      worry that proposed changes to the Medicaid program could      significantly diminish my overall health outcomes and even      leave me facing long-term homelessness.  As my colleagues and people at home who are watching this debate well know, this week could prove to be an extremely consequential week in the history of this country. The decisions we make--the 100 of us--over the next few days could literally mean life or death for many Lives are on the line.  Tomorrow, I will give a speech that is more about the data, and we have heard about some of that, but there is a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that came out this week that reads that Medicaid--having the insurance--improves people's lives and that--this is not precise--for every 300 to 800 who will lose healthcare, who would lose Medicaid, there will be a premature death.  This is a study that is going to be summarized in the New Yorker, in an article by Atul Gawande, that the effect of having insurance is not about dramatic emergencies. This is especially about things like diabetes and heart illness and cancer--the day-to-day. It is about having access. Because you have insurance for care, it improves the health of people, and it extends mortality. This is real stuff. What we are doing is really serious.  I strongly urge my Republican colleagues to talk with their constituents about the bill that was drafted. Again, it was behind closed doors, and many of my Republican colleagues did not see it until last week. I urge them to talk to their constituents about the consequences this bill would have for seniors, for children, and parents who have Medicaid coverage.  Talk to the people who would see their healthcare costs rise. Talk to the families who may lose their health insurance. People are afraid.  I am a cochair of the World Health I go all around my I talk to roundtables at rural hospitals and nursing homes.

As part of this broader legislative effort, I sponsored the Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program Act because I believe we need to make sure that our Intelligence Committee has the best and most robust training in the world in order to keep our Nation safe.  In 2015, the Department's Chief Intelligence Officer identified the need to strengthen the workforce at the agency by giving intelligence analysts the tools they need to succeed. I served as an intelligence officer for 7 years in the Marine Corps and worked in the Intelligence Committee, including at the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, so I know firsthand the value of intelligence analysts gaining experience in different mission areas in order to broaden their ability to do their jobs more effectively for the American people.  This program does that. It encourages analysts to gain experience in all of the various agencies that are part of the larger DHS community.  With authorization, this bill will ensure that we are building and strengthening the expertise among employees[[Page H6117]]at the DHS in order to keep the country safe.

1784,topic-id,541,"Mr.Speaker, first of all, my experience with the Affordable Care Act actually comes from the State legislature, where, in a bipartisan manner, the Republican governor joined with the minority Democrats and a handful of Republicans in the Senate State House to pass Medicaid expansion.  Why did we do that?  If you looked at what was happening in Arizona, it was some of the Trump areas, as I like to call them, these rural districts where the rural hospitals, which are not only the medically necessary infrastructure of the area but also the economic drivers, the only high-wage employers in the area, they were about to shut down.  There was so much uncompensated cost, because people were using the emergency room as their primary care doctor, that these hospitals were starting to have to charge more and insurance companies were starting to refuse to pay more for their premiums, that they needed to respond to that.  In the end, what we started hearing from these hospitals is that we are going to have to shut down the emergency room, and if you have an emergency, we are going to have to helicopter you either to Tucson or  Now, for many of you guys who are not Southwesterners like us in the Southwest, we have a lot of territory and a lot of land. For you to just drive to Phoenix for emergency care would be pretty insane, let alone the expense of helicoptering into Phoenix was even more so than that.  Because we had the goal of actually increasing and improving our healthcare outcomes, we worked again in a bipartisan manner with Governor Brewer, with Republicans and Democrats to pass one of the most comprehensive Medicaid expansion bills in the country that has actually turned around, lowered costs, created better healthcare outcomes, and has now insured more than 400,000 poor Arizonans that did not have it before, including people in the disability community, as well as children.                              {time}  1315  To counteract what we saw today, if it wasn't really for the bravery of Senator Murkowski, Senator Collins, and Senator McCain, as well as all of the Senate Democrats, what we would have seen would have been a bill that would not only have just rolled back the millions of people who are now covered with health insurance, but it would also have been detrimental to the people who currently have even private health insurance.  Premiums were going to go up for everybody. The estimated amount of people just on the so-called skinny bill that were going to lose health insurance would be 16 million people, and on the House bill it was going to be 23 million people, in addition to the essential gutting of Medicaid, all for giving a tax cut to the top 1 percent.  Now, this is bad policy, but it is worse policy when you don't have an open process to it, when you seek it through the middle of the night, hoping that the American public is just going to accept what comes out.  There is a reason why TrumpCare was polling less than Congress, and trust me, it is very difficult to poll less than At this point, it is just our families that like us.

1785,topic-id,430,"I like you, too, You are a good man.  But the fact that we the American public knew so little, just knew enough, and said this bill is bad and were able to come out and put pressure on our Senators and our Members of Congress with public hearings and townhalls was key to stopping this.  Lastly, before I move back to Ted, if you are so proud of this bill, if you are the Senate Republicans and you are so proud of this bill, if you are Donald Trump and you are so proud of this bill, even our House colleagues, why didn't you have consistent townhalls? Why didn't you go out there and explain to people what you were planning to do and why this is better for America?  Instead, they tried to hide it. They tried to move it as fast as possible, and then tried to schedule a vote in the middle of the night. If you have to vote for something in the middle of the night, it means you are not very confident and you are not very proud of that bill.  So what is the solution now? Nobody in the Democratic Caucus thinks the Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare, as some people call it--is the be-all and end-all. We don't think it is perfect. We certainly think that there is a great bipartisan approach we can take to make it better. And what I mean by ``better'' is more coverage, lower premiums, and better healthcare outcomes.  When I use those words, those were almost exactly, word for word, what Donald Trump said he wanted to see happen when he was going to replace the Affordable Care  But, point by point, whether it was the bill that came through the House or the bill that came through the Senate, none of those would have even fit Donald Trump's mandate. Which is why, at the end of the day, that bill was radioactive. Nobody liked it, and they had to hide it.  So what we should do is follow the advice of Senator McCain in Arizona, follow the example of Senators Murkowski and Collins and all of the Senate Democrats: get back to regular order and work out an actual fix to the Affordable Care Act and get Americans more coverage, lower premiums, and better healthcare outcomes.  I say that also as someone who is on an ObamaCare plan. I am not exempt from it, and neither is Mr.We are in it just as much as everyone else is, and we want to see it fixed.

1786,topic-id,467,"Mr.Speaker, if you want to hear some ideas--and I think it is important that instead of just us knocking what was introduced, we could also give some ideas--certainly, for me, and I think I am also speaking for Ted Lieu, we would prefer to have Medicare for all, so people have a stable insurance, a system that we know works, a system that actually brings down costs. But if we can't do that, there are many things we can do in the meantime.  Why not drop the age of Medicare eligibility to 55? If you do that, you are going to also decrease premiums for people who are not on Medicare, people who are just buying private health insurance. You could be on Medicare at 55 and still be working.  What about for those counties that don't have private insurers on the subsidized market? They should be able to buy into the Federal health insurance plans of all of the workers who live in those districts, or buy into the plans that Ted and I have. Why can't we let them do that?  Why not cover every U.citizen up until the age of 18 under Medicaid to relieve the parents of that burden?  We can also start looking at community health centers, reinforcing those to make sure that we are taking the poorest of the poor who actually cost the most when it comes to healthcare costs and, instead of forcing them into a hospital or into a primary care situation, they could get consistent care without putting a burden on the overall medical system.  There are tons of ideas that we could be working on with our colleagues that will, again, fulfill President Trump's goal of lower costs, lower premiums, and better healthcare outcomes. So this doesn't have to be a static situation. This doesn't have to be an either/or.  President Trump is making it sound like, because we did not pass his idea of reform, we must collapse the whole system. That is unnecessary, that is irresponsible, and that is not how adult people that legislate act.  You can fix this. We can fix this so more people can have healthcare coverage, more people can have that security that they are going to always have health insurance so they can go and start a business and know they are going to have health insurance, know that they can send their kid to college and they are still going to have health insurance, know that they can retire knowing that they have been healthy the whole time and they are going to have a good, dignified retirement because we had made sure that we established a good healthcare system from the time they were born until the time they retire.

If you were one of those Members of Congress, if you are a Republican Senator or a Republican Member of Congress who voted to gut the Affordable Care Act, there is time. There is a way to come back from that really bad decision. You can turn around and start working for the betterment of this country by trying to fix the Affordable Care  The American public will look kindly upon those legislators who are here to work in a bipartisan manner to, again, lower costs, lower premiums, and provide more coverage and better healthcare outcomes. There is time to do this. But there is not time for more opportunities to gut this, for more time to kick people off Medicaid, or for more time to create some kind of situation that is only go to raise premiums.  If we allow Trump to actually, in his words, make the whole thing fail, it is not ObamaCare that fails, it is not the Affordable Care Act that fails--it is the American people that fail. He is playing a game with the lives of the American people.  What he is going to do is he is going to cause millions of people to either lose their insurance because insurance companies are going to have to start shedding people, or premiums are going to end up going up because, if he creates instability in the market, these insurance companies are going to try to recoup their costs somehow, and it is going to discourage younger individuals from actually coming on and buying into the ObamaCare insurance pool, which, again, will raise premiums. This is unnecessary.  Mr.Speaker, for those Members of Congress and those Senators who want to work with us, the first step is to encourage and stop the President from sabotaging the Affordable Care Act and to work diligently in a bipartisan manner to fix the Affordable Care Act and cover more people.

1769,topic-id,2133,"Again, I am very pleased as the Congressional Progressive Caucus to be able host a Special Order every week. We pick a different topic every week, for those of you that are just beginning to listen. This week we want to focus attention on what we believe are some of the most serious and pressing issues facing our country today around the Trump administration's ties to Russia, around the firing of James Comey, and the many, many issues that have come forward over the last several months, but certainly in the last week.  Since last Tuesday, we have borne witness to a slew of alarming events within the White House and the Department of Last Tuesday afternoon, we received word that the President had fired FBI Director James Comey from his position.  That position, by the way, is a 10-year term. Congress designated it as a 10-year term specifically to ensure that we could protect any administration and the entire country against any conflict of interest that may come up. Obviously, that did not convince the President that he should keep Director  So we heard that he fired him. It seems as if each morning we wake up to a barrage of firings, tweets, or untruths that continue to erode the public's confidence in our democracy.  So what do we know today? Certainly, we don't know enough, but we do know that the President fired Director Comey under the guise of being unsatisfied with how he handled Secretary Hillary Clinton's email investigation.                              {time}  1745  But if that were the case, then why didn't he fire him months ago? Why now? Why did he choose to meet with Russian officials the day after firing Mr.Comey?  Mr.Trump's attempts to use Clinton's emails to divert attention from Comey's investigation into the campaign's ties to Russia are, unfortunately, very disingenuous, and I think that they are proving to be unsuccessful.  Despite his claims that Mr.Comey was not investigating him, the President must have been concerned about what Director Comey would find because the firing, interestingly, came just days after Director Comey had requested additional resources for the investigation.  White House officials attempted at first to say that the blame for the firing was Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's fault. They said it was at his recommendation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions weighed in on that decision as well. But, in fact, shortly after, the President went on television and said that, no, this was his decision regardless of what had been proposed, this is where he was going to be.  On Wednesday, just 1 day after firing then-Director Comey, the President welcomed the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov; and the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, into the Oval Office for a closed press meeting. Let's not forget that Kislyak met with former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn during the campaign, a meeting that Flynn then lied about. I think this is very important because there were a number of Trump administration or Trump campaign officials that met with Russian officials over the course of many months before the election.  Those meetings in and of themselves are not a problem. The problem, however, is that these individuals continued to lie about those meetings, and that makes you wonder: What fire is there where the smoke is? Why would they lie about these things?  We certainly don't know that. We have been unable to get the transcripts of that conversation because the President has not been willing to release them.  Russian President Vladimir Putin is more willing to make that information public than our own President, but I find it outrageous that President Putin would actually propose to be sort of the backup of this information for the We are not looking to President Putin to provide corroboration of these meetings. We actually need an independent ability to look at the facts of this case.  On Monday, the news exploded with reports that the President released highly classified information to Lavrov and Kislyak during their discussion at the White This is extremely alarming. It is true that the President has the right to declassify any information, but the information that was shared was so sensitive that the United States had not even shared it with our allies. The President's decision to divulge that information to foreign officials--particularly Russian officials with whom our relationship is contentious at best--is dangerous and reckless.  There is no doubt in my mind that this will hinder our ability to build international coalitions to actually be able to share information with allies who provide that classified information to us with the understanding that we are going to protect that and guard that. Should any classified information then be declassified for some reason, it is done in consultation with the country that provided that information and with national security advisors. None of that happened in this situation.  President Trump also tweeted during the campaign that Hillary Clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive and highly classified information. So this seems like a particular irony. The President claimed that Hillary Clinton's lack of ability to handle classified information actually made her unfit to be  Speaker Paul Ryan said this: ``It is simple: Individuals who are `extremely careless' with classified information should be denied further access to it.''  Reince Priebus, Trump's Chief of Staff, took it one step further, saying: ``Those who mishandled classified info have had their sec clearances revoked, lost their jobs, faced fines, and even been sent to prison.''  So this is a situation that we have to take extremely seriously.  Before we could even fully engage and vet that news, however, reports then came out that President Trump had actually asked FBI Director James[[Page H4351]]Comey to drop the investigation into Michael According to sources close to Comey, this request came just 1 day after Michael Flynn was fired. This is truly a new low. If this is true--and we are trying to get to the bottom of this--it would absolutely constitute an obstruction of justice. The President has put obstacle after obstacle in the way of any real investigation that gives us the information that we need to protect our national security and the American people.  In the 118 days since the Trump Presidency began, it has been scandal after scandal. The latest events have escalated this crisis to an even higher level. As I mentioned, the FBI Director serves a 10-year term specifically in order to be able to carry out these independent investigations free of partisanship or political pressure. The firing of James Comey and the fact that he was asked by the President for loyalty--again, this is apparently in Director Comey's memo, which we hope to be able to see--and to abandon the investigation against Michael Flynn are extremely serious offenses. They hurt our democracy and they hurt our country.  The President has tried to distract us time and time again, but we actually know that the American people deserve better. History smiles kindly on those who stand up and put country over party and on those who ensure that in the darkest of times and the most difficult of times, the times when we face a constitutional crisis, where our Nation wonders what direction we are going in, the times when we know that the need to preserve the institutions of democracy and justice are most necessary, those are the times when we need people to speak out on both sides of the aisle for the facts, for the truth, and for democracy.  This should not be a partisan issue. We are seeing that starting to emerge from our colleagues across the aisle. I commend those Republicans who have begun to ask for information, documents, and hearings; and I hope that more of my colleagues will join us in the pursuit of truth and in the pursuit of justice.  Last night we received news that Robert Mueller, who is the former FBI Director, has been appointed as special counsel for the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with This is an extremely distinguished man. He has served the country with tremendous success and loyalty, and we are hopeful that Mr.Mueller will diligently investigate the allegations against Michael Flynn and other members of the Trump campaign with veracity and free from political influence. However, we still maintain that an independent commission is necessary because a special counsel answers to the Attorney General, who can then overrule decisions that they make or even fire them at any time. So the appointment of Robert Mueller is a good first step, but it cannot be the last.  Director Mueller will still be in the chain of command under the Trump-appointed leadership of the Justice He cannot take the place of a truly independent outside commission that is free from Trump's meddling.  I think that is why it is so important that we all join in signing the discharge petition that was introduced yesterday by my colleagues, Representative Swalwell and Representative Cummings, who is the ranking member on the Oversight and Government Reform This discharge petition would essentially allow for a bill to move forward that would establish an independent commission that we could truly trust to seek justice. The commission would interview witnesses, would obtain documents, would issue subpoenas, and would receive public testimony in order to examine whether or not the Russian Government did, in fact, interfere with U.elections and how they carried that out.  This is a really crucial step to take because it is not only about the short term and the immediacy of what is in front of us--extremely important, the commission would deal with that as well--but it is also about how do we ensure that these things don't happen again? What did happen, first of all, and how do we make sure that we continue to protect our democracy in the face of what 17 independent intelligence agencies said, which is that the Russians hacked our election in the United States?  There is a lot we need to understand. We need the special counsel, but we also need this independent citizen commission not made up of Members of Congress, but appointed by the House and the Senate leaders of both parties in equal numbers so that we could actually have people who look at this from the perspective of all of America and not tainted by even the vestiges or the appearance of party.  Apparently when President Trump heard that special counsel had been named, he laughed out loud, saying that this is ``the greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history.''  No, Mr.President, we are seeking the truth. As the American people have shown us, they are not backing down, and we will continue to fight for this truth.  Now, in that vein, I also wanted to mention that my colleague, Representative Raskin, and I actually introduced a package of bills that we are calling the Trump transparency package. It is because we really believe that the American people deserve better. We believe that the American people deserve from us transparency. So what this package will do is, first, it will clearly forbid government officials from accepting anything of value from foreign governments in exchange for an official act. It would prohibit government employees from using their positions to further the financial interests of the It would ensure that the President's press pool continues to exist so that the American people receive honest answers, and it would require the President and his family to publicly report any foreign business deals that exceed $10,000.  These are simple steps. They are not egregious and they are not outrageous. They would apply to anyone. They are not partisan. They are about transparency and accountability so that we know that the President of the United States and that others in government are actually accountable to the American people--not to their financial interests, not to their bank accounts, not to their stock portfolios, not to their hotels and golf courses, but to the American people. We have to hold every administration--and certainly this one--accountable. So now, more than ever, it is our moral duty to defend the Constitution, and this bill package goes a step in the right direction.  So I hope that all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would actually cosponsor the Trump transparency package with us so that we can continue to fight for the American people, for democracy, and for the notion that America is willing to question itself and for the notion that America is willing to always put our hands on that moral arc of the universe to push it more quickly towards justice.

1820,topic-id,3053,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for his words.  I rise today to give voice to the concerns I am hearing from so many people in my State and across the country about this repeal bill.  First, I want to recognize my colleague from Hawaii, Senator Hirono, who spoke earlier tonight about her personal battle with kidney cancer, as she is an example to all of us of determination and grit when the going gets tough. She not only is going to the hospital for surgery tomorrow--which isn't an easy surgery--but she decided she wanted to spend the night before she went into the hospital here because she is so passionate about this issue.  I know she is going to fight this disease and win and come out stronger than ever. I have been so moved by how she has taken on her personal fight against cancer at the same time that she has kept this fight going in the She is doing it not just for herself or for her State but for people all over the country.  As Senator Hirono has said, her experience shows how quickly a routine visit to the doctor can turn into a serious diagnosis--a diagnosis that becomes a preexisting condition.  Everyone who faces a serious illness, no matter who they are, should be able to focus all of their energy on getting better, not on how they are going to pay their medical bills. Unfortunately, the bill we are considering doesn't allow everyone to do that.  As the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office noted earlier today, this bill could mean the return of annual or lifetime limits on what insurance would cover for people with expensive conditions like cancer or Alzheimer's, and some key healthcare benefits might be excluded from insurance coverage altogether.  It is no surprise that the Minnesota Hospital Association has said that this proposal ``creates a lot of chaos.''  I was just at Northfield Hospital this weekend. It is a college town, but it is in the middle of a very rural part of our State, with a lot of farms surrounding it. In fact, they call the town ``Cows, Colleges, and Contentment.'' In that town and in that hospital, there wasn't a lot of contentment during my visit.  The CEO of the hospital told me that he was worried that this bill could drive more of his patients to bankruptcy. I met with a number of people who were on the board and work at the hospital, and they were all very concerned about what the bill would mean.  This did not mean that they didn't want to see changes to the Affordable Care They do. They see the issues with premiums in our That is why our Republican legislature worked with our Democratic Governor to pass a bill for reinsurance, to try to use something to leverage the risk for the people in the exchange. We could do something similar on the Federal level, and we should, but that is not what this bill is about.  The head of another hospital in my State said: ``They are shortening up the money, but they're not giving us the ability to manage the care.''  A Minnesota seniors organization said that this bill ``feels like we're pulling the rug out from underneath families and seniors.'' That is why AARP strongly opposes the bill as well.  According to the CBO report that we got today, this bill would cause 22 million people to lose their coverage over the next 10 years--22 million people. On Friday, my Republican colleague Senator Heller said that he ``cannot support a piece of legislation that takes insurance away from tens of millions of Americans.'' I agree.  I hope our Republican colleagues will come to the negotiating table in a bipartisan way. I hope this administration will not sabotage the bill that we have now and will work with States like mine that want a waiver to be able to do the kind of cost sharing and the reinsurance that I just described. During that time, we can work together to actually make healthcare in America better and more affordable.  We need to think about the real and devastating impacts on people's lives that this piece of legislation would have because that is what this debate is about. It is not about all of us going back and forth and citing facts and figures. In the end, it is about how this will affect people.  It is about the lives of people like the mom in Minnesota who has a child with Down syndrome. She told me how she has seen Medicaid help parents of kids with disabilities avoid bankruptcy and how it helps school districts pay for the therapy children like hers need. She said that this bill is ``unconscionable''--that is her word--because of what it would do to adults and kids who have disabilities.  We have more than half a million children in Minnesota who rely on Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance This includes kids like the students of a retired teacher from Northwestern Minnesota, right across from the North Dakota border. The teacher wrote in, saying that the bill is ``cruel and mean,'' especially for the families of special needs students.  A lot of us have talked about how the President called the House bill mean and how we hoped to avoid a bill like[[Page S3753]]this in the In fact, this last weekend, he did admit that he had called the House bill mean after he had celebrated its passage. That is behind us.  The President is the one who is known for speaking his mind and speaking directly. He didn't need a poll or a focus group or an accountant to look at the House bill. He just called it what it was--mean.  In Minnesota, people don't mince words either, and that is why that teacher told me exactly what the impact of this Senate bill would be. In fact, today the Congressional Budget Office--the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office--confirmed it earlier today with its estimate that millions of people, 22 million people, would lose their Medicaid coverage because of the bill.  Our debate today is about the lives of people like the retiree with Parkinson's in Minneapolis, who told me she is ``scared and worried.'' She is not just worried about the cuts to Medicaid but also about depleting the Medicare trust fund to pay for tax cuts for the very wealthy. As she told me, the future of these vital programs that so many Americans depend on is on the line.  This healthcare bill is also about the people who are worried about taking care of their baby boomer parents at the same time that they are caring for their children. One woman told me about her mom, who died 2 years ago at 95 after suffering from dementia for more than 20 years. She had worked her whole life, but as she got older, she couldn't afford the nursing care she needed so much. Luckily, she was able to rely on Medicaid to pay for it.  More than half--54 percent--of nursing facility residents in Minnesota rely on I think when this House bill first came out, people thought, well, Medicaid--what does that have to do with my life? Then they started talking to their parents, their grandparents or they started talking to their neighbors, and that is when they realized, whoa, over 50 percent of people who go into assisted living and nursing homes end up relying on  This woman's daughter told me she is worried that this bill's cuts would put those vital services for seniors at risk for so many other parents and their kids. And even for older people who don't use Medicare or Medicaid, this bill could put health coverage out of reach. That is because it has an age tax for seniors, allowing older people to be charged five times as much as younger people for insurance. As AARP has said, that is just not right.  These are the concerns I have heard from seniors and their families in They are shared by people across the country, especially by people in our rural areas, where they tend to have a little older population. One reason for that is because the Senate bill, actually more than the House bill when it comes to Medicaid, makes even deeper cuts over the long term that will hurt seniors and rural hospitals along with children, people with disabilities, and people suffering from opioid addiction.  We actually have a strong bipartisan group working on the opioid addiction problem. Four of us--two Democrats, two Republicans--were the chief authors of the bill that passed last year, which set the framework for the We then put billions of dollars into treatment last year, and we shouldn't blow it up now by passing a bill that, because of the Medicaid cuts, would--in my State, one-third of the people who get opioid addiction treatment get it from Actually, it would be moving ourselves backward.  I know my colleagues Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski have expressed real concerns about these kinds of Medicaid cuts in their States of Maine and Alaska, which also have big rural populations.  In my State, Medicaid covers one-fifth of our total rural population, about 20 percent of our rural population. These cuts could cause the rural hospitals that serve this population to close. This doesn't just threaten healthcare coverage; it threatens the entire local economy. That is a big deal for rural hospitals, which often have operating margins of less than 1 percent. These rural hospitals are on the frontlines of the opioid epidemic that is hitting communities across the country.  In my State, deaths from prescription drugs now claim more lives than homicides. They claim more lives than car crashes. While there is more work to do to combat the epidemic, I want to recognize our progress. Yes, we passed the blueprint bill, which I just mentioned, with the help of Senators Portman, Whitehouse, and Unfortunately, we are moving ourselves backward.  Medicaid expansion has helped 1.3 million people receive treatment for mental and substance abuse across the country. I know this bill's cuts to these important services for people struggling with addiction have real concerns in States like West Virginia and States like  The problems with this bill, of course, go beyond Medicaid cuts, as a mom from Belgrade, MN, told me when she wrote about her daughter who died way too young from cancer. She asked me to oppose this bill in honor of her daughter and the thousands of other children diagnosed with cancer each year. She is worried that the waivers in this legislation would undercut protections for people with preexisting conditions, threatening to make health insurance unaffordable for families like hers who have children or children with cancer.  One man from Minneapolis told me that what this does is ``downright scary.'' Those were his words. He is scared because he is self-employed. He has a preexisting condition, and he gets his insurance on the individual market. He is worried that under this bill, his costs--which are already high--would skyrocket.  I am the first to say that we need to fix the individual market. In fact, I started out by talking about the fact that we have done some work in our State, and I would like to bring that out nationally. This bill is not the way to do it because--as the CBO said earlier today--it would actually cut assistance and increase deductibles for many people on the individual market. Based on CBO's projections, the Joint Economic Committee estimates that average premiums in Minnesota would go up substantially next year, even more than they have gone up already.  People across the country are making their voices heard about these types of problems. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation poll that came out just last week, only 30 percent of Americans had a favorable view of the House bill, and these concerns go across party lines. Only about half of Republicans--56 percent--supported the House bill.  I know this bill has some differences from the House version, but as Speaker Ryan said last week, the two are very similar. I hope that hearing from Americans on both sides of the aisle prompts my colleagues to start working together to make our system better in a bipartisan way.  Here are some ideas. I would love to include, if we worked on a bipartisan basis together, not only the work that needs to be done on the individual market, but on the exchanges, on the rates, and for small businesses. But I would also like to work on prescription drugs. I have a bill that would harness the negotiating power of 41 million seniors on Medicare to bring drug prices down. We have a number of Senators on the bill. Right now, Medicare is absolutely banned from negotiating with 41 million seniors. That is just wrong. Our seniors should be able to use their market power to negotiate.  I would also love to see more competition in this market. There are several ways we can do it. One is by bringing in less expensive drugs from other countries when we have drug shortages now in this country. Senator Collins and I worked on this, and the bill passed this Senate and got signed into law. Now the Secretary of Human Services can actually bring in drugs that are safe from other countries when we have a drug shortage. We refined some of the language where the rules already allowed the Secretary to do that. They could do the same thing right now, but we can make it even more clear if this Congress got behind it.  Senator McCain and I have a bill to bring in less expensive drugs from Canada, which is very similar to the American market. We have a provision in the bill so they would be safe. Many people in my State are doing this now. We once had bus rides of seniors going up there to get less expensive drugs. We could do it with other countries, as[[Page S3754]]well, as long as they were certified as safe. For one of the ways you could do it, Senator Lee and I have a bill that looks at this. Again, this a bipartisan bill. If you have less competition in the market and you have less competitors, that would trigger the ability to bring in more drugs. You could do it based on the price. If it goes up high and the Secretary or someone else that we could put in that place finds that it is not because of input costs, you could allow this competition to come in from other countries. It would be a trigger. I would bet you right now that if you did that, it would create incentives on American drug companies not to jack up the prices like they have been doing.  The top 10 selling drugs in America have gone up over 100 percent. Things like insulin are up three times. Things like naloxone, which we rely on for overdoses from opiates, have gone up astronomically. It feels like when these drug companies get a monopoly in their lap, they go for it. That is what is happening.  A second way to bring in competition is by encouraging more generics. Senator Grassley and I have a bill to stop something called ``pay for delay.'' This is unbelievable to me, when I describe this to people--that big pharmaceutical companies are actually paying generic companies to keep their products off the market. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found that this would save something like $3 billion over a number of years if we passed our bill. That is for the government and taxpayers, but you could save an equal amount of money for consumers who are paying for this in premiums. How could you ever explain that pharmaceuticals are actually paying generics to keep their products off the market? That is a vote I would like this Senate to take. I would like to challenge anyone to explain why they would vote against that.  We also have another bill called the CREATES Act, with Senators Grassley, Leahy, Lee, and me, which makes it easier to get generics to market by sampling and other things.  These are just a few of the examples of bills that I think would be very good if we would consider them, but so far, we have done nothing. We banned seniors from negotiating. There is nothing in the House or the Senate repeal bills that does anything about these pharma issues. Again, that is one reason alone to be concerned about these bills.  I was at that baseball game a few weeks ago and saw firsthand that incredible bipartisan spirit, and at the women's softball game, as well. At the men's baseball game, the players played together, and, at the end of the game, when one team won--the Democratic team--they took their trophy and they gave it to the Republican team, and they asked them to put it in Representative Scalise's office. That is what we need to see more of--not just two teams but one team. Certainly, on an issue as complex as healthcare, we just can't be playing in our separate ballparks. This is the time to come together. We have changes that we must make to the Affordable Care I said that the day it passed--that it was a beginning and not an end.  I always thought it was unfortunate that it was more of a Democratic bill than it was a bipartisan bill. So we have an opportunity now to fix that, to make fixes to the bill, and to work together. But this bill is not the answer--this bill that we were not allowed to take part in, where the doors were closed, not only to Democratic Senators but to Americans themselves.  So I hope, as we go forward, that our colleagues on the other side will work with us on a truly bipartisan bill that would make some of the changes we need to bring down healthcare costs, instead of moving forward with this bill.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-06-26-pt1-PgS3751-2.txt,1826,FANNIE AND FREDDIE OPEN RECORDS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,26.0,April

1666,topic-id,2757,"Mr.President, we are still dealing with some of the same issues we have dealt with before. It is interesting to me the number of people who have asked: Is Congress obsessed right now with all of the press reports and all of the things that are happening around the Presidency and everything else? I have said to them that is one of the things on our list, but that is not what we are talking about the most. We are working on issues like tax reform and healthcare issues and regulatory issues.  I just had three bills that went through the markup process just yesterday that deal with small business regulation and how we are going to be able to manage getting things back in order. We spent all day at lunch on Tuesday and we spent all day at lunch on Wednesday with our entire conference in a working lunch together and talked about healthcare policies. We are still working on trying to finish these issues that absolutely need to get done.  Healthcare is one of those issues that has been one of the prime conversations now for years, and we are in the final stretch of actually working through an actual repeal and replace of multiple sections of the Affordable Care Act that have caused the greatest amount of damage, but I still have people who will catch me and ask: Well, there are beneficial parts. What are you going to keep, and what is going to go, and why do we need to replace it?  I will typically smile at folks and say: Let me give you a quick recap as to why we need to replace this and what is really happening. It may be different in your State than it is in mine, but let me lay it out as to where we are and what has been said.  Remember, back in the earliest days, the Affordable Care Act being passed, it was all about premiums decreasing. In my State, premiums went up just last year--in 1 year--76 percent in the individual market. It was a 1-year increase of 76 percent. The year before, under the Affordable Care Act, they went up 35 percent in 1 year. Premiums not only have not stabilized, but they have accelerated out of control.  It was all about deductibles decreasing. Deductibles have also skyrocketed. It was about, if you like your doctor or if you like your healthcare, you can keep it. Doctors have moved to other hospitals. Doctors' offices have stopped being independent. They have to be able to work with other facilities so as to maintain the compliance requirements there. Most of the independent doctors in Oklahoma are no longer independent doctors. They now work under a corporate structure or they cannot survive.  As to this whole thing about competition on the open market, we used to have multiple companies in Oklahoma that provided insurance. We now have one. Every other company has left. There is one company left. There is no competition driving down prices. It is a monopoly. It is the same thing that is happening all over the country. Just this year, there are one-third of the counties in America that now only have one insurance provider. In my State, all 77 counties only have one insurance provider.  To tell you where things are really headed in this area of competition, United, which is one of the largest providers of healthcare, dropped out of all[[Page S3030]]of the exchanges nationwide--everything. It is doing none. In the past couple of days, Aetna announced it will no longer do competition in any State anywhere in the country. The number of companies even willing to try to live up to these regulations continues to drop off. That is what is really happening in our  If you want to know what that actually means to real families, let me give you a taste as to what comes into my office regularly because I have many people who call my office and say: Protect this. Protect this. Protect whatever it may be in the healthcare coverage. You have to make sure you guard it.  I will typically say to them: Let me introduce you to some other people who are also calling in and who are also writing in.  I will leave their names out, but let me give you just some of the situations:  A single mom, who has children and is from Norman, OK, contacted us and said her family has seen its premiums triple over the last 2 years. Currently, its premiums are $1,500 a month, with a deductible for the family of $24,000.  Another family contacted me who has a disabled child. The federally mandated health insurance under ObamaCare for 2016 was $895. For 2017, it is $1,553 a month for this family with a disabled child.  A husband and wife in Tulsa, OK, wrote me. Their current monthly expense for just insurance is $1,500--twice the amount of their house payment. They have a relative who is working three part-time jobs and cannot get a full-time job because, under ObamaCare, a full-time job also requires all of the benefits. No one is hiring in that full-time area because of the additional requirements for He is working three part-time jobs, and because he is working three part-time jobs and has no health insurance, he is also paying the penalty--fine--on his taxes for not having insurance. Not only can he not get a full-time job because of the ObamaCare requirements, but he is paying a penalty because of it as well.  A husband and wife from Newkirk, OK, wrote me. For their insurance alone, not including out-of-pocket medical expenses, the husband and wife will spend $21,965 this year on healthcare coverage.  Another family wrote me from Stillwater, Their healthcare coverage used to be 5 percent of their family income. Now their healthcare coverage is 22 percent of their family healthcare income.  I have another family who wrote to me, and it is very interesting. They are from Oklahoma City, and they wrote me and just gave me a breakout--a chart--that they had created. In 2015, their monthly premium had skyrocketed to $1,400. In 2016, it was $1,500. Now, in 2017, it is $2,042 a month. Let that soak in for a moment.  Then they made the statement that there are financially strapped families who will not go to the doctor due to this out-of-pocket expense. That is the additional deductible that is on top of their $2,000 premium. Individuals buying private insurance have no recourse because we have no other option that we are allowed to go to. There is only one insurance provider available to us. We need competition in this State in order to take away the financial burden on our families.  All they want are options. Yet right now what the Federal Government has told them is: We have a policy, and you have to buy that policy. If you do not buy the policy we pick for you, we will fine you on your taxes.  They are stuck. Thousands of Oklahomans are stuck.  Why is it such a big issue? Because of how it affects individuals. Why is it such a big issue? Because of what is still coming.  There is this false belief that the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented. That is not true. Many of the aspects of the most onerous parts of the Affordable Care Act did not go into implementation until after President Obama left office. Let me give you some examples of some things they had back-loaded that would not start until after he had left office:  There is the Cadillac tax. Every union family across the country will start to face much higher costs on their insurance because their insurance is considered too good under the Affordable Care So all of those great union families who have great healthcare insurance across the country are about to start facing additional taxes and fees for their insurance being better than their next-door neighbors' insurance as the Affordable Care Act tried to push down healthcare insurance to be the same for everyone.  There are increased penalties that are still coming because the full penalties have not been rolled out yet on all of the taxes. They have gone up a little bit each year, but they will accelerate now over the next several years.  There are increased taxes. The medical device tax, which has been sitting out there, has been delayed, but it now will go into full implementation. There is also a tax, which is a health insurer tax, that adds an additional tax to every insurance company that of course they will then pass on to every single premium.  There are still all of the costs that are associated with the expansion of Now, there has been a lot of conversation about the expansion of As many people know, this was an expansion of Medicaid for people from 100 percent of poverty to 138 percent of poverty. It is just in that small bracket that there had been an expansion of Initially, the Federal Government covered all of the costs of that expansion. Then, starting this year, the States pick up the additional cost. My State, like several others, chose not to do the expansion, and my State legislature and my Governor have taken a lot of heat for that. Yet what they said several years ago is, once the State has to pick up the additional bill, we will not be able to afford that expansion. We cannot do that.  Let me tell you what that would mean to my Because we did not expand, we do not have an additional cost this year, but let me give you a parallel. The State of Oregon is almost exactly the same size as the population in the State of It will now start taking on an additional $257 million a year in its State budget because of the expansion of Medicaid it took on.  Now, that may not seem like a big deal to some people in this Chamber, but in my State right now, our State legislature and our Governor are struggling to balance a budget, and we are going through all kinds of issues because, right now, our State is about $800 million behind budget, and this is after being $800 million behind budget last year. If the people in my State will imagine what is going on right now in the State capitol, if we had an additional $257 million added to that hole, then that is what it would mean for our  There are real effects that are out there, and I understand healthcare is extremely personal. That is why it has always been something that has been decided by individual families, not by the Federal Government and, in my State, by someone 1,000 miles away who is trying to make healthcare decisions for them.  What we are really trying to do with this is to deal with the issues I just laid out. This is not about partisan politics. This is about people and families who have been hurt by what is happening in the Affordable Care Act--by someone 1,000 miles away who is trying to tell them what policies they can and cannot buy, by the skyrocketing costs, by the actual effect that has happened. While I have some people who say that is not real, I could line up the families in my State who used to have coverage but who no longer have coverage because they cannot afford it anymore.  Then there are the simplistic answers to, Why don't we just cover everybody in the country? Why don't we just do a single-payer system? People do not understand. They know how bad it has become now and how hard it has become now. You would accelerate that multifold if you were to just slip into a single-payer system.  What do we need to do? Let me give you a couple of quick thoughts. We are going to need transition time. Whatever you hear about all of the conversation we have about the Affordable Care Act or replacing the Affordable Care Act, please know that all of the conversations for us begin with how do we do a good transition from where we are now to where we need to be.  I have folks who say: Well, next week, this ends. Well, next year, this suddenly goes away.[[Page S3031]]  No, there will have to be a transition process, and it will be over several years.  We are also still looking at some of the most basic elements. For instance, I have had folks say: I want to be able to keep my kids on my insurance until 26. That has been assumed, quite frankly, by the House and by the Senate, but the House bill that has been passed already keeps that. There has been a lot of conversation about preexisting conditions. Most of the conversation we have had as Senators, behind closed doors, is about taking care of people with preexisting conditions.  Those are very real issues.  We understand the dynamic of what happens back and forth with insurance companies and families and the struggles families have, whether they are cancer patients, diabetic, have rare blood diseases or Alzheimer's. There are so many struggles that are out there. We understand that. That is in our conversation as well. Yet we have to be able to find practical ways to start leveling out the cost of insurance. We cannot survive with rates skyrocketing like they are, and people need to know the safety net is going to actually be there.  We have to resolve these issues. We have to work for the benefit of our States, which cannot afford these overwhelming cost increases. We have to work for the benefit of families who are facing the issue and, quite frankly, for the Federal taxpayer as well.  While my State struggles with an $800 million hole that it is facing right in the budget, by the end of our session, it will have had that resolved. It is constitutionally required to have that resolved. The Federal Government is facing a $20 trillion budget hole right now--$20 trillion. For all the folks who say: Just add more to it, it will be fine, may I remind you, there is a day all of that has to be paid. We have to be able to be responsible with our Federal budget at the same time we are helping our States to be able to manage theirs and at the same time we are helping our families to do the same.  No, this is not simple, but it has to be done. We have to be able to find a way to restore it. This is not about returning healthcare back to where we were years ago. That, quite frankly, is gone. As I mentioned before, all of those private doctors that used to function in my State, they don't function in my State anymore. They are all under corporate structures. The insurance companies have left or have merged. Hospitals in my State have merged because they couldn't survive the last few years of Even if we wanted to go back to how healthcare was--and we don't--but even if we wanted to, we can't because there has been so much change in the last few years. We have to be able to actually fix where we are.  So I would encourage continued communication. Lots of folks have contacted my office on every side of this issue. Keep doing that. Lots of folks in this Chamber have had dialogue, and though it looks like a partisan exercise, it is actually a pretty open conversation among our conference to try to figure out how we are going to actually help families, help our States, help our Federal budget, and help us to be sustainable on these critical issues.  I have gotten lots of other letters I can bring. There are lots of other stories out there. I think we know enough now to be able to know this is something that needs to be done. So while the Nation is distracted, we cannot be distracted. Let's finish the healthcare conversation. Lots of families are counting on us.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

So I thank her for her leadership.  The constant stream of allegations and scandals springing from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is really quite shocking. I have to admit that, after watching President Trump fire the FBI Director who was investigating him, I thought things could not get any worse. But just days later, President Trump blundered into sharing classified intelligence with Russian officials.

If The New York Times report is true, President Trump's attempts to influence a Federal probe can only be described in one way, and that is obstruction of justice. And, yes, we all know obstruction of justice is an impeachable offense.  Right now, one thing, though, is crystal clear: The President's abuse of power has plunged this Nation into a full-blown constitutional crisis. This crisis goes far beyond party interests. Every American, Democrat or Republican, should be concerned by these allegations.  President Trump's actions have threatened national security, the rule of law, and the independence of our Nation's justice system. His actions dishonor the Office of the Presidency and place this Nation and our allies in danger.  The reports of last week underscore the need to establish a bipartisan, independent commission to get to the bottom of Russian interference in our elections once and for all. It is vitally important that Director Mueller--and I am very pleased that the Department of Justice appointed him; this is one step in the right direction--be given the resources and the autonomy to conduct an investigation.  Unfortunately, President Trump said that this investigation is a witch hunt. Nothing could be further from the truth. The American people deserve to know the facts about possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Our democracy must be defended at all costs.  I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for giving us a chance to speak tonight about this very dangerous moment that we are in, about Presidential abuse, and, really, about the preservation of our democracy. The Congressional Progressive Caucus continues to lead on so many issues that are important to this country and to the world.

1821,topic-id,1565,"Mr.President, I would like to thank my friend and colleague Senator Hirono for her words and her willingness to share how this bill could impact the millions of Americans with preexisting conditions. I, along with everyone else in this Chamber, wish her the best and a speedy recovery so she can continue to fight for the people of Hawaii and the people of the United  After weeks of secret meetings, Senate Republicans released their healthcare legislation last week. In many ways, it is even worse than expected. It is no wonder that the Senate Republicans kept this legislative malpractice hidden behind closed doors. For working families and the elderly, for the disabled and for those suffering from opioid addiction, this legislation is a death sentence. This bill takes a machete to It abandons people with preexisting conditions. It punishes Grandma and Grandpa, who live in a nursing home, and 25,000 seniors in Massachusetts' nursing homes who are on  It causes the single greatest rollback of civil rights for people with disabilities in a generation, by taking away the funding for those with disabilities. It creates an age tax for those over the age of 50. It shreds a critical healthcare program for the disabled, working families, and children just to bestow billions in tax breaks for the wealthiest in our country.  This is an amazing number. The richest 400 billionaires in the United States will get a tax break of more than $33 billion, which is roughly equivalent to the cuts from ending Medicaid expansion in four That is more than 700,000 people in just those four States who could be kicked off of their health insurance coverage to benefit just 400 billionaires in America who do not have to worry about their healthcare or their family's welfare. But for those who are going to lose the coverage--people with cancer, people with Alzheimer's, people who need opioid addiction treatment, people with diabetes--they will have their healthcare coverage slashed so that 400 billionaires can get a tax break, which they don't need and they don't deserve. That is at the heart of this Republican healthcare bill. It is what it is all about. This legislation is of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich.  It is a ``wealth care'' bill for the upper 1 percent in our country, and it says to everyone else: Your healthcare is going to suffer in order to take care of that 1 percent with their tax breaks. It is a more than $500 billion tax break to corporations and individuals making $200,000 or more. It is no wonder that President Trump has kept his tax returns secret, because he knew he was about to get a massive tax break through this legislation from slashing healthcare for people with cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, heart disease, and substance use disorders. This selfish Senate Republican legislation will increase premiums and out-of-pocket costs, while decreasing the quality of health insurance coverage for most  This bill would result in many Americans--especially those over the age of 50--paying thousands more in premiums for skimpier health plans. It will put insurance companies back in charge of our healthcare by allowing them to waive coverage of the essential health benefits like emergency care, prescription drugs, maternity care, or mental health treatment.  That means that someone with a preexisting condition, like a cancer survivor or a child with asthma, might have insurance but not actually be covered for the treatment they need, because under this bill, the anxiety of suffering from an illness or the constant fear of relapse will once again be exacerbated by financial insecurity.  Yet some of the most damaging provisions of this legislation are the brutal cuts to Medicaid, which already serves more than 70 million Americans, including, very importantly, two-thirds of all seniors in nursing homes in America, who are on Let me say that again: Two-thirds of all seniors in America are on Half of all seniors over the age of 85 have Alzheimer's, and 15 million baby boomers are going to have Alzheimer's. They are going to need some help. People have a hard time paying $60,000, $80,000, $100,000 a year for a nursing home bed. What are the Republicans planning on doing over the next 15 years? Slashing that funding in Medicaid for seniors in our country who will need that help just to stay in a nursing home, or else they are going to have to go home to their families who will be responsible for providing the care for them.  The Senate Republicans doubled down and opted for even steeper cuts in their bill than in the House version. In[[Page S3755]]3 years, the Senate bill will start the process of kicking millions off of their Medicaid coverage by ending Medicaid expansion in States around the country. It will mean 22 million Americans are kicked off of coverage.  Then, as if that wasn't enough, starting in 2025, the plan will institute even more drastic Medicaid cuts that every year become a deeper cut than the year before, and it will literally mean death by a billion cuts for millions of Americans who will lose their healthcare coverage, especially those suffering from substance use disorders. Medicaid covers about one-third of Americans with an opioid use disorder and pays for nearly half of the medication-assisted treatments in Taking away this treatment would be a death sentence for thousands of  A vision without funding is a hallucination. The Republicans are saying: We will find the will to take care of these people with opioid treatments. Well, you can't will your way to dealing with an opioid crisis. It is a disease. You need funding. You need treatment. And right now, there are millions of Americans who don't have the treatment they need. Medicaid is the way in which it will be provided, but the Republicans are just going to slash it, and the consequences are going to be catastrophic.  Now, here is what the Republicans are saying: To make up for the cuts to Medicaid, the Senate Republican healthcare legislation creates an opioid fund of $2 billion for 2018. Compare that to the $91 billion in funding for opioid use disorder treatment that would be provided by the Affordable Care Act over the next 10 years. A $2 billion opioid fund is pocket change for a crisis that took 2,000 lives just last year in Massachusetts and 33,000 lives across the country. And if people were dying from opioid addiction at the rate they are dying in Massachusetts, that would be a 100,000 people a year--two Vietnam wars a year dying from opioid addiction. They are going to slash the funding for treatment for these families. It will be a death sentence for these individuals if they do not have access to the funding.  So the formula of this bill is simple: First, increase the cost of care, so working families pay more. Second, decrease the quality of care for seniors and the sick. Finally, hand over the hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country--billions in tax breaks to people who don't need them, who don't deserve them, paid for by people who can't afford it. It is healthcare heartlessness.  To add insult to injury, it will devastate the budgets of already strapped States, which may be forced to raise taxes or cut other benefits, such as education or housing assistance, to make up for the billions of dollars States will lose because of this bill.  It is cruel. It is inhumane. It is immoral. It is just plain wrong to cut healthcare benefits for those who need them to give tax breaks to those who do not need them. That is the Republican plan.  The Republican leadership is trying to catch a political unicorn with this bill--to make moderate Republicans happy while satisfying the most conservative elements of the Republican But there is no treatment for It is dangerous for healthcare, and there is no reviving Medicaid if this bill passes.  This Republican proposal has never been about policy. It isn't about covering more people or decreasing costs of healthcare or making it more patient-centered. The Republican proposal has always been about slashing healthcare for ordinary Americans to give a massive tax break to the wealthy in our country. That is the Republican policy agenda, not patient-centered care, because this will hand back over the power to insurance companies in our country, not to patients.  If Republicans were really concerned about reducing the deficit, then every single dollar in this bill would go to reducing the deficit--the crocodile tears which they shed about the deficit. No, ladies and gentlemen, they are shoving this money straight to the biggest number of billionaire beneficiaries than any tax bill in our country's history. They are, in fact, the party of the wealthy. They are the party trying to make sure that those who are in charge of funding the Republican Party now receive their pay back in the form of tax cuts at the expense of the healthcare of the ordinary people in our country. That is selfish, that is unconscionable, and that is why the Democrats are going to fight this every step of the way this week in order to protect healthcare for every  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1819,topic-id,1253,"Mr.President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Hawaii tonight. They are certainly very relevant to the issue of healthcare here in America because each of us hopes that if a loved one gets ill, they will have the peace of mind that they know they will be able to get the healthcare they need and they will not go bankrupt in the process. Yet here we are tonight debating a bill titled ``Better Care Act.''  Better Care, has ever there been a bill in the history of the United States of America so more perversely named than this Better Care Act which strips care from 22 million Americans?  I was very struck by one equation of this bill; that is, that it provides to the richest 400 Americans $33 billion over a 10-year period. That is enough to pay for healthcare under Medicaid for 700,000 individuals--700,000 individuals. It rips the healthcare away from them to give $33 billion to the richest 400 families. That is obscene. That is certainly not better care.  It is hard for me to imagine that a single Member of this body would vote to proceed to this bill, but here we are. Until we get agreement that we are not going to proceed, we have to continue to carry on this fight.  We know that 15 million people, CBO estimates, will lose healthcare in the next 12 months. That is even worse than the House bill. Last week, I came to this floor to call the Senate draft mean and meaner. The House bill was mean. The Senate's is meaner. Now we have the CBO estimate that says, yes, it is worse. One million more people would lose healthcare in a short period of time.  Furthermore, the rate at which standard Medicaid is compressed--Medicaid, as it existed before ObamaCare, that rate has increased to further diminish healthcare, having nothing to do with ObamaCare, just to add to the cruelty of this bill. So millions lose, but we deliver billions of dollars to the richest  In my home State of Oregon, just the elimination of the expansion of Medicaid, the Oregon health plan--just that would eliminate 400,000 Oregonians off healthcare.  Imagine those individuals holding hands, 400,000 Oregonians, stretching from the Pacific Ocean to the State of Anyone who has driven across Oregon would realize it is 400 miles across If you are driving it, it is 7 hours of driving. For 7 hours, at 50 miles an hour, 60 miles an hour, you are passing a stream of people who would lose their healthcare just from the elimination of the expansion of  My colleagues across the aisle have crafted this so as to put it beyond the next Presidential election, beyond the 2018 election and beyond the 2020 election. Why? They are so terrified of the impact of this on the election they decided to postpone it until after 2018 and 2020, as if that makes it acceptable to rip healthcare from millions of people. That type of cynical, cynical act, purely political, is not going to be viewed well by the American public.  If you are so ashamed of this bill, if someone is so ashamed that they want to postpone the effects beyond the next Presidential election 3\1/2\ years from now, then maybe you should be so ashamed as not to vote to move to the bill here in the short term.  One of our colleagues across the aisle noted today: I can't imagine--not quite the exact word-for-word, but it is close. I can't imagine that anyone in America would have a chance to review this bill and truly understand it in time to proceed to it this week, including myself.  Well, that is certainly true. Has there ever been a case where a bill profoundly affecting so many has not had the benefit of committee deliberation here in the Senate? Are we a legislative body or are we a dictatorship where everything is done behind closed doors[[Page S3752]]and then rammed through? That is not the American way, and that is not the constitutional vision for how the Senate should work. There is supposed to be time to consult healthcare experts and time to go home to consult our constituents and find out how they feel.  If one is so terrified of this bill that you are afraid of your constituents, then you shouldn't vote to proceed to the bill. If one is so terrified you don't want to consult the experts, you shouldn't proceed to this bill. If you are so terrified that the reaction from the public will be so strong that it will put you in an awkward spot, then you shouldn't proceed to this bill--because you have the responsibility to consult with your folks back home, a responsibility to consult with healthcare experts, to understand every nuance of this bill.  One of those facts is going to have a devastating impact on those who would go to nursing homes. Folks who are under Medicaid and in a nursing home have given up their entire income and assets before they can get Medicaid support.  I was in Klamath Falls the weekend before this last weekend, went to a nursing home, and they said: Senator, almost 100 percent of the folks here on long-term care are paid for by I thought they were going to say 60 percent or two-thirds, because that is the national statistic. No, in rural Oregon, in Klamath Falls, almost 100 percent.  Then we had the CEO of the Oregon Health Association reach out and address this issue of how it is going to affect seniors. Here are his exact words:       I was on a call early today looking at some projections of      how hard Oregon and Medicaid-funded long-term care service      would be hit. If this bill passes, it literally could force      the closure of the majority of nursing facilities in Oregon      by 2025.  One thing I can't get out of my mind. At another nursing home I went to is a woman named I explained I was coming by to talk to people because I wanted to understand better the impact of this bill on long-term care.  She said: Senator, I am paid for by If Medicaid disappears, I am on the street, and that is a problem because I can't walk.  That is exactly what Deborah said. And, of course, it is a problem, not only because she can't walk but because she needs extensive care, which is why she is in long-term care to begin with.  The anxiety was palpable among the nursing home residents, among the long-term care residents, because they have no backup plan, because they had to spend down their assets before they qualified for Don't think of this just as ripping healthcare away from millions of working families, millions of struggling families, millions of children, but also from our seniors who are in long-term care, who need extensive care, and who have given up their assets in order to qualify for They used those assets to pay for it as long as they could, and now they are on We are prepared to take those folks, many of them in wheelchairs--like Deborah, unable to walk--and throw them into the street and say: too bad.

1658,topic-id,2337,"Mr.President, I am on the floor to talk about the status of America's healthcare system. As we speak though, the country is obsessed with the question of the firing of FBI Director Comey and the appointment last night of a special counsel who is going to seek to get to the bottom of this question as to whether there was coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian Government and their attempts to influence an American election.  There have been secret meetings happening in the Senate among Republicans--reportedly 13 Republicans, to be specific--attempting to craft a new version of legislation that passed the House of Representatives, now, I guess, 2 weeks ago, that would rob healthcare from 24 million According to the Congressional Budget Office, it would drive up costs for everyone immediately by about 15 percent to 20 percent and jeopardize the protections that are built into the law for people with preexisting conditions.  There is no CBO score on the latest House proposal because Republicans decided to ram the bill through without the ability of anyone to read the legislation. No one read that bill. Let's be honest. It was filed hours before it was voted on, and no one knows the cost of that bill because they didn't wait for a CBO score.  It is simply unbelievable that the House of Representatives decided to reorder one-fifth of the American economy without reading the proposal or without understanding its cost, but Republicans in the Senate are attempting to pass their own version of a repeal-and-replace bill. We await the results of these secret partisan meetings.  I think Democrats have been pretty clear that we would like to be in this conversation. We want to preserve what works in the Affordable Care Act, and there is a lot that works. A new report out just a couple of weeks ago shows an astonishing decrease in the number of people who face personal bankruptcy in this country. Why? Because half of personal bankruptcies in the United States of America, prior to the Affordable Care Act being passed, were due to medical debt. So the reason that less people than ever before are having to declare personal bankruptcy is because medical bills don't bankrupt them anymore because of the Affordable Care Let me guarantee you, that number will spike back up if anything approximating the House bill passes.  We think there are good things in the Affordable Care Our constituents agree. Polling now routinely tells you the majority of Americans want to keep the Affordable Care Act, not replace it, but we want to be part of a conversation in which we talk about keeping the things that work and addressing the parts of the healthcare system that don't work. Costs are still way too high. We would like more competition on these exchanges. So let's have a conversation about that.  As of today, Democrats are being shut out of the process. If you are represented by Democrats in the U.Senate, you have no voice in this process because Republicans have chosen to do it just amongst their own party. I think that is a shame. I understand in the end, Democrats passed a product in 2010 with Democratic votes, but anybody who was here remembers that there was a long process by which President Obama and Democrats in Congress tried to work with Republicans and brought the bill through the committee process. The HELP Committee and the Finance Committee had exhaustive meetings, hearings, and markups. In the end in the HELP Committee, upon which I sit today, there[[Page S3026]]were over 100 Republican amendments that were accepted and included in the piece of legislation that eventually passed on the floor of the  As far as we know, this secret process happening behind closed doors will include no Democrats now and will not go through a committee process. If they ever come up with something that can come up with 50 votes, it will be rushed to the Senate floor. That is outrageous. We want to be part of this process.  I am on the floor not to talk about what will happen if a bill robbing healthcare from millions of Americans, jeopardizing protections for people with preexisting conditions, comes to the floor of the Senate, I want to talk about what is happening right now because President Trump made it very clear, just a few days after he was sworn in, that his desire was to kill the aspects of the American healthcare system that are affected by the Affordable Care By the way, that is almost the entirety of the American healthcare system because that bill did--in addition to extending coverage to 20 million Americans--grant protections from insurance abuse to hundreds of millions more.  A January 20 Executive order issued by the President said that ``it is the policy of my Administration to seek the prompt repeal'' of the law. It said:       To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Secretary of      HHS and the heads of all other executive departments . . .      shall exercise all authority available to them to waive,      defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of      any provision or requirement in the Act that would impose a      fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or      regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare      providers.  President Trump made it clear that his motive from the start was to destroy the Affordable Care My colleagues, he has consistently kept up that attack. I am often bringing President Trump's tweets to the floor because, well, they continue to exist on social media. It is nice to be reminded of the fact that, over the course of the first 100 days in office, President Trump has been routinely--routinely--attacking the American health care system, saying: ObamaCare will fall of its own weight; be careful--i.e., if you are thinking of signing up, be careful--discouraging people from signing up for these exchanges.  Once again, ObamaCare is dead, says the President of the United States, despite the fact that 19 million people rely on the exchanges for their healthcare coverage. Here is another one: ObamaCare will explode. Do not worry; he has it taken care of, he says. Finally, ObamaCare is in a death spiral.  So these are the routine, almost daily attacks, rhetorically, that this administration has waged against the Affordable Care He has commanded his agencies to pick it apart in any way that they can. So, to the extent there is any diminution in the health of these exchanges, to the extent that insurers are thinking about not participating or are pushing up their rates, there is only one reason for it. It is the active sabotage campaign that the Trump administration is engaged in to try to destroy the Affordable Care  This is purposeful. This is intentional. This is planned. That Executive order, unlike some other Executive orders, was not just an exercise in political and public relations, because the next month, in February, the IRS announced that it would not reject tax forms from people who failed to answer the question of whether they had health insurance. So the IRS took a definitive step to undermine the Affordable Care Act by telling consumers they were not going to enforce the individual mandate.  Now, here is a news flash: Republicans think the individual mandate is a good idea. After attacking it for the last 6 years, the House bill they passed includes an individual mandate. It does. It is in a slightly different place. Instead of the penalty applying when you lose healthcare, in the House, all they did was just shift the penalty to when you sign up for healthcare again. All they did was move the mandate from when you lose healthcare to when you repurchase healthcare. But it is still there.  The administration is seeking to undermine the existing mandate. Insurance companies have noticed. Senator McConnell came to the floor a week or so ago to take note of the pretty serious premium increases that were requested in Maryland, in part, by Blue Cross Blue But the head of Blue Cross Blue Shield in Maryland was very clear about why they were increasing rates.  He said the uncertainty around the individual mandate plays a significant role in the company's rate filing because failure to enforce the mandate makes it far more likely that healthier, younger individuals will drop coverage and drive up the costs for everyone else.  Insurance companies are noticing that the administration is picking apart the protections that can keep rates down in the exchanges and, thus, they are filing higher rates. But with less people in the exchanges than anticipated, insurance companies are also rethinking participation. This is intentional as well. Shortly after taking office, the HHS Secretary pulled the advertising for the Affordable Care Act in the last week of open enrollment. We know exactly what happened here because we have the data on who was signing up before Trump took office and after Trump took office.  Before Trump took office, open enrollment was exceeding open enrollment for the prior year. After that decision was made to pull funding for advertising, open enrollment cratered. The former marketing chief for healthcare.gov estimates that 480,000 people did not sign up for coverage in the last week because the ads were pulled and because the President of the United States was out their actively telling people that they should ``be careful'' before signing up for the exchanges because he was going to kill it.  So almost half a million Americans did not sign up for these exchanges. A half million Americans don't have health care today, potentially, because the Trump administration stopped advertising the exchanges and because the President of the United States told people, essentially, not to sign up.  Finally, let me talk about what is happening right now with respect to something called cost-sharing reduction payments. A big part of the Affordable Care Act--and really the foundation of the Affordable Care Act--is subsidies that are given to individuals, often passed straight through to insurance companies, in order to help folks who are lower income buy insurance.  Guess what. Republicans think this is a good idea too. I know that because we stole the idea from This was initially a Heritage Foundation plan that was adopted by Mitt Romney in It was the Republican alternative to the Clinton healthcare bill in 1993. So this idea of individuals getting subsidies is a Republican idea that Democrats stole.  Republicans included it in the House bill. The subsidies are lower, but they are still there. The subsidies come in two forms. One, there is a tax credit to individuals based upon their income, and, two, for lower income individuals there is a payment that goes to the insurance companies that mitigates the amount of money that you have to pay out of pocket--just two different kinds of subsidies.  These subsidies are relied upon by the insurance companies to continue to offer these products. The Trump administration is paying the subsidies but is trickling them out 1 month at a time, constantly making public pronouncements that question whether they will continue to make those payments.  Here is what OMB Director Mick Mulvaney told reporters. He said the administration could pull the plug on subsidies at any time. He said: We haven't made any decisions. The payments are due, I believe, the 20th or the 21st of every single month. We have not made any decisions at all on whether we will pay in  Think about if you are an insurance company executive deciding, A, whether to put a plan on an exchange or, B, if you put a plan on an exchange, how much to charge, and the White House is telling you: You may not get the subsidies that are called for under the law, and we may give you no warning in pulling those subsidies. We are going to pay them for We might not pay them for Maybe we will pay them for July and Maybe we will pull them for  How would you make a decision on how much to charge consumers? Why[[Page S3027]]would you enter into a contract with a State or Federal-based exchange? So whether it is the attack on the individual mandate, whether it is the decision to pull advertising, or whether it is the games being played with cost-sharing reduction payments, there is a coordinated effort inside the White House today to destroy the American healthcare system to the extent that much of the system has the Affordable Care Act at its foundation.  President Trump was pretty clear about this the day of the failure of the first healthcare bill in the House of He essentially telegraphed that he was going to try to undermine the Affordable Care Act as punishment to Democrats, and that if he hurt enough people, eventually Democrats would come to the table and negotiate with him. Well, I have a message for the President of the United States: That is not how it is going to work. You are not going to blackmail Democrats by hurting our constituents by undermining the Affordable Care  We want to be part of this discussion about improving the healthcare system. We do. We want to work with It will be a much smaller and likely less revolutionary bill than Republicans are considering today, but it will have both party's fingerprints on it. We are not going to be part of a bill that strips healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans, and we cannot support this administration while it seeks to undermine the Affordable Care Act on a daily basis.  If these exchanges fail--I don't think they will, but if the exchanges fail--or if rates go up, there is only one place to put the blame--on an administration that is actively, regularly, and on a daily basis trying to sabotage the Affordable Care  I yield the floor.

1822,topic-id,5677,"Mr.President, today's Congressional Budget Office analysis of the Trump-McConnell healthcare bill gives us 22 million reasons why this legislation should not see the light of day. What CBO tells us in truth is that this bill really has nothing to do with healthcare; rather, it is an enormous transfer of wealth from the sick, the elderly, the children, the disabled, and the poor into the pockets of the wealthiest people in this country.  According to CBO--and that report came out just a few hours ago--this bill would throw 22 million Americans off of health insurance, cut Medicaid by over $770 billion, defund Planned Parenthood, and substantially increase premiums for older Under this bill, a 64-year-old with an income of $56,000 could see his or her premiums increase from $4,400 under current law to $16,000--an increase of nearly 850 percent. How are older workers in this country going to deal with an 850-percent increase in their premiums? Meanwhile, the Trump-McConnell bill would provide a $231 billion tax break to the top 2 percent and hundreds of billions more in tax breaks to the big drug companies and insurance companies that are ripping off the American people every day.  At a time when the middle class of this country continues to shrink and when families all across America are struggling to make ends meet, to put food on the table, to pay their rent, to save a few bucks for retirement, we cannot take from working-class families and we cannot take from the sick and the elderly and the children in order to give even more to the very wealthiest people in this country--people who are at this moment doing phenomenally well.  Mr.President, this, in fact, is a barbaric and immoral piece of legislation. But let's be very clear. It is not just Bernie Sanders who opposes this bill. It is not just every Member in the Democratic caucus who opposes this bill. It is not just that the overwhelming majority of the American people oppose this legislation. According to a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 16 percent of the American people thought this bill was a good idea. This bill is opposed by virtually every major healthcare organization in this country--the people on the frontlines, the people who today, yesterday, and tomorrow are dealing with healthcare issues, dealing with the sick, working in hospitals, working in community health centers. Almost without exception, every major healthcare organization in this country opposes this bill.  Maybe my Republican friends might want to get beyond the politics, get beyond Republicans and Democrats, and ask the people who really know about healthcare in America and ask yourself, how does it happen that virtually every major healthcare organization in this country opposes this legislation?  The AARP opposes this legislation--the largest senior group in America, which knows what high premiums for healthcare will do to their membership. The American Hospital Association knows a little bit about hospitals and what will happen to rural hospitals if this legislation is passed. The American Medical Association is a conservative organization. This is the doctors organization all over this country. This is not any progressive radical group; these are our doctors, the doctors we go to. They oppose this legislation because they know what will happen if there are massive cuts to Medicaid, if 22 million people are thrown off of health insurance. The American Academy of Family Physicians knows what this legislation will mean to the children of our country. The American Psychiatric Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, the Catholic Health Association, the American Lung Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National MS Society, the American Nurses Association--every one of these[[Page S3756]]organizations opposes the Republican legislation; not Bernie Sanders but every major healthcare organization says do not go forward with this disastrous bill.  This is what the AARP, the largest senior group in America, said recently:       This new Senate bill was crafted in secrecy behind closed      doors without a single hearing or open debate--and it shows.      The Senate bill would hit millions of Americans with higher      costs and result in less coverage for them.       AARP is adamantly opposed to the Age Tax, which would allow      insurance companies to charge older Americans five times more      for coverage than every one else while reducing tax credits      that help make insurance more affordable.  I ask all of my Republican friends to think for a moment about the implications of this bill and what it will mean to your constituents when they lose the healthcare they currently have. Put yourself in their place. Today you have health insurance, but tomorrow, next year, you might not. What does that mean? Think about it.  What does it mean if you are an individual today--and, sadly, there are too many of them. If you are a person today suffering with cancer and you are fighting for your life--maybe you are on radiation treatment. Maybe you are on chemotherapy. You are scared to death. You don't have a lot of money. You have cancer. You are struggling. And now you are reading in the papers that this Republican bill may take your health insurance away from you? How do you think they feel? I suspect scared to death. It is the same with people who have heart disease, who have asthma, who have diabetes or any other life-threatening illness. What happens to those millions of people when they cannot afford to go to the doctor when they are sick, cannot afford to buy the medicine they desperately need?  Mr.President, I know this is a sensitive issue, but I am going to raise it, and that is that the horrible and unspeakable truth is that if this legislation were to pass, and I am going to do everything I can to see that it doesn't, but if it were to pass, many thousands of our fellow Americans every single year will die, and many more will suffer and become much sicker than they should. That is not, again, Bernie Sanders talking; that is exactly what a number of studies have shown. Study after study, including one from the American Journal of Public Health to the New England Journal of Medicine, to the Harvard School of Public Health have told us. Again, this is not Bernie Sanders engaging in a rhetorical debate; this is what scientists and doctors who have studied the issue are telling us.  In fact, just this afternoon, a few hours ago, the Annals of Internal Medicine, a prestigious medical journal, published an article from researchers at the City University of New York School of Urban Public Health at Hunter College and Harvard Medical School entitled: ``The Relationship of Health Insurance and Mortality: Is Lack of Insurance Deadly?'' That is the title of the article appearing today.  According to a summary of this article, ``Insurance decreases the odds of dying among adults by at least 3 percent and as much as 29 percent and `being uninsured substantially raises the risk of dying.' ''  The coauthor of this article, David Himmelstein, commented:       According to the CBO, the Senate Republicans' plan would      strip coverage from 22 million The best estimate      based on scientific studies is that about 29,000 Americans      would die each year as a result.  I know no Republican wants to see anybody die--none of us do--but that is the reality we are dealing with, and you cannot ignore it. If somebody has cancer, if somebody has heart disease and you take away their health insurance, I don't need studies from Harvard University to tell me and to tell you what you know to be the case. This is the United States of America, and we can do better than that.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the article that appeared today in the ``Annals of Internal Medicine'' be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From Annals of Internal Medicine, June 27, 2017]    The Relationship of Health Insurance and Mortality: Is Lack of                            Insurance Deadly?    (By Steffie Woolhandler, MD, MPH, and David Himmelstein, MD)       (About 28 million Americans are currently uninsured, and      millions more could lose coverage under policy reforms      proposed in At the same time, a growing number of      policy leaders have called for going beyond the Affordable      Care Act to a single-payer national health insurance system      that would cover every These policy debates lend      particular salience to studies evaluating the health effects      of insurance coverage. In 2002, an Institute of Medicine      review concluded that lack of insurance increases mortality,      but several relevant studies have appeared since that time.      This article summarizes current evidence concerning the      relationship of insurance and mortality. The evidence      strengthens confidence in the Institute of Medicine's      conclusion that health insurance saves lives: The odds of      dying among the insured relative to the uninsured is 0.71 to      0.97.)       This article was published at Annals.org on 27 June 2017.       At present, about 28 million Americans are uninsured.      Repeal of the Affordable Care Act would probably increase      this number, while enactment of proposed single-payer      legislation would reduce it. The public spotlight on how      policy changes affect the number of uninsured reflects a      widespread assumption that insurance improves health.       A landmark 2002 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on the      effects of insurance coverage on the health status of      nonelderly adults buttressed this assumption. The IOM      committee responsible for the report found consistent      evidence from 130 (mostly observational) studies that ``the      uninsured have poorer health and shortened lives'' and that      gaining coverage would decrease their all-cause mortality.       The IOM committee also reviewed evidence on the effects of      health insurance in specific circumstances and medical      conditions. It concluded that uninsured patients, even when      acutely ill or seriously injured, cannot always obtain needed      care and that coverage improves the uptake of essential      preventive services and chronic disease management. The      report found that uninsured patients with cancer presented      with more advanced disease and experienced worse outcomes,      including mortality; that uninsured patients with diabetes,      cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal disease, HIV      infection, and mental illness (the five other conditions      reviewed in depth) had worse outcomes than did insured      patients; and that uninsured inpatients received less and      worse-quality care and had higher mortality both during their      hospital stays and after discharge.       At the time of the IOM report, only one adequately      controlled observational study had examined the effect of      coverage on all-cause mortality. In this review, we summarize      key evidence on this issue (Table 1), focusing on studies      that have appeared since the IOM report and other previous      reviews. Although not reviewed in detail here, more recent      studies generally support the earlier reviews' conclusions      that insurance coverage improves mortality in several      specific conditions (such as trauma and breast cancer),      augments the use of recommended care, and improves several      measures of health status.                                METHODS       We searched PubMed and Google Scholar on May 19, 2017, for      English-language articles by using the following terms:      ``[(uninsured) or (health insurance) or (un-insurance) or      (insurance)] and [(mortality) or (life expectancy) or (death      rates)].'' After identifying relevant articles, we searched      their bibliographies and used Google Scholar's ``cited by''      feature to identify additional relevant articles. We limited      our scope to articles reporting data on the United States,      quasi-experimental studies of insurance expansions in other      wealthy nations, and recent cross-national studies. We      contacted the authors of 4 studies to clarify their published      reports on mortality outcomes.       We excluded most observational studies that compared      uninsured persons with those insured by Medicaid, Medicare,      or the Department of Veterans Affairs because preexisting      disability or illness can make an individual eligible for      these programs. Hence, relative to those who are uninsured,      publicly insured Americans have, on average, worse baseline      health, thereby confounding comparisons. Conversely,      comparisons of the uninsured to persons with private      insurance (which is often obtained through employment) may be      confounded by a ``healthy worker'' effect: that is, that      persons may lose coverage because they are ill and cannot      maintain employment. Nonetheless, most analysts of the      relationship between uninsurance and mortality have viewed      the privately insured as the best available comparator, with      statistical controls for employment, income, health status,      and other potential confounders.       Finally, we focus primarily on nonelderly adults because      most studies have been limited to this group, and this group      is likely to experience large gains or losses of coverage      from health reforms. Since the advent of Medicare in 1966,      almost all elderly Americans have been covered, precluding      studies of uninsured seniors. Although Medicare's      implementation may not have accelerated the secular decline      in seniors' mortality, the relevance of this experience,      which predates many modern-day therapies, is unclear.       Children have also been excluded from most recent analyses      of the relationship of[[Page S3757]]     insurance to mortality. Deaths in this population beyond the      neonatal period are so rare that studies would need to      evaluate a huge number of uninsured children to reach firm      conclusions, and high coverage rates make assembling such a      cohort difficult. The few studies addressing the effect of      insurance on child survival have found that coverage lowers      mortality and few policy leaders contest the importance of      covering children.                     RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS       Only one well-conducted randomized, controlled trial      (RCT)--the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE)--has      assessed the effect of uninsurance on health outcomes. In      2008, the state of Oregon opened a limited number of Medicaid      slots to poor, able-bodied, uninsured adults aged 19 to 64      years. The state held a lottery among persons on a Medicaid      waiting list, with winners allowed to apply for a slot. The      OHIE researchers took advantage of this natural experiment to      assess the effect of winning the lottery on the 74,922      lottery participants.       Many lottery winners did not enroll in Medicaid, and 14.1%      of lottery losers obtained Medicaid through other routes      (some also got private coverage). Hence, the difference in      the ``dose'' of Medicaid coverage was modest, an absolute      difference of about 25%; to adjust for this, the OHIE      researchers multiplied outcome differences by about 4.       At 1 year of follow-up, the death rate among lottery losers      was 0.8%, and the winners' death rate was 0.032% lower, a      ``dose-adjusted'' difference of 0.13 percentage points      annually. This difference was not statistically significant,      an unsurprising finding given the OHIE's low power to detect      mortality effects because of the cohort's low mortality rate,      the low dose of insurance, and the short follow-up.       The findings on other health measures, obtained from in-     person interviews and brief examinations on a subsample of      12,229 individuals in the Portland area, help inform the      mortality results. Most physical health measures were similar      among lottery winners and losers in the subsample. However,      winners had better self-rated health, were more likely to      have diabetes diagnosed and treated with medication, and were      much less likely to screen positive for depression. Medicaid      coverage was associated with a nonsignificant decrease of      0.52 (95% CI, 2.97 to -1.93) mm Hg in systolic blood pressure      and 0.81 (95% CI, 2.65 to -1.04) mm Hg in diastolic blood      pressure. In addition to the low dose of insurance, these      wide CIs reflect the lack of baseline blood pressure data;      this precludes analyses that take advantage of paired      measures on each individual, which would reduce the variance      of estimates.       In sum, the OHIE yields a (nonsignificant) point estimate      that Medicaid coverage reduced mortality by 0.13 percentage      points, equivalent to a (nonsignificant) odds ratio of 0.84.       Two older RCTs are also relevant to the effect of insurance      and access to care on mortality, although neither directly      compared insured and uninsured persons. In the RAND Health      Insurance Experiment, random assignment to full (first-     dollar) coverage reduced diastolic blood pressure by an      average of 0.8 mm Hg (P < 0.05) relative to persons randomly      assigned to plans that required cost sharing, an effect size      similar to the blood pressure findings in the Unlike      the OHIE, the RAND Health Insurance Experiment obtained      baseline blood pressure readings, allowing researchers to      determine that for participants with hypertension at      baseline, full coverage reduced diastolic blood pressure by      1.9 mm Hg, mostly because of better hypertension detection;      the effect was larger among low-income (3.5 mm Hg) than high-     income (1.1 mm Hg) participants.       The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program also      suggests that removing financial barriers to primary care in      populations with high rates of uninsurance may reduce         TABLE 1.--SUMMARY OF STUDIES ON RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSURANCE COVERAGE AND ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                               Estimated                                                        Information on     Mortality Effect     Study, Year (Reference)         Participants       Baseline Health     of Coverage vs.        Comments                                                                               Uninsured----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RCTs    Oregon Health Insurance       74,922 nondisabled  Retrospective       OR, 0.84 (NS).....

That population-based RCT carried out in the 1970s      screened almost all residents of 14 communities, with      oversampling of predominantly black and poor locations.      Persons with hypertension were randomly assigned to free      stepped care in special clinics or referral to usual care.      Although the clinics' staff treated only hypertension-related      problems, they provided informal advice and ``friendly      referrals'' for other medical issues. Strikingly, all-cause      mortality was reduced by 17% in the intervention group, with      similar reductions in deaths due to cardiovascular and      noncardiovascular conditions.       Finally, a flawed RCT carried out by the Social Security      Administration starting in 2006 bears brief mention. That      study randomly assigned people who were receiving Social      Security disability income and were in the waiting period for      Medicare coverage to receive immediate or delayed coverage.      Unfortunately, randomization apparently failed, with many      more patients with cancer assigned to the immediate coverage      than to the control group, precluding reliable interpretation      of the mortality results. Interestingly, persons receiving      immediate coverage had rapid and significant improvements in      most measures of self-reported health.         MORTALITY FOLLOW-UP OF POPULATION-BASED HEALTH SURVEYS       Several routinely collected federal surveys that include      information about health insurance coverage have been linked      to the National Death Index, allowing researchers to compare      the mortality rates over several years of respondents with      and without coverage at the time of the initial survey. One      weakness of these studies is their lack of information about      the subsequent acquisition or loss of coverage, which many      people cycle into and out of over time. This dilutes coverage      differences and may lead to underestimation of the effects of      insurance coverage.       Sorlie and colleagues analyzed mortality among respondents      to the 1982-1985 Current Population Survey, with follow-up      through 1987. In analyses limited to employed persons, the      relative risk for death associated with being uninsured was      1.3 for white men and 1.2 for white women (neither overall      figures nor those for minorities were reported).[[Page S3758]]     The study's lack of data on important determinants of health,      such as smoking, and its reliance on employment status as the      only proxy for baseline health status weaken confidence in      its conclusions.       Kronick used data from the 1986-2000 National Health      Interview Surveys, with mortality follow-up through 2002. The      mortality hazard ratio for uninsured versus insured      individuals was 1.10 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.19) after adjustment      for demographic variables, smoking, and body mass index. The      hazard ratio fell to 1.03 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.12) after      additional adjustment for baseline health, defined by using      self-reported disability and self-rated health. Although the      self-rated health scale is known to be a valid predictor of      mortality, it may introduce inaccuracies in comparisons of      uninsured versus insured persons. Recent data indicate that      gaining coverage improves self-rated health, before      improvements in objective measures of physical health are      detectable (or plausible). This suggests that uninsurance may      cause people to underrate their health, perhaps because of      anxiety or the inability to gain reassurance about minor      symptoms. Analyses, such as Kronick's, that rely on self-     rated health for risk adjustment therefore may inadvertently      compare relatively sick insured persons to relatively healthy      uninsured persons, obscuring outcome differences caused by      coverage. Studies that include more objective measures of      baseline health should be less subject to any such bias.   MORTALITY FOLLOW-UP OF POPULATION-BASED HEALTH EXAMINATION SURVEYS       Two studies have analyzed the effect of uninsurance on      mortality using data from the National Health and Nutrition      Examination Survey (NHANES), which obtains data from physical      examination and laboratory tests among participants.       Franks and colleagues analyzed the 1971-1975 NHANES, with      mortality follow-up through 1987. They compared mortality of      uninsured and privately insured adults older than age 25      years, adjusted for demographic characteristics, self-rated      health, smoking, obesity, leisure time exercise, and alcohol      consumption. In addition, their models controlled for      evidence of morbidity determined by laboratory testing and      medical examinations performed by NHANES staff. By 1987, 9.6%      of the insured and 18.4% of the uninsured had died. After      adjustment for baseline characteristics and health status,      the hazard ratio for uninsurance was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.00 to      1.55).       Wilper and colleagues' study (which we coauthored) used      data from the 1988-1994 NHANES, with mortality follow-up      through 2000. The study assessed mortality among uninsured      and privately insured persons age 17 to 64 years, controlling      for demographic characteristics, smoking, alcohol      consumption, body mass index, leisure time activity, self-     rated health, and physician-rated health after the NHANES      physician completed the medical examination. The study also      included sensitivity analyses adjusting for the number of      hospitalizations and physician visits within the past year,      limitations in work or activities, job or housework changes      due to health problems, and number of self-reported chronic      diseases, which yielded results similar to those of the main      model. In the main model, being uninsured was associated with      a mortality hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.84). QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF STATE AND PROVINCIAL COVERAGE EXPANSIONS       In two similar studies, Sommers and colleagues compared      mortality trends in states that expanded coverage to low-     income residents (before implementation of the Affordable      Care Act) with trends in similar states without coverage      expansions.       Their analysis of Medicaid expansions in Maine, New York,      and Arizona during the early 2000s found that adult mortality      rates fell faster in those states than in neighboring ones (a      relative reduction of 6.1%, or 19.6 deaths per 100,000),      coincident with a decline in the uninsurance rate of 3.2      percentage points. Mortality reductions were largest among      nonwhites, adults age 35 to 64 years, and poorer counties.      Sommers and colleagues' subsequent reanalysis using data that      allowed better matching to control counties yielded a      slightly lower estimate of the mortality effect. As the      authors note, the large mortality effect from a relatively      modest coverage expansion may reflect the fact that Medicaid      enrollment often occurred ``at the point of care for patients      with acute illnesses,'' leading to the selective enrollment      of those most likely to benefit from coverage.       A study of the effect of Massachusetts' 2006 coverage      expansion compared mortality trends in Massachusetts counties      with those in propensity score-matched counties in other      states. Mortality decreased by 2.9% in Massachusetts relative      to the comparison counties, a difference of 8.2 deaths per      100,000 adults, with larger declines in poorer counties and      those with lower coverage rates before the expansion.                    OTHER QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES       Several researchers have used data from the Health and      Retirement Study (HRS)--a longitudinal study that has      followed cohorts enrolled at age 51 years or older--to assess      the effect of insurance coverage on mortality. The HRS      periodically surveys respondents and their families and has      been linked to Medicare and National Death Index data.       McWilliams and colleagues found significantly higher      mortality rates among uninsured compared with insured HRS      respondents, even after propensity score adjustment for      multiple predictors of insurance coverage. Baker and      colleagues found that respondents who were uninsured      (compared with those who had private insurance) had higher      long-term but not short-term mortality. After adjustment for      multiple baseline characteristics, including instrumental      variables associated with coverage (such as a spouse's union      membership), Hadley and Waidmann found a strong positive      association between insurance coverage and survival before      age 65 years. Black and colleagues suggested, on the basis of      a ``battery of causal inference methods,'' that others      overestimated the survival benefits of insurance and that      uninsured HRS respondents had only slightly higher (adjusted)      mortality than those with private coverage. Finally, studies      have reached conflicting conclusions as to whether the health      of previously uninsured persons improves (relative to those      who were previously insured) after they reach age 65 years      and become eligible for Overall, the preponderance      of evidence from the HRS suggests that being uninsured is      associated with some increase in mortality.       Some studies using other data sources suggest that death      rates drop at age 65 years, coincident with the acquisition      of Medicare eligibility, whereas others do not.       Finally, several studies have assessed the relationship      between insurance coverage and hypertension control, a likely      mediator of any relationship between coverage and all-cause      mortality. Lurie and colleagues followed a cohort of 186      patients who lost Medicaid coverage because of a statewide      policy change and a control group of 109 patients who      remained eligible. Among those who lost coverage, 5 died      within 6 months (compared with none in the control group; P =      .16), and the average diastolic blood pressure of those with      hypertension increased by 10 mm Hg (compared with a 5-mm Hg      decrease in controls; P= 0.003). At 1 year, 7 patients who      had lost Medicaid and 1 control had died; blood pressure      differences were slightly less marked than seen at 6 months.      A similar study of patients terminated from Veterans Affairs      outpatient care because of a budget shortfall found marked      deterioration in hypertension control among the terminated      patients relative to controls who maintained access. These      clinic-based findings accord with cross-sectional population-     based analyses of data from NHANES, which have found worse      blood pressure control among uninsured than insured patients      with hypertension.      EVIDENCE FROM OTHER NATIONS AND FROM CROSS-NATIONAL STUDIES       The United States lags behind most other wealthy nations in      life expectancy and is the only one with substantial numbers      of uninsured residents. Although many factors confound cross-     national comparisons, a recent study suggests that worse      access to good-quality health care contributes to our      nation's higher mortality from medically preventable causes      (so-called amenable mortality). Similarly, a recent review of      studies from many nations concluded that ``broader health      coverage generally leads to better access to necessary care      and improved population health''.       Quasi-experimental studies assessing newly implemented      universal coverage in wealthy nations have reached similar      conclusions. For instance, Taiwan's rollout of a single-payer      system in 1995 was associated with an accelerated decline in      amenable mortality, particularly in townships where coverage      gains were larger. In Canada, a study exploiting the      different dates on which provinces implemented universal      coverage estimated that coverage expansion reduced infant      mortality by about 5% (P < 0.03).       Finally, a recent study of cystic fibrosis cohorts also      suggests that coverage improves mortality. Such patients      live, on average, 10 years longer in Canada than in the      United Among U.patients, those without known      coverage have the shortest survival; among the privately      insured, life expectancy is similar to that among patients in      TABLE 2.--WHY THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP OF HEALTH INSURANCE TO MORTALITY                            IS HARD TO STUDY------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------Deaths, especially from causes amenable to medical treatment, are rare among nonelderly adults, who account for most of the uninsured.Because insurance might prevent death by slowing the decline in health over several years, short-term studies may underestimate its effects.Many people cycle in and out of insurance diluting differences between groups.Randomly assigning participants to no coverage is unethical in most circumstances.Observational studies must address reverse causality. Illness sometimes causes people to acquire public insurance by qualifying them for Medicaid, Medicare, or Department of Veterans Affairs disability coverage. Conversely, illness may cause job loss and resultant loss of private coverage.In cohort studies, adequate control for baseline health status is difficult, particularly in uninsured patients, whose lack of access lowers self-rated health and also causes less awareness of important risk factors, such as hypertension or hyperlipidemia.[[Page S3759]] Quasi-experimental studies, which exploit factors associated with coverage (such as policy changes), rest on unverifiable assumptions (e.g., that without a coverage expansion, mortality trends in states expanding coverage would parallel those in comparator state).------------------------------------------------------------------------                               DISCUSSION       The evidence accumulated since the publication of the IOM's      report in 2002 supports and strengthens its conclusion that      health insurance reduces mortality. Several newer      observational and quasi-experimental studies have found that      uninsurance shortens survival, and a few with null results      used confounded or questionable adjustments for baseline      health. The results of the only recent RCT, although far from      definitive, are consistent with the positive findings from      cohort and quasi-experimental analyses.       Several factors complicate efforts to determine whether      uninsurance increases mortality (Table 2). Randomly assigning      people to uninsurance is usually unethical, and quasi-     experimental analyses rest on unverifiable assumptions.      Deaths are rare and mortality effects may be delayed,      mandating large studies with long follow-up. Many people      cycle into and out of coverage, diluting the effects of      insurance. And statistical adjustments for baseline health      usually rely on participants' self-reports, which may be      influenced by coverage. Hence, such adjustments may under- or      overadjust for differences between insured and uninsured      persons.       Inferences about mechanisms through which insurance affects      mortality are subject to even greater uncertainty. In some      circumstances, coverage might raise mortality by increasing      access to dangerous drugs (such as oral opioids) or      procedures (such as morcellation hysterectomy). On the other      hand, coverage clearly reduces mortality in several serious      conditions, although few are common enough to have a      detectable effect on population-level mortality. The      exception is hypertension, which is prevalent among the      uninsured and seems a likely contributor to their higher      death rates. Although uncontrolled hyperlipidemia is also      more common among the uninsured, the OHIE--the only RCT      performed in the statin era--found no effect of coverage on      cholesterol levels.       Finally, our focus on mortality should not obscure other      well-established benefits of health insurance: improved self-     rated health, financial protection, and reduced likelihood of      depression. Insurance is the gateway to medical care, whose      aim is not just saving lives but also relieving human      suffering.       Overall, the case for coverage is strong. Even skeptics who      suggest that insurance doesn't improve outcomes seem to vote      differently with their feet. As one prominent economist      recently asked, ``How many of the people who write such      things . . . choose to just not bother getting their      healthcare?''                           Key Summary Points       In several specific conditions, the uninsured have worse      survival, and the lack of coverage is associated with lower      use of recommended preventive services.       The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, the only available      randomized, controlled trial that has assessed the health      effects of insurance, suggests that insurance may cause a      clinically important decrease in mortality, but wide Cls      preclude firm conclusions.       The 2 National Health and Nutrition Examination Study      analyses that include physicians' assessments of baseline      health show substantial mortality improvements associated      with coverage. A cohort study that used only self-reported      baseline health measures for risk adjustment found a      nonsignificant coverage effect.       Most, but not all, analyses of data from the longitudinal      Health and Retirement Study have found that coverage in the      near-elderly slowed health decline and decreased mortality.       Two difference-in-difference studies in the United States      and 1 in Canada compared mortality trends in matched      locations with and without coverage expansions. All 3 found      large reductions in mortality associated with increased      coverage.       A mounting body of evidence indicates that lack of health      insurance decreases survival, and it seems unlikely that      definitive randomized, controlled trials can be done. Hence,      policy debate must rely on the best evidence from      observational and quasi-experimental studies.

I don't think it is really an exaggeration that what we are seeing right now is our democracy actually under attack. Unfortunately, it is from our own White  I think Americans around the country, regardless of their political party or even political persuasion, are kind of shaking their head and saying: What the heck is going on?  Every day, there is some sort of a new and disturbing revelation. We found out that the President of the United States just seems to have blurted out highly, highly classified information in a meeting with the Russian Ambassador and the Russian Foreign Minister--information that was passed on, it seems, from the Israelis, but actually could put some of the people who are doing the most delicate work on the ground in some danger. And then, of course, last week, the President fired the FBI Director, James  As a Democrat, I certainly have had problems in the past with James I think that he helped influence the outcome of the election. But it turns out that on national television the President basically admitted, after giving various explanations of the firing, that it came down to the Russian investigation.  Then we find out that James Comey actually took notes of a meeting with the President where the President asked him to drop the investigation of General Flynn and his connection to the It is a real question of what is going on.  It was an important step when, yesterday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein took the important first step of appointing a special counsel to investigate the Russia connection and the relationship between this administration of President Trump and the Russians.[[Page H4350]]  I am really happy. I was on the Intelligence Committee when Robert Mueller was the FBI I have to tell you that I feel very confident in his independence and his integrity. I know that he, importantly, would not allow the FBI to work with the CIA when they wanted to torture people, essentially, by using enhanced interrogation techniques. So I feel good that he is a very good choice.  But having done that, today I was happy to sign a discharge petition to create an independent commission that would also be looking into even the larger picture about what was going on with the Russian influence campaign involving itself in our elections, and then also, what was the connection between the Trump administration, Donald Trump himself, did they collude on influencing the election?  It is important to do both. They are complementary. They don't do the same thing.  I am going to quote from Adam Schiff, who is our ranking Democrat on the Intelligence I think he put it really well: ``The value an independent commission adds is you have a body that is truly independent of any political consideration and also has all the resources it needs and a single focus on the oversight of what Russia did, how we need to respond in the future, and it brings that political independence and staff and resources on task. So those are two different needs, and I think they're complementary, not in competition with each other.''  The other reason I am very much in support not only of the special prosecutor, but of the independent commission is because, then, Congress has a role here. Congress itself is saying--hopefully, Republicans and We have two Republicans right now on our discharge petition that would force the bill to come to the floor that would say that we, together, think that this is worthy, our democracy is worthy of this kind of in-depth investigation.  Finally, let me say we would find out a lot about the relationship of the President and Russia, plus other conflicts of interest, if we could see his tax returns, like every other President has done. Release his tax returns.  Again, I would hope that this has not devolved into strictly a partisan issue.

Our Republican friends, mostly in the House--I want to say that my friend the Republican leader is working hard to get a good bill done, and I appreciate that, but Republicans are holding us up on some critical poison pill riders.  We have made good enough progress.

They have done heroic work, and I am happy to report that, if we get an agreement, we will see increases in NIH funding, year-round Pell grants, and housing assistance in the underlying omnibus bill.  We are willing to have a voice vote on a short-term extension of the government funding in the hopes that we can wrap this up early next week. As I said last night, there is still a handful of unresolved poison pill riders, fewer than there were yesterday at 6 o'clock because of the work they did overnight, but there are still some out there.  I want to reiterate the Democratic position. We don't want them--zero. We are happy to pass a clean, bipartisan appropriations bill, which is the way this process is supposed to work. On the more controversial issues, we can have a debate in regular order. They shouldn't be stuck in these bills with no debate and no discussion and no votes--no regular order voting.  I am confident that we can get there if both sides realize that these important debates on policy should be left with the regular order process and in full view of the public.  I yield the floor.

1690,topic-id,1398,"Mr.President, last night we learned that the current Republican healthcare bill lacks enough support to even reach the floor of the After numerous delays, false starts, false predictions, and two pulled votes, it should be crystal clear to everyone on the other side of the aisle that the core of the bill is unworkable.  It is time to move on. It is time to start over. Rather than repeating the same failed partisan process yet again, Republicans should work with Democrats on a bill that lowers premiums,[[Page S4030]]provides long-term stability to the markets, and improves our healthcare system.  I heard the Republican leader this morning say that Democrats ``decided early on that they did not want to engage seriously'' on healthcare. In the same speech, the Republican leader also admitted that the very first thing the Republican majority did this Congress was to pass reconciliation so they could pass healthcare on a party-line vote--50 needed, no Democrats needed. Early on, the majority leader told Democrats: We don't need you. We don't want you.  Respectfully, I take issue with the idea that Democrats didn't want to engage on healthcare. The majority leader admitted that he decided the matter for us when he locked Democrats out of the process at the outset. At the very beginning of this Congress, President Trump and Leader McConnell said: Don't come knocking on our door on healthcare. We don't need you.  Now that their one-party effort has largely failed, we hope they will change their tune.  It seems like many Republicans are ready for a truly bipartisan effort on healthcare, indeed. My friend Senator McCain has urged it quite strongly saying: ``The Congress must now return to regular order, hold hearings, [and] receive input from members of both parties.'' He said that while recuperating in So that is how strongly he feels about it.  Other Republican Senators have made similar comments, but the Republican leader still plans to ignore their advice and instead plans on holding a proxy vote on a straight repeal of our healthcare law first.  Make no mistake about it. Passing repeal without a replacement would be a disaster. Our healthcare system would implode. Millions would lose coverage. Coverage for millions more would be diminished. Our healthcare system would be in such a deep hole that repair would be nearly impossible.  In fact, passing repeal and having it go into effect 2 years later is, in many ways, worse than the Republican healthcare bill that was just rejected by my Republican colleagues. It is as if our healthcare system were a patient who came in and needed some medicine and the Republicans propose surgery. The operation was a failure. Now Republicans are proposing a second surgery that will surely kill the patient. Medicine is needed--bipartisan medicine, not a second surgery.  We urge our Republican colleagues to change their tune. Passing repeal now is not a door to bipartisan solutions, as the majority leader suggested this morning. Rather, it is a disaster. The door to bipartisanship is open right now, not with repeal but with an effort to improve the existing system. The door is open right now. Republican leadership only needs to walk through it, as many Republican Members are urging.  The door is to accept the progress we have made in our healthcare system and work to improve it. The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect, but repealing all of the good things about the law will create such chaos that there will hardly be anything left to repair.  Republicans don't need to wreak havoc on our healthcare system first in order to get Democrats to the table. We are ready to sit down right now, if Republicans abandon cuts to Medicaid, abandon huge tax breaks for the wealthy, and agree to go through the regular order--through the committees, with hearings, and onto the floor with time for amendments. That is how we perfect legislation here. That is how it has been done for 200 years.  Almost inevitably, when you try to draft something behind closed doors and do not vet it with the public, it becomes a failure--in this case, a disaster. So again our Republican colleagues don't need to wreak havoc on our healthcare system first in order to get Democrats to the table. We are ready to sit down right now, again, if Republicans abandon cuts to Medicaid, abandon tax breaks for the wealthy, and agree to go through the regular order. The door to bipartisanship is open right now. Republicans only need to walk through it.  I would remind my Republican friends that the CBO has already scored the idea of a clean repeal bill, and it would be a catastrophe. Listen to what the nonpartisan CBO said. The head of CBO is appointed by the Republican leader of the Senate and the Republican leader of the Here is what CBO said about repeal: It would cause 32 million Americans to lose their insurance. Premiums would double, while cutting taxes for households with incomes over a million dollars by over $50,000 a year. It would end Medicaid expansion with no grace period or option for States that like their Medicaid expansion and want to keep it. In many ways, it is just as cruel, if not crueler, to Medicaid as the TrumpCare bill, but in a different way.  So I would expect that the same Senators who are concerned about the TrumpCare bill's Medicaid cuts will be equally concerned about what repeal and delay would do to Many of my Republican friends rejected roundly the idea of repeal and delay several months ago at the beginning of the year when President Trump first proposed it and it seemed like that was really what Republicans would do. Here are just some of the names back then who said repeal and then replace later doesn't work: Cassidy, Alexander, Collins, Corker, Cotton, Hatch, Isakson, Moran, McCain, Murkowski,  Well, I would tell those colleagues and all of the others: The idea hasn't magically gotten better with age. It is still nothing more than a cut-and-run approach to healthcare that will leave millions of Americans out in the cold and will raise costs on everyone--the young, the old, the sick, the healthy, working Americans, and middle-class families. Everyone will be hurt but the very, very wealthy.  Every day that Republicans spend on trying to pass their now failed partisan TrumpCare bill, every day they spend cooking up new tricks to bully their Members to get on a healthcare bill is another day wasted, another day that could have been spent working on real improvements to our healthcare system.  Democrats want to work with our colleagues on the Republican side to stabilize the marketplaces and improve the cost and quality of care, and we want to do it via regular order, a process this body has used time and again to produce consensus, bipartisan, historic legislation.  The majority leader said in 2014, in a speech entitled ``Restoring the Senate,'' ``When the Senate is allowed to work the way it was designed to, it arrives at a result acceptable to people all along the political spectrum.'' But if it is ``an assembly line for one party's partisan legislative agenda,'' it creates ``instability and strife'' rather than ``good stable law.''  I want to repeat that. These are the words of Leader Mitch I hope Leader McConnell is listening and remembers these words. He hasn't for the last 6 months, and it has only led to trouble for him and his Republican colleagues in the Let me read it again, the 2014 speech, ``Restoring the Senate'' by Mitch ``When the Senate is allowed to work the way it was designed to, it arrives at a result acceptable to people all along the political spectrum. But if it's ``an assembly line for one party's partisan legislative agenda,'' it creates ``instability and strife'' rather than ``good stable law.''  Leader McConnell, I couldn't agree more. It is time to start over on healthcare, abandon the idea of cutting Medicaid to give a tax break to the wealthy, abandon this new repeal and run, and use the regular order to arrive ``at a result acceptable to people all along the political spectrum,'' as Leader McConnell once said. I dare say it would create a much better result for the American people as well.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-18-pt1-PgS4029-7.txt,1036,PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MUSLIM BAN,2017.0,18.0,May

The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee marked up two authorizations in our jurisdiction that are included in this bill: the U.Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management  The Coast Guard authorization supports service missions to enforce all Federal laws on the high seas and in U.waters. It does so by providing a variety of acquisition authorities to help lower costs, requiring a land-based unmanned aircraft system program, eliminating redundant training requirements, and providing the Coast Guard parity with other armed services in matters related to healthcare and retirement.

1662,topic-id,1096,"Mr.President, every week I have been coming to the Senate floor to talk about someone in my great State of Alaska who makes Alaska a better place for all of us--for the community, for everybody living there. I call this person our Alaskan of the To be honest, it is one of the most fulfilling things I get to do as a Senator, recognizing back home and across the country special people in my  There is no doubt that many here in the Chamber and the people who are watching from home have seen pictures and television shows about We are a little biased--I know one of our pages is an Alaskan--that we have the most beautiful State, not only in the country but in the world. So we want to encourage everybody watching to come visit It will be the trip of a lifetime, absolutely guaranteed. It is truly the people of Alaska who make our State so special, people with big hearts who band together to solve challenges. Like all places, we have challenges.  This week I would like to recognize Michael Carson for his work to help people in Alaska who are struggling with addiction. We know this is a problem that is impacting every single State in our great Michael lives in Palmer, AK, a picturesque town about 45 miles from Anchorage in Alaska's vast Matanuska-Susitna Valley--what we just call the Valley or the Mat-It is about the size of West Virginia, so don't get me going on the size of It will embarrass most of my--actually all of my colleagues here, unfortunately for them. Palmer is flanked by the rolling Talkeetna Mountains to the north and the saw-toothed Chugach Mountains to the south. It is a close-knit community where most people know each other.  Many people in Palmer and the Mat-Su across the State know Michael Carson's name. Like many Alaskans, Michael's story is one full of adventure. Originally from California, he received his undergraduate in early childhood development from the University of After hitchhiking through Africa and spending a summer in Mexico, he took a job teaching in Nome, AK, in 1974. A few years later, he moved to the Mat-Su to teach and taught our students for many years.[[Page S3028]]  He retired from teaching, but his yearning to help people, particularly our youth, did not leave him. He got a job at Covenant House in Anchorage, which is a homeless youth shelter. It is a wonderful place, by the way. I am a little biased on this one; my wife Julie happens to work at Covenant Michael's shift started at 8 p.m. and ended at 8 a.m. That is what he was doing at Covenant He spent those hours walking through the city, reaching out to kids on the streets, sharing his own story, and inspiring our youth because his story also involves recovery. It is a privilege to say here on the Senate floor that Mike has been sober for 29 years.  Eventually realizing that kids in the Mat-Su Valley also needed a place to go when they were in trouble and needed help, Michael and another incredible constituent of mine, Michelle Overstreet, founded MYHouse in Palmer, a place that provides services like job assistance, access to healthcare, clothing, food, and showers for homeless youth. Michael still sits on the board, still remains a champion for all youth, particularly those in recovery and the homeless or disadvantaged. He leads recovery groups on-site weekly, as well as meetings with clients who are struggling. He has also volunteered to host recovery groups at the Mat-Su youth detention facility for the past 13 years. Michael has helped many young people get sober and stay sober.  In Michelle Overstreet's words, it is not uncommon for youth to come into the drop-in center, homeless and just out of juvenile detention, and ask specifically for Michael, to come in and say that he helped them somewhere along their journey through life to sobriety, just to come in and say: Thank you,  Most of us know that our country is in the midst of an opioid crisis, one that has become an epidemic in many places across the country. In 2015, more people in America died from overdoses--over 52,000, and most were linked to opioids and heroin--than car crashes or gun violence.  On Wednesday morning, Alaskans awoke to a disturbing headline in the Alaska Dispatch News: ``Anchorage is seeing a dramatic surge in heroin overdoses.'' Anchorage is the largest city in It is my hometown. The article said that since May 1, there have been more than 2 overdoses a day in Anchorage--34 overdoses in just a little more than 2 weeks.  Like almost every State in this great Nation of ours, Alaska is being hit hard by the opioid crisis, and we are trying to focus as much attention as we can in a bipartisan fashion on addressing this crisis, whether in Alaska, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Indiana, or  We need people like Every State does. He started the only grassroots opioid task force in the State of Alaska and continues to chair that effort to this day. He knows too well how the abuse of opioids, other drugs, and alcohol robs our citizens--but particularly our youth--of their lives, promise, and future. He also understands how very important it is to have resources for those who need the support and recovery. Those resources come in many forms. We have been trying in the Congress in the last year, year and a half, to bring significant resources to our State and local communities. We are doing that.  State support is also important across the country. Perhaps most important is the community support and having people like Michael on the frontlines who understand that addiction is not a moral failure and that people who are suffering need help. They need help, not moral judgments from us.  Because of Michael's involvement and the involvement of so many others in Alaska and particularly in the Mat-Su, there are places for people who are suffering to call and get help. There are places to go and heal and places where our youth can have leaders who listen to them, like  Michael says it is vital for his own recovery to continue to help people who are suffering from addiction.

1663,topic-id,1168,"Mr.President, the internet worked great in 2014 when there were no Federal net neutrality rules. Truth be told, even after the Obama-era Federal Communications Commission applied depression-era phone monopoly regulations to broadband in 2015, most Americans saw little or no difference in their internet experience. The internet still creates jobs, expands educational opportunities, keeps us in touch with loved ones, and, as a bonus, it is often entertaining.  This internet that we know and love isn't going to fall apart anytime soon, no matter what the FCC decides. But there are important policy questions that need to be answered about how the internet will grow and develop into the future. Let's put the apocalyptic rhetoric and fearmongering aside.  The internet doesn't belong just to Republicans, Democrats, big Silicon Valley tech companies, internet service providers, small Silicon Prairie startups, or the Federal It belongs to everyone. It is global. It is best when it is free and open.  Today, as the FCC reconsiders the flawed broadband regulations it issued only 2 years ago, Congress should look back at the path that we could have taken but didn't. In November of 2014, I offered former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to come together to craft a permanent legislative solution banning controversial practices known as blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization of internet traffic. With colleagues in the House of Representatives, I even put forward a draft bill doing exactly that. It wasn't a final offer but, rather, an outreach to get the conversation started. I thought the time and opportunity to protect the open internet on a bipartisan basis had arrived. Through bipartisan legislation, I believed Congress should put into statute widely accepted principles of network management, commonly referred to as ``net neutrality.''  Our idea for legislation was straightforward: Combine protections ensuring that owners of broadband infrastructure can't use their role to manipulate the user experience with those guaranteeing a continuation of the light-touch regulatory policies that helped the internet thrive for two decades.  But Chairman Wheeler rejected our idea for bipartisan legislation. Instead, he and his staff lobbied to block such discussions from even happening in He then, with only partisan support, issued an order that gave the FCC authority to regulate the internet under old laws designed for phone monopolies and eliminated all the authority the Federal Trade Commission had to police broadband providers.  I represent South Dakota, a rural State that is home to small but still very innovative technology businesses. In other parts of the State, communities lack access to high-speed broadband. In the debate over the FCC regulating broadband with rules designed for phone monopolies, there were many concerns that Chairman Wheeler's approach would create uncertainty that chills investment.  ``Chilling investment'' is a term that one often hears among the business community. To me, what it really means is that many Americans in rural communities will have to wait longer before they have an opportunity to select high-speed internet service. Today there are 34 million Americans who lack access to broadband services at home.  As innovation on the internet thrives, demand for data rises, and the stock market hits all-time highs, one would have suspected that broadband investment would continue growing as it had for two decades. But according to one analysis, annual investment actually went down 5.5 percent in 2016 compared to 2014. This is a troubling sign that private investment may have second thoughts about the ability to turn capital expenditures into future profits under an excessive regulatory regime.  Chairman Wheeler assured the public that his FCC would not use new authority over the internet to aggressively restrict many regular online practices, but he could not offer assurances that, as years pass and administrations change, such regulatory restraint would remain. His order gives wide legal latitude for any future FCC[[Page S3029]]not bound by his commitments to touch any and every corner of the internet. After all, unless grounded in legislation, partisan policy changes through administrative action can be fleeting.  Today's action at the FCC aptly underscores the concern that the FCC's partisan approach to internet policy in 2015 did not put the internet on a solid foundation. I know there are many upset about what the FCC is doing. I felt much the same way 2 years ago when the FCC voted to proceed after my bipartisan outreach had been rejected.  We should not, however, view the FCC's action today as a final outcome. While I commend Chairman Ajit Pai and Commissioner Michael O'Rielly for taking this necessary step, I fully recognize that today's action alone does not create ideal certainty for the internet. There is more work yet to do.  In politics, it is rare to get a second chance at bipartisan compromise, yet right now we have an opportunity to accomplish what eluded us 2 years ago--clear and certain rules in statute to protect the open internet. We have another chance to sit down, to discuss every stakeholder's concerns, and to work toward the common goal of protecting the internet.  While the FCC's 2015 order may soon be consigned to the dustbin of history, the last few months have shown that political winds can and often do shift suddenly.  To my colleagues in both the majority and minority: The only way to truly provide legal and political certainty for open internet protections is for Congress to pass bipartisan legislation. We need a statute offering clear and enduring rules that balance innovation and investment throughout the entire internet ecosystem.  In crafting rules, we need to listen to the concerns of all Americans who support an open internet but who may have differing opinions about the greatest threats to online freedom. For some Americans, the greatest concern is meddling by internet service providers, and for others it is unelected bureaucrats attempting to overprotect Americans from products and services that they actually like.  Online innovation is a virtuous circle. Online companies need robust and widely available broadband networks to reach their customers, and ISPs need the online experience to be compelling enough to drive subscriber demand.  We need to work together collaboratively to find the right policies for the internet. I firmly believe we can find common ground to protect the internet, so long as we don't fixate on the misguided notion that monopoly regulation is the only way to preserve it. While some may wish to wait until the activities at the FCC and in the courts have completely run their course, my preference would be to begin bipartisan work on such legislation without any further delay. Innovation and job creation should no longer take a backseat to partisan point scoring.  It is time for Congress to finally settle this matter. I am happy to meet at any time with any of my colleagues who are serious about discussing a path forward.

1660,topic-id,633,"Mr.President, I rise today to point out that the Federal Communications Commission is voting today, perhaps this morning, to begin the process to roll back a regulatory framework that should never have been imposed on broadband service providers in the first place. Like many of my colleagues, I am glad the FCC is working to restore the ``light touch'' regulatory framework that has allowed the internet to thrive since its creation.  This action sets the stage for Congress to then put a legislative solution in place that strikes the right balance between providing regulatory oversight on the one hand and giving the broadband industry the flexibility it needs to innovate and expand on the other hand.  We should not rely on a classification that was devised during the depression era. There should be 21st-century rules for 21st-century technology. As chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees internet issues, I look forward to the task ahead. Keeping the internet free and open is a goal shared by most of us and by many of my friends on the other side of the aisle. A bipartisan solution can help provide long-term certainty for both consumers and broadband providers.  This certainty will be essential to our efforts to close the digital divide and remove barriers to internet connectivity that exist in Mississippi and around the United The online experience we enjoy today and the revolutionary advances of the internet over the past quarter century did not happen because of the heavy hand of the Federal  These advances happened because the Federal Government stayed out of the way, supporting a ``light touch'' regulatory framework where innovation, competition, and investment could truly survive and thrive.  This was the framework that existed under both Republican and Democratic administrations until 2015, when politics got in the way. With a party-line vote, the FCC that year decided to adopt a utility-style framework, as I said, resulting from legislation devised during the depression. It classified broadband service as a common carrier under title II of the Communications Act of 1934.  A utility-style framework for telephones may have worked during the Bell telephone monopoly of the depression era, but that does not mean it is a right fit now. Nor does it mean we should adopt a completely hands off regulatory approach, which I would also oppose. The goal of net neutrality, which is designed to prevent internet providers from prioritizing some legal content over others has not gone away. But we know that handing over broad control of the internet to Washington is also not the answer.  FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has outlined some of the reasons for this, including the impact of title II regulations on big and small internet service providers. If we do not give providers the confidence to invest in better services and better infrastructure, it could limit consumers' options and services. This could also affect our efforts to close the digital divide, to bring the digital world to our rural communities in Alabama and Underserved communities could remain underserved.  Without broadband access, these communities could lose out on critical jobs, economic development, and many other opportunities borne out of the thriving internet economy.  At the end of the day, we need to be asking: What do Americans want and what do Americans need? They need broadband that is accessible, affordable, fast, and reliable. They want to be able to choose the services and content that best meets their needs.  These are the priorities that need to be kept in mind as the FCC works today and as lawmakers work to strike a balance between regulatory oversight and free market productivity.  Thank you, Mr. I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1837,topic-id,1171,"Mr.President, today I wish to express my concerns about the outcome of the April 16 constitutional referendum in Turkey, when more than 50 million Turkish citizens voted on constitutional amendments to convert Turkey's parliamentary government into a Presidential system.  Turkey is a longstanding friend of the United States and a NATO ally.[[Page S2770]]Our bilateral partnership dates back to the Cold War when Turkey served as an important bulwark against the creeping influence of the Soviet Time has not diminished Turkey's geostrategic importance. Today Ankara finds itself at the intersection of several critical challenges: the instability in Syria and Iraq, the threat of ISIS and other extremist groups, and the refugee crisis spawned by this regional upheaval.  The United States relies on Turkey and other regional partners to help coordinate and strengthen our collective response. I was deeply troubled when renegade military units attempted to overthrow Turkey's democratically elected government last Turkey's strength is rooted in the democratic legitimacy of its government--a pillar of stability targeted by the reckless and criminal coup attempt.  As chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, or U.Helsinki Commission, I take very seriously the political commitments made by the 57 participating states of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, These commitments, held by both the United States and Turkey, represent the foundation of security and cooperation in the OSCE region. They include an indispensable focus on human rights, rule of law, and democratic institutions.  In the OSCE's founding document, the Helsinki Final Act, participating states affirm ``the universal significance of human rights and fundamental freedoms'' and consider respect for these to be an ``essential factor'' for international peace and security. This vision is consistent with long-established U.foreign policy promoting human rights and democracy as cornerstones of a safer, more stable international order.  With these principles in mind, the United States must pay urgent attention to the current situation in Turkey and the danger it poses to Turkish and regional stability. Eroding respect for fundamental freedoms, rule of law, and democratic institutions in Turkey has proceeded at an alarming pace. The government's planned ``executive presidency'' will further decrease government accountability.  Since the attempted coup more than 9 months ago, Turkey has operated under a state of emergency that gives the government sweeping authority to curtail rights and silence opponents. Certain extraordinary measures may have been justified in the immediate aftermath to restore order, investigate events, and bring perpetrators to justice, but the government's actions have stretched far beyond these legitimate aims. The ongoing purge has touched every institution of government, sector of society, corner of the country, and shade of opposition--military or civilian, Turk or Kurd, religious or secular, nationalist or leftist, political or nonpolitical.  An atmosphere of fear and uncertainty has settled over Turkish society as more than 100,000 people have been detained or arrested. Tens of thousands have been fired from their jobs, had their professional licenses revoked, and had their names released on public lists without any recognizable due process. The government removed and replaced thousands of judges and prosecutors within hours of the coup's defeat, compromising the independence of the judiciary at a moment when an impartial justice system had become more important than ever.  The government has also closed more than 150 media outlets. Upwards of 80 journalists are behind bars. The offices of the country's oldest newspaper were raided, and the paper's editor-in-chief and other staff were arrested. The media environment was already under extraordinary pressure before the coup. Last spring, the government seized control of the country's highest circulation paper. Self-censorship is now widely practiced to avoid provoking the government's ire.  Additionally, state of emergency decrees have given regional governors the ability to curtail freedom of assembly rights, harming the ability of civil society organizations to organize rallies concerning the referendum. Since July, the government has detained more than a dozen opposition parliamentarians. Many more continue to face criminal charges for political statements they made before the coup attempt.  It is difficult to overstate the chilling effect these measures have had on political debate in Turkey; yet these are the circumstances under which Turks voted on April 16. These major constitutional changes passed with a slim majority of 51 percent. The OSCE's international observation mission stated in its preliminary conclusions that the vote ``took place on an unlevel playing field'' and that ``fundamental freedoms essential to a genuinely democratic process were curtailed.''  Under the revised constitution, the once largely ceremonial position of President will convert into an ``executive presidency'' and the position of Prime Minister will be abolished. The President will be elected along with the national assembly every 5 years and has the ability to dissolve the assembly and call new elections at will. The President will also appoint a larger proportion--nearly half--of the country's supreme judicial council. In a report on these new constitutional provisions, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe concluded that the amendments are a ``step backwards'' and pose ``dangers of degeneration . . . towards an authoritarian and personal regime.''  Turkey is undergoing a disturbing transformation, and I am concerned these changes could undermine the strength of our partnership. President Erdogan's government has dramatically repressed dissent, purged opponents from every sector of government and society, and is now poised to consolidate power further under his self-described ``executive presidency.''  In the short term, the Turkish Government should act swiftly and transparently to investigate credible claims of voting irregularities in the referendum, as well as the legality of a surprise electoral board decision to admit an unknown number of ballots that should be deemed invalid under existing rules. Public trust in the outcome of such a consequential vote is of utmost importance. Sadly, until now, the government has responded to these challenges with dismissiveness and suppression. In the past week, dozens of activists have been detained for participating in protests against the election results.  Furthermore, the government should lift the state of emergency, stop all forms of repression against the free press, release all imprisoned journalists and political activists, and urgently restore public confidence in the judiciary. Only then can it credibly and independently adjudicate the tens of thousands of cases caught up in the government's months-long dragnet operations.  A country where disagreements are suppressed rather than debated is less secure. A country where institutions are subordinated to personalities is less stable. A country where criticism is conflated with sedition is less democratic. Unless President Erdogan moves urgently to reverse these trends, I fear our partnership will inevitably become more transactional and less strategic. It will become more difficult to justify long-term investment in our relationship with Turkey if the future of the country becomes synonymous with the fortunes of one party or one individual.  The United States and Turkey need a solid foundation for enduring cooperation to tackle regional instability, terrorism, migration, and other challenges. The future of this partnership is difficult to imagine in the midst of a prolonged state of emergency, wide-scale purges, and weakened democratic institutions.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-04-pt1-PgS2769-2.txt,1226,TURKEY,2017.0,4.0,May
