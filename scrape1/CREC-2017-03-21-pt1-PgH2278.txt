                    NATIONAL VITILIGO AWARENESS DAY

  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a bipartisan 
resolution which designates October 17 as National Vitiligo Awareness 
Day.
  Vitiligo is a chronic medical condition resulting in the loss of skin 
pigmentation. Studies show that about 50 million people worldwide are 
diagnosed with vitiligo. In the United States, around 2 to 5 million 
individuals are affected. Michael Jackson had it.
  The American Academy of Dermatology refers to vitiligo as a life-
altering disorder that can result in low self-esteem, anxiety, and 
depression. Children with vitiligo are especially vulnerable to being 
bullied because of their looks. They have a harder time making friends 
and are more likely to perform poorly at school. We have the power to 
change this. By naming October 17, 2017, as National Vitiligo Awareness 
Day, we highlight the importance of providing support to individuals 
diagnosed with vitiligo in an effort to improve their quality of life.
