                     HORRORS OF THE IMMIGRATION BAN

  (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GARAMENDI. I will just finish this up very quickly. I think we 
need to look to where this problem emanates. It emanates from the 
President's adviser, Mr. Bannon. He has been at this for some time 
talking about the nature of America being a White nationalist nation. 
So if we look beyond the horror that this ban places, we need to look 
to where it emanates, Mr. Bannon, clearly this comes from him, and we 
need to focus our attention on what he has done to this Nation's 
values.
  I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.
  Mr. RASKIN. If the gentleman has a few seconds left, I would just say 
I know the distinguished Congressman King is going to go, and then we 
have a couple more people who were left over from the Progressive 
Caucus Special Order who will stay for 1-minutes after.
