                  HONORING THE LIFE OF RHONDA LeROCQUE

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Madam Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of 
Rhonda LeRocque. Rhonda attended the Route 91 Festival in Las Vegas on 
October 1.
  Rhonda was married to her husband, Jason, for 21 years, with whom she 
had a 6-year-old daughter, Ali.
  Rhonda and Jason were very active in their church and enjoyed 
participating in humanitarian projects together. One of their biggest 
projects was when they traveled to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina 
to help rebuild homes.
  Rhonda worked for a design firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but 
dreamed of opening up her own catering business. She loved skiing, 
cooking, and baking, but nothing could surpass her love for her family. 
She is remembered for being a selfless and joyful woman who had a 
strong faith.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Rhonda LeRocque's family and 
friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, 
and the whole country grieve with you.
