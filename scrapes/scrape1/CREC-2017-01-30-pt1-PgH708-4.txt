         NEW ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO MILITARY READINESS

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, President 
Donald Trump took lifesaving action to begin the much-needed process of 
rebuilding our military.
  For the past 5 years, the failed policy of defense sequestration has 
forced our military to endure extreme reductions, dangerously affecting 
equipment, personnel, and training readiness. Under the order, 
Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis will review all aspects of military 
readiness.
  As chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, 
with four sons who have served overseas, I especially appreciate 
President Trump's commitment to rebuilding the military. It is critical 
for American families to ensure that our troops have the resources and 
training to accomplish their missions.
  This order is a positive first step, and I look forward to working 
alongside President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Speaker 
Paul Ryan, and Chairman Mac Thornberry as we ensure our troops have the 
resources they need to promote peace through strength.
  God bless our troops.
  We will never forget September the 11th in the global war on 
terrorism.
  Thank you, President Donald Trump, for vetting refugees to protect 
American families.
