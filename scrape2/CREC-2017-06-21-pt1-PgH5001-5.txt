                                 PRAYER

  Rabbi Hershel Lutch, MEOR Foundation, Baltimore, Maryland, offered 
the following prayer:
  Almighty God, we pray this day for wisdom, humility, courage, and 
Your beneficence.
  We pray that You endow the distinguished Members of this House with 
the wisdom to develop legislation that advances the noble aims of our 
Nation and the honorable needs of her citizens.
  Lord, we pray that You grant us humility to know that we are Your 
subjects and it is Your children for whom we toil.
  We pray for steadfast courage to champion justice with fortitude and 
to battle tyranny with vigor.
  O Lord, we pray this day that Your blessings of safety, success, and 
serenity rest on each Member, staff, and security officer of this 
House, and we pray that we might make continued room for Your presence 
in our hearts and in the soul of our great Nation.
  Gracious God, we thank You today and every day for the profound gift 
that these United States represent in our lives. Both for those here at 
home and for people around the world, America stands as a beacon of 
hope and leadership in times of challenge and conflict.
