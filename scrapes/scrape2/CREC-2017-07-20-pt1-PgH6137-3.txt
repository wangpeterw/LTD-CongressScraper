                               OBAMACARE

  (Mr. DeSANTIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, Republicans have promised for years to 
repeal and replace ObamaCare, and this effort has seemed to have 
stalled in the Senate.
  The best way to restart the ObamaCare repeal process is simple. Make 
Congress live under it.
  The President can make this happen. ObamaCare included a provision 
dropping the congressional health plans for Members of Congress and 
diverting Members to the ObamaCare exchanges where they would have to 
pay their own premiums. Yet an Obama administration regulation gutted 
this provision and provided lucrative taxpayer subsidies for Members 
thereby creating an illegal exemption for Congress under ObamaCare.
  Mr. President, cancel this regulatory exception. Make Members live 
under ObamaCare as written. If you make them live under ObamaCare, my 
guess is that they will vote to quickly repeal ObamaCare.
