                         TERROR ATTACK IN EGYPT

  (Mr. BUDD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, just last week, Egypt experienced the worst 
terror attack in its country's history. Islamic terrorists set off 
explosives that took over 300 innocent lives and injured over 100 more.
  What made this tragedy even worse is that it happened at a place of 
worship in the northern Sinai region. In their effort to wreak havoc on 
the Middle East and other parts of the world, the Islamic State and 
other terror groups have targeted Christians, Jews, and Muslims.
  President Trump was right to say, after the attack in Egypt, that we 
should strengthen our efforts to defeat terrorism and extremism in all 
of its forms. In the past year, we have made progress in deterring the 
Islamic State's so-called caliphate in Syria and in Iraq, and while 
their shadow in those two countries isn't nearly what it was a couple 
of years ago, this doesn't mean a radical Islamic insurgency won't 
remain in that area.
  Mr. Speaker, if military progress isn't coupled with a thought-out 
strategy of reconstruction, a vacuum will be left for these groups to 
return. As the beacon of freedom around the world, the United States 
must stay vigilant in our ongoing war on terror.
