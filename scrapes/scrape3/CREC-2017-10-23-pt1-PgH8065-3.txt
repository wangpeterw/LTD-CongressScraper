            CONGRATULATING FORT LEE ON 100 YEARS OF SERVICE

  (Mr. McEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of the 100th 
anniversary of the United States Army's Fort Lee in Prince George 
County, Virginia.
  The fort that we know today began as Camp Lee in 1917. Camp Lee 
served as a training base for hundreds of thousands of our country's 
bravest as they prepared for service in World Wars I and II, a 
tradition that has continued ever since, often in pathbreaking ways.
  In the late 1940s, Camp Lee became the home of the Women's Army Corp 
Training Center, which established a high-quality training facility for 
women who wished to serve their country.
  Mr. Speaker, Fort Lee continues to prepare men and women for their 
service as the home to the Combined Arms Support Command, the U.S. Army 
Ordnance School, the U.S. Army Quartermaster School, the U.S. Army 
Transportation School, and roughly 20 other organizations and units.
  Today and every day, we are grateful to all who have served at Fort 
Lee for a combined 100 years of dedication and honorable service.
