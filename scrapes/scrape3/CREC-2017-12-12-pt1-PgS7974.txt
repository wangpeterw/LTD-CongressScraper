              TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COMMANDER WENDY LEWIS

  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Lieutenant Commander 
Wendy Lewis of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
Commissioned Officer Corps, who has served as a fellow to the Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation Committee for the past 3 years. I thank 
Lieutenant Commander Lewis for all of the hard work she has done for 
me, my staff, and the entire committee.
  Lieutenant Commander Lewis has had a significant impact during her 
time as a fellow. Her expertise as a ship driver and manager of our 
Nation's natural resources has meaningfully informed the committee's 
efforts. She has worked on several pieces of legislation that have 
become law, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration Sexual Harassment and Assault Prevention Act and the 
Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017. Her 
contributions have enhanced the ability of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration to carry out its missions and bettered the 
lives of those who work there.
  I would like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to 
Lieutenant Commander Lewis for all of the fine work she has done and 
for her continued service to our Nation. I wish her success in the 
years to come.
