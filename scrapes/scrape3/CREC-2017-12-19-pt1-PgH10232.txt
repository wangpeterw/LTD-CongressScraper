                        THE TAX CUT IS A DEBACLE

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I hold in my hand the vote tally for 
the ``Tax No Jobs'' bill. It is interesting, when you are asked about 
the tax bill, they put the word ``jobs.''
  This was a very close vote, and 12 Republicans understood this was 
the worst vote, worst bill in the history of the United States; and the 
reason is, of course, because tens of millions of middle class 
households and those who need a tax break will not get it. $1.7 
trillion in debt.
  It eliminates tax benefits that directly impact the middle class, it 
results in 13 million fewer Americans with health insurance, it adds 
over $2 trillion in deficit spending, and it triggers PAYGO's automatic 
spending cuts to mandatory programs.
  So let me tell you, my voice is a little rough, but my heart is 
strong. Social Security to the American people, it is going to be cut. 
Medicare, it is going to be cut. The Medicaid, for those in nursing 
homes like my friend who I visited over the weekend, will be cut.
  And you know what? There will be no answer in jobs of corporations 
who got low tax rates, lower than you.
  This is a debacle so bad that it has to come back and we have to vote 
again for it.
  My voice is a little rough, but I am going out there to tell the 
American people that this is the worst calamity since we collapsed 
under the past Republican administration. Vote ``no'' every time you 
see this bill because it is ``no'' for the American people.
