                         BILL THREATENS OHIOANS

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today, Vice President Pence is expected to 
visit northeast Ohio for an appearance at a manufacturing firm. He will 
discuss the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and subsequently 
rip away healthcare for millions upon millions of Americans, as well as 
quadruple its cost to millions and millions more elderly.
  Ohioans should know that the bill the GOP is trying to ramrod through 
Congress would threaten nearly 1 million Ohioans who gained coverage 
over the last few years through the Affordable Care Act. Further, 
seniors would see their insurance premiums rise by four to five times 
as much, with nothing being done to lower their cost of medicine.
  Why is this administration making things worse for Ohio?
  We need to maintain Medicaid for the treatment of those Americans who 
are sick, suffering, in nursing homes, those who are mentally ill, and 
those who are suffering from terminal illness. The Pence-Trump doctrine 
will hurt them all.
  I hope the Vice President won't mislead our people about how many 
Ohioans will lose coverage.
  In fact, is the Vice President aware healthcare jobs help drive our 
economy in Ohio. The TrumpCare bill, which is really a tax break for 
millionaires, will cause an Ohio job loss of over 80,000 healthcare 
workers over the next 5 years.
  I urge the Vice President to meet with officials at Cleveland Clinic, 
MetroHealth, or the Sisters of Charity and hear what they have to say 
about the GOP's anti-life bill.
