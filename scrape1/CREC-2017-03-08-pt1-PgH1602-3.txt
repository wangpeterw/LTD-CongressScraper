                        AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT

  (Mr. WOODALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I rarely come down during the 1-minute time 
of the day, and I am glad I came down this morning for Father Conroy's 
prayer because there really is a lot of anxiety in this country as it 
relates to health care. Every family in this country has health care on 
their mind.
  The gentleman from Rhode Island is exactly right. We have an 
opportunity to work together to fix it because we all know the 
ObamaCare system is failing. That is why we talk about how to fix it 
because we know that it is failing.
  President Trump said on Monday that the Republican alternative is now 
open for review and negotiation. He didn't say take it or leave it. He 
didn't say pass it before you can read it. He said open for review and 
negotiation.
  I challenge my colleagues to think about our opportunity to serve not 
just one constituent, but all of our constituents. Think about our 
opportunity to come together and put this healthcare discord behind us 
for a generation.
  I thank Father Conroy for that admonition this morning. I hope we 
will rise to that challenge.
