                HONORING SCHOOL NUTRITION PROFESSIONALS

  (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
school nutrition professionals across the country and in my 
congressional district located in central and southwestern Illinois. 
From Monticello's Washington Elementary School, to Edwardsville's St. 
Boniface Catholic School, I have seen firsthand the great work they do 
in schools across my district.
  Now, as summer comes to an end and children head back to school, 
these professionals will be working hard to ensure students receive 
healthy and appealing meals, which is not an easy task. Each schoolday, 
nearly 100,000 schools serve lunch to 30.4 million students. Nutritious 
meals at school are an essential part of the day and help to nourish 
children and enable them to learn.
  This could never be possible without dedicated school nutrition 
professionals. School nutrition professionals are passionate about 
ensuring that students have access to the nutrition they need to 
succeed. I would like to take this opportunity to honor school 
nutrition professionals who should take pride in the work they do every 
single day.
  Thank you, and keep up the great work.
