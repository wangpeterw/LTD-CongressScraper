                       WE NEED SENSIBLE GUN LAWS

  (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart, imagining the 
pain felt in Parkland, Florida. No parent should have to send their 
children to school each day wondering if they will return home.
  While details of the shooting in Florida are still emerging, it is 
clear this horrific act of violence was perpetrated by an individual in 
crisis.
  I lost my older sister to suicide with a firearm at a young age. What 
I have learned since is that helping to prevent people in crisis from 
temporarily having a gun saves lives.
  Today, I urge my colleagues to support the Gun Violence Restraining 
Order Act, allowing family members or law enforcement officials to 
petition a judge to temporarily remove firearms from an individual in 
crisis.
  For those who keep repeating after each mass shooting that it is too 
soon to discuss gun violence reform, please consider that for many 
families, including my own, it is far too late.
  We owe these families more than just our thoughts and prayers. We owe 
them sensible gun laws that protect our children from needless gun 
violence.
