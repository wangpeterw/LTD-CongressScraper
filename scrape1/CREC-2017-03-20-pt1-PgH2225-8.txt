      CALIFORNIA'S FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT TOWNHALL MEETINGS

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this past Saturday, in my own First 
Congressional District of California, we had the first of our series of 
townhall meetings--this one in Nevada County at the Grass Valley 
fairgrounds.
  It was a good meeting. A bit raucous at times. There was 
disagreement, and there was some agreement as well. But I think it was 
a good dialogue to get started with the dialogue we need to have in 
northern California on the very important issues that we are working on 
here in Congress.

  There was agreement and disagreement on where we should go with the 
ACA treatment and where we should go with the funding of EPA. But what 
I am happiest about is that at least we were able to come together, 
1,400 people and me and my staff, and have a dialogue that, again, at 
times was a little loud, a little raucous, but also people looking 
forward to being able to hear each other and listen to each other on 
the issues that are important as we go forward in this Congress.
  I commend people in Nevada County for reaching out and for helping us 
get started with our outreach that we are going to have in northern 
California. Upcoming next will be Butte County, Shasta County, and the 
farther reaches a little bit later.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a good dialogue I need to have.
