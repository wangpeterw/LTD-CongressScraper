                                 PRAYER

  Chaplain Michael J. Halyard, South Texas Veterans Health Care System,

[[Page H8532]]

San Antonio, Texas, offered the following prayer:
  Merciful and loving God, source of life and constant guide to Your 
people, we ask Your blessings on our esteemed Representatives as they 
continue to help govern a course for our Nation and its citizens.
  In these days of disrepute and impropriety, keep them steadfast in 
their deliberations. Inspire them to continue in their journey to 
promote the values upon which this great Nation was founded: justice, 
liberty, equality, freedom, and peace.
  As Your blessings of goodness transcend into a dynamic of creativity, 
help us to see signs of hope born of pain as we often find ourselves 
present in the midst of uncertainty and suffering.
  May the vacuous space left by stains of catastrophic occurrences open 
the minds and hearts of all to deeper compassion and a new level of 
human understanding.
  May all that is done here today be for our American democracy while 
reflecting Your resplendent honor and glory.
  Amen.
