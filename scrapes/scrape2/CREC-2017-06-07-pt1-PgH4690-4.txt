                     NATIONAL CANCER SURVIVORS DAY

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, a few days ago on June 4, we recognized 
National Cancer Survivors Day to honor all of the incredible men and 
women who have battled cancer and have emerged triumphant.
  This year, an estimated 1.6 million new cases of cancer will be 
diagnosed, and nearly 700,000 people will die of cancer in the United 
States.
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists cancer now as 
the second leading cause of death. Fortunately, we are taking steps to 
lower those numbers. Last year's 21st Century Cures Act, a bipartisan 
initiative, authorized $1.8 billion in funding for the Cancer Moonshot 
Foundation, aids in cancer research, and strives to increase the 
availability of a wide variety of treatment options while also helping 
to help prevent cancer and detect it at early stages.
  Mr. Speaker, on National Cancer Survivors Day, we are grateful for 
those who have won their fight against cancer, and now we commit to 
honoring more survivors through research for new and improved cures.
