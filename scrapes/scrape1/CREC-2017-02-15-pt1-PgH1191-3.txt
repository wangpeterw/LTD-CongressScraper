                  TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT: IT'S TIME

  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, it is a bitter reality that universal 
human rights are under daily assault around the world.
  I rise today joining in celebration and in mourning with Chinese 
democracy activist Zhu Yufu. This past week, he turned 64, but he 
marked the occasion in prison.
  Zhu Yufu has devoted his life to promoting democracy and human 
rights, to the ire of Chinese authorities. In 2012, he was condemned to 
7 years imprisonment on unjust charges. Since then, his health has 
deteriorated, made worse by denial of medical care and inhumane 
treatment. His family fears for his life.
  The poem that led to Yufu's imprisonment is called ``It's Time.'' I 
completely agree. It is time. It is time for the Chinese government to 
provide Zhu Yufu with proper medical treatment and humane care. More 
than that, it is time for the Chinese Government to release Zhu Yufu 
and political prisoners like him who are unjustly detained. It is time 
for the Chinese Government to recognize and support freedom of speech, 
assembly, thought, and belief.
