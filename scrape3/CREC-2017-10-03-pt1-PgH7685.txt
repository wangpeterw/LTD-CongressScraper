                 A CALL TO RENEW YOUR STATUS UNDER DACA

  (Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because this Thursday, 
October 5, is an important deadline: 154,000 young men and women have 
until this Thursday to renew their status under the Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Those 154,000 DACA recipients, 
whose authorization expires before March 6, 2018, must renew their 
application.
  If you are one of them, please send in your application today. Under 
the new DACA rules, you are entitled to receive two more years of 
deferral, but only if the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services 
receives your application by October 5. If you have not already sent in 
your application, send it in the fastest way possible. A regular first 
class stamp will likely not arrive in time.
  My district is home to many DACA beneficiaries known as DREAMers. Do 
not wait. To all the other DREAMers, I say: Don't lose hope. You have 
the support of the vast majority of the American people, and we are 
fighting every day to get the Dream Act to the House floor.
