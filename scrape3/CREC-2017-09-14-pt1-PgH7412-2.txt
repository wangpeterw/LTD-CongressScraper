  MOMENT OF SILENCE ON 1-MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF CHARLOTTESVILLE TRAGEDY

  (Mr. McEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, today, I am joined by my colleagues from 
Virginia.
  As you know, Mr. Speaker, this past Tuesday marked the 1-month 
anniversary since we lost three Virginians in Charlottesville.
  Today, my colleagues and I stand here to observe a moment of silence 
in honor of Heather Heyer of Charlottesville, Virginia; Lieutenant H. 
Jay Cullen of Midlothian, Virginia; and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates 
of Quinton, Virginia.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House now observe a moment of silence.
