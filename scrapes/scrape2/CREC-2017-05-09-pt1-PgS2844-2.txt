                 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF McCORMICK COUNTY

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, November 2016 marked the 100th 
anniversary of the founding of McCormick County, the smallest and 
second youngest county in South Carolina. Known as the Gem of the 
Freshwater Coast, McCormick's rich history dates back to before our 
Nation's founding. The first overt act of the American Revolution in 
South Carolina occurred in McCormick County, at Fort Charlotte near 
Mount Carmel on July 12, 1775. McCormick continued to grow after the 
discovery of gold in 1850 and the expansion of the railroad. Today 
McCormick is known for its ``Natural Pace of Life,'' with ample outdoor 
recreation opportunities and hospitable citizens.
  On behalf of South Carolina and all of us here in the Senate, I offer 
congratulations to the entire McCormick County community on reaching 
this milestone. Best wishes for continued success and 
prosperity.
