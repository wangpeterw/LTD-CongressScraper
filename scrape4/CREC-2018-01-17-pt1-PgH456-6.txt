         150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF LOUISBURG, KANSAS

  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 150th 
anniversary of the founding of Louisburg, Kansas.
  Today, Louisburg kicks off its celebration at Louisburg City Hall, 
and although I cannot be there, I am honored to join in the celebration 
of this community I have the privilege of representing in Congress. 
Congratulations to Mayor Marty Southard, City Manager Nathan Law, and 
all the community leaders who have come together to recognize the 150th 
anniversary.
  Founded in 1868, Louisburg is a town of wonderful history, great 
people, outstanding public schools, booming businesses, and beautiful 
parks and lakes. Louisburg is home to a number of small businesses that 
have contributed to its success and growth.
  One of my favorite stops each fall is the Louisburg Cider Mill.

always have a great time watching the girls choose pumpkins, enjoy 
cider donuts, and take in all the fun fall activities.
  I am proud to represent Louisburg resident Joe Steffy of Poppin' 
Joe's Gourmet Kettle Korn, started in 2005. As a young man with Down 
syndrome and autism, Joe has testified before Congress as a small-
business leader, and I had the pleasure of meeting him on Capitol Hill.
  Mr. Speaker, these small businesses are just two examples of what 
makes Louisburg great. Congratulations to Louisburg, and I look forward 
to another great 150 years.
