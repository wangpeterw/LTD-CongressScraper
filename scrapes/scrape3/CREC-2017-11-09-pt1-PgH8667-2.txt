                  NOVEMBER IS DIABETES AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, November is Diabetes Awareness Month.
  Over 30 million children and adults, including myself, suffer from 
diabetes. Another 84 million have prediabetes, and 90 percent of them 
don't even know it.
  Diabetes can cause stroke, blindness, kidney disease, heart disease, 
loss of toes, feet, or even legs.
  In addition to the personal toll this disease takes on the lives of 
those affected, healthcare costs for diabetic patients are 2.3 times 
greater than for those without diabetes. This awful disease costs the 
healthcare system an estimated $322 billion.
  Rates of diabetes have risen dramatically, unfortunately, in recent 
years. We must do something to stop it. The U.S. Congress is working 
towards that end.
  I was proud to have worked on the 21st Century Cures Act, which 
invests in research for a cure. The bill streamlines the FDA approval 
process and provides more money for research to the NIH.
  There is much more we can do, Mr. Speaker, to tackle this serious 
public health issue.
