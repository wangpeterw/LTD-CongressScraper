                CONGRESSIONAL BASEBALL PRACTICE SHOOTING

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I join with the majority leader in 
offering our prayers for those who are injured.
  I was absolutely shaken by the news of a shooting early this morning 
at the baseball field in Alexandria where many of my friends and 
colleagues were practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game, 
an event that brings us together each year.
  It has been reported that Representative Scalise, the House whip, was 
shot during the attack, as were two brave members of the Capitol Police 
Force and others, including a staffer. Let us pray that they and any 
others who were injured are able to recover quickly.
  This morning is the most sobering reminder of how thankful we should 
be for the service of the Capitol Police Force, who put their lives on 
the line day in and day out for us to be safe. I could not be more 
grateful that Capitol Police was there at a time to prevent this attack 
from being any worse than it was. I was in the gym with Senator Paul, 
who had been there, and he had told me that, had these two Capitol 
police officers, who were part of Congressman Scalise's detail, not 
been there, it might have been a massacre because there would have been 
no one to respond. But their bravery is exemplary of all the Capitol 
Police Force, and we thank them.
  The entire Senate family sends its thoughts and prayers to those who 
were wounded and our gratitude to the police officers and first 
responders who were at the scene.
  I yield the floor.
