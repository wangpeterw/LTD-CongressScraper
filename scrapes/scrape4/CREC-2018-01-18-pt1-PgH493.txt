             RECOGNIZING UDAP INDUSTRIES IN BUTTE, MONTANA

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the critical 
work of UDAP Industries, a company in Butte, Montana, that produces 
self-defense sprays. It was founded by Mark Matheny, a survivor of a 
grizzly bear attack.
  When you are in bear country, bear spray is critically important. 
Citing concerns about the ozone layer, the EPA moved, in 2015, to ban 
the propellant used to make bear spray shoot out of the canister. EPA 
suggested a replacement that was half as effective, undermining safety. 
Rather than give in and make a less effective, inferior product, UDAP 
and others petitioned the EPA to reconsider.
  After my office and others worked with the EPA to waive the ban for 
bear spray, EPA did the right thing and waived the ban that would have 
created a safety hazard. I will continue working with UDAP and others 
to ensure that they are not burdened by unnecessary Federal 
regulations.
