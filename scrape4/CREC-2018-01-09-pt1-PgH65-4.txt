                         WOMEN AND THE TAX SCAM

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, last month, Republicans rammed through a 
terrible tax bill with devastating consequences, and women are among 
the hardest hit. This tax plan drains funds from working mothers while 
giving huge tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy.
  Women are breadwinners for half of the American families with 
children. These women often do more work for less pay.
  Nearly six in ten workers in low-wage jobs are women. Women earn 82 
cents on the dollar. In Michigan, it is even lower: 74 cents.
  The tax plan takes away the individual mandate, so 9.5 million women 
could lose healthcare--annual exams, birth control, cancer screening, 
pregnancy support--and lose economic security.
  Under this new law, the wealthiest continue to prosper at the expense 
of hardworking women in this country. We deserve better in America. 
People deserve better than this reckless tax bill.
