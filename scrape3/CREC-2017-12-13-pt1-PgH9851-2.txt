                      GRANDFATHER RANGER DISTRICT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Grandfather 
Ranger District of the Pisgah National Forest and community partners.
  Recently, the Grandfather Ranger District of the Pisgah National 
Forest received the coveted 2017 Restored and Resilient Landscapes 
Award from the U.S. Forest Service southern region.
  The Ranger District received this award due to efforts to produce a 
healthy and more diverse forest. This project, which began in 2012, has 
exceeded its goal of restoring 40,000 acres of forest for parkgoers to 
enjoy.
  Specifically, collaborative partners have worked together to remove 
understory fuels to decrease wildfire risk, restore shortleaf pines, 
and increase wildlife openings, while improving areas for deer and 
other wildlife to forage.
  These combined efforts of the Grandfather Ranger District and 
collaborative partners have yielded fantastic results for our community 
and our forests.
  I know that these efforts will benefit generations of outdoor 
enthusiasts and conservationists for years to come. I salute the 
Grandfather Ranger District and the many partners who earn the Restored 
and Resilient Landscapes Award.
