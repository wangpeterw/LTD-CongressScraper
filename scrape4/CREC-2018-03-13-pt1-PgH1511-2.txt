     HONORING THE TOP 10 FEMALE HIP-HOP COLLABORATIONS OF ALL TIME

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Jeffries) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, throughout the years, artists such as 
Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and Bruce Springsteen have been 
recognized on the floor of the House of Representatives.
  Today I rise to honor the top 10 female MC hip-hop collaborations of 
all time.
  Number 10: Eve, ``My Chick Bad remix.''
  Number 9: Monie Love, ``My Buddy.''
  Number 8: Missy Elliott, ``Hot Boyz remix.''
  Number 7: Remy Ma, ``Ante Up remix.''
  Number 6: Lauryn Hill, ``Ready or Not.''
  Number 5: Nicki Minaj, ``Up All Night.''
  Number 4: Da Brat, ``Da B Side.''

  Number 3: Lady of Rage, ``G Funk Intro.''
  Number 2: Fox Boogie Brown, ``Ain't No.''
  Number 1: Representing BK to the fullest, Lil' Kim, ``Quiet Storm 
remix.''
  These extraordinary MCs, along with legendary pioneers such as Queen 
Latifah, MC Lyte, and Salt-N-Pepa, shattered hip-hop's glass ceiling 
with their skill, talent, and lyrical ability.
  As we celebrate Women's History Month here in the United States 
Congress, these dynamic women are worthy to be praised.
