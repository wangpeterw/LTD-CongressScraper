                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Mighty God, the source of all life and the light of all seeing, lift 
our thoughts from the smallness of our labors to the greatness of Your 
majesty.
  We pray for the victims of the terrorism in the United Kingdom.
  Teach our lawmakers to love in the presence of hate, to forgive in 
the presence of injustice, and to illuminate in the presence of 
darkness. Make them light bearers in the midst of darkness as they 
strive to live lives that reflect Your glory. Lord, may the promise of 
Your love be experienced in all their relationships.
  Be for us all a helper and a shelter in the time of storm.
  And Lord, we thank You for the life and legacy of Jim Bunning.
  We pray in Your righteous Name. Amen.
