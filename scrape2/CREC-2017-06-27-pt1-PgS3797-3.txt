      SISSETON-WAHPETON SIOUX TRIBE'S SESQUICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION

 Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 150th 
anniversary of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe's treaty with the U.S. 
Government, which coincides with the Tribe's 150th annual Fourth of 
July celebration.
  Beginning in 1867, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota Nation's annual 
Fourth of July Wacipi is the oldest continual event in South Dakota and 
one of the oldest established celebrations in the Nation. The Sisseton-
Wahpeton Sioux Tribe is dedicated to maintaining their culture in the 
modern world through art, language, spirituality, and traditions, all 
of which is celebrated during its annual Fourth of July Wacipi. They 
also use the celebration to honor area veterans who bravely fought 
defending our freedoms.
  The story of the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands is one of movement of 
the Native people that made their home on the Lake Traverse 
Reservation, where they still celebrate today. Here, Tribal members 
draw on their rich history, continue their traditions, and contribute 
to a vibrant, growing economy in the area.
  On behalf of all South Dakotans, I wish to congratulate the Sisseton-
Wahpeton Sioux Tribe on their sesquicentennial celebration. I thank 
them for their treaty, friendship, and alliance with the United States 
of America over the past 150 years and look forward to continuing our 
friendship in the 150 years to come.
