                     REJECT SENATE HEALTHCARE BILL

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, another Republican 
healthcare bill that the nonpartisan, bipartisan Congressional Budget 
Office tells us will rip away healthcare from 22 million Americans, 
raise premiums--especially on older Americans--and cut Medicaid by 
roughly $800 billion.
  The Senate Republican's plan is especially cruel for New York City. 
Not only will millions lose coverage, but sharp Medicaid cuts will cost 
hospitals over $5 billion, and fewer seniors will be able to afford 
nursing homes and home care providers.
  But the bill saves its worst for women. It cuts Federal funding for a 
year for Planned Parenthood clinics that provide essential healthcare 
to millions of American women. It allows States to easily waive 
guaranteed coverage for benefits like maternity. In short, women will 
have to pay more for essential healthcare because we are women, and 
women will have less access to healthcare because we are women.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to reject this cruel and merciless 
bill.
