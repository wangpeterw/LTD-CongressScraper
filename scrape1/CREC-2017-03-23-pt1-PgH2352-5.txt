                    THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE WATCHING

  (Ms. VELAZQUEZ asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, today House Republicans are preparing to 
vote to rip away health care from 24 million Americans, 2.7 million of 
them in New York. In my district, 122,000 people will lose coverage, 
including 12,700 children. Those who do retain coverage will pay more 
for less, with deductibles and premiums skyrocketing.
  This is what House Republicans plan to put on the floor today. It is 
a plan that benefits the healthy and the wealthy while hurting everyone 
else. If you have a preexisting condition and your coverage lapses, 
under TrumpCare, get ready to pay more.
  Are you a senior? Good luck affording medical coverage if TrumpCare 
becomes law. You are going to pay the insurance company five times more 
than younger people.
  Mr. Speaker, the American people see this for what it is, a direct 
assault on the vulnerable in order to give a tax cut to the wealthy and 
the healthy. Reject TrumpCare.
