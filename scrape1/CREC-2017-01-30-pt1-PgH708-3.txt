               OPEN YOUR HEARTS TO THE REST OF THE WORLD

  (Mr. CAPUANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, this is my first 1-minute in 20 years--
first one--and I am here today to basically call out my colleagues who 
remained silent this weekend as Lady Liberty shed tears.
  It is not about extreme vetting. No one has concerns about punching 
it up a little bit. This weekend we took people from around this world 
who are legally, legally, legally coming to our country, many of whom 
have been through every single vetting we can give them. We embarrassed 
ourselves and them in what we did this weekend.
  Where is the terror threat from a 5-year-old child?
  Where is the terror threat from a professor coming to MIT or a 
research scientist coming in?
  There is none. Not one of the seven countries mentioned provided one 
single terrorist.
  And for those people who say, I am here just to protect our country, 
I have been in Boston all of my life. The largest numbers of people 
came out from New York City and Boston. It was our people who lost 
their lives, yet we remain humanistic and openhearted.
  Open your hearts to the rest of the world.
