                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS

                                 ______
                                 

SENATE RESOLUTION 219--DESIGNATING JULY 13, 2017, AS ``SUMMER LEARNING 
  DAY'', A DAY TO REFLECT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING YOUNG PEOPLE 
WITH SAFE, PRODUCTIVE, AND ENRICHING ACTIVITIES EVERY SUMMER, ENSURING 
THE YOUNG PEOPLE RETURN TO SCHOOL IN THE FALL WITH THE SKILLS VITAL TO 
                       SUCCEED IN THE YEAR AHEAD

  Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Hatch) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 219

       Whereas summer learning loss widens an already existing 
     achievement gap that stays constant during the 9-month school 
     year;
       Whereas summer learning loss disproportionately impacts the 
     learning of children from lower-income households or with 
     special educational needs;
       Whereas, during the summer, students lose approximately 2 
     months of grade level equivalency in math computation skills 
     and low-income students lose an additional 2 months in 
     reading achievement;
       Whereas effective summer programs can bridge the eighth to 
     ninth grade transition and strategically decrease dropout 
     rates of high risk students;
       Whereas only 1 in 7 students received the nutrition and 
     meals they needed during the summer of 2016;
       Whereas summer learning programs contribute to the academic 
     and social growth of students, provide safe and healthy 
     spaces for children during the summer, and give young people 
     the tools necessary for success in school;
       Whereas summer youth employment programs provide young 
     people with access to meaningful experiences that foster 
     interest in potential careers, encourage financial and 
     personal responsibility, and emphasize community engagement;
       Whereas many organizations, including public agencies, 
     schools, libraries, museums, recreation centers, camps, and 
     businesses, assist with the personal development of young 
     people through summer activities;
       Whereas students who do not receive supervision during the 
     summer are far more likely to receive poor grades, exhibit 
     behavioral issues, and drop out of school;
       Whereas summer learning contributes to increasing high 
     school graduation rates; and
       Whereas summer learning is a crucial component in ensuring 
     that all students graduate from high school and emerge ready 
     for the next endeavor, which may be to attend college or 
     start a career: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate designates July 13, 2017, as 
     ``Summer Learning Day''.
