               FRANCISCAN COMMUNITY DEPARTS CONWELL-EGAN

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, over the last 60 years, the Franciscan 
Friars shaped the lives of many students and families that have passed 
through the halls of Conwell-Egan Catholic High School in lower Bucks 
County. It is with a heavy heart that I rise today to announce the 
departure of the Franciscan community from Conwell-Egan.
  If you went to Egan like me, then you knew Father Fidelis and Brother 
Larry. Their service and the service of more than 150 other Friars who 
have ministered there have brought profound grace and enrichment to the 
lives of so many young men and women throughout lower Bucks County.
  The Franciscan Order at Conwell-Egan reinforced the school mission of 
building character through service, achieving academic excellence, and 
demonstrating a commitment to a life full of learning.
  Myself, my family, and the entire lower Bucks County community are 
forever grateful for their continuous guidance and their continuous 
support. As we say good-bye to these exemplary individuals, true 
representatives of St. Francis, we wish them the best as they move on 
to their next mission.
