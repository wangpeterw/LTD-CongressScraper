                  REQUESTING THE RELEASE OF DOCUMENTS

  (Mr. ZELDIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, yesterday I went to the Capitol basement, 
where I read a classified document that angered me. It was frustrating. 
It was disappointing. It was also greatly enlightening.
  The American people deserve, they must, they want to know what is in 
this document. Release the memo. Release the memo and all of the 
related material sourced in the memo. Release the file.
  There is no concern--there should not be--for compromising any good 
sources and methods by releasing the memo and releasing the file. What 
it would reveal is the Fed's reliance on bad sources and methods.
  The American public deserves the truth. We should not hide the truth 
from them. They have waited too long. Do not pull the wool over their 
eyes. Show them the facts. They deserve nothing less.
