                  PAY MORE AND GET LESS WITH TRUMPCARE

  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, under the Republican healthcare plan, 
TrumpCare, hardworking Americans will pay more and get less. Your 
premiums will increase. Your copays will increase. Your deductibles 
will increase. Your out-of-pocket costs will increase. But the quality 
of your health care will go down.
  Tens of millions of Americans under TrumpCare will also lose their 
entire health coverage. And under the Republican healthcare plan, it 
will impose a draconian age tax on people between 50 and 64, some of 
whom will be forced to pay approximately $14,000 per year.
  Trump has said he is going to do health care in three phases. I have 
finally figured it out. Phase one, disease. Phase two, disaster. Phase 
three, destruction. Vote ``no'' against this reckless plan.
