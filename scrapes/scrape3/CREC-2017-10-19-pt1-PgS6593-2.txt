                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Savior, we thank You for the fellowship of Your Spirit and 
Your consolations of love. May our lawmakers remember that You are 
their rock and refuge. Lord, speak peace to their hearts in these 
turbulent times, guiding them along the path of Your wisdom. Reward 
their efforts with a joyful harvest, as they strive to build up and not 
tear down. Raise them above discord and division, helping them to work 
together to keep America strong.
  We are grateful for the favor You have given this Nation and for 
surrounding us with the shield of Your compassion, mercy, and love. 
Strong Deliverer, accept our grateful praise.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
