     RECOGNIZING MIAMI JEWISH HEALTH SERVICES; EMPATHICARE VILLAGE

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Miami 
Jewish Health Systems as they break ground on their cutting-edge memory 
care facility to be called the S. Donald Sussman EmpathiCare Village. 
This facility will serve as an essential resource to many elderly 
individuals in south Florida who find themselves in need of mental 
health services. The Sussman EmpathiCare Village will also host 
researchers working on cutting-edge memory care treatment.
  This new facility is just the latest accomplishment in the Miami 
Jewish Health Systems' long tradition of service in our community. For 
over 75 years, this wonderful organization and its staff have provided 
compassionate healthcare with dignity and respect and helped those most 
in need in south Florida to live longer, healthier, and more enriched 
lives.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored that such an amazing institution is located 
in south Florida, and it is a pleasure to recognize that the S. Donald 
Sussman EmpathiCare Village is now a reality. Thanks again to MJHS, and 
mazel tov on a job well done.
