minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ducks Unlimited 
on its 80th anniversary. Over the past eight decades, Ducks Unlimited 
has partnered with local communities and Members of Congress to support 
conservation of millions of acres of waterfowl habitats across North 
America.
  As a lifelong outdoorsman, I know the value of these habitats and the 
benefits that they provide to countless Americans who enjoy these areas 
for a wide array of recreational and scientific activities.
  We must ensure the preservation of these habitats for future 
generations, and I know that Ducks Unlimited will work to ensure this 
goal for another 80 years.
  I would like to extend my thanks and congratulations to DU and wish 
them continued success for many generations to come.
