                       FIGHTING TO REINSTATE DACA

  (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, straight from the 
train, I had the opportunity to join fellow Delawarians for a rally in 
support of DREAMers in our State and across our country. These are 
young adults who were brought to America as children. This is the only 
home they know.
  I have had the opportunity to hear from some of the 75 DREAMers at 
Delaware State University. Every single one of them is excelling. They 
are part of our future.
  Ending DACA will cost Delaware's GDP $88 million, and create a loss 
of nearly $460 billion for our country.
  America thrives on our diversity. We have a moral obligation to stand 
up for these young Americans, and I will continue to join my colleagues 
in fighting to reinstate DACA.
