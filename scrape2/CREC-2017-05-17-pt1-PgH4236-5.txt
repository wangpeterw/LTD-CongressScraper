                   COMPROMISING SENSITIVE INFORMATION

  (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, I find it deeply disturbing that highly 
classified intelligence information from Israel, our indispensable 
ally, was carelessly compromised by President Trump in a meeting with 
Russian officials.
  By recklessly sharing this sensitive intelligence, the President has 
not only endangered our troops, intelligence officials, and sources who 
risk their lives every day to keep us safe, but he has jeopardized the 
relationship we have with our most important ally in the Middle East, 
Israel.
  If we wish to defeat ISIS, the President must rectify this 
unacceptable blunder. The American people must receive immediate 
assurances that this administration is doing everything necessary to 
repair any damage caused by the President's reckless actions.
  The role of Commander in Chief is one that must be taken seriously 
and should never result in the compromising of our most sensitive 
information, especially to a foreign adversary at the expense of one of 
our strongest allies.
