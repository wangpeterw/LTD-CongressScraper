                      100 DAYS OF BROKEN PROMISES

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday marks 100 days of broken 
promises made to the American worker by the Trump administration. On 
the campaign trail, he promised to fight for the American worker and 
create jobs right here at home. Since he has taken office, he has done 
the opposite.
  During the first few weeks of his administration, the President 
signed an executive order to raise mortgage rates for new homeowners. 
The administration also killed worker protections for individual 
workers in this country, and then they also have done nothing, 
absolutely nothing to deal with Davis-Bacon and prevailing wages, which 
guarantees American workers the right to earn more money. Finally, the 
administration gutted another protection that would have made it harder 
for companies to secure Federal contracts if they have a history of 
labor law violations.
  It is more than clear that this administration does not plan to fight 
for the American worker, the American man and woman out there making it 
every day in America. Instead, they are doing everything they can to 
help the President's billionaire buddies and to promote golf courses 
and other businesses that they own.
  Mr. Speaker, that is why we will continue to stand up to the 
administration when it turns its back on working class Americans.
