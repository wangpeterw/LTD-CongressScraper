                         REMEMBERING FRANK HESS

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember my neighbor and 
longtime friend, Frank Hess, who formerly served as special assistant 
to the legendary New York State Assembly member Denny Farrell, who, for 
many years, chaired the prestigious Ways and Means Committee.
  Frank was known for his cowboy hats and brutal honesty. He devoted 
his life to public service and spent almost 30 years in government. He 
was a devoted godfather, uncle, and father figure to anyone in the 
community who knew him. He once called 20 stores and drove for 2 hours 
to try to find a pair of shoes for his niece.
  Frank was a devoted person to his family and his community. Through 
his lifetime devotion to public service, he made sure Washington 
Heights was a better place for all of us. Frank could accomplish 
anything he set his mind to and he could unite different groups of 
people despite any racial, ethnic, or religious differences. He lived 
his life demonstrating what it means to be a contributing citizen and 
to serve as a role model for those, like myself, who were fortunate to 
know him.
  I will miss Frank Hess. He will forever be missed by our community.
