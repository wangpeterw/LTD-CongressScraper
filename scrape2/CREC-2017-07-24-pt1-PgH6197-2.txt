                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, July 24, 2017, I was 
unavoidably detained attending to a funeral in my home state. Thus, I 
was not present for the rollcall votes that were cast. Had I been 
present, I would have voted as follows:
  1. H.R. 3180--Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018--I 
would have voted ``no.''
  2. S. 114--A bill to authorize appropriations for the Veterans Choice 
Program--I would have voted ``no.''
  3. H.R. 3218--Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act--I 
would have voted ``yes.''

                          ____________________
