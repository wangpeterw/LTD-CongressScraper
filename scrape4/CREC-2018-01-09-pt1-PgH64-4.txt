      HONORING JORDAN THOMAS FOR RECEIVING THE RHODES SCHOLARSHIP

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jordan Thomas, a senior 
at Princeton University and a graduate of University High School in 
Newark, New Jersey, for being selected as a 2018 Rhodes Scholar, one of 
only 32 in the country.
  This young man, who graduated high school in my district, is the 
first Newark Public Schools student in over a decade to receive this 
prestigious honor.
  In addition to getting straight A's since his freshman year at 
Princeton, Jordan is writing a thesis on school-based support services 
that Newark Public Schools offers pregnant and parenting teens.
  In the next year, he will be taking his talents abroad to study 
social policy at Oxford College in England. Jordan plans to return to 
his home of Newark as a public servant. He told the Star Ledger 
newspaper: ``Newark built me. Newark shaped me.'' As a lifelong 
resident of Newark myself, I know that feeling.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Jordan 
Thomas for his successes, service, and future. His love for his 
community shows that our country's future is in good hands.
