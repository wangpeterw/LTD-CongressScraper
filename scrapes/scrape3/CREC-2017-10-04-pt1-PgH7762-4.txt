                  CELEBRATE NATIONAL MANUFACTURING DAY

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, this Friday we celebrate National 
Manufacturing Day. The economist, Peter Navarro, recently said that 
manufacturing is the seed for all other jobs in the United States. I 
couldn't agree more. Manufacturers are the pioneers, the innovators, 
and the people who bring ideas to life.
  With over 20 percent of Florida's manufacturers located in the Tampa 
Bay area, I am proud of the fact that there are more than 2,500 
manufacturers in and around my district. Their work couldn't be more 
essential to our community and our country.
  It is our job to support manufacturing and to create a business 
environment in which they can thrive. This means passing meaningful tax 
reform, eliminating regulations that stifle the industry, and 
encouraging STEM education, which is needed for workforce development.
  I look forward to continuing to work on these important issues as we 
embrace the full potential of what it means to make it in America: Made 
in America.
