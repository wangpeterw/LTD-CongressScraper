                         REMEMBERING DAVID CULP

  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to learn of the 
passing of my dear friend David Culp in early February. As one of the 
leaders of the arms control community for decades, David was an 
indefatigable advocate for reducing the threat of catastrophic nuclear 
war and stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In particular, 
David's work was critical for Senate ratification of the New START 
Treaty, which established limits on the number of deployed strategic 
nuclear weapons in the United States and Russia.
  More recently, David worked closely with my staff on a number of arms 
control initiatives, including my efforts to scale back the Pentagon's 
trillion-dollar nuclear spending spree, restrain excessive and 
destabilizing missile defense systems, and cancel a new nuclear-armed 
cruise ``missile that would make Americans less safe.
  I will miss David's wisdom, humor, and strategic insight, but I am 
comforted to know that his legacy lives on in the robust and committed 
arms control community he helped lead. I will continue to be inspired 
by David's memory, and I offer my deepest condolences to his friends 
and his family.
