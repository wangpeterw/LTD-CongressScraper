                 NEW YORK CITY ATTEMPTED TERROR ATTACK

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, as we continue to learn more details 
about the attempted terror attack this morning in Manhattan, I wish to 
commend the law enforcement and intelligence community that quickly 
reacted to the attack. Their courage in the face of danger protected 
the lives of those around them.
