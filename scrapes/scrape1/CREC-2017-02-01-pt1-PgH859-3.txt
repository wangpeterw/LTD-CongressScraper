     MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING VICTIMS OF QUEBEC TERRORIST ATTACK

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining 
me tonight to stand in solidarity with our neighbors in Canada, and 
honor the victims of the January 29 terrorist attack at the Quebec 
Islamic Cultural Center in Quebec City.
  A house of worship is a place of refuge, peace, and reflection, but 
for the 6 people killed, the 19 wounded, and the entire community, that 
hallowed ground is now tainted--yet, shall always remain covered in 
love.
  Let our presence here serve as a reminder that we will stand up 
against bigotry and hatred wherever it takes place.
  I now ask my colleagues to bow their heads and join us for a moment 
of silence.
