But when the funds in question are placed under the appropriations process and are subject to being swept for other Federal spending measures, I hope that bothers you--not strikes you as odd, but bothers you.

It is not like we are hiding anything. And I missed the part where it says, oh, the fact that they are not taxpayer funds makes it okay that we go ahead and try to sweep those into that.  I also missed the fact, quite frankly, that this is different than something like the Bureau of Consumer Protection folks who were an out-of-control executive branch agency using federally appropriated funds to do as they darn well please.  I missed the fact where we have got a problem with credit unions taking care of their own administration and their own insurance.  And I, finally, missed the fact where, quite frankly, we have absolutely no problem with respect to these folks' performance record.  So when you talk about going out and getting nontaxpayer-generated funds and saying we are going to bring those--by the way, good luck for these folks to get under our budgeting process. I won't say anything more than that, Mr.Good luck.  Whose budget are they going under? Who are we waiting for approval so we can say keep doing the things the way you were?  So I will just say that this is a problem that does not exist with a solution that is being applied because of other regulators, which I agree with, but it is like to suggest, quite frankly, that the CHOICE Act was perfect and doesn't need a second look on a small thing like this, I mean, hats off to the committee.

Mr.Chairman, the examples raised by my friend, the gentleman from Minnesota, really have nothing to do with the provisions of the bill that the amendment seeks to strike. What the bill does do, the underlying bill, and I thank the gentleman from Georgia for including this in the Financial Services Appropriations bill--what the bill does is make targeted adjustments so that manufactured home loans are available in the market.  Again, consumer protection is not denying people access to affordable housing, and that is what the gentleman's amendment would do.  The Dodd-Frank Act does prevent predatory lending, but nothing in this language changes that at all. Instead of unrelated stories about consumer protections that the bill's provision will not change, let's get back to talking about how consumers are actually harmed by the rules we are seeking to change.  Look, let's talk about real people who are affected negatively by overreach by the CFPB and Dodd-Frank, people in my district in Kentucky, in rural Kentucky where manufactured housing is one of the best affordable options and less expensive than renting.  Let's talk about the hospital worker in Paducah, Kentucky, who was denied a loan of $38,500 to finance a manufactured home. He had an 8 percent down payment. His monthly income was $2,200 per month, plenty to cover the all-in housing costs of $670 per month.  The payment for his own home would have been less than what he was spending on rent, but he was unable to get financing. Why? Because of the CFPB; because of Dodd-Frank; because of overregulation. He contacted his local banks and credit unions, but they no longer financed manufactured homes because of overregulation.  Those harmed include those who currently live in and those who seek to purchase a manufactured home: retirees, veterans, working families, et cetera.  And the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data is clear. Consumers have been shut out of the market for quality affordable housing because regulations have caused financing to be less available for manufactured homes.  I want to reserve the balance of my time, and I want to give some other Members an opportunity to say something about this, but I do want to just conclude by saying, this amendment, again, is not about consumer protection.

62,topic-id,537,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment simply preserves the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's independent funding and ensures that it is adequately funded. That is essentially what this is all about. This is very clear. The sides on this couldn't be more clear. My amendment is one of many this week, but I hope that people pay special attention to how folks vote on this particular amendment.  This amendment is a clear litmus test. If a legislator wants to support[[Page H7346]]the work of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, if they want to support the work of $11.5 billion being returned to consumers, they should vote ``yes.''  A ``yes'' vote on my amendment means you want to protect Americans from fraud, deceptive practices, and rip-off schemes.  A ``yes'' vote means you want banks, debt collectors, credit reporting agencies, payday lenders, and other finance companies to be held accountable if they rip off consumers.  A ``yes'' vote means that you want honest and fair-dealing firms in the financial services space to be rewarded for their good work and for people who take advantage of consumers to be punished.  We want to keep good companies good. How can you do that if good and bad get treated just alike?  We need the My amendment asks that you stand with Ari Booras, for example. As you may have seen on ``CBS Sunday Morning'' a few weeks ago, Harry Booras contacted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's consumer complaint center for help. His teenage son, Ari, joined the Army, just like mine did, and bought a used truck at a car dealer near his base.  My boy was 18 when he went to the Ari was the same age, I imagine. Yet that desire was taken advantage of.  Teenage Ari joined the Army and bought a used truck at a car dealer near the base. The loan was way more than this private could possibly afford, with an extensive extended warranty and 18.5 percent interest. Private Booras would have paid three times more than Blue Book value for this $11,000 truck. He would have paid three times more. Yet he can't afford three times more. He is just a private trying to serve his country.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau got Private Booras and 50,000 other servicemembers out of these predatory loans that ruin their finances and cause enormous stress in their lives. We need servicemembers thinking about protecting the country, not how to fight off some predatory lender.  My amendment asks that you stand with Samir Hanef from Durham, North Samir was one of more than half a million people who was wrongly charged for auto insurance when he took out a loan to buy a Honda  Samir, a social worker, already had insurance, but Wells Fargo charged him and 20,000 others, customers, added insurance that made them miss payments. This led to their cars being repossessed in some cases.  The numerous scandals at Wells Fargo--the forced insurance, fake accounts, overcharges at mortgage closing, signing customers up for life insurance without their consent, and other fraudulent practices--are coming to light because of the work of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its consumer complaint office.

On behalf of the manufactured homeowners we      represent, we our offering our organizational support for      this amendment.       MHAction empowers homeowners and residents in manufactured      home communities to build and win local, state and national      issue campaigns that strengthen the long-term viability and      affordability of their communities. The work of MHAction is      based on a set of core values, central to which are      compassion for our neighbors and love of our communities. We      believe that manufactured home communities play a key role in      providing affordable, safe and accessible housing for all      families, regardless of race, language, immigration status,      class, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. MHAction      currently represents over 19,000 manufactured homeowners in      28 states.       It is vital that this amendment passes to protect      manufactured home buyers, especially people of color that      face higher levels of lending discrimination and seniors. We      need to ensure that the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau      retains the power to ensure that potential home buyers aren't      steered into high fee and high interest loans. When people      buy a home, it should help increase their stability and      wealth, not damage their finances.       Again, we would like to express our sincere thanks to your      office for fighting to ensure that the Consumer Finance      Protection Bureau can continue to protect manufactured home      buyers from loans that strip away their economic and      retirement security.       Should you have any question, please feel free to contact      MHAction's Executive Director, Kevin Our organization      can easily put your office in touch with purpose-driven      community leaders in numerous states that have been fighting      to strengthen the economic and retirement security of      manufactured homeowners.

Representative Keith Ellison,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Ellison: On behalf of the 17 million      people nationwide who live in manufactured homes, we offer      our support for the Ellison Amendment 200 to the      Department of the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies      Act of 2018 (H.3354).       This amendment prevents the roll back of vital Dodd-Frank      consumer protections that would be especially harmful to low-      and moderate-income families. Contrary to claims made by      those making these changes, the current manufactured housing      provisions in H.3354 would not expand access to credit and      would not serve the interests of homeowners and communities.      Instead, this bill would undermine already vulnerable      homeowners by stripping away protections created by Congress      and implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection       These protections were put in place for a reason: to give      manufactured-home owners the same protections as traditional      home owners. The last housing crisis showed that exorbitant      loan pricing was a particular area of abuse. Congress and the      CFPB decided to protect homeowners from these practices, but      the current language in H.3354 would repeal these      protections for the buyers of manufactured homes.       The severity of this problem has been well-documented by      investigations such as the one conducted by The Seattle Times      and the Center for Public In a series of articles      published in 2015, it was reported that ``former dealers said      the company encouraged them to steer buyers to finance with      Clayton's own high-interest lenders.'' The investigation      concluded that industry leader, ``Clayton relies on predatory      sales practices, exorbitant fees, and interest rates that can      exceed 15 percent, trapping many buyers in loans they can't      afford and in homes that are almost impossible to sell or      refinance.''       We support the Ellison Amendment 200 to H.3354 in      order to retain the CFPB's efforts to protect manufactured      home buyers from high cost loans. Please feel free to contact      us with any questions.

79,topic-id,623,"I am also very proud of the residents of the Park Plaza, a[[Page H7348]]manufactured home resident-owned community in my district.  They tell me that being steered to high-cost loans makes homeownership more costly for families. Before Dodd-Frank and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the manufactured home loan market was notoriously predatory.  For example, a story in The Seattle Times, which I recommend Members read, tells the story of Kirk and Patricia Ackley, a construction worker and a Walmart employee in Washington  More than a decade ago, they bought a new manufactured home big enough for their children and room to care for Patricia's dad, who had dementia. But their dream became a nightmare when the promised 7 percent interest rate was raised to 12.5 percent.  This family faced crisis when this raised their monthly payment from $700 to $1,100. They had already invested $11,000 to build the concrete foundation for their new home. They took the loan, but it destroyed their finances and nearly cost them their marriage. The home was repossessed.  A 2015 investigation by the Center for Public Integrity and The Seattle Times interviewed more than 280 customers of Clayton One person they interviewed was a member of the Navajo She said she learned about Clayton on Navajo radio.  The ad recommended that she talk to a specific Navajo-speaking salesperson at a lot outside of the reservation. He told her that Vanderbilt Mortgage was the only source of finance for homes on the reservation. He didn't tell her the truth and overcharged her.  Now it is illegal for a salesperson to steer buyers to high-cost loans because of new rules from the Consumer Financial Protection But section 915 of the bill weakens those protections. Loans with high interest rates can be especially devastating to buyers of mobile homes since houses often depreciate quickly.  A buyer with a high rate will still owe a large sum for many years on a home that can be almost impossible to sell or finance. That is because the value of the home can fall below the loan balance.  Opponents of my amendment say that they want to help manufactured home buyers. That is a good thing. Yet none of them have cosponsored H.515, which would provide low-cost loans to owners of outdated mobile homes so they can buy ENERGY STAR homes, which would reduce their bills and save energy. None of them have joined me to cosponsor the Frank Adelmann Manufactured Housing Community Sustainability Act, which helps residents of mobile home communities form a cooperative and buy the land that they live on. Or what about H.3583 that gives manufactured homeowners located in communities the same tax benefits as those who own their own land?  I have introduced these bills to try to help people who live in manufactured homes. We do and must stand with them because this is an affordable, and sometimes quality, housing option for people, and yet manufactured homeowners support my bills.  Right here we have the National Manufactured Home Owners Association, which has said very clearly that my amendment is a good one.  There is a way to help manufactured homeowners that does not involve overcharging them. There is a way forward to help owners of manufactured housing without helping Clayton Homes and its affiliates make more money off of them.  And let's be clear, nearly no other lender benefits to this change to section 915. Ninety-one percent of the high-cost loans come from lenders owned by The industry's second largest mobile home lender, Wells Fargo, didn't have a single loan in the high-rate pool in The Seattle Times study.

88,topic-id,556,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment is to preserve the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's authority to regulate small-dollar loans.  Sometimes people need access to more money quickly. We know that. Your car breaks down, your refrigerator dies, or your kid breaks a leg at a soccer game and you get hit with an unexpected health bill. Life happens sometimes, not on a plan. We get that.  Unfortunately, too many people--about half of families--do not have the adequate savings for the cushion. Right now, Mr.Chairman, about 63 percent of all Americans report that they do not know what they would do if hit with an unexpected $500 bill.  If they take out a payday loan or a title loan, they can fall into a cycle of debt, and many people do. Instead of getting one $500 loan, most people get a repeat loan of 6 to 10, on average, paying additional fees each time, at 400 percent interest. So a $500 loan could cost thousands of dollars.  More than 80 percent of the payday industry's revenues are generated by repeat borrowers, not one-and-done, Mr. That is why the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau prioritized improving the small-dollar loan market. Unfortunately, language in this bill would stop the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from moving forward to rein in abuses in the payday loans, auto title loans, and other similar debt traps.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has documented through extensive study how payday lending traps borrowers in a cycle of debt: one in three auto title loans in default, one in five borrowers using auto title loans have their cars repossessed. That is 20 percent.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is close to releasing guidance to improve this market. Its efforts are supported by a broad network of civil rights and consumer advocates, as well as faith-based leaders opposing predatory lending.  I am really proud of Exodus Lending in my district. The Minneapolis Lutheran congregation recognized that too many of their congregants were stuck in debt traps. Their parishioners had jobs. They had bank accounts. But when they took out small-dollar loans, it gave lenders access to their bank accounts, which stripped out a third of their paycheck every 2 weeks. Instead of one loan, they ended up getting ten because they could not repay the first loan.  So the Lutherans, working with Sunrise Banks, established an alternative. They made more than 100 loans to people stuck in debt traps. Other communities are creating small-dollar lending alternatives through employer assistance programs with for-profit partners.  My amendment would simply allow the CFPB to finalize its rulemaking so cool ideas like these, to help people out of debt, could go forward. We need strong Federal standards so people can have access to small loans on a quick basis without falling prey to debt traps.  Research from the Center for Responsible Lending shows that payday lending drains $3.4 billion a year nationally from consumers' pockets--money that is no longer available to help pay for medicine, new tires, or any kind of emergency.  The CFPB is very close to putting forth a better way to get private sector lenders involved. We could have a $300 loan with $60 fees that someone can repay.  Let's allow the CFPB to move forward to better small-dollar loans. Please support my amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

91,topic-id,218,"Mr.Chairman, let's be clear, to get a payday loan, you have to have a bank account and a job. We are not talking about the unbanked. We are talking about people who run into a short-term financial crisis, they go to a payday lender, but the amount of the fees are so high that they have to borrow money to pay the money back, and they end up getting in a cycle of 6 to 10 loans that they have to continue to take out, which drains money from their finances. They lose bank accounts because of payday loans.  We are saying: Let the CFPB allow the regulatory process, the rulemaking process, to go forward. Let's not chop it off, let's not stop it, and let's see what we can find out. People in my district have come up with some pretty innovative ways to go around the high-cost, high-APR payday lending scam.  But if we just say, No, we are just going to take authority away from the CFPB, what we are really doing is subjecting Americans to the payday loan industry.

Originally this was offered by my friend from Florida (Mr.Posey), who is currently helping his constituents recover from Hurricane Irma, so I rise on behalf of Mr. Mr.Chairman, this amendment would strike the IRS' Operations Support account by $165,300 and transfer that amount to the Spending Reduction account. The effect would be to eliminate the salary of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen's salary, in fact, and would finally begin a tiny amount of accountability that American taxpayers have deserved for quite some time.  Not only did Commissioner Koskinen fail to hold the IRS accountable for wrongfully targeting groups based on their lawful political beliefs, but he obstructed the congressional investigations into the scandal.  When Congress requested the testimony of Lois Lerner, who was head of the Exempt Organization Division at the IRS, she took the Fifth Amendment and refused to cooperate. Instead of providing these records, as required, Mr.Koskinen chose to--in his words--``recycle'' the Lerner email records. By recycle, Mr.Koskinen meant, obviously by his actions, destroy evidence that was part of a congressional investigation, which was in direct conflict with his duties as a public servant and, in particular, as head of the Internal Revenue  After obstructing a congressional investigation, Mr.Koskinen then lied about it under oath on several occasions before In other words, he repeatedly and contemptuously perjured himself before  Now, on June 20, 2014, for example, Mr.Koskinen testified in a Ways and Means Committee hearing that since the targeting investigation started, every email had been preserved and nothing was lost. At that very same hearing, Mr.Koskinen said that the backup files no longer existed. He then went on to say that the IRS had ``gone to great lengths to spend a significant amount of money trying to make sure that there were no emails that were required that has not been produced.''  That, as we found out, was a blatant lie. Mr.Koskinen and his staff had gone to no lengths to get these emails. They had done nothing. In fact, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said that the IRS under Koskinen--his direction--simply did not look for the emails at all. Later, more than 1,000 emails were recovered from backup tapes that the IRS had attempted to destroy knowing they were being sought by  A year later, on June 20, 2015, Mr.Koskinen again falsely testified--also known as perjuring himself--that all of the Lerner emails had been preserved--not lost--but the IRS had destroyed the emails, in fact, and tried to destroy the backup tapes as well. That was well after the investigation had started and the emails were being sought.  Koskinen's dishonesty and obstructionist actions were not limited to congressional business. His actions directly affected American taxpayers. Under his tenure, IRS customer service for the 2015 filing season was nothing short of abysmal. Taxpayers were forced to wait hours to speak to an IRS agent, even after Congress gave him more money than he had had before for that assistance, but under his control and direction, it was squandered in other ways.  The terrible customer service was a direct result of Mr.Koskinen's IRS directing funds meant for taxpayer services toward other priorities.

114,topic-id,685,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today to offer a bipartisan amendment in support of the Small Business Administration's ScaleUp program. Like many of you, one of my favorite things to do when I am back home is to visit local businesses, businesses like Beech Tree Woodworks in Olympia, which just invested in some amazing new cutting-edge machinery; or Zoe Juice Bar in Olympia, which opened with just four employees not that long ago, and they now have more than a dozen, and they are still growing.  These businesses have all expanded with the help of SBA's ScaleUp program. ScaleUp is a program that gives small businesses the tools they need to become not so small anymore. It works within existing community networks to provide the education and technical assistance and access to capital that small businesses need to grow.  I include in the Record an article from my hometown newspaper which discusses the positive impact ScaleUp has had on our community.   Why Is Trump's Pro-Business Administration Hurting Businesses in                             Thurston County?                            (By Rolf Boone)       President Donald Trump once declared that he would be the      ``greatest jobs president that God ever created.''       After a recent decision to cut a business owner training      program in Thurston County--and 14 other locations around the      country--some might question Trump's claim.       ``The program was under review by the Trump Administration      and the decision was made to let the program expire in its      entirety at the end of September,'' said Melanie Norton, a      spokeswoman for the Northwest region of the U.Small      Business       Locally, the program was known as ScaleUp Thurston, a      multi-week course that helped businesses beyond the start-up      stage grow.       The two-year-old program was based in Lacey at the Center      for Business & Innovation, a partnership of the Thurston      Economic Development Council, its business resource center      and South Puget Sound Community Celia Nightingale is      the director of the center.       ScaleUp received about $200,000 a year from the SBA, she      said.       The decision to discontinue the program clearly was not      data driven because it produced results, with businesses      increasing their revenue and adding employees, Nightingale      said.       ``I find it hard to believe,'' said Kevin Leneker about the      decision. Leneker is chief executive of Olympia-based Single      Handed Consulting, a vocational rehabilitation business that      helps injured workers return to work. After participating in      ScaleUp in 2016, his revenue grew 57 percent and he increased      his staff to 25 from 10.       The course taught him to step back and think bigger picture      about the future of his business.       ``Work on your business, not just in it,'' he said.       Jason Phillips, owner of Zoe Juice Bar in Olympia, also      took part in       Phillips said the course allowed him to fine-tune his      business systems and procedures. It also introduced him to      other business owners and the importance of networking. His      juice bar opened in December 2013, followed by a production      space for cold-pressed juice in His business opened      with four employees. He now has 12-14, he said.       ``It's really disappointing,'' he said. ``It was a great      resource for small businesses, and small business represents      jobs and families''       ``You feel like you had a friend in your corner,'' he added      about       ScaleUp may have been viewed as a duplication of services      already offered by the SBA's Small Business Development      Center, Nightingale said.       Leneker praised the services of the Small Business      Development Center, but he thinks there was little overlap.       ``Not even close,'' he said.       Nightingale said the current ScaleUp program will run      through 29. After that, the plan is to seek grants and      corporate sponsorships to keep it going, she said.       Perhaps the city of Lacey will step up with some funding.       Lacey City Council recently learned about ScaleUp's end      after Councilwoman Rachel Young, a small business owner who      serves on the Thurston EDC board, reported the news to a      stunned council on July 13. That led business owner and Mayor      Andy Ryder to wonder aloud about possibly funding the      program.       It wouldn't be the first time the city has stepped up when      the federal government would not. The city led the creation      and funding of the Veterans Services Center  ",CREC-2017-09-13-pt1-PgH7334-3.txt,2040,"DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES",2017,13,September

118,topic-id,348,"Mr.Chairman, the fact of the matter is that our constituents were only informed 5 short weeks ago that ScaleUp was ending in 2 months. This amendment is the only recourse available given that very short timeframe, and because evidence-based measures of ScaleUp performance are all very positive, none of us had any reason to believe that the program would not continue, and the announcement came as a complete surprise to all of us.  The fact of the matter is, I don't agree with the decision of the Small Business Administration, and it is our job as a function of our oversight and check and balance responsibility to pursue our disagreement, as it were, because their decision flies in the face of the evidence.  I would argue that the appropriation process exists so that Congress can exercise this independent oversight of the spending priorities of the executive branch and assert itself in exactly this sort of a circumstance.  Mr.Chair, I would dearly love to work with the chair of the Small Business Committee on legislation to specifically authorize the ScaleUp program, but that is a longer term issue. This program will end at the end of this month if we don't act now, taking away a very valuable program that is working--evidence, metrics, measurable. It is getting the job done.  Why wouldn't we pass this amendment, it is fully offset, there is no increased spending here, and have the existing program continue while we work on a more permanent solution.[[Page H7358]]  Mr.Chair, with all due respect, I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment in the name of helping small businesses grow.

Despite its best intentions, section 1502 has been ineffective and, in some cases, has been shown to have increased violence is central That is why this suspension that I am proposing passed the House last year as an amendment to the FSGG appropriations bill, and a full repeal of section 1502 passed the House this Congress as part of the Financial CHOICE  Conflict minerals refer to tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, which have been used in a variety of products, from cell phones, cosmetics, jewelry, footwear, apparel, and even auto suppliers located in west  Mr.Chairman, the breadth of voices opposing section 1502 is remarkable, and I would like to start with those that matter most. For too long, the people of central Africa have been overlooked in this debate, even though they are the ones who suffer from Dodd-Frank's unintended consequences.  I include in the Record an open letter from 70 Congolese leaders and other regional experts.                             An Open Letter       Dear governments, companies, non-governmental      organisations, and other stakeholders implicated in efforts      of various kinds related to the issue of `conflict minerals',       In early 2014, two international industry giants--Intel and      Apple--issued refined corporate social responsibility      policies for minerals sourced in the eastern Democratic      Republic of the Congo (DRC). The announcements followed an      unprecedented wave of[[Page H7354]]     guidelines, law-making, and initiatives over the past few      years to `clean up' the eastern DRC's mining sector, and were      met with widespread praise.       Perhaps the most widely publicised of these efforts is US      legislation known as Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act,      which asks all companies registered on the US stock market to      reveal their supply chains to the Securities and Exchange      Commission (SEC) when sourcing minerals from the eastern DRC      or neighbouring countries. Canada is in the advanced stages      of developing similar legislation, and many other countries      are looking closely at the issue. The European Union has      introduced a voluntary conflict minerals regulation scheme      for all member states, and the United Nations (UN) and      Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)      have developed guidelines on sourcing natural resources in      high-risk areas such as the eastern       These efforts primarily target artisanal (or `informal')      mining in the eastern DRC, due to widespread international      recognition that so-called conflict minerals (most notably      tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) produced by artisanal      mining in this part of the world have helped conflict actors      generate revenue to finance their operations in the DRC over      the past two decades.                             The Situation       Despite successes of activists in shaping policy, the      conflict minerals campaign fundamentally misunderstands the      relationship between minerals and conflict in the eastern      First, while the minerals help perpetuate the conflict,      they are not its cause. National and regional political      struggles over power and influence as well as issues such as      access to land and questions of citizenship and identity are      just some of the more structural drivers of conflict. The      ability to exploit and profit from minerals is often a means      to finance military operations to address these issues,      rather than an end in itself. Internal UN assessments, for      instance, show that only 8% of the DRC's conflicts are linked      to minerals, and specific motivations vary greatly across the      vast array of different armed groups.       Second, armed groups are not dependent on mineral revenue      for their existence. The eastern DRC is a fully militarised      economy, in which minerals are just one resource among many      that armed groups--and the national army FARDC--can levy      financing from. The M23, until recently the most powerful      non-state armed group in DRC, never sought physical control      over mining activity.       Moreover, few local stakeholders have been included in on-     going international policy-making, and as a result realities      on the ground have not always been taken into account.      Setting up the required systems and procedures to regularly      access and audit thousands of artisanal mining sites in      isolated and hard-to-reach locations spread across an area      almost twice the size of France would be a challenge for any      government. In the eastern DRC, where road infrastructure is      poor to non-existent and state capacity desperately low, the      enormity of the task is hard to overstate. But in demanding      that companies prove the origin of minerals sourced in the      eastern DRC or neighbouring countries before systems able to      provide such proof have been put in place, conflict minerals      activists and resultant legislation--in particular Section      1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act--inadvertently incentivize buyers      on the international market to pull out of the region      altogether and source their minerals elsewhere.                               The Result       As a result, the conflict minerals movement has yet to lead      to meaningful improvement on the ground, and has had a number      of unintended and damaging consequences. Nearly four years      after the passing of the Dodd-Frank Act, only a small      fraction of the hundreds of mining sites in the eastern DRC      have been reached by traceability or certification efforts.      The rest remain beyond the pale, forced into either      illegality or collapse as certain international buyers have      responded to the legislation by going `Congo-free'.       This in turn has driven many miners into the margins of      legality (for instance, feeding into smuggling rackets),      where armed actors return through the loopholes of      transnational regulation. Others have simply lost their jobs,      and in areas where mining has ceased, local economies have      suffered. To put this in context, an estimated eight to ten      million people across the country are dependent on artisanal      mining for their livelihood. Some former miners have returned      to subsistence agriculture, but persisting insecurity levels      leave them in abject poverty facing dire living conditions,      in fear of missing harvests due to displacement. Others have      been prompted to join militias as a means to quick cash in      the absence of other opportunities; a particularly perverse      impact, when one considers the intentions of the movement.       Alongside the impact on mining communities and local      economies, several armed groups have responded by turning to      different businesses such as trading in charcoal, marijuana,      palm oil, soap, or consumer goods. Those remaining in the      mining sector have largely traded mineral exploitation on      site for mineral taxation a few steps down the supply chain,      operating numerous roadblocks that can bring in millions of      dollars a year. Others are reported to have sent in family      members or civilian allies to run business for them on site,      while they remain safely at a distance.       For the few mining sites fortunate enough to be reached by      Joint Assessment Teams responsible for determining their      `conflict-free' status, these teams have been unable to      provide the regular, three-month validation visits envisaged      in legislation. There is an additional delay of several      months following these visits before the Congolese Ministry      of Mines reviews and approves the assessment at the national      level. Given the speed at which situations can change in      volatile environments, infrequent assessments and lengthy      delays raise concerns over the accuracy of certification and      the credibility of the system.       More worrying still, multinational corporations such as      Apple and Intel are auditing smelters to determine the      conflict-free status of the minerals they source, and not the      mines themselves. As smelters are located outside of the DRC      and audits are not always conducted by third parties, these      processes raise further concerns over whether conflict-free      certifications reflect production realities.       By far the most advanced site in terms of producing      `conflict-free' minerals for sale to the international market      is Kalimbi, a tin mining area home to externally-financed      initiatives running an industry-led bagging-and-tagging      scheme called iYet even here, despite the establishment      of a `closed pipeline' from mine to exportation, the mine      still suffers from the sporadic influence of armed actors,      and miners are made to bear the additional costs of      `conflict-free' schemes. This raises further concerns over      the credibility of the system in place, and its suitability      for the scale-up and expansion to other, more remote mine      sites currently underway. Coupled with slow progress in      implementation, the trend towards the monopolisation of      `conflict-free' supply chain initiatives, in particular      traceability by iTSCi, is economically damaging to local      populations since it currently excludes and isolates the      overwhelming majority of mining communities from legal access      to international markets.                            The Alternative       There is broad consensus for the need to clean up the      eastern Congo's minerals sector, yet much disagreement about      the international community's current model for achieving      this goal. As such, efforts to improve transparency in the      eastern DRC's mineral supply chains should continue. Yet a      more nuanced and holistic approach that takes into account      the realities of the eastern DRC's mining sector and the      complexity of the conflict is needed. To this end, we make      the following five recommendations:       Improve consultation with government and communities:      Congolese government and civil society were poorly consulted      on Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act prior to its passing,      and as a result many were unaware of its implications. The      few who were consulted were unanimously pro-Dodd-Frank,      creating additional conflicts on local levels where      endorsement and dissent compete. More Congolese voices must      be listened to, and the local context and power structures      taken into account. This would ensure greater understanding      of the local context and better harmonisation with existing      national and regional initiatives, such as the International      Conference of the Great Lakes Region's (ICGLR) Regional      Initiative against the Illegal Exploitation of Natural            Work towards meaningful reform: The audit process should be      designed to improve policies and practices rather than to      just provide window-dressing. The dominant belief that static      oversight and validation processes ensure `conflict-free'      mineral trade is misplaced given the volatile security      situation in most of the eastern Both mines and smelters      should be regularly inspected and the time period between      inspection and certification minimized. Where this is not      feasible, additional waivers or similar measures should not      be ruled out.       Create incentives towards better practice: Legal frameworks      must be supported by real projects on the ground that can      meet their requirements. If this is not possible--which is      clearly still the case today, nearly four years after the      passing of Dodd-Frank--then transition periods must be      extended and the lowering of excessively high standards for      `conflict-free' minerals should be considered. Similarly,      former conflict actors should be incentivised where      appropriate to join new `conflict-free' schemes. This may      help avoid the eventual subversion or infiltration of the      `clean' system put in place, as has been seen to date.       Promote fair competition: Regulation must be based on      competition that allows not only international businesses but      also Congolese producers to influence (i.e. increase) local      price schemes. This in turn would encourage a regime that      ensures minimum wages which mining cooperatives can guarantee      to their members based on their increased leverage on the      price fluctuation.       Widen the lens: Root causes of conflict such as land,      identity, and political contest in the context of a      militarized economy, rather than a single focus on minerals,      must be considered by advocates seeking to reduce conflict      violence. Furthermore, efforts to eradicate conflict minerals      should not overlook the fact that artisanal mining is a key      livelihood in the eastern DRC that holds as much potential to      help steer the region away from conflict as it does to      contribute towards it. More supportive measures are needed--     such as those found in the earlier 2009[[Page H7355]]     draft of the US Conflict Minerals Act--that can help capture      the economic potential of artisanal mining. Finally, other      critical challenges such as access to credit, technical      knowledge, hazardous working conditions, and environmental      degradation should not be ignored by multinational      corporations if they seek to improve business practices and      increase transparency in their supply chains.       So far, progress has been made in producing more ethical      products for consumers, but stakeholders have not yet      proceeded to improve the lives of Congolese people, nor      address the negative impact current `conflict-free'      initiatives are having. If the conflict minerals agenda is to      lead to positive change on the ground, legislation passed by      national governments and steps such as those outlined by      Apple or Intel need to be grounded in a more holistic      approach that is better tailored to local realities. Failure      to do so will continue to seriously limit the ability of      conflict minerals initiatives to improve the daily lives of      the eastern Congolese and their neighbours. Worse, these      initiatives will risk contributing to, rather than      alleviating, the very conflicts they set out to address.                          List of Signatories       1.

109,topic-id,760,"Mr.Chair, they state in the letter that section 1502 provisions ``. . . inadvertently incentivize buyers on the international market to pull out of the region altogether and source their minerals elsewhere.  ``As a result, the conflict minerals movement has yet to lead to meaningful improvement on the ground, and has had a number of unintended and damaging consequences.''  Dodd-Frank's impact on African miners may seem unimportant to many rich-country activists, but in the Congo, it has been the question of life or death.  According to a Washington Post article entitled ``How a well-intentioned U.law left Congolese miners jobless,'' section 1502 ``set off a chain of events that has propelled millions of Congolese miners and their families deeper into poverty.''  The article goes on to share the story of how a Congolese teenager could no longer feed himself after Dodd-Frank ravaged the country's mining sector, forcing the young man to actually join an armed group; the outcome diametrically opposed in the goal of section 1502.  Mr.Chairman, no one can claim that these effects were unforeseeable. In fact, in a letter to the SEC commenting on section 1502, leaders from three Congolese mining cooperatives predicted that the conflict minerals rule would lead to a devastating boycott.  These miners wrote: ``We cannot continue to suffer any longer. Do we now have to choose between dying by a bullet or starving to death?''  I ask my colleagues to remember the Congolese aren't alone in their suffering. The SEC's rules apply to nine[[Page H7356]]other nations as if they were all one single country. Section 1502 treats over 230 million Africans living in 10 distinct nations as one undifferentiated group.  Dodd-Frank's supporters will say that at this point, some countries neighboring Congo may help smuggle minerals on behalf of armed groups, which is why we need to paint with such a broad brush. But I would ask my colleagues to name another example where a country's economy and each of its neighbors is targeted due to a presumed smuggling risk.  Do we design Russia sanctions to apply to each of its 14 adjoining countries, too?  Do Iranian sanctions implicate all seven of its neighbors?  Perhaps advocates for section 1502 believe that there is no smuggling from Russia and Iran, but the real issue seems to be this: Dodd-Frank supporters have no problem treating Africans differently from other regions of the world.  I find that troubling. So now let's consider implementation of section 1502 itself.  In April of this year, the GAO reported that section 1502 has produced little meaningful information on conflict mineral sourcing. It found that more than half of the companies in 2016 couldn't even determine what country their minerals came from. Most importantly, virtually none of the companies could tell whether their minerals benefited armed groups, a conclusion that echoed GAO's findings from 2015 and 2014 as well.  No wonder companies can't figure this out, Mr.Even the Department of Commerce has reported that it is unable to determine whether smelters around the world use minerals traceable to armed groups. In other words, Dodd-Frank is asking U.companies--some of which are very small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in large corporations' supply chains--to produce information that even the Federal Government can't provide.  As if that weren't enough, the courts also struck down parts of section 1502 for violating companies' First Amendment rights.  The Trump administration's SEC has had enough of section 1502 failures, and is now reexamining the conflict mineral rule. The State Department is now conducting a review to see how responsible sourcing can be undertaken more effectively. The amendment I am offering today would suspend section 1502 while the administration completes its assessment.  Mr.Chairman, the facts I have laid out on section 1502 aren't partisan, and a suspension shouldn't be either. So let me close with the words of Barack Obama's Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, Mary Jo White, who, in 2013, said: ``Seeking to improve safety in mines for workers or to end horrible human rights atrocities in the DRC are compelling objectives, which, as a citizen, I wholeheartedly share. But as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, I must question, as a policy matter, using the Federal securities laws and the SEC's powers of mandatory disclosure to accomplish these goals.''  It should tell us something when even Democrats' own Securities and Exchange Commission Chair warns that Dodd-Frank overreached on conflict minerals. A suspension would be something that Republicans and Democrats can agree on, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

132,topic-id,404,"Mr.Chair, well, this amendment is actually quite simple. It says that U.taxpayers should not subsidize coal-fired power plants built in other countries.  Under the Obama administration, the Treasury Department issued guidance saying that the United States, through multilateral development banks, would no longer fund or support the construction of such plants in foreign countries. Unfortunately, President Trump has rolled back these efforts, and, in essence, the Trump administration is saying to the American people that American tax dollars should go overseas to subsidize fossil fuels and coal-fired power plants.  I support, as many in this body do on both sides of the aisle, the efforts of multilateral development banks. In fact, the use of America's power in that sense, through entities such as the World Bank, is a great way for us to contribute to development across the globe and use that soft power in a way that potentially keeps us from having to go in a different direction. But we should not be using U.dollars on projects that subsidize foreign sources of pollution that contribute to increased carbon in our atmosphere and worsen climate change.  Now, there are some that say that the science is not settled on this question. The people who are saying that, I am not quite sure where they are getting their science. Climate change is real. We really don't need a lot of evidence, even recently, to reinforce the notion that climate change is real. Extreme weather events are real, and they are making that point in ways that no discussion on this floor could ever do. Unfortunately, experts are telling us it is only going to get worse.  Congress should not be encouraging the use of American taxpayer dollars to support coal-fired plants overseas. This amendment takes a stand and says that we will not support these sorts of irresponsible projects.  Here in Congress we continually advocate for the responsible use of taxpayer dollars. And for the most part on this floor, we continue to advocate for efforts that will reduce carbon emissions in order to protect the environment, not just for ourselves, but for generations to come.  Using American dollars to support coal plants in developing countries is not responsible. It is not a responsible use of taxpayer dollars. It is not good for our environment.  Mr.Chair, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

When it comes to the use of U.taxpayer dollars going overseas, we ought to be able to clearly say that those dollars should be used in a way that contributes to the development of those nations, but in a way that does not undermine the quality of life across the globe and across the decades and centuries to come.

122,topic-id,361,"Mr.Chair, when I am at home, I don't hear anyone say, Let's make it easier for folks to use big money to influence elections, and yet there are provisions in this spending bill that would do just that.  My colleagues across the aisle are putting these provisions into this spending bill because they know that shocking our political system with even more money is incredibly unpopular, and these provisions would never pass if they were given an up-or-down vote in their own right; therefore, I am standing up today for restoring accountability for campaign spending and highlighting the two provisions that should not be in this bill.  First, we need some sunlight in this murky world of campaign spending. 501(c)(4) groups can play fast and loose in our elections, and I want to be sure that they are actually working on issues that impact the people I represent, not trying to get their preferred candidates elected. And yet this legislation that we are voting on ensures that the IRS will not have the authority to look into groups that might be flouting the rules, and that is wrong.                              {time}  1630  Unfortunately, secondly, we have also seen the Federal Election Commission struggle to enforce our campaign finance laws.

The Commission was designed to be the people's advocate in our elections, and yet, unfortunately, it has seen more gridlock than  The Federal Election Commission is once again undermined in this bill because the bill says that the Commission cannot enforce any rules regarding how certain special interests are able to raise money. We should not be making it easier for political action committees to raise additional money from a few wealthy individuals without Federal Election Commission oversight.  We should be voting on campaign finance laws that strengthen the integrity of our elections, not bills like this that weaken it. So my hope is that we can chart a new course, a better course, and one that brings people power back to these hallowed Halls rather than, again, giving more power to the deepest pockets and to special interests.

64,topic-id,436,"Mr.Chairman, in June, the House passed H.10, the Financial CHOICE Act, with overwhelming support.  Section 713 of the Financial CHOICE Act contained language to subject the CFPB to the annual congressional appropriations process.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB is funded out of the earnings of the Federal Reserve system. In order to obtain funding, the Director need only submit a letter to the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve each quarter certifying the amounts of funds determined by the Director to be reasonably necessary for carrying out the authorities of the The Federal Reserve then transfers the stated amount to the Bureau for operations.  Basically, the Federal Reserve serves purely as an ATM machine for the CFPB, and neither Congress nor the President has the ability to have any input into the Bureau's funding or oversight of whether that funding is spent effectively.  The Bureau's funding is, therefore, different from other regulators that police markets for force and fraud, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and all those which are funded principally through congressional appropriations.  To return to a constitutional structure and create agency accountability, Congress must reclaim its power of the purse over the most potent tools the Constitution gives Congress for conducting oversight of Federal agencies and implementing the real reforms. There can be no consent of the governed if the American people, through their democratically elected Representatives, have no say in how their government spends their hard-earned dollars.  To reassert Congress' power of the purse, the Financial CHOICE Act calls for all the Federal financial regulatory agencies, including the CLEA and FSOC, to be funded through the congressional appropriations process, ensuring that these agencies use their funding effectively and transparently to fulfill their mission of protecting consumers and investors.  Like other executive branch agencies and other regulators that police the markets, the CFPB will have the chance to justify its expenditures to Congress as a part of the appropriations process.

We are picking around on the edges of some things and don't really understand the unintended consequences of what we are trying to do here.  The amendment that is here, to try to change the definitions of what a mortgage originator and a high-cost mortgage to facilitate access to credit for purchasing manufactured homes, is going to do just the opposite of what the gentleman is trying to do.  Do you realize that the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr.Pearce), in his district, he has testified in our committee that over 50 percent of the people in his district live in manufactured homes. This is not a little bitty problem of half a dozen people living over on the side. This is a major source of housing for many people.  I can tell you, I have got a story right here from a banker in southeast Missouri who had an individual who has several disabilities, was a very honest man, wanted to come in and take care of a dental problem that he had, and his only collateral was a truck and his manufactured home.  He wanted to make the loan on the manufactured home because he could stretch out the payments and do it at a less interest rate, but he couldn't do that. Why? Because the way the law is[[Page H7349]]structured, he had to do it on his car loan, and, as a result, it really strained and put difficulties in the way of--put barriers in the way of this individual.

90,topic-id,349,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, in June, the House passed H.10, the Financial CHOICE Act, with overwhelming support. Section 733 of the Financial CHOICE Act contained language to remove the CFPB's authority to regulate small-dollar credit.  Federalizing payday loan regulation is unnecessary and harms consumers. The legislatures of several States have determined the respective short-term small-dollar lending solutions that work for their constituents. No State is without small-dollar short-term lending laws and regulation of some kind.  Congress has an obligation not to suspend the Democratic process in the States by delegating to the CFPB Director the authority to impose one unelected man's view on all  Small-dollar and payday loan products are an unfortunate necessity for many unbanked and underbanked  What is the APR for losing a job, Mr.Chairman? What is the APR for getting evicted and having your utilities shut off? What is the opportunity cost for struggling Americans no longer having access to this vital lifeline?  Removing the option to utilize a small-dollar short-term loan is likely[[Page H7350]]to have a very real and very harmful impact on a consumer, forcing them to miss bill payments, shift to the alternative, potential legal options, or exacerbating any number of other conceivable financial emergencies that could arise.  Mr.Chairman, I believe the best way to improve products is to promote competition and offering them, not ban them. The Financial CHOICE Act ensures that the market, not the regulators, is responsible for determining product viability in the marketplace.  Mr.Chairman, CFPB's own study showed that their regulation was going to drive out of business 85 percent of the small-dollar lenders, and they still went ahead. They don't care. They intend to restrict credit to these very people that need the credit.  An FDIC 2015 study shows that 25 percent of the people in this country are either unbanked or underbanked.  How do we solve that problem? How do those folks have access to credit?  The CFPB is not trying to regulate. They are trying to destroy the small-dollar lending market.

Mr.Chairman, this is really frustrating to me from the standpoint that just a minute ago I gave the figure of 25 percent of our people are either unbanked or underbanked. My good colleague across the aisle said he is not worried that people who are unbanked can't have access to payday lending or short-term lending, and that is just not accurate. That is, quite frankly, in many instances, where people get their credit started. They go to someplace like this because they have a job.  You can't get a payday loan or a small-dollar loan like this unless you have a job. They take the stub of their paycheck and they can go in and say, I have got a job. From there, they are able to then start paying back whatever the loan is that they take out.  I have in front of me also a whole list of groups of folks and individuals here who have utilized short-term small-dollar programs.  Here is Michelle from Fulton, Missouri, in my own district. She says: My frustration to loan access today is that my 20-year-old daughter, who has a full-time, decent-paying job, cannot get a loan to buy her first vehicle. She isn't even able to get a credit card, which you used to be able to just apply for and you would get it. It is a catch-22: you need credit to get credit. But nobody will give you credit to begin with.  This is an opportunity for a lot of people to get their foot in the door to get credit established and, if you have bad credit, to reestablish good credit. And it also helps people to take care of--and I have another whole bunch of stories here about a young man who needed to get a car loan to get his car fixed, as the gentleman from Minnesota indicated.

129,topic-id,273,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, this amendment strikes a provision that subjects the National Credit Union Administration to the annual congressional appropriations process.  My point this afternoon is that Congress must restore its power of the purse, one of the most potent tools the Constitution gives Congress for conducting oversight of Federal agencies and implementing reforms. There can be no consent of the governed if the American people, through their democratically elected representatives have no say in how their government spends their hard-earned dollars.  We must not miss the opportunity to reestablish separation of powers and restore Article I authority, which Congress has given away in so many instances that the administration now has more power than the legislative branch.  The NCUA is a prime example of why it is time to reassert Congress' power of the purse. Accountability and transparency was so lacking under former Chairman Debbie Matz' tenure that, over the course of her tenure, the NCUA budget increased each year, in some cases by double-digit percentages. The Financial Services Committee, in fact, was forced to hold a public hearing during the 114th  NCUA should not be singled out to avoid accountability to The CHOICE Act, which was passed by the House with overwhelming support--and the Congressman from Nevada's support as well--subjects all Federal financial regulators to the same congressional appropriations process, including There is no reason to single out the NCUA for different treatment from all other regulators, all of whom the House has already voted on to put on appropriations just 3 months ago.

We have reached our debt limit, we have lifted our debt limit, and we are now determining how to control our spending while still funding necessary programs. What is worse, too many of our Federal regulations and mandates that we fund--or maybe more appropriately, the taxpayers fund--are unnecessary and exact burdensome, excessive costs on our constituents, both families and businesses.  The reality is we can and we must make cuts to our government before financial markets make them for us. We can do that without impacting essential programs if we make the right targeted cuts. If we make those cuts, we can actually grow our economy by stopping overeager bureaucrats who seem to believe that everything--and I do mean everything--should be regulated until it no longer functions.  Not only is such action possible, it is essential for the well-being of the American economy and our families.

It actually allows the agencies within their administrative accounts to manage money as they best see fit.  The idea that we can't cut 10 percent of the budget only works in government. I spent a big part of my career in the private sector--over 30 years. I spent quite a period of time with the Chrysler Corporation in the original loan guarantee days, where Lee Iacocca said: If you can't cut 10 percent of your budget, I will find a new manager. We saved the company.  It happens in the real world every day--Lord knows it happened after 2008 and the financial crash--yet somehow we are looking at government agencies and they can't save 10 percent in administrative costs. It is not possible to do it without Armageddon in Financial Services, without a cybersecurity crash, without all the fear-mongering that comes over a simple cut.  If we are ever going to get to the point that we can afford the government we have, we have to have some fiscal limitations. We have to have some responsibility. Rather than these broad strokes of it is indiscriminate, if we target it, that will be a problem, too.

The record is abundantly clear. Section 1502 is working.  Now, he talked about Congolese leaders who don't like it. These are people who are profiting from the armed conflict, but there are Congolese communities and leaders who support section 1502 because they are seeing the improvements in security and rule of law.

Today, let's admit we are a long way from that. And if we are honest, that is in part because of Dodd-Frank.''

This amendment permits employers to fire a woman for having an abortion due to rape, or to decline to hire a woman for using in vitro fertilization, or to fire a man for using condoms, or to reduce the salary of a parent for buying birth control for his or her child.  Contrary to the sponsor's claim, the D.law does not require employers to provide insurance coverage for reproductive health decisions. Importantly, the law states expressly, here this language: ``This section shall not be construed to require an employer to provide insurance coverage related to a reproductive health decision.''  The D.law is valid under both the U.Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Indeed, the law has been in effect for more than 2 years. It is now law. And there appear to have been no lawsuits challenging it.  Under the U.Constitution, laws may limit religious exercise if they are neutral, generally applicable, and rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. Under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, laws may substantially burden religious exercise only if they further a compelling governmental interest in the least restrictive means.  The D.law meets all of these requirements. That is why it has never been challenged. The D.law also protects religious liberty. The Constitution's narrow ministerial exception allows religious organizations to make employment decisions for ministers and ministerial employees for any reason whatsoever.  D.law permits religious and political organizations to make employment decisions based on religious and political views.

This year, the D.Council passed its second local budget under the Local Budget Autonomy  Smart lawyers differed about the validity of the Local Budget Autonomy Act when D.enacted it. However, the Local Budget Autonomy Act has been litigated. The only court ruling in effect upheld it, the ruling was not appealed, and the court ordered D.officials to implement it.  Some House Republicans disguised their opposition to the Local Budget Autonomy Act with legalistic arguments until Speaker Ryan revealed last year the real reason the House passed the stand-alone bill repealing the Local Budget Autonomy He said: ``There are real consequences. The D.government wants to use revenues to fund abortions in the House Republicans will not stand for that.''                              {time}  1500  The Speaker was wrong about the effect of the Local Budget Autonomy Congress loses nothing under our budget autonomy law. Congress retains the authority to legislate on any D.matter, including its local budget, at any time. That is unfortunate, but that, too, is the law.  The Local Budget Autonomy Act is a modest attempt by the District to be able to implement its local budget soon after it is passed, like other jurisdictions, instead of having it caught up in congressional delays.  Indeed, the riders in the bill prohibiting D.from spending its local funds on marijuana commercialization and abortion services for low-income women were changed from those in prior appropriations bills to account for the Local Budget Autonomy Still, that is not enough.  Historically, D.riders applied only to funds included in appropriations bills, because only appropriations bills authorized D.spending. In this bill, as in fiscal year 2017, the riders apply to D.local funds available under any authority, including those in the local budget passed under the Local Budget Autonomy  Local control over the dollars raised by local taxpayers is a principle much cited by my Republican colleagues, and it is, indeed, central to the American form of government. Beyond this core principle, budget autonomy has practical benefits for D.C., including lowering borrowing costs, more accurate revenue and expenditure forecasts, improved agency operations, and the removal of the threat of D.government shutdowns during Federal Government shutdowns. These are our concerns.  D.C.'s budget is larger than the budgets of 14 States, Mr.The District raises $8 billion in local funds. While D.is in a better financial position than most cities and States in this country, with a rainy-day fund of over $2 billion on a total budget of $14 billion, budget autonomy makes the District even stronger, as it must be, because it has no State fallback.

This amendment would, once again, overreach by prohibiting funds for D.C.'s Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Amendment Act of 2014. That law prohibits discrimination based on reproductive health decisions. The Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Amendment Act protects workers in D.from workplace discrimination if the employer disagrees with the employee's use of contraception, in vitro fertilization, and even perhaps a medically necessary abortion. The law prohibits employers from making employment decisions based on reproductive health decisions of employees, their spouses, and children.  Without RHNDA, employers could fire a woman for having an abortion due to rape, fire a man for using a condom, reduce the pay for a parent buying birth control for their child, and decline to hire a woman for using in vitro fertilization. D.is protecting workers from losing their jobs if their supervisors do not agree with their most personal decisions. This amendment would strip those protections from D.workers.  For those who thought this bill infringed on employers' religious beliefs, D.passed a statutory clarification that no employer was required to provide insurance coverage related to reproductive health decisions.  During the congressional review period, the Republican-controlled House passed a resolution disapproving this bill, but the Republican-controlled Senate did not. The Congress had time to act on this issue, and it failed to do so.  D.residents should not be subject to endless efforts to overturn their laws. People should be judged at work based on their performance and not on their personal, private reproductive healthcare decisions. That is why D.passed this law.

None of the funds made available to the      Department of Treasury by this division may be used to issue      a license pursuant to any Office of Foreign Assets Control      (OFAC) memo regarding Section 5.1.1 of Annex II to the Joint      Comprehensive Plan of Action of July 14, 2015 (JCPOA),      including the January 16, 2016, OFAC memo titled, ``Statement      of Licensing Policy For Activities Related to the Export Or      Re-Export to Iran of Commercial Passenger Aircraft and      Related Parts and Services'' and any other OFAC memo of the      same substance.

31,topic-id,309,"Mr.Chairman, to close, as to the argument about ideological riders, this is the Article I branch. It is the prerogative of the House of Representatives and the Congress to speak and decide how money is to be spent.  As to the notion that, the accusation that this breaches the JCPOA, as much of a critic as I am of that deal, this doesn't breach it. So it is in compliance with it.  The notion of jobs is an interesting one, and it kind of creates a moral quandary until, Mr.Chairman, you balance out these two things: jobs versus lives. Is that really a question here? Aren't lives more important than jobs? Isn't it an interesting thing that several Members of the Washington State delegation where Boeing, in particular, is headquartered have actively written to the leadership of the Boeing Company saying, don't do this, essentially, and don't put our employees in the moral quandary of having to move forward on this?  Finally, Mr.Chairman, how would we be feeling if the debate were happening in 1938 in this country, and the question was: Are we going to loan money to some commercial operation that can be used by the regime in Hamburg, Germany, for example? We would be scandalized by it.  We need to recognize with a sense of clarity where we are in history. We ought not to be complicit with this. This House can make a great deal of difference in the future of this fight.  Mr.Chair, I urge the passage of this amendment, the adoption of it, and I yield back the balance of my time.

93,topic-id,177,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Here we go again: another amendment defending another one-size-fits-all Washington solution, and a solution that the D.Circuit Court of Appeals would say is going to be promulgated by the single most powerful official, other than the President, in the United States Government, an official that could effect the lives of countless Americans who are in need of short-term credit.  This amendment is a solution in search of a problem. There is no regulation going on in payday lending. The fact is these transactions are being regulated. They are being regulated at the State level by legislators who know their States and their constituents.  This CFPB action, if they act here, may very well remove the option to utilize a small-dollar short-term loan, and that is likely to have a very real and very harmful impact on the consumer, forcing them to miss bill payments, shift to alternative--potentially illegal--options, or exacerbating any number of other conceivable financial emergencies that could arise.

7,topic-id,167,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment which is included in this en bloc package. This amendment would increase funding for the Small Business Administration Entrepreneurial Development programs by $4 million, with the increase intended to support entrepreneurship education.  Our entrepreneurs and small-business owners form the foundation of the American economy. Entrepreneurs with inspired ideas benefit from the educational resources and information that help them convert those ideas into thriving businesses. Entrepreneurship education within the SBA provides resources such as growth assistance, financial literacy education, and basic information for aspiring entrepreneurs.  We in Congress have a responsibility to ensure that Americans, young and old, with the entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to succeed have access to lessons and resources that will help them succeed. This amendment will help our small businesses to prosper and, ultimately, create jobs.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to continue to ensure that the United States remains the best place in the world to start and grow a business.
