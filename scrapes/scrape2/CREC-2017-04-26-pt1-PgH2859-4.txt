              RECOGNIZING WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DAY

  (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of 
World Intellectual Property Day.
  Strong intellectual property protections are grounded in the 
Constitution and have never been more critical to our economic success 
and culture of innovation than they are today.
  IP industries contribute more than $6 trillion to our economy 
annually and support more than 45 million American jobs.
  In my home State of Georgia, there are an estimated 1.9 million IP-
related jobs that contribute $30 billion per year in manufacturing 
exports.
  IP protections undergird our economy by promoting competitiveness, 
ensuring good-paying jobs, and rewarding ideas that have value.
  In Georgia, which is now the third largest State for film production 
in the Nation, as well as the home to software companies, ``payment 
processor alley,'' musicians, and video game designers, strong 
intellectual property rights mean that our State can continue to grow 
and thrive.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to join me in recognizing 
World IP Day and the importance of intellectual property protections at 
home and abroad.
