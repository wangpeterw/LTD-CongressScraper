                 ISRAEL BONDS' ``A NIGHT ON THE BEACH''

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday night is Israel Bonds' 
``Una Noche en la Playa''--``A Night on the Beach''--in Miami Beach.
  Over the years, I have had the honor of participating in many of 
Israel Bonds' programs. The work that Israel Bonds does is vital in 
expanding and growing Israel's economy and has helped Israel become a 
global leader and innovator in so many sectors.
  With all of the threats now facing the Jewish state, the work of 
Israel Bonds is more important now than ever. The

guest speaker will be none other than the Israeli Ambassador to the 
United States, my good friend and Miami Beach native, Ron Dermer.
  The Israel Bonds event will also serve as a commemorative tribute to 
Isaac and Nieves Olemberg. Isaac and Nieves were dear friends who did 
so much for the south Florida community, for the American Jewish 
community, for the Cuban American community, and for Israel, herself. 
Their memories will forever live on through their kindness and 
compassion.
