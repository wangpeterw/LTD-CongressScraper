                                 PRAYER

  Dr. J. Todd Mullins, Christ Fellowship Church, Palm Beach Gardens, 
Florida, offered the following prayer:
  Heavenly Father, Thank You for hearing our prayers today. We are 
humbled that today, as we call out to You, You listen to us. We ask 
that You bless the Members of Congress as they lead our great Nation. 
Grant them wisdom for the decisions they face, and may we remain 
dependent upon You, never forgetting Psalm 33:12 that says, ``Blessed 
is the nation whose God is the Lord.''
  We pray for those in Texas, in Florida, in Puerto Rico, and in the 
Caribbean, who are recovering from the devastating hurricanes. Give 
them peace and courage as they rebuild their lives. Bless the first 
responders and those serving the people impacted by these storms. Grant 
them Your strength for their assignments.
  Guide our President. Give him clear vision to steer our Nation during 
these troubled days, and grant strength to the Members of this House as 
they represent the people across our land.
  We ask this in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
  Amen.
