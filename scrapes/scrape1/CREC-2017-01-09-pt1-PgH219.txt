               NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on National Law Enforcement 
Appreciation Day to recognize and support our many men and women 
bravely serving and protecting their communities all across Minnesota 
and our country.
  Law enforcement officers are heroes. They put their lives on the line 
to keep our neighborhoods, homes, businesses, and schools safe and 
secure, as was evidenced by the tragedy that took place in Orlando. We 
owe them so much for the many risks and difficult decisions they make 
every single day.
  It is important that we don't take their service for granted. Our 
communities are better, thanks to their unwavering commitment. That is 
why recognitions like today or National Night Out in August, where we 
promote police community partnerships through neighborhood block 
parties and cookouts with officers, are so critically important in 
strengthening the bond between community and law enforcement.
  Our men and women in uniform, as well as their families and loved 
ones, make tremendous sacrifices for the safety and security of their 
neighbors. We thank them and recognize them for their daily service.
