                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, Lord of the Universe, inspire our lawmakers today with 
the magnetism of Your presence. Give them a longing to know and do Your 
will, receiving Your guidance and following Your admonition. Lord, 
provide them with the liberating assurance that all things are possible 
for those who believe. Go before our Senators to guide, beside them to 
inspire, above them to bless, behind them to protect, and within them 
to transform. Fill their minds with Your Spirit and their hearts with 
Your joy, becoming their Providential Guide in all they think, say, and 
do.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
