                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We ask Your blessing upon the men and women of this, the people's 
House, as they return from a weekend at home. Help them, and, indeed, 
help us all to obey Your law, to do Your will, and to walk in Your way.
  We ask Your blessing this day as our President visits holy sites in 
the Middle East and the various leaders in the region. Grant that Your 
children of different cultures and faiths might come together in peace 
and understanding.
  May all that is done this day be done for Your greater honor and 
glory.
  Amen.
