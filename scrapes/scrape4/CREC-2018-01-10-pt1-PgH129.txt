                  HUMAN RIGHTS FOR THE IRANIAN PEOPLE

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the dramatic 
struggle for freedom and human rights that we are witnessing in the 
country of Iran.
  The oppressive, theocratic regime in Iran has a bloody track record 
of abuses and has long neglected its citizens' most basic rights and 
needs.
  The Government of Iran has squandered the precious resources of its 
people by supporting proxy armies throughout the Middle East and 
wreaking havoc across the globe instead of providing for the basic 
needs of its citizens. Courageous Iranians are proving each day that 
they are no longer willing to accept the indignities and repression 
from the ruling elite.
  It is tragic, but not shocking, to see the regime in Iran respond to 
the recent wave of protests with violence, cutting off communications, 
media, and, predictably, blaming the United States of America.
  I am a cosponsor of H. Res. 676, a resolution passed by the House of 
Representatives yesterday in support of the rights of the people of 
Iran to express themselves freely, and condemning the oppressive 
Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate protests.
  I stand with the brave Iranians who are facing down the violent and 
brutal regime for the sake of liberty.
