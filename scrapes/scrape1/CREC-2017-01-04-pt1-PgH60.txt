           HOW THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WORKS FOR CONSTITUENTS

  (Ms. JUDY CHUof California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JUDY CHU ofCalifornia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of 
Kalwis Lo, a young man from my district in San Gabriel, California, who 
toldme how his life was saved by the Affordable Care Act.
  When he was just out of college, Kalwis was shocked when he 
wasdiagnosed with stage III Hodgkin lymphoma. He learned that this 
disease would end his young life if ignored, but was actuallyeasily 
treatable in the early stages.
  No longer covered by his university, he applied to every type of 
health insurance hecould, but he was denied every single time because 
of his preexisting condition. He knew that through insurance coverage 
hecould get the chemotherapy treatments that could save his life, but 
with each denial, he felt more and more desperate.
  ThenKalwis learned about the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan 
under the Affordable Care Act. This plan made insuranceaccessible to 
anyone that had been denied due to a preexisting condition. Thankfully, 
California was one of the Statesparticipating in the program. Finally, 
Kalwis got the chemotherapy he needed. He is one of millions of 
Americans given thepromise of their lives back thanks to the Affordable 
Care Act.
