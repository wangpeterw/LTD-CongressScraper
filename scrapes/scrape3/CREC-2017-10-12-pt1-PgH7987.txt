                     WELCOMING REVEREND JOSHUA LEU

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. 
Marshall) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute and say thanks 
during Pastor Appreciation Month. This one is particularly special, as 
one of my own church's pastors gave the opening prayer to this body 
just moments ago.
  From baptisms to weddings to funerals, pastors give us encouragement 
to meet the demands of life. They give spiritual balance to a material 
world and are spiritual leaders for a nation deemed ``one Nation under 
God.''
  I thank my current pastor, Pastor Josh Leu; his wife, Ashley; his 
lovely daughters, Karys and Khora. I also want to thank my pastor of 20 
years, Pastor Bill Johnson, and his wife, Lois.
  Thanks for all you have done for us, for my family, for my community, 
and for my church.
  Like Pastor Bill always used to say: Have a good day, if you want to.
  Mr. Speaker, let's all reach out to pastors and their families to 
tell them thanks for all they do for us.
