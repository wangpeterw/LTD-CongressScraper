                       CONGRATULATING LYN GARLING

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
farmer-educator Lyn Garling for being selected as the 2018 recipient of 
the Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture's PASAbilities 
Award. The award honors businesses and individuals who make meaningful 
contributions to sustainable agriculture in the State and beyond.
  For the past 20 years, Lyn Garling of Rebersburg has owned and 
operated Over the Moon Farm in Centre County. Over the Moon specializes 
in organic hay, broilers, hogs, and turkeys.
  Lyn has traveled widely, teaching ecology in Nicaragua and conducting 
biological studies in Costa Rica and Mexico. She has earned her 
bachelor's degree in zoology and has worked on an 80-cow, 800-acre 
dairy farm in Colorado. She has spent decades as a program director for 
the Pennsylvania Integrated Pest Management Program at Penn State 
University, and she is widely known for helping growers at all scales 
understand and manage pests on their own operations.
  Lyn has also worked as an independent organic inspector for 
Pennsylvania's Certified Organic and has served several terms on PASA's 
board of directors.
  I wholeheartedly congratulate Lyn on this well-deserved recognition, 
and I thank her for all of her contributions to the industry.
