                   SCHOOL AND GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION

  (Ms. BONAMICI asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say that we must refuse to 
accept gun violence as normal. Today, I stand with students from Oregon 
to Florida, who are courageously and peacefully demanding that their 
elected leaders take real action to prevent gun violence in their 
communities.
  This past weekend I met Madeline, a high school student from 
Beaverton, Oregon. She said that now when she enters a classroom, her 
first thought is: where can she hide, and how could she escape.
  As a mom, that broke my heart. And I heard from students in 
McMinnville, Oregon. They told me they are terrified when they hear a 
fire alarm because that is how the Parkland, Florida, massacre started.
  How have we become a country where our students are afraid in their 
classrooms?
  Mr. Speaker, we owe it to Madeline and to all of the students around 
the country to protect them from violence and to keep them safe in 
school and in their communities.
  The STOP School Violence Act is a modest first step, but we must do 
more. We must listen to the voices of the students and work toward 
creating a safer future for them and for everyone.
