                                 PRAYER

  Reverend David Godleski, Jesuit Conference, Washington, D.C., offered 
the following prayer:
  Gracious and loving God, look kindly on those gathered here this 
morning and grant to all of us a sense of zeal and enthusiasm for the 
work You have called us to do. We are mindful and our hearts are 
grateful for the many gifts You have bestowed on us, both as 
individuals and as a Nation, especially the gift of freedom, the gift 
of our abundant natural resources, and the gift of opportunities to 
pursue our hopes and aspirations.
  We ask that You continue to bless our country and those who govern 
it, especially the Members of this House of Representatives. Bestow 
upon them true wisdom, understanding, and insight in their efforts to 
discern how best to serve the people of these United States. Provide 
them with the strength and courage of will to promote the common good 
and to work for justice and peace for all people.
  Amen.
