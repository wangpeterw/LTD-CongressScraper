                 REACTION TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ADDRESS

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, last night President Trump delivered a speech 
that was long on campaign themes but short on specifics. It seems the 
President is more interested in political theater than leadership, and 
it showed. He was very vague on every topic he discussed, from health 
care to trade, to tax reform.
  The campaign is over, but it is clear President Trump hasn't moved 
on. Where is his interest in governing and in leading this Nation? I 
don't see it. Just the day before, in his speech, he discovered that 
health care is unbelievably complex.
  Every day since the inauguration President Trump has shown that he is 
ill-prepared, ill-tempered, and ill-informed, and he does not 
understand what governing is about. His speech did not change that.
  It is time for President Trump to stop talking about bringing this 
country together and actually make an effort to do so. He needs to 
engage Congress, including the Congressional Black Caucus. He needs to 
move from platitudes to plans, and he also needs to act on the 
priorities of the American people.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
