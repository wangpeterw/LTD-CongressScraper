                 GE'S ECONOMIC IMPACT IN NORTH CAROLINA

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, GE will hold its 2017 Annual Meeting 
of Shareowners in Asheville, North Carolina. The company will also be 
celebrating its 125th anniversary.
  GE likes to hold its shareowners meeting in a different city each 
year to highlight the company's strong presence in communities across 
the United States. It certainly has significant business operations in 
North Carolina.
  GE supports nearly 18,000 jobs in the State between its direct 
employees and its suppliers. For every one GE job, three North Carolina 
jobs are supported. The company also generates $7.2 billion in total 
production output per year in North Carolina, and compensates its 
employees more than twice the State average.
  GE makes this investment in our great State because it knows that the 
workers in North Carolina, especially those at the GE facility in West 
Jefferson, in the Fifth District, work hard and have a commitment to 
excellence.
