                HUMAN TRAFFICKING, A SCOURGE ON HUMANITY

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House

for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, at 15 years old, Jane was pregnant, 
alone, out on the streets, and ready to end her life. When Marcus and 
Robin Thompson found her, Jane thought she was saved. But instead of 
taking her to safety, the criminals forced the girl on a terrifying 6-
week trek across the United States.
  The outlaws photographed Jane in suggestive photos and sold her on 
the marketplace of sex slavery--human trafficking. Truck stops and 
sleazy hotel rooms became her life, sold to any pervert with the money 
and desire to buy sex from a child.
  After multiple beatings, Jane sought help at a hospital, where nurses 
identified her as a sex-trafficked victim. The Thompsons are now locked 
up in prison for the crime they committed--modern day slavery.
  Madam Speaker, human trafficking is a scourge. We must remain 
vigilant like the nurses in this case and rescue victims and send 
traffickers to the jailhouse where they belong. No more selling our 
children on the marketplace of slavery.
  And that is just the way it is.
