                        TRIBUTE TO GERALD FRAAS

 Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I recognize Gerald Fraas, an 
intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all the hard work he has done 
for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Gerald is a graduate of West Central High School in Hartford, SD. 
Currently, he is attending the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, AL, 
where he studies political science and economics. Gerald is a dedicated 
and diligent worker who has been devoted to getting the most out of his 
internship experience and who has been a true asset to the office.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Gerald for all of the 
fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the years to 
come.
