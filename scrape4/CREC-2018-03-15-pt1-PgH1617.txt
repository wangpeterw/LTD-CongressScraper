CELEBRATING FIVE GENERATIONS AND 125 YEARS OF VARNS AND HOOVER HARDWARE

  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Varns and 
Hoover Hardware, which has been a fixture in the Middlebury community 
for more than 125 years.
  The success and longevity of this family-owned business lies in the 
family's dedication to serving their neighbors and providing high-
quality products with a friendly smile.
  Small businesses like this are the backbone of the American economy, 
and it is a privilege to represent a family so devoted to the 
prosperity of their community for so many years.
  To honor Varns and Hoover Hardware is to honor what it means to 
achieve the American Dream.
  With ownership now being passed down to the fifth generation family 
member, Nathan Miller, I am grateful to be able to recognize such a 
pivotal moment in the history of this Hoosier family, their small 
business, and the community that they serve.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Varns 
and Hoover Hardware and in wishing them the best in all the years to 
come.
