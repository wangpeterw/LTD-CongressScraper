   RECOGNIZING THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE WORK OF SCOTT CHESTER GRAVES

  (Mr. CONAWAY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and thank a long-
time member of my staff, Scott Graves, for his 12 years of service on 
Capitol Hill. Scott has worked in numerous capacities, starting as an 
agriculture legislative assistant and then as a legislative director, 
then as my chief of staff, and, most recently, as staff director at the 
House Committee on Agriculture. He is a well-respected and accomplished 
leader; and though he is moving on, I know he will continue to 
accomplish great things for American agriculture.
  Scott has been my right-hand man for many years, helping me navigate 
the complexities of the 2008 and 2014 farm bills, serving as an adviser 
when I chaired the House Committee on Ethics, and keeping the wheels 
running in both my personal office and the Agriculture Committee. 
Although much of his work was done behind the scenes, my colleagues and 
I knew we could always count on Scott to get results.
  Beyond his many professional attributes, I will certainly miss his 
wit and humor. I am very proud of him, and I wish Scott, Haley, Bronte, 
and a unit to be named this summer the very best. I want to thank him 
for his loyalty and dedication to public service, and I wish him 
Godspeed in the next chapter of his life.
