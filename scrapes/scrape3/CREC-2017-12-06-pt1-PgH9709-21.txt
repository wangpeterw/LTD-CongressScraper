            By Mr. ROGERS of Alabama:
        H.R. 4577.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article I, Section 8, Clause I empowers the Congress to 
     provide for the common defense. Explosives detection canines 
     have proven invaluable in conflicts throughout American 
     history. Servicemembers and first responders entrust their 
     safety to these incredible animals. However international 
     demand for capable working dogs has driven up prices and 
     depleted supply abroad. This bill aims to connect domestic 
     canine breeders and vendors with the federal procurement 
     process and streamline the procurement of quality working 
     dogs from the United States rather than overseas.
       This legislation will ensure continued access to critical 
     defense asset.
