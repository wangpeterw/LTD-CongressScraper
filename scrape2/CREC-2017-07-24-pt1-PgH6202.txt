                         SUPPORTING CARE CORPS

  (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.)
  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to encourage my colleagues to support the Care Corps Demonstration Act. 
As a caregiver myself, I know how tough a job it is and how critical it 
is that we support family caregivers and the paid direct care 
workforce.
  But as our population continues to age, our country faces a critical 
shortage of caregivers. In 2010, there were seven potential caregivers 
for every person over the age of 80; by 2030, that ratio is projected 
to drop by almost half, to about 4 to 1. At the same time, our economy 
continues to feel the effect of the Great Recession, and many young 
people are unemployed or underemployed.
  That is why I am introducing this bipartisan bill which creates a 
grant program that would place Care Corps volunteers in communities 
across the country to provide services that help seniors and 
individuals with disabilities remain independent. The program would 
help meet the need for more caregivers and provide opportunity in a 
growing career field by offering benefits and educational assistance to 
the volunteers.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to quickly pass this important 
bill.
