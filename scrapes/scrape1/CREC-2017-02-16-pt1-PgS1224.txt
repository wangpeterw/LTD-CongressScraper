                       RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, here is something else that will give 
cheer to Kentucky families. I am pleased to report that today the 
President will sign a resolution identical to a proposal I introduced, 
a resolution that will undo a harmful regulation that could threaten 
nearly one-third of America's coal mining jobs. I am looking forward to 
attending that signing ceremony later today.
  This resolution is just one of several that we hope to send to the 
President to begin providing the American people with relief, 
protecting jobs, and growing our economy. It reflects promises made and 
promises kept.
