                   IN SUPPORT OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, when I ran for Congress, I made a promise to 
hang my family's Revolutionary War musket in my office as a steadfast 
reminder of the reason I am here in Washington: to support and defend 
the Constitution and to honor those who have fought for the 
Constitution and those who continue to fight for our freedom. We must 
never forget how precious our constitutional rights are, and the right 
to bear arms is one of the most important because that right ensures 
our ability to defend all of our rights.
  As a veteran of the United States Army and as a life member of the 
NRA, I will fight in Congress to defend our right to bear arms. It is a 
special honor to represent the great people of the Second District of 
Florida and to fight for their conservative values in Congress.
