              NATIONAL PARK FOUNDATION CELEBRATES 50 YEARS

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, the National Park Foundation 
was established by Congress and President Johnson.
  The National Park Foundation is the official charity of America's 
national parks and the nonprofit partner to the National Park Service. 
For 50 years, they have raised funds, private funds, to help protect 
more than 84 million acres of national parks through critical 
conservation and preservation efforts.
  The National Park Foundation has helped safeguard our heritage and 
engage that next generation of national park enthusiasts by connecting 
us to the parks right in our own backyard. Although they haven't been 
around as long as the National Park Service, they have played an 
important role in strengthening and enhancing our parks.
  So, Mr. Speaker, I would just like to thank the National Park 
Foundation for its work to help protect and preserve the crown jewels 
of America, our national parks, monuments, and battlefields. Our 
country looks forward to another 50 years of your great work.
