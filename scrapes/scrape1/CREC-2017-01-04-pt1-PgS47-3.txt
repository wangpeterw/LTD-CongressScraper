                       TRIBUTE TO ARLENE MATHEWS

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, Iwish to recognize Arlene Mathews 
of Helena, MT, for her 63 years of volunteer service at St. Peter's 
Hospital.
  In a basement in 1953, Arlene began the ``Sock Sew,'' which makes 
socks for newborn babies who are born in December at St.Peter's 
Hospital to take home.
  This year, Arlene and volunteers sitting at 20 sewing machines cut, 
sewed, and glued 100 large stockings for the newbornsand another 100 
smaller stockings for patients at St. Peter's whose Christmas Eve is 
spent in the hospital. This is a wonderfulgesture that made their 
Christmas in the hospital just a little bit better. Thank you, Arlene, 
for thinking of those in thehospital, especially during the Christmas 
season.
  I am thrilled to honor our unsung hero, Arlene Mathews, for her 63-
year service to her community.
