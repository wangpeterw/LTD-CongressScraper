                  CONGRATULATING DIRECTOR GLENN COSTIE

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, today I rise to thank and honor an 
integral member of my community, Director Glenn Costie of the Dayton VA 
Medical Center, and congratulate him on his retirement.
  Director Costie turned the Dayton VA into one of the top medical 
facilities for our veterans in the country. Director Costie's success 
as a director of the VA Medical Center in Dayton has gained him 
national recognition. He has been sent throughout the country to save 
multiple VA medical facilities plagued with issues, particularly 
including veteran patient backlogs.
  Furthermore, Director Costie has worked tirelessly to integrate the 
Dayton VA into our community to serve our veterans in a way that it 
hadn't in several decades. Director Costie's time at the VA has been 
dedicated to bettering the lives of our veterans.
  I was very honored to work with Director Costie on the issue of 
bringing creative housing options for Dayton's veterans, a place known 
as Lyons Place II. We also worked together on the successful campaign 
to bring the VA National Archives to Dayton.
  Director Costie's leadership and expertise will be deeply missed at 
the Dayton VA. I wish to thank him, give him all the best, and look 
forward to what he will be doing in his leadership in the future in our 
community, and I thank him again for everything he has done for Dayton 
veterans.
