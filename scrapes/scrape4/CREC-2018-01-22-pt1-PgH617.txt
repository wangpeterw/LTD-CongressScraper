                       LET'S COME TO A COMPROMISE

  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask both sides of this Chamber 
to stop bickering and finger-pointing and start listening to each 
other. Let's come to a compromise.
  This government shutdown is a disgrace to this Congress and hurtful 
to this country. Both sides are blaming each other, and the American 
people are shaking their heads in disgust and disbelief.
  Both sides have valid points, but, in this case, partial rights 
actually make a wrong. The government needs continuous funding. The 
military needs funding. Domestic programs, such as homeland security, 
children's health, and the opioid epidemic, need proper funding. DACA 
needs a solution. The southern border needs securing.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask Members of the House, let's work together and find 
reasonable compromises for these important issues. Let's look at each 
other as honorable people.
