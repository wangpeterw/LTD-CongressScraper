                        A MESSAGE FOR THE MEDIA

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have a message for the liberal so-
called mainstream media.

obviously so slanted, so biased, that you have lost your credibility; 
in fact, polls show that it is at a record low.
  In trying to destroy this President, you are destroying yourself. Is 
that what you want?
