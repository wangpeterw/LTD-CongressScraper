                     POTENTIAL CRIMES AND COVERUPS

  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump poses the greatest 
Presidential threat to our democracy since Richard Nixon. It is about 
the potential crimes and the potential coverup. Seventeen different 
intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russians interfered with 
the election in order to help Donald Trump. Top Trump cronies like 
Carter Page, Paul Manafort, and Michael Flynn all had regular 
communications with high-level Russian intelligence agents at the same 
time they were engaging in hacking.
  The National Security Adviser resigned in disgrace because of illegal 
communication with the Russian Ambassador. The President refuses to 
denounce Vladimir Putin and continues to try to make Russia great 
again.
  Connect the dots. It is time for House Republicans to do their job 
and put country ahead of party. Join us in a bipartisan investigation 
of the White House. What did the President know, and when did he know 
it?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Simpson). The Chair would remind Members 
to avoid improper references to the President.
