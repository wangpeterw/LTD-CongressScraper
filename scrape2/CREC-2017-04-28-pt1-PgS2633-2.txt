                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, thank You for Your great mercies for us, for while we 
are yet seeking You, You find us. Before we call, You answer, and while 
we are speaking, You fulfill Your purposes.
  Guide our lawmakers on their legislative pilgrimage. Lord, provide 
them with a spirit of wisdom so that they will be able to discern what 
is best. May they strive to honor You in their thoughts, words, and 
actions. Help them to faithfully seek truth and justice for all rather 
than privilege for a few.
  O God, give us all the courage to go forth to live as we have prayed.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
