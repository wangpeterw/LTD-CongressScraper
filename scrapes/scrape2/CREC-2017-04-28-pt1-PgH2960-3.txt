             PROTECT EVERY COASTAL COMMUNITY IN OUR NATION

  (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise because I am deeply troubled by the 
Trump administration's executive order expected to be signed today that 
will potentially expand offshore oil drilling in the Pacific, Atlantic, 
and Arctic Oceans. My district, the central coast, knows all too well 
the havoc wreaked from gas and oil platforms off our coasts. We cannot 
afford another disastrous oil spill.
  California's coastal region generates over $1.9 trillion per year in 
GDP. This order poses a direct threat to our local tourism economies 
and the success of local businesses, which are undeniably tied to a 
clean coast and healthy, thriving ocean ecosystem.
  It is crucial for Congress to pass my bill, H.R. 731, the California 
Clean Coast Act, to permanently ban drilling off California's coast and 
to take further action to protect every coastal community across our 
Nation.
