              1-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF DALLAS POLICE SHOOTING

  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, July 7, 2016, is forever marked by the 
sadness and loss our community suffered when five Dallas police 
officers were gunned down in the deadliest attack for law enforcement 
in the United States since the September 11 attacks.
  These officers were killed as they protected Dallas citizens 
exercising their constitutional right to protest. They put their own 
lives on the line for the safety of others.
  Reflecting on the events of last July 7, what stands out to me is the 
heroism of those who answered when duty called and a community that 
banded together during this tragic event. We are in the midst of an 
environment that can be deeply divided. We should all seek to follow 
the example of the Dallas community.
  I want to acknowledge former Dallas Chief of Police David Brown and 
offer my sincere gratitude for his leadership; as well as the Dallas 
Police Department; first responders; the Parkland hospital; Baylor 
University hospital, where this iconic photograph was taken, for 
providing excellent emergency care; and others who helped the victims 
of this attack.
  Mr. Speaker, we must recognize the sacrifice of the men and women and 
the critical role they played to protect our communities.
