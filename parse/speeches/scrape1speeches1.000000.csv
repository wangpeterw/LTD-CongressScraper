5926,topic-id,1370,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of my remarks at the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions earlier today.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       2017 Food and Drug Administration User Fee Reauthorization       The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and      Pensions will please come to order. We're holding a hearing      today on ``FDA User Fee Agreements: Improving Medical Product      Regulation and Innovation for Patients Part 1.''       Now, Senator Murray and I will each have an opening      statement, then we will introduce our panel of witnesses.      After our witness testimony, senators will have 5 minutes of      questions. The subject of today is the Food and Drug      Administration's medical device and drug user fees. It seems      like a long time ago, but it really wasn't that long ago,      that Congress passed the 21st Century Cures 94 Senators      voted for it, President Obama and Vice President Biden were      strongly in support of it. So were Speaker Ryan and Mitch      McConnell, who called it ``the most important piece of      legislation in the last       It came through this committee and I thank the members of      the committee, especially for resolving our differences of      opinions and making it possible to reach a consensus. That      bill was about the moving medical products, drugs and devices      more rapidly, in a safe way, through the investment and the      regulatory process into the hands of patients and doctors      offices.       Today, we are talking about really implementing that great      goal, one that shows so much promise for virtually every      We're here to talk about how we continue the fund      the Food and Drug Administration, the agency responsible for      making sure the promising research supported by 21st Century      Cures actually reaches patients.       We will hear from witnesses from the agency itself to tell      us how the user fee agreements will improve the agency's      abilities to regulate medical products and promote      innovation. We will hear from patients, device manufacturers,      and brand and generic drug manufacturers in a second hearing,      which is tentatively scheduled for April 4.       I want to thank the witnesses for taking the time to      testify today. We respect the great amount of expertise and      service that you've given for our country. I want to thank      you also for moving so quickly to implement the 21st Century      Cures I noticed specifically that the provision      involving regenerative medicine was published with about a      month after President Obama signed the law.       The first medical product user fee agreement was enacted in      1992. FDA worked with the drug manufacturers to hammer out an      agreement that the agency would collect user fees from drug      manufacturers in exchange for more timely, predictable      reviews. The agreement was a success--it decreased review      times and increased patient access to medicines.       Before September 30 of this year, 4 different user fee      agreements need to be reauthorized: The Prescription drug      user fee is the first one. Now it's common around here to      call it PDUFA, I'm not going to do it. I just can't stand      PDUFA, and MDUFA and GDUFA and the other So I'm going to      call them if you don't mind, the prescription drug user fee,      which accounted for over 70 percent of the brand drug review      budget in       The second one is the Medical device user fee, which      accounted for 35 percent of the medical device review budget      in 2015.       The Generic drug user fee accounted for 70 percent of the      generic drug review budget. Biosimilar user fee accounted for      7 percent of the biosimilar review budget.                 Consequences of Failing to Reauthorize       So a lot of the money for the FDA comes from these      agreements with manufacturers of prescription drugs and      devices.       The authority for FDA to collect user fees for medical      product review will expire on September 30 of this year--six      months from now.       Now this is probably the most important part of what I have      to say this morning. If we do not move quickly to reauthorize      these agreements, the FDA will be forced to begin sending      layoff notices to more than 5,000 employees to notify them      that they may lose their jobs in 60 days--that's what they      have to do by law.       A delay in reauthorizing these agreements would delay the      reviews of drugs and devices submitted after April 1, only a      few days away.       For example, if we do not pass these reauthorizations into      law before the current agreements expire, an FDA reviewer who[[Page S1887]]     gets started reviewing a cancer drug submitted to the agency      in April would be laid off on October 1, before the reviewer      is able to finish his or her work. The sooner we reauthorize      the agreements, the better--to give patients, reviewers, and      companies certainty.       In addition to harming patients and families that rely on      medical innovation, a delay in reauthorizing the user fees      would threaten biomedical industry jobs and America's global      leadership in biomedical innovation.                      Process for reauthorization       I am hopeful that this committee, and this Congress, can      work in a bipartisan manner to reauthorize the user fees      before the August recess.       Congress must pass legislation reauthorizing and updating      the fees to support the recommendations contained in what are      called ``commitment letters'' sent to Congress in       Now these commitment letters are part of the agreements      between FDA and industry--they establish the agency's      commitments, such as timelines for application review or to      put out guidances in exchange for the fees Congress      authorizes. The letters were transmitted to Congress in      January of this year.       So today's hearing is not the first time members of      Congress or the public is hearing about the recommendations      for reauthorization.       In Congress, while we were working on the 21st Century      Cures and after it was signed into law, the HELP Committee      had 15 bipartisan briefings, some of which were in      conjunction with the Energy and Commerce Committee in the      House of Representatives as well, so we could hear from FDA      and industry about the reauthorization. The first of those      briefings was back in late 2015.       Outside of Congress, the FDA posted meeting minutes after      every negotiation, and held public meetings to hear feedback.       So the content of the commitment letters, and the changes      to the fee authorizations, should not be new, or a surprise,      for any member of this committee.       After the April 4th hearing, I hope to move to mark-up the      legislation in committee as soon as possible.       This is the first time that the user fees have sunset in      the first year of a new administration, so we are starting      hearings a little later this year than we did in 2012.       In order to get this done on time, any additional policies      that Senators may want to attach need to be broadly      bipartisan, related to human medical products, and non-     controversial in order to avoid slowing the package down.            How reauthorization builds on 21st Century Cures       There are many improvements in the commitment letters and      fee structure in these reauthorizations to be excited about.       The prescription drug and medical device reauthorizations      include many provisions that build on the work of 21st      Century Cures, such as: involving patients in drug and      medical device development, dedicated staff to assist in the      development and review of rare disease drugs, improved      timelines, increased guidance for drug and device combination      products, and modernizing the clinical trial process.       There are important structural reforms. Each agreement      contains reporting measures built both by FDA and by      independent third parties, so we can see how the changes are      working. FDA is going to work to implement full time      reporting by 2022, so Congress, patients, and medical product      manufacturers will have a better picture about how resources      are being used at FDA and understand what is needed to do      what we ask.       The biosimilar and generic drug user fee agreement includes      additional staff and resources to approve more biosimilars      and more generic drugs, which provide more competition and      lower drug costs.       These are just a few of the highlights of the      reauthorization and commitment letters. It is a good      agreement for patients, and I look forward to working with      Senator Murray and all the members of the Committee to get it      done expeditiously.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgS1886-2.txt,1695,CONGRESS SHOULD CONDEMN U.N. ANTI-ISRAELRESOLUTION,2017.0,21.0,February
5697,topic-id,719,"Mr.Speaker, I wish to thank the gentleman from Iowa, my good friend for yielding to me.  I rise to express my strong support for the announced policy by Attorney General Jeff Sessions that will terminate U.Department of Justice grants to sanctuary cities. These are the localities that have chosen not to cooperate with the Federal Government when its seeks to deport already-detained criminal aliens.  Under this Trump policy, your hard-earned tax dollars will no longer go to cities and counties that thumb their nose at the Federal immigration authorities and refuse to cooperate.  In President Trump's first 2 months in office, this administration has acted to secure our borders, to encourage compliance with Federal immigration law, and to deport criminal aliens. The previous administration put out the welcome mat for criminal aliens. Thanks to Trump, the welcome mat has now been removed.  A few short days ago, the national news broke on how two illegal aliens from Central America raped a 14-year-old girl in the boys bathroom of a public high school in Rockville, These two young men, Henry Sanchez-Milian, an 18-year-old from Guatemala, and Jose Montano, a 17-year-old from El Salvador, came across our southern border last year as unaccompanied minors. The Obama administration initially targeted them for deportation proceedings, but they were later released to join relatives in  When asked about the situation, Rockville school officials said that the legal status of these two individuals did not matter, as Rockville has declared itself to be a sanctuary city. I beg to differ. It does matter. If the Federal Government had done its duty and immediately returned these illegal immigrants to their home country, this young girl would not have been brutally raped.  For the sake of this young girl, we must secure our borders. This vicious crime would never have taken place had the Obama administration followed the law and secured our borders. The good news is that the new administration is working hard to secure our borders, to deport criminal aliens, and to protect the lives of American citizens.  Cracking down on sanctuary cities is an important first step. In the first month of the Trump administration, ICE issued 3,083 detainers. These are orders for local authorities to keep criminal aliens in custody for 48 hours to enable U.Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, agents to come and get these criminal aliens for deportation. 206 of these detainees were just declined, meaning that local authorities deliberately ignored ICE's detainer requests and released these individuals back out onto American streets.[[Page H2580]]  This is especially concerning because 44 percent of those individuals had already been convicted of crimes in the United These weren't just petty crimes, folks. These include: homicide, rape, assault, domestic violence, indecent exposure with a minor, sex offense against a minor, aggravated assault with a weapon, resisting an officer, vehicle theft, kidnapping, driving under the influence, hit-and-run, and sexual assault.  Thank you, Mr.President, for holding accountable these sanctuary cities that released these criminals back out onto our streets.  We are also working to force foreign countries to take back their criminal alien citizens; 25-year-old Casey Chadwick was murdered by an illegal alien from Haiti, Jean Jacques had been released 6 months earlier and ordered deported after serving a 19-year sentence for attempted murder.  Haiti had refused multiple times to take back Jacques, and under the Obama administration policy, Jacques was simply released onto U.streets to return to his life of crime, although Haiti had gladly taken billions of U.aid. That is why I have introduced H.82, the Criminal Alien Deportation Enforcement My bill withholds foreign aid from countries that do not repatriate their criminal aliens.  This commonsense step ensures that countries that benefit from the goodwill of the United States must hold up their end of the bargain and take back their criminal aliens. And through his recent executive order, President Trump declared that he would restrict the issuance of visas to certain residents of noncooperative countries. Congress should support the President by locking in this enforcement with legislation so that a future President does not reverse this enforcement.                              {time}  1115  On behalf of the American people, I applaud President Trump and I call on my colleagues to cosponsor my legislation to lock in these protections for future generations of Americans and keep them safe.

5778,topic-id,1504,"Mr.President, I come today to talk about the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.Supreme Once again, throughout the hearings last week, Judge Gorsuch proved that he has the knowledge, he has the temperament, and he has the experience to serve on our Nation's highest He laid out a clear judicial philosophy that adheres to what I think most Americans want to see happen today on the Court and what clearly the Framers of the Constitution thought would happen.  In his own words, Judge Gorsuch said: ``I have one client, it's the law.'' That is the way the Founders saw the Supreme They didn't see it as a legislative body. All good judges had to do was to read the law. They didn't have to be happy with the law. They didn't have to approve the law. They didn't have to determine that the law and the Constitution met their exact standard. They just had to determine what the law and the Constitution said. In fact, the first Supreme Court had six judges. There was no thought that it was a legislative body that had to have a tie-breaking judge so you could legislate.  They thought six judges were plenty. By the way, they thought they needed six circuits. Each of those judges rode a circuit. So even when there was an appeal to the Supreme Court, one of the judges had already heard the case at the lower level. That judge heard the case again and then listened to see if that judge heard anything new, something that might change their mind. The other five of them were sitting there with the appeal of one of their colleagues, and nobody saw that as a problem because the Court wasn't about legislating.  The Court was about determining what the law should say. Again, Judge Gorsuch said: ``I have one client, it's the law.'' It is not the little guy. It is not the big guy. It is not the medium-size guy: It is the law. He was asked over and over: Are you going to find for the little guy or the big guy? Well, that is not the judge's job. The judge's job is to read the law so both the little guy and the big guy know when they are in court that this is a country where the rule of law matters. They know, when they enter into a contract, that if you and your lawyer have read the law right, there shouldn't, at the end of the day, be very much gray space about what that contract said.  Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has demonstrated his commitment to interpret the Constitution as it is written, applying the rule of law and not legislating from the bench. ``Judges are not politicians in robes.'' I think that may be another Gorsuch comment: ``Judges are not politicians in robes.'' If he didn't say it, his career as a judge shows that he believes it. Unfortunately, some of my colleagues have shown that their deference to the Constitution is not the same when it[[Page S2023]]comes to the Senate's role to advise and consent.  I am particularly dismayed by the Democratic leader's intention to filibuster Judge Gorsuch's nomination. Republicans have never filibustered a Democratic nominee, yet colleagues across the aisle appear willing to do just that. Such a maneuver would only be an affront to our national norms.  I don't know in the history of the country--I think there was one filibuster led by Democrats against a nomination by a Democrat President when Lyndon Johnson nominated Abe Fortas to move from Associate Justice to the Chief Justice's role. It didn't happen in 1968 because it was a Presidential year and Justices don't get confirmed in the Supreme Court in a Presidential year in vacancies that hadn't even occurred yet. 2, it was led by Democrats in a Senate that had an overwhelming Democratic majority. There has never been a partisan filibuster effort involving any Justice on the Supreme Court until right now--until right now--and I am disappointed that that is what the Democratic leader of the Senate says he wants to do.  According to Robert David Johnson, a Brooklyn College history professor, ``The chances of success'' of a partisan filibuster ``are basically zero.'' So my thought would be: Why pursue it?  Kim Strassel recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal: ``Never in U.history have we had a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee.''  In the last half century, only three Supreme Court Justices have even faced a filibuster. The most recent, Justice Alito, was ultimately confirmed when 19 Democrats refused to back the filibuster of his nomination. He had the full vote, and he got a majority vote.  One would think that if Senate Democrats are willing to upend Senate tradition to block this nomination, they would have an unassailable reason to block it. They would be saying this judge is not qualified. This judge hasn't served his time. We don't know what he would do as a judge. He has been on the circuit court of appeals for a decade, and when looking at case after case, appeal after appeal, we see his unbelievably fine record as a judge.  In announcing his intention to mount this filibuster, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate said that Judge Gorsuch ``was unable to sufficiently convince me that he'd be an independent check'' on the executive branch. The American Bar Association unanimously gave Judge Gorsuch's nomination their highest rating. They disagree. As they explained, ``based on writings, interviews, and analyses we scrutinized to reach our rating, we discerned that Judge Gorsuch believes strongly in the independence of the judicial branch of government, and we predict that he will be a strong but respectful voice in protecting it.''  This is from the American Bar Association, which many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have said over and over again is the ultimate test of qualification for the  When I met with the judge last month, he left no doubt in my mind that he would uphold the judiciary's unique constitutional role in our system of checks and balances.  Let me go back to the other quote here for a minute. What was it that the Senator from New York said? ``Judge Gorsuch was unable to sufficiently convince me that he'd be an independent check'' on the executive branch. I am not even sure I know where in the Constitution that is the job of the judge. The job of the judge is to read the law and look at the The job of the Congress is to pass the law. The job of the President is to sign the law. Unless there is some constitutional problem with that law, it is not the judge's job to decide whether the law is right or not, unless there is a constitutional reason to do that.  Last week, I mentioned Judge Gorsuch's qualifications for the bench, but I think they bear repeating as we enter the next few days. As a graduate of Columbia University, a graduate of Harvard Law and Oxford University, his academic credentials are at the highest level. Judge Gorsuch has served his country admirably as a Supreme Court clerk, first for a Democrat on the Court, Byron White, who had been appointed by President Kennedy, and for a Republican appointee, Anthony Kennedy, appointed by President He has been the principal Deputy Associate Attorney General of the United States at the Department of Justice, and in 2006, George Bush nominated him to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of The Senate unanimously confirmed his position at that time. Every single Democrat--12 of them now serving in the Senate who were in office, supported his nomination in 2006. In the decade that he served on the Tenth Circuit Court, he has shown independence, integrity, and he has shown a mainstream judicial philosophy. He has demonstrated a legal capacity that makes him a worthy successor to Justice Scalia on the There is no precedent for requiring a 60-vote threshold to confirm a Supreme Court Justice, and Judge Gorsuch has given this body no reason to demand one now.  I look forward to supporting his nomination. It will reach the Senate floor, I believe, after the Judiciary Committee deals with it early next week. I hope by the time we leave here a week from Friday that Judge Gorsuch is on his way to join the Supreme Court as an Associate By the way, if he does that, he will be the first Associate Justice ever to serve on the Court with a Justice for whom he clerked two decades or more ago. When he and Justice Kennedy get a chance to serve together--I look forward to seeing that happen.

5757,topic-id,485,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.58, which would undermine the requirement that States assess the quality of their teacher preparation programs and weaken efforts to provide educators with high-quality teacher preparation programs.  There is no doubt that our country needs highly skilled and diverse educators, and that means attracting good people by providing them with high-quality preparation and ongoing support, especially early in their careers. Many teacher preparation programs are meeting this charge--recruiting diverse candidates, offering rigorous practicums, and providing supports that follow them into their classrooms.  But some programs are still preparing large cohorts of educators for fields that are not in demand. And, according to one survey, more than 60 percent of teachers still enter the classroom feeling unprepared for one of the toughest, most important jobs in  Many of us readily agree that the regulations governing transparency and program quality for teacher preparation are not perfect. But, let's remember that this resolution would effectively demolish key provisions at the Higher Education Act, which was last reauthorized in 2008, and in which Members from both sides of the aisle agreed that States needed to provide better data on the quality of their teacher preparation programs.  If the rules for improving teacher preparation programs are unnecessary, as my friends across the aisle may contend, I would ask them to explain why critical sections of the Higher Education Act remain largely unimplemented, nearly a decade after Members of Congress wrote the requirements into law. Without regulations, provisions of the 2008 reauthorization will continue to go unfilled. Taxpayer-funded grants will continue to support ineffective programs for teachers in high-needs schools.  The truth is, Democrats and Republicans could probably reach consensus about how we might like to see these regulations amended and improved. I am sure we all support robust data on how new teachers are performing and being supported in the classroom. And I am sure we all support States and institutions using data to continually strengthen their preparation programs.  But, unfortunately, my Republican colleagues appear unwilling to have that conversation about how to give teacher preparation programs the tools they need to improve. Instead, they have offered this resolution that would essentially guarantee that important provisions in law are never fully implemented by this administration, or a future administration, because this resolution is under the Congressional Review Act, which, until recently, has been used successfully only once. It is a blunt instrument that actually bans Federal agencies from providing similar protections in the future.  So instead of fixing the teacher preparation regulations and upholding congressional intent in the Higher Education Act, supporters of this resolution are turning their backs on the law. The resolution is an overreaction. It appears to be part of a dangerous agenda to do permanent damage to the Department of Education's important oversight and enforcement responsibilities.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this and work together on amending the regulations.  ",CREC-2017-02-07-pt1-PgH1041.txt,2092,HAPPY 108TH BIRTHDAY TO MARY COFFEY,2017.0,7.0,March
5762,topic-id,290,"I thank the chairman.  Mr.Speaker, H.57, which we will be voting on today and discussing and debating in a few moments, would overturn an administration rule on school accountability standards that were finalized back in  Congress passed a law last year with the intent of giving power back to States and to local communities, but unelected bureaucrats at the Department of Education finalized this rule last year which, ultimately, could force Common Core standards on States that don't comply.  We see this time and time again. Congress will create a law, and then an agency that is filled with unelected officials disregards the will of the people by writing regulations as it sees fit. Every American, in putting aside one's personal ideology, can agree that an important issue like how we educate our kids is not something that we should decide here in In the months and the years to come, we should welcome a continued debate about whether the fate of a child's education should be decided in Washington or if a child's education should be more personalized at the State and the community levels. In my view, dictating specific accountability requirements from Washington and punishing those who don't meet those standards is a losing prescription.  It is my hope that every kid in my district, in North Carolina, and around the country has a quality education. I think that is the hope of my colleagues, too. The more we think that Washington has all of the answers, the further we get away from our founding vision of a limited Federal role in our lives, especially in something as personal as education.  It will be debated in a few moments, but I do urge a ``yes'' vote on H.57.  ",CREC-2017-02-07-pt1-PgH1041.txt,,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,7.0,March

5870,topic-id,1429,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Neil Gorsuch and to oppose cloture on this nomination.  I take seriously the responsibility to give advice and consent, and I take seriously the President's remarks that he planned on nominating someone to the Court who would overturn Roe v.  A U.Supreme Court nominee requires 60 votes, and if a nominee can't clear 60 votes, then I agree with my colleague, the Senator from New York, that it is the nominee who should be changed and not the Senate rules.  If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will have a lifetime appointment to the U.Supreme Court and have an impact on many, many Americans' lives. When people say lifetime, I think that doesn't quite accurately reflect this issue and nomination. Lifetime, in this case, may mean 30 to 35 years.  It is hard for me in an information age to think of all the issues that are going to occur in the next 30 to 35 years and what issues this nominee might rule on. But I know this: Right now, privacy rights and how they affect the lives of many Americans are critical, not just to my constituents but to people all over the country.  Judge Gorsuch is commonly referred to as a proponent of originalism and textualism. He believes the U.Constitution should be interpreted by the original intentions of those who drafted it as closely as possible. As someone who knows well the record of the former Supreme Court Justice who wrote the Griswold v. Connecticut decision, I doubt that one would say that he was an originalist.  Some legal scholars have even called Judge Gorsuch a selective originalist, favoring some textual provisions while overlooking others. And while no one expects Judge Gorsuch to reveal how he would vote on a particular case. During his Senate confirmation hearing, he did not give Senators enough background about his judicial philosophy. In our private meeting, he did not give me enough of an assurance of his philosophy as it relates to these issues on privacy for my constituents in  Whether we are talking about access to healthcare or we are protecting individuals' privacy rights from unwanted corporation or government intervention, these issues are critically important. Judge Gorsuch told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he does recognize privacy rights. However, his earlier writings on unenumerated constitutional rights contradict this statement. This contradiction raised questions with me, and I worked to try to further clarify his judicial philosophy on this issue.  I told him that my State had actually codified the rights of women to have access to reproductive healthcare.  He said: Oh, you mean your State legislature did that.  And I said: No, Judge Gorsuch, I mean the people of Washington voted on these issues and voted to protect a woman's right to access to reproductive healthcare.  When it comes to the right to privacy, I work hard to understand where our judiciary is coming from, and if it is for the next 30 to 35 years, I guarantee you these privacy rights are going to be of critical importance.  In the longstanding precedent known as the Chevron doctrine, judges should defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutory language. It allows agencies to get expert input on their decisions and regulations. By overturning this doctrine, it could make it easier for courts to challenge important agency decisions protecting health and the environment. This issue is also important to my We fought the Enron case to make sure that the Federal energy regulators did their job in protecting the ratepayers of Washington from, at the time, what was, in my opinion, a violation of the Federal Power Act on just and reasonable rates. We had to go to a great extent to make sure that the agencies' decisions were carefully considered to make sure we didn't become the deep pockets.  Making sure that this doctrine is continued and not overturned is important. I find it troubling that Judge Gorsuch concluded that this precedent from Chevron v. the Natural Resources Defense Council should be overturned.  Also, yesterday was Equal Pay Day, and there was a lot of discussion about how women still face unequal wages. What would Judge Gorsuch do about equal pay?  As a professor, he told his students that women manipulate family leave policies for their own benefits. As a judge, he frequently ruled against women and their rights. In Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius, a privately held company, which was a store chain, challenged the Affordable Care Act's birth control benefit. The Affordable Care Act required health insurance plans to provide women with birth control coverage with no cost sharing.  Judge Gorsuch joined the Tenth Circuit majority, holding that an employer's religious beliefs could override an employee's right to birth control coverage. Judge Gorsuch also supported an effort to defund Planned Parenthood, an important provider of women's health services. In Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert, the Tenth Circuit upheld an injunction to prevent the Governor of Utah from defunding Planned However, Judge Gorsuch dissented and pushed for a rehearing of this case by the full court.  Judge Gorsuch has had a narrow interpretation of the laws meant to protect workers against discrimination. In another case, a worker alleged that she had been unlawfully discriminated against based on gender because she took 2 weeks of leave under the Family[[Page S2373]]Medical Leave She claimed that her employer had a higher performance standard for women than for her male coworkers. The Tenth Circuit ruled in her favor and found that the employer had discriminated against her. However, Judge Gorsuch dissented, arguing evidence of discrimination was entirely absent.  These issues and rulings make me concerned about Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy as it relates to what I now believe is an accepted standard.  Judge Gorsuch has also ruled against LGBTQ individuals seeking fair and nondiscriminatory treatment. Lambda Legal and other groups have called his record openly hostile toward the LGBTQ community. Judge Gorsuch has held that a transwoman's constitutional rights were not violated, citing the absence of any medical evidence.  Also, as many of my colleagues have talked about, Judge Gorsuch has had a pattern of ruling against the little guy. My colleague from Hawaii noted that he seems to favor corporate interests over workers' rights and private interests over public interests.  Look at the outcome in many of these cases, which have been cited frequently since his nomination--none more than the case involving the Individuals with Disabilities Education I think it is so important that it needs to continue to be talked about.  This case, which was recently rejected by the U.Supreme Court, limited the opportunities for children with disabilities. Judge Gorsuch had concluded that to comply with the law, the school's responsibility to the student was to make progress that was ``merely more than de minimis.'' That is to say that those children in our education system who have a special need, whether it be autism or something else, through our education system need to make progress, and it could be no more than de minimis.  This ruling impacts hundreds of thousands of students all across America, including in the State of He wrote the majority opinion and used the word ``merely.''  I asked Judge Gorsuch about this because of the cases I mentioned earlier on Federal energy regulators and the fact that we needed strong anti-manipulation laws, and we needed people to interpret the standards to make sure that they were upholding the interests of the public. We had quite a long discussion about this issue. Judge Gorsuch suggested that he was bound by a previous decision.  I know some of my colleagues have also noted this, but when Justice Roberts wrote the unanimous opinion rejecting these ``merely more than de minimis'' standards that Judge Gorsuch used, Justice Roberts said: ``When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing merely more than de minimis progress from year to year can hardly said to have been offered an education at all.'' On this point, I agree with the Chief  Not having a deeper understanding about his judicial philosophy and given my great concerns for the right to privacy issues that will remain constant in our society for the next 30 years and given these issues around regulatory standards that are so important, I cannot support this nomination nor support cloture to move ahead.

5726,topic-id,4074,"Mr.President, I thank the             Russia and the President's Address to Congress  Mr.President, on Tuesday night, along with my colleagues, I listened to the President of the United States address the joint session of As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I was particularly interested to hear what the President would be saying about American foreign policy.  I heard him say during the speech that American foreign policy would be based on the respect of the sovereign rights of nations, which is something that I strongly believe in. I then thought I would hear the President talk about one of our greatest challenges from a country that is not respecting the sovereign rights of the United States of America, that country being But the President didn't mention Russia at all in his State of the Union address, which really surprised me.  When we look at Russia's most recent conduct and know what they did in regard to their attack on the U.democratic election system, it is beyond dispute that they wanted to interfere with our free elections, they wanted to affect the credibility of our democratic election system, and they wanted to influence the outcome of the election. That is pretty clear from the evidence that we have seen to date. Yet[[Page S1565]]the President did not mention that at all--a country that had attacked us as recently as just a few months ago. There was no mention in the President's State of the Union address.  It wasn't an isolated attack by Russia on the United We knew that before that, when we saw Russia's influence in regard to Montenegro's elections and how they tried to impact their parliamentary elections to influence Montenegro's decision to join We know that Russia is attempting to influence the elections in Western  So we have a country that is trying to bring down our democratic system of government by using our democratic system of government, and the way that we conduct open elections, to compromise our system.  But that is not the only thing Russia has done that is contrary to the U.national security and our foreign policy objectives. We know that they have physically incurred into other countries. They have physically incurred into Today, Russia has annexed Crimea--something we will never recognize. Crimea is part of Russia is continuing to support the separatists in the eastern part of Ukraine, compromising Ukraine's sovereignty.  The President did not mention that in his State of the Union address.  We know that Russia is in Georgia, in Moldova, and other sovereign countries; once again, no mention of that.  And then Russia is very much engaged in the Middle We know that Russia's footprint in the Middle East is growing. They have their military presence in Syria, backing the Assad regime, facilitating Iran's participation in  We also know that the type of conduct that has been conducted under Russian support, where civilians have been targeted, humanitarian convoys have been attacked, amounts to war crimes--a situation where Russia has culpability; yet, we don't hear anything about that.  So we have a role. Congress has a role to play in making sure that we protect our national security interests.  First and foremost, we have to know what is going on. We have to know what Russia was doing. We have to know what Russia's intentions were when they compromised our cyber security and used that information to try to influence our elections. We have to know what Russia's intentions are all about regarding the contacts they have made with Americans in their effort to influence this campaign. We have to understand what Russia's intentions are as they relate to democratic countries.  We saw in General Flynn's case that a contact was made, and as a result of not coming forward with that, General Flynn has left the Trump administration. And then we find out yesterday that the Attorney General, as a U.Senator, had contact with the Russian Ambassador, and that information was not made available during the confirmation process.  The timing of that meeting in Senator Sessions' office is concerning. It is concerning because it was right at the time that Russia was the most active in trying to get information that they could use to influence our elections. So this is an important aspect for us to understand.  We need to understand why that meeting took place and what was involved in that meeting. There have been calls by Members on both sides of the aisle that we get that type of information.  But I will add one more dimension to this: Why was the Russian Ambassador interested in meeting with Senator Sessions during the campaign period? Was this part of an overall strategy by Russia to try to influence the election? We need to get the answers to that.  The only way we are going to be able to get a complete account of what has happened by Russia's attack on the United States is by setting up an independent commission. Russia may not have used MiGs to attack They may have used a mouse. But it was an attack. And when we were attacked on 9/11, Congress did right thing--they set up an independent special commission to understand what happened, how we were so vulnerable to an attack, so that we could take steps to protect ourselves from future attacks and hold those responsible accountable. That was a bipartisan effort by the Congress of the United States, setting up an independent commission, a commission where the members could devote their entire full time to the assignment, because that is how serious being attacked is. There was no limit on their jurisdiction. They could go where the facts led. They could give a report to the American people so there would be credibility that we, the policymakers, are going to have independent information in order to act to protect the national security of the people of this country. That is what that independent commission meant. That independent commission met. They made many recommendations on eliminating a lot of the stovepiping of intelligence information and combining agencies together. Congress acted on those recommendations. As a result, we are safer today than we were prior to 9/11.  We need to be safer tomorrow than we are today from the attacks of The only way we are going to be able to get that objective information with the credibility so that we can act in the best interests for the people of this Nation is to have a nonpartisan, independent commission take a look at what Russia was doing, get all the facts, find ways and recommendations to make us safer, give the credibility to the American people, and then Congress needs to act in order to protect our national security. I know we have some committees looking at this. I know the Senate Intelligence Committee is doing some very important work. I support that.  We have our responsibilities in Congress to take steps within the jurisdictions of our committees. I am for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee looking into what Russia was doing in order that we can protect the jurisdiction of our committee to do a better job in our bilateral relationship with Russia, or what Russia is doing in Europe or in other parts of the world that affects our national security under the jurisdiction of the Senate Foreign Relations We need to do that work. The Intelligence Committee needs to do their work. Armed Services needs to do their work. Judiciary needs do their work.  But we need one central investigation that includes the broad jurisdiction that can get to answer why the Russian Ambassador may have wanted to see a U.Senator who was active in one of the campaigns that close to the elections, that has an opportunity to understand why Russia was so active in their cyber attacks in America, getting so much information, so much political information, why Russia was trying to understand our election system. There is no evidence that they tried to manipulate individual votes. That didn't happen--at least we don't believe that happened--but we know they were looking into how we do that. Was that for some future use? We need to understand that to protect our democratic system of government. That is what an independent commission will allow us to be able to receive.  I urge my colleagues to respond to the national security challenge of Russia, and let's establish an independent commission.  There are other things we need to do. There are two bills I filed with my Republican colleagues to make it clear that it is not going to be business as usual with There are going to be consequences to what they have done to the United States and our national security interests.  One bill that I filed, of which Senator Graham is the principal sponsor, is to make sure that Congress carries out its responsibility of oversight in regard to our bilateral relationship with It is the Russia Review Act, which would require the President of the United States to submit to Congress for review any attempt to eliminate or modify the current sanctions against He would be required to submit that to the Congress of the United States, hopefully working with us and consulting with us before he makes decisions but giving us an opportunity to weigh in before that decision could take effect.  For my colleagues who remember the Iran nuclear agreement, it sounds very familiar. Senator Corker and I, Senator Menendez, Senator Kaine, and others worked on the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review It passed nearly unanimously in the It required a President to submit that[[Page S1566]]agreement to us before it could take effect. It made the negotiations much more transparent. As a result, I believe we had a stronger agreement, but we also had a more open process, and Congress had a chance to carry out its responsibility. In a similar vein, it is important that we pass the Russia Review Act so that we can carry out our responsibilities, preventing the President from taking unilateral action without consulting with us. This is bipartisan; we have Democrats and Republicans working on this. I hope we will be able to pass this bill in a timely way.  The third bill I want to bring to my colleagues' attention as it relates to Russia's activities in the United States is legislation that I have filed with Senator McCain and many others. We have a large number of Democrats and Republicans who have cosponsored this bill that would increase the sanctions against Russia because of their attack against us. It would expand the options for imposing sanctions to different sectors that could affect Russia's energy, that could affect the ability of Russia to finance their sovereign debt, that could affect Russia's ability to privatize their industries by making it clear that we are not going to allow Americans or companies to help finance these activities because in reality they are financing activities against our interests, such as the cyber attacks, as we saw last fall.  This legislation is comprehensive. It deals more than just with sanctions; it deals with another major problem that we have found. Through NATO and U.leadership, we have made it clear that we will defend the countries of NATO, and we have deployed troops to make it clear to Russia that they better not try to compromise the territorial integrity of the member states.  This initiative has been well received by Europe and has countered Russia's attempts to cause a fracture within the European community. We need a similar initiative on democracy, a democracy initiative, because not only is there a threat against Europe from their geographical boundaries, there is a threat against Europe in regard to their democratic institutions. We know that. We saw that here in It is being challenged in So this democratic initiative would allow us to participate in strengthening the democratic institutions in Europe so that we don't allow Russia to use the democratic institutions to try to bring down the democratic institutions.  There is another part of this legislation which I think is extremely important. We are all getting to better understand the tactics being used by Russia, this fake news--inventing news and then using the social media to make it look like it is the hottest news in town. We know they are good at that. We also know they are very good at propaganda, and they go in directions that we, prior to this election, thought we would never see in our own country. We are now seeing it more frequently. Part of this legislation is for us to develop a capacity to be able to counter this propaganda and fake news so that Russia's deployment of it will not compromise our national security.  I think all three bills will be considered shortly and favorably by this body--setting up an independent review commission; requiring the President to submit any changes in the Russian sanctions to the Congress for review before they could take effect; and strengthening our sanctions regime against Russia for its conduct, including strengthening our commitment to democratic institutions and fighting this new cycle of fake news.  I also listened to the President during the State of the Union Address when he said that our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world. That is another statement I happen to agree with. And then I thought about what I had heard a little earlier that day: that the President's budget was going to have about a 30- to 35-percent cut--it wasn't exactly clear, but it was a large number--to the State  I said: How are you going to have a robust and meaningful engagement in the world if you cut our diplomacy budget, you cut our development assistance budget? This is how we keep the world safe. This is how we get our goals accomplished globally.  We have had so many hearings in our committee where there is a much greater need. We need to do more in Africa in promoting democracy. We need to do more in the Middle East in promoting good governance and inclusive governance so we don't have to have as many wars. We need to do things in our own hemisphere. We heard today in a hearing what is happening in There is a lot of work for America to do. A 30-percent cut? Is that a more direct, robust, and meaningful engagement within the world? It didn't sound that way to me. I was concerned about that and how we are going to be able to gauge.  It was Secretary Mattis who said: If you don't give the Secretary of State the resources, you better give me more soldiers.  And they are more expensive. We have the best fighting force in the world, and we are going to support our fighting force. The way we show respect for our soldiers is to use them only as a matter of last resort. Diplomacy is critically important for America's national security.  A strong, credible Office of the President is equally important if we are going to be able to be the type of country that influences our values globally, and the President of the United States has put that at risk. That is why I am reintroducing my resolution to try to avoid a constitutional crisis. I introduced it before President Trump took the oath of office, and I am introducing it again to avoid a constitutional crisis. It deals with the emoluments clause of the Constitution of the United  Every modern President of the United States prior to President Trump, in order to avoid conflict, in order to do what is ethically right and to comply with the Constitution of the United States--the emoluments clause--has either divested their financial holdings or has set up a blind trust. Some have done both. That is the way that the ethics officers tell us you can comply with not just the Constitution but with the highest ethical standards so that there are no real conflicts and you don't have any perceived conflicts, which can be just as damaging to the credibility of a public office holder.  President Trump, by not divesting, by not setting up a blind trust, has put the Office of the Presidency, our country, in a compromising position.  Let me give some specific examples, if I might. I will mention three countries. I could mention more.  Saudi Very interesting country, Saudi In August 2015, the Trump organization filed eight separate business companies to do business in Saudi As we all know, the President's Executive order that was originally issued that excluded immigrants from seven Muslim countries from visas did not include the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia even though, as we all know, many of the participants in the 9/11 attack against the United States originated from the country of Saudi President Trump has vast business interests in Saudi  Let me quote President Trump:       Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy      apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I      supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.  It is not a question, Mr.President, of whether they like you or they don't like you; under our Constitution, they cannot give you any favor. If they give you a business favor, that is an emolument and violates the Constitution of the United States and violates your oath of office.  In regard to Turkey, Turkey has two large-scale developments in the country that are under the Trump organization. The Trump organization has a partnership with a luxury furniture company, Dorya International, to build pieces to be sold under the Trump Home Collection brand and a multimillion-dollar branding deal with the Dogan Group-- the Dogan Group is run by one of the most politically influential families in Turkey--for a two-tower complex in According to President Trump's May 2016 financial disclosure, he received as much as $1 million in royalties from the first venture and as much as $5 million from the second venture.  Because President Trump has not properly divested himself from his business, he will presumably continue to receive royalties from both ventures, and these business arrangements are not unknown to Turkey's leadership. President Erdogan presided over the opening ceremonies of Trump Towers, Istanbul.[[Page S1567]]  Shortly after the election, President Trump held a phone call with President Erdogan in which he praised his business partners. There are substantial business interests known by the Turkish Government that Mr.Trump has in their country. Mr.Erdogan is not shy about talking about and using the Trump He has bragged about it. We have a lot of foreign policy decisionmaking that affects We need to know that when the President is making those decision, it is America's interest which is at the front and center, not the Trump Organization's interests that are affecting those decisions. That is why we have the emoluments clause, that is why we believe in avoiding conflicts, and that is why President Trump needs to divest of his interest or set up a blind trust.  I will mention one other country, if I might. That country is For a decade, the Trump organization has been trying to get a trademark of its brand in I am going to quote from Mr.Trump on February 7, 2011, when he wrote to the American Ambassador in This is what Mr.Trump said: ``I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees to secure my own name and globally recognized brand for Chinese individuals who seek to trade off my reputation.''  For 10 years he was fighting to get that trademark protection. It was granted on February 14, 2017, a few weeks after President Trump took the oath of office, shortly after President Trump stated that he would support the One China policy, something the Government of China strongly wanted him to say.  We don't know connections. We can't draw connections. We don't know that. That is why the emoluments clause is in the Constitution, so you cannot accept any favors from another country. It is against our Yet we have concerns as to whether the President is acting under that interest. That is just wrong and it needs to stop. What the President has done is established a circumstance where there is an appearance of conflict, where it looks like foreign governments are trying to influence his decisions.  He has affected America's standing to advance good governance and corruption. I want to underscore that point. He is compromising America's moral authority on the values we hold so dear. Our Western democratic values are being compromised because leaders of autocratic countries, corrupt leaders, can say: If it is all right for the President of the United States to keep his business holdings while he is President, what is wrong with me having an interest in some of our entities here? It takes away our effective ability to use diplomacy to solve problems or advance our goals. We are being compromised. The current arrangement is simply inadequate.  President Trump announced he is going to let his two adult sons handle his businesses, but he still maintains his financial interests. He gives a couple of different other things he is going to do. I will just go over one or two of them.  He says he is going to donate the profits from his foreign hotels to charities. That sounds good.  Let me just quote from Steve Carvell, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, who said:       It's a monumental task to constantly run this down. Even if      the company is trying its hardest and making its very best      effort, it will be difficult to fulfill that goal.  Let's get serious about this. The arrangements he set out will not solve the conflict. It will not comply with the Constitution of the United The Office of Government Ethics said on the President's proposal it is ``wholly inadequate.'' That is the Office of Government They go on to say: ``The plan the [President] has announced doesn't meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting and that every President in the last four decades has met.''  I am a lawyer but would not claim to be a constitutional expert. Let me quote, if I might, from constitutional experts. Richard Painter, Norm Eisen and Laurence Tribe have written a comprehensive study of the constitutional provisions, concluding that ``since emoluments are properly defined as including `profit' from any employment, as well as `salary,' it is clear that even remuneration fairly earned in commerce can qualify.''  Richard Painter, the chief ethics officer for President George Bush, stated it in a blunter fashion. He said:       This is a for-profit hotel. [Trump] is making profits over      dealing with foreign governments. Same with the loans from      foreign government-owned banks. Those are for a for-profit      business. That is prohibited under the Emoluments Clause of      the  Let me just conclude with this. This is not about any one person. This is about the Office of the This is about our constitutional form of government that depends upon the Office of the President being respected. It is bigger than any one person. The Framers of our Constitution went on to say: We recognize it. We know the faults of men. That is why we set up the Constitution, to protect against the frailties of individuals.  This is about the Office of the President of the United States, not about any one person who may occupy it 4 to 8 years. We need to protect the Office of the President, and that is why we need to act now to avoid this constitutional crisis of the President of the United States, who has put our Nation at risk because of his personal conflicts and because of his violation of the Constitution of the United  I call upon President Trump to live up to the values of the Give the American people the transparency they deserve and completely sever his relationship with the Trump Organization before we are embroiled in an ethical and constitutional crisis that will not serve the best interests of the President, Congress or the American people.

5741,topic-id,597,"Mr.President, I rise in support of the Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act, which I am introducing today with my colleagues Senators Collins, Casey, and This important bill repeals the monetary caps that limit Medicare beneficiaries' access to medically necessary outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services.  Limits on outpatient rehabilitation therapy services under Medicare were first imposed in 1997 as part of the Balanced Budget The decision to impose limits on these services was not based on data, quality-of-care concerns, or clinical judgment--its sole purpose was to limit spending in order to balance the Federal budget. Since 1997, Congress has acted 12 times to prevent the implementation of the therapy caps through moratoriums and an exceptions process. While these short-term actions have provided necessary relief to our seniors, a long-term solution is essential to bring permanent relief and much-needed stability for both patients and providers.  We need a full repeal of the existing caps on physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. These annual financial caps limit services often needed after a[[Page S597]]stroke, traumatic brain injury, or spinal cord injury, or to effectively manage conditions such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and arthritis. Arbitrary caps on these vital Medicare outpatient therapy services are simply unacceptable. They also discriminate against the oldest and sickest Medicare beneficiaries, who typically require the most intensive therapy, and disadvantage Medicare beneficiaries who live in regions with higher health care costs.  In a 2009 report issued by the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee, MEDPAC, it was estimated that the therapy cap, if enforced without an exceptions process, could negatively impact 931,000 Medicare beneficiaries. Arbitrarily capping outpatient rehabilitation therapy services would likely cause some beneficiaries to delay necessary care, force others to assume higher out-of-pocket costs, and disrupt the continuum of care for many seniors and individuals with disabilities.  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Collins in supporting the Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act to ensure that our seniors have access to the outpatient rehabilitation therapy services that they need.

5775,topic-id,2285,"Mr.President, confirming a Supreme Court nominee is one of the Senate's most significant constitutional responsibilities. I come[[Page S2021]]to the floor today to announce that I shall cast my vote for Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a Justice of the U.Supreme In making my decision, I evaluated Judge Gorsuch's qualifications, experience, integrity, and temperament. I questioned him for more than an hour in a meeting in my office, evaluated his record, spoke with people who know him personally, and reviewed the Judiciary Committee's extensive hearing record. While I have not agreed with every decision Judge Gorsuch has made, my conclusion is that he is eminently well qualified to serve on our Nation's highest  Judge Gorsuch has sterling academic and legal credentials. In 2006, the Senate confirmed this outstanding nominee by a voice vote to his current position on the U.Court of A rollcall vote was neither requested nor required.  Judge Gorsuch's ability as a legal scholar and judge has earned him the respect of members of the bar. The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has unanimously given him its highest possible rating of ``well qualified.'' President Obama's former Acting Solicitor General testified before the Judiciary Committee in support of Judge Gorsuch, praising him as fair, decent, and committed to judicial independence.  I have also received a letter signed by 49 prominent Maine attorneys with diverse political views, urging support for Judge Gorsuch's nomination. They wrote:       Gorsuch's judicial record demonstrates his remarkable      intelligence, his keen ability to discern and resolve the      central issues at dispute in a legal proceeding . . . and his      dedication to the rule of law rather than personal      predilections. His judicial record also confirms that he is      committed to upholding the Constitution, enforcing the      statutes enacted by Congress, and restraining overreach by      the executive branch.  In my view, these are precisely the qualities that a Supreme Court Justice should embody.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record following my remarks.  Our personal discussion allowed me to assess the judge's philosophy and character. I told him that it was important to me that the judiciary remain an independent check on the other two branches of government as envisioned by our Therefore, I asked him specifically whether anyone in the administration had asked him how he would rule or sought any commitment from him on any issue. He was unequivocal that no one in the administration had asked him for such promises or to prejudge any issue that could come before him. He went on to say that the day a nominee answered how he would rule on a matter before it was heard or promised to overturn a legal precedent, that would be the end of an independent judiciary.  During the Judiciary Committee hearings, when Senator Lindsey Graham asked him a similar question about whether he was asked to make commitments about particular cases or precedents, he gave the same answer. In fact, Judge Gorsuch notably said that if someone had asked for such a commitment, he would have left the room because it would never be appropriate for a judge to make such a commitment, whether asked to do so by the White House or a U. Neil Gorsuch is not a judge who brings his personal views on any policy issues into the courtroom. If it can be said that Judge Gorsuch would bring a philosophy to the Supreme Court, it would be his respect for the rule of law and his belief that no one is above the law, including any President or any  I am convinced that Judge Gorsuch does not rule according to his personal views, but rather follows the facts and the law wherever they lead him, even if he is personally unhappy with the result. To paraphrase his answer to one of my questions about putting aside his personal views, he said that a judge who is happy with all of his rulings is likely not a good judge.  The reverence that Judge Gorsuch holds for the separation of powers, which is at the core of our American democracy, was also evident in our discussion. As he reiterated throughout his confirmation hearing, the duty to write the laws lies with Congress, not with the courts and not with the executive branch. Members of this body should welcome his deep respect for that fundamental principle.  Judge Gorsuch's record demonstrates that he is well within the mainstream of judicial thought. He has joined in more than 2,700 opinions, 97 percent of which were unanimously decided, and he sided with the majority 99 percent of the time.  I asked Judge Gorsuch how he approaches legal precedents. I asked him if it would be sufficient to overturn a long-established precedent if five current Justices believed that a previous decision was wrongly decided. He responded: ``Emphatically no.'' And that, to me, is the right approach. He said a good judge always starts with precedent and presumes that the precedent is correct.  During his Judiciary Committee hearing, Judge Gorsuch described precedent as ``the anchor of the law'' and ``the starting place for a judge.'' He has also coauthored a book on legal precedent with 12 other distinguished judges, for which Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the introduction.  Now, there has been considerable discussion over the course of this nomination process about the proper role of the courts in our constitutional system of government. It is also important for us to consider the roles that the executive and legislative branches play in the nomination process.  Under the Constitution, the President has wide discretion when it comes to nominations to the Supreme The Senate's role is not to ask, Is this the person whom I would have chosen to sit on the bench? Rather, the Senate is charged with evaluating each nominee's qualifications for serving on the  I have heard opponents of this nominee criticize him for a variety of reasons, including his methodology and charges that he is somehow extreme or outside of the mainstream. But I have not heard one Senator suggest that Judge Gorsuch lacks the intellectual ability, academic credentials, integrity, temperament or experience to serve on the U.Supreme Yet it is exactly those characteristics that the Senate should be evaluating when exercising its advice and consent duty.  This is especially true when Senators contemplate taking the extreme step of filibustering a Supreme Court nomination. As you well know, unfortunately, it has become Senate practice of late to filibuster almost every question before this body simply as a matter of course. But that would be a serious mistake in this case, and it would further erode the ability of this great institution to function. In 2005, when the Senate was mired in debate over how to proceed on judicial nominations, a bipartisan group of 14 Senators proposed a simple and reasonable standard. That group--of which I am proud to have been a part--declared that for Federal court nominations a Senator should only support a filibuster in the case of extraordinary circumstances.  Since coming to the Senate, I have voted to confirm four Justices to the Supreme Two were nominated by a Democratic President, and two were nominated by a Republican Each was confirmed: Chief Justice Roberts by a vote of 78 to 22, Justice Alito by a vote of 58 to 42, Justice Sotomayor by a vote of 68 to 31, and Justice Kagan by a vote of 63 to 37.  Before I became a Senator, this body confirmed Justice Kennedy, 97 to 0; Justice Scalia, 98 to 0; Justice Thomas, 52 to 48; Justice Ginsburg, 96 to 3; and Justice Breyer, 87 to 9.  Note that two of the current members of the Supreme Court were confirmed by fewer than 60 votes, but consistent with the standard that we established in 2005, neither one was filibustered.  Even Robert Bork, whose contentious confirmation hearings are said to have been the turning point in the Senate's treatment of Supreme Court nominations, was rejected by a simple failure to secure a majority of votes--42 yeas to 58 nays--not by a Senate filibuster. In fact, the filibuster has been used successfully only once in modern history to block a Supreme Court nomination. That was an attempt to elevate Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice in 1968, nearly half a century ago. In that case, Justice Fortas ended up withdrawing under an ethical cloud.[[Page S2022]]  The result of the votes on Justice Alito's nomination are also illuminating. In 2006 Senators voted to invoke cloture by a vote of 75 to 25. That is considerably more Senators than those who ultimately voted to confirm him, which was accomplished by a vote of 58 to 42. Here again, Senators proceeded to a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote on the nomination.  Let me be clear. I do believe strongly that it is appropriate for the Senate to use its advice and consent power to examine nominations carefully or even to defeat them. In fact, I have voted against judicial nominees of three But playing politics with judicial nominees is profoundly damaging to the Senate's reputation and stature. It politicizes our judicial nomination process and threatens the independence of our courts, which are supposed to be above partisan politics. Perhaps most importantly, it undermines the public's confidence in the judiciary.  Since the Founders protected against the exertion of political influence on sitting Justices, the temptation to do everything in one's power to pick nominees with the right views is understandably very strong. But the more political Supreme Court appointments become, the more likely it is that Americans will question the extent to which the rule of law is being followed. It erodes confidence in the fair and impartial system of justice, and it cultivates a suspicion that judges are imposing their personal ideology.  The Senate has the responsibility to safeguard our Nation against a politicized judiciary. The Senate should resist the temptation to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee who is unquestionably qualified, the temptation to abandon the traditions of comity and cooperation, and the temptation to further erode the separation of powers by insisting on judicial litmus tests. It is time for the Senate to rise above partisanship and to allow each and every Senator to cast an up-or-down vote on this nominee.  This nomination deserves to move forward, as the dozens of distinguished Maine attorneys who wrote to me in support of his nomination said:       In sum, during his tenure on the U.Court of Appeals,      Judge Gorsuch distinguished himself as a judge who follows      the law with no regard for politics or outside influence.

We are fortunate to have female leadership on our staff, also, and we thank them.  I know, in working on a program that I have had over the past 4 years, a young woman's leadership program, NASA, space, and astronauts have been some of the most popular people that our women in junior high and high school have liked to meet, hear from, and really be able to see themselves in those roles and to talk to women who have actually been leaders in those fields.

5787,topic-id,2665,"Mr.President, we find ourselves at an interesting point. Let me start by saying what a tremendous privilege it is to serve in this body. Every single day that I come to the building from where I live, I express that to myself--what a tremendous privilege it is for all of us to serve in this body, denoted by many as the greatest deliberative body in the world. Certainly, we find ourselves here in a place where we can effect so many things that not only affect our citizens but citizens across the world. What a privilege that is.  The Presiding Officer and I have had numerous conversations in the past. I spent a life in business before coming to the Senate, and I know the Presiding Officer did a lot of unique things as well. At the age of 25, I was fortunate enough to build a business, starting with a small amount of money. It ended up operating all around the country. One of the things we did after every project--I built shopping centers around the country--is that we would get together and analyze the things we had done well and the things we had done not so well in an effort to become better. At the end of each year, we would sit down and look at our company, which was growing very rapidly, and try to analyze those things. Sometimes we would have setbacks, but generally speaking, the company continued to operate on an upward trend.  What I find here is just the opposite. I have been here now a decade, and what we do is just the opposite of that. What we do is we continue a downward trend because the way the two parties operate with each other is when it gets to a point where there is something very critical that has to happen, the other side says, well, if they were in power, this is what they would do, so let's go ahead and do this ourselves. So what we have in the Senate, at least since I have been here in the last decade, is instead of an escalating situation where we continue to operate better and deal with these things in a more balanced way, what we do is we are on this continual downward trend.  One of our younger Members mentioned the other day as we were discussing this--and I thought it was a great point--that what has happened in the Senate is that neither party has had the ability to withstand the pressure that is brought to them by their base in either party.  I have seen that play out right now. What happens is their base puts pressure on, and we end up breaking the traditions of the We did it legislatively with the cloture vote being the scored vote by outside groups. So that is where we find ourselves.  What is happening in our own caucus--I just realized over the weekend--is that we are now trying to figure out whom to blame. I heard a discussion last Wednesday that was totally divorced from reality as far as how we had gotten where we are today. I realized that we are getting ready to do some things here that will change the Senate dramatically. What is really happening is that both sides are trying to make sure history records that it was the other side that caused this to happen.  We are now starting to see editorials in various publications--some that we Republicans read and some that Democrats read--to try to set the story straight. I about came out of my chair last Wednesday with regard to one of the explanations as to how we got where we are today. My guess is, today at lunch on the other side of the aisle, the same thing will be taking place. Obviously, on our side, it is the other side. On their side, it is our side.  Let me go back to 2013. We had a breakdown taking place. President Obama was bringing forth some nominations, and it was right after he was elected for a second term. We went through the summer of 2013 with some of his nominees not getting cloture votes. I was called, as were a few other Senators, to make what we would call some tough votes. These were nominees whom we did not support. Cloture had again become the vote that people were scoring, but I and John McCain and Lamar Alexander and a few others were asked to make some votes that, candidly, were not very pleasant to keep us from getting to a place at which Senator Reid would impose the nuclear option.  We made it through the summer, and we went into the fall. We had just confirmed a new circuit court judge for the[[Page S2030]]DC Circuit, which is just below the Supreme Court relative to importance for lots of reasons. So we had a 4-to-4 balance on this circuit court. Senator Reid brought forth three more nominees, and they were not bad nominees. I think most people thought they were actually pretty decent nominees. But we did not want the balance of the DC Circuit to change; it was at 4-to-4.  We know that a lot of administrative rulings that are relative to the administration take place in the DC court, so we made the argument that there were already enough judges there and that they did not have a very good case. It was the same argument, by the way, that Democrats made back in 2006 when Bush was also trying to make some nominations. We do the same to each other. So we ended up filibustering those three nominees.  What we thought was going to take place was a negotiation on how many judges would actually go when all of a sudden Senator Reid, out of the blue, with some of his Members not realizing what had happened, did the nuclear option. He ruled and called upon the person sitting in the Chair and the All of a sudden, we destroyed what had been the case of it taking 60 votes to move beyond to an actual vote on the nominee. I was livid.  Somebody said the other day that that was fine and that we had just gotten to where we had wanted to be. Are you kidding me? We were livid. We were livid that on some circuit court nominees, Senator Reid had pulled the nuclear option.  I will tell you this: There were days--not days, months--where people who had normally worked with people on the other side of the aisle just kind of shut down. It was hard to believe the nuclear option had been invoked.  Last Wednesday, somebody acted like it was no big deal, that it had just gotten us back to where we had always been. The fact is that we have not used filibusters much--years ago. The fact is that we are using them a lot today. Look, this was a big deal.  Now we find ourselves in a situation in which we are getting ready to take the last step, if you will, on nominations. Let's face it: We have a nominee in this judge who is on the floor who is really beyond reproach.  I realize my friends on the other side of the aisle have pressures. I have talked to some of them, and I respect them. I understand that their base is saying that because of what we did last year. Remember, it had been an hour since the great Justice passed away, and we had already declared we were not going to allow another Justice to be confirmed until after the Presidential race. It was a pretty audacious move, let's face it, and obviously it created some hard feelings on the other side of the aisle after the election was determined.  Within their base, many of them are saying they are going to invoke the filibuster here. Our leadership is saying: If that happens, then we ourselves have to invoke the nuclear option on the Supreme Court  We understand where this is going. I do not know what has been said on the floor other than during the hearings, but let's face it: One side is reacting to their base, to their pressure. They are having ads run against them if they are even considering voting to move beyond the cloture vote to an actual vote on the nominee. On our side, obviously, we are in a situation in which, if that happens, then our leader is going to call the nuclear option.  By the way, everybody says: Oh, we are never going to do it on legislation. Come on. Let me go back to that for a minute.  Back in 2010, the Democrats passed a healthcare bill with 60 votes. Then there was an election, and it took them down below 60 votes. They just needed to fix a little element on the healthcare bill with a reconciliation bill, and the Republicans went crazy over that. How many times have we talked about their passing this healthcare bill with reconciliation? It has been going on for 7 years. Now we are in the driver's seat. We have the majority. We are writing an entire bill through reconciliation because we understand the power of being able to do something with 51 votes. I understand. So what we do is we just keep upping the ante with each other. Are you kidding me?  If we continue on the path we are on right now, the very next time there is a legislative proposal that one side of the aisle feels is so important, they cannot let their base down, the pressure builds, then we are going to invoke the nuclear option on a legislative piece. That is what will happen. Somebody will do it. Somebody will say that if they were in control, they would do it. That is the way trust has gotten around here. So we ought to do it because this is our opportunity to really change history.  Look, I hope that before we move to the place that we all know we are going--I do not think anybody here would deny that pressures have built. Let's face it. If we do not have respect for the institution we serve and for ourselves, no one else will. Who will? These people know what we are getting ready to do to this place. For us to act like if we do it here, there is no way we would ever do it on a legislative piece--let me tell you this: Two years ago, after Senator Reid did what he did--a friend of mine and somebody I worked very closely with, I think most people know it took me a while to get back to normal with him. Two years ago, there would not have been a single Republican in our caucus who would have even considered voting for the nuclear option. As a matter of fact, we had discussions about changing it back. Then the election occurred, and we decided not to do that.  What it looks like to me is that there is a whole host of Republican Senators who are willing to do that today. Everyone knows that on the other side of the aisle--maybe everyone; I don't know. Yet to say that we will never get to the point at which we will not change a legislative piece--give me a break. Somebody is not living in reality, because we each continue to take the other down.  Again, I do not really care how history writes it; I am going to tell you how I am going to write it. Neither side of the aisle has had the maturity or the willingness to stand up to the pressures and cause this institution to operate in the way it should--neither side of the aisle. As for anybody who tries to say that one side of the aisle is worse than the other, come on. It takes two of us to take the institution to the place at which we are getting ready to take it next week. That is my history. I have been here 10 years. I have watched it. Neither side of the aisle has clean hands. We have one side. They have a decision to make. Are they really going to filibuster this judge? Let's face it. If you go back and look at the principles of the Gang of 14 that were put in place back in the 2000s, when both sides came together and said: We are not going to do the nuclear option as long as a judge meets these criteria--this judge meets that criteria. It is clear. By the way, I am not criticizing; I am just observing.  We both have pressures. We know that if a filibuster takes place--and you will know that immediately; of course, it would be after a few filibuster votes just to show that it cannot happen--the leader on this side is going to invoke the nuclear option. You all know that. I do not know if people are saying that it could happen, but of course that is what is going to happen. And then the very next time another big legislative issue comes up, the same thing is going to happen unless we have the ability to sit down and talk about this. I would love to do it out on the floor. Typically, we do not do those kinds of things because things get out of control when we talk about things honestly here on the floor, but I would like for us to do that. I would love for us to have maybe a 4-hour discussion about what we are getting ready to do here in the To me, that would be a healthy thing.  I think all of these staffers who work up here, whom we respect, know exactly what is getting ready to happen here in the  I think we owe this to people who are getting ready to run for the Senate or maybe to people who are thinking about running for reelection. We should go ahead and have this discussion so that they will know whether they are running for a 6-year House term--a 6-year House term because we do not have the maturity, because we do not trust each other, because we are on this constantly deescalating deal and our leaders do not talk to each other and fight and all of those kinds of things happen, because we are getting ready to take this institution to a[[Page S2031]]place that I do not think many of us are going to be proud of. But, again, for the people who are thinking about running for the Senate, let's go ahead and clear it. Let's have a discussion about this legislative issue so that people will know, if they are seeking election to the U.Senate, that they are, in essence, going to sign up, possibly, for a 6-year House term.  I am at a place in my Senate life where I have tremendous respect for the people with whom I have served. Every day I come here, I look at the things I have the ability to affect as one I look at that with such honor, to be able to be in a body that debates these kinds of things and affects people in the way we do. What an honor it is to be here. I am here with no malice.  I am here, though, at a time when I see what is getting ready to happen without a lot of discussion, and I hope that somehow or another, we will have the ability to avoid what I see as something that is very, very detrimental to the Senate and, in the process, very detrimental to our country.

5773,topic-id,2102,"Mr.President, I came to the floor to talk about the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to serve as the next Supreme Court Justice, and I happened to walk in while the Democratic leader was speaking. In the brief time I heard him comment this morning, I concluded that basically the Democrats are against everything. They are against everything. He knows as well as anybody that when the President sends over a budget, it is a proposal by the President that Congress routinely changes, arriving at its own budget priorities, working with the White                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, before I get too distracted by the minority leader's opposition to anything and everything, let me comment a little bit on the Gorsuch nomination.  We will meet next week, on April 3, to vote Judge Gorsuch's nomination out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, at which time his nomination will come to the floor. The world had a chance to see--and certainly all of America--during the 20 hours that Judge Gorsuch testified before the Judiciary Committee that he is a superb nominee. He is a person with a brilliant legal mind. He has an incredible educational resume and extensive experience both in the public sector--working at the Department of Justice--and in private practice and then for the last 10 years, of course, serving as a Federal judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals out of  I believe he is one of the most qualified nominees in recent history, to be sure, and you might have to go back into our early history to find somebody on par with Judge Gorsuch in terms of his qualifications for this important office. Unfortunately, in spite of this, we are seeing the minority leader threatening to filibuster this incredibly well-qualified judge. I hope other Democrats will exercise independence and do the right thing.  I was glad to see just yesterday our colleague, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Vermont, say that he had a different take. He was quoted in a Vermont newspaper--perhaps it is a blog--it is called VTDigger.org. Senator Leahy, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said: ``I am not inclined to filibuster.''  Just for the benefit of anybody who might be listening, let me distinguish between the use of the filibuster as opposed to voting against the nominee.  It is a fact that there has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in American history--never.  The only time cloture was denied on a bipartisan basis of a nominee to the Supreme Court was in 1968, when Abe Fortas was nominated by then-President Lyndon Mr.Fortas, then serving as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States, had a number of problems, one of which was that he was still advising President Johnson while he was a sitting member of the U.Supreme He was basically giving political advice from the bench to the President of the United States, with whom he had a long-established relationship.  Then there was a suspicion that Earl Warren, the Chief Justice of the United States, had cut a deal with the President such that he would resign effective upon the qualifying of his successor. So there wasn't any literal vacancy to fill. The President would then nominate Abe Fortas, then an Associate Justice, and he would then nominate Homer Thornberry, then a judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, to fill the Fortas Associate Justice slot. There were a couple of embarrassing items to Judge Fortas that caused a bipartisan denial of cloture, or the cutting off of debate, after which his nomination was withdrawn after 4 days of floor debate.  I mention all of this because sometimes people want to lead you down this rabbit trail, claiming that what they are doing is something that is well established in our history and in this precedence of the Senate when that is absolutely not true. There has never been a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee that has been successful in denying that Justice to the Supreme Court's nomination to be confirmed--never. What Democrats are threatening to do next week when[[Page S2020]]Judge Gorsuch's nomination comes to the floor is unprecedented. It has never happened before.  I am glad to hear some voices of sanity and wisdom from people like Senator Leahy, who said he was not inclined to join in that filibuster. I also saw that our colleague from West Virginia, Senator Manchin, has said he will not filibuster the nominee. It is totally a separate issue as to whether they vote to confirm the nominee ultimately because, as we all know, in working here in the Senate, in order to get to that up-or-down vote, you have to get past this cloture vote, which requires 60 votes, and it has been traditional that we have not even had those cloture votes with regard to Supreme Court nominations.  As a matter of fact, there have only been four of those in our history. Two of them were with regard to William Rehnquist when nominated as Associate Justice to the Supreme Court and then when he was nominated to be Chief Justice of the Supreme With Samuel Alito, there was cloture obtained. Ultimately, he won an up-or-down vote and got a majority of votes on the Senate floor. Then, of course, there was the Fortas nomination, which I mentioned earlier. In none of those four cases was there a partisan filibuster that denied an up-or-down vote to the nominee. Again, the only one that is a little of an outlier is the Fortas nomination, which was ultimately withdrawn, so the Senate did not have the opportunity to come back and revisit that initial failed cloture vote because of the ethical problems that led Judge Fortas to resign from the Supreme Court and return to private practice.  Let me talk a minute about the excuses our Democratic colleagues have given in opposing Judge  First, they said they would fight a nominee who was not in the mainstream.  I believe that out of the 2,700 cases Judge Gorsuch has participated in, 97 percent of those have been affirmed on appeal--97 percent. He has only been reversed in maybe one case. I believe there was a discussion about it. There was even an argument as to whether that was an outright reversal. It is very unusual, in my experience, to see a judge who enjoys such a tremendous record of affirmance on appeal and such a very low record of reversal, particularly for an intermediate appellate court like the Tenth Circuit Court of  After they realized this ``out of the mainstream'' argument wouldn't work, they then moved the goalpost. Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have implied they might oppose Judge Gorsuch because of his refusal to answer questions about issues that could come before him on the In doing so, the judge was doing exactly what is required by judicial ethics. In other words, how would you feel if the judge before whom you appeared had previously said ``If I get confirmed, I will never vote in favor of a litigant with this kind of case''? Judges do not do that. Judges are not politicians who run for office on a platform. In fact, judges are supposed to be the anti-politician--ruling on the law and the facts. It is not based on a personal agenda or a political agenda at all, and our colleagues know that.  This is the same rule that was embraced by Ruth Bader Ginsburg--someone whom our friends across the aisle admire on the Elena Kagan did the same thing in refusing to comment or speculate, saying that it would be improper for them to prejudge these cases or to campaign, basically, for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Judge Gorsuch did the same thing as Justices Ginsburg and Kagan, and he fulfilled his ethical obligations as a sitting judge and preserved the independence of the judiciary by keeping an open mind as to cases that come before him.  When they failed to make the case that Judge Gorsuch was somehow out of the mainstream, when they failed to make the case that he somehow was being nonresponsive in his answering questions by the Judiciary Committee, the goalpost moved yet again. Last week, some suggested that Judge Gorsuch never ruled in favor of the ``little guy.'' This was following a line of arguments peddled by some outside groups who were trying to paint Judge Gorsuch as unsympathetic to the litigants who appeared in his court.  Fortunately, Judge Gorsuch set the record straight. He made clear that his motivation in each and every case is to follow the law wherever it may lead and to reach a decision based on where the law stands, not on his personal opinion or emotions. Again, a good judge does not judge the litigants but, rather, the case at hand.  I should point out, as I did with regard to the more than 2,700 cases Judge Gorsuch has decided, that virtually all of them have been affirmed, meaning that every judge on the panel, including those nominated by Democrats, reached the same conclusion that he did, and they were approved, or affirmed, by the higher court, certainly not reversed.  I think our colleagues are making a tragic mistake by denying this President his nominee for the Supreme Court of the United If Judge Gorsuch is not good enough for them, they will never vote to confirm any nominee from this or any other Republican President of the United What would happen if that view were to prevail? I think we would see the Supreme Court essentially become nonfunctional and shut down, and litigants who were hoping to get access to a hearing before the Court would have nowhere to turn. It is not acceptable.  Some of our colleagues remind me of the old story about the child who murders his parents and then comes before the court and asks for leniency, saying: I am an orphan. This is a situation of their own making.  I really regretted hearing the Democratic leader talk about a case in which somehow there was the argument that because the judge followed the precedent that then existed but that a future decision in a Supreme Court case changed that precedent--that the judge should have anticipated it and somehow failed to follow the current precedent because the Supreme Court at some later date might change that precedent. It makes absolutely no sense.  So what our colleagues are doing is basically saying that no nominee of President Trump's or any Republican nominee is going to get confirmed to the Supreme Court because it is going to require 60 votes to do so. This would be unprecedented in our Nation's history. I think it will be an abuse of the power we have in the Senate of encouraging debate, which is the cloture vote, by filibustering this outstanding nominee.  I have said it before and I will say it again: Judge Gorsuch is going to have his day on the Senate floor. We are going to have a fulsome debate. We are going to give our Democratic colleagues a chance to do the right thing and to vote at some point to cut off debate and then have an up-or-down vote to confirm the nominee, just as has happened in every single case before, with the possible exception of the Fortas nomination, which I described earlier, which was ultimately withdrawn and the judge resigned because of an ethical scandal.  I hate to see our colleagues taking us down this path, but they are determined to oppose anything and everything these days. We used to say there was a difference between campaigning and governing. Basically, they are so upset with the outcome of the election that they are continuing the political campaign now and making it impossible for us to do our work here in the It is a crying shame.  I can only hope that cooler heads will prevail and that others in the Democratic caucus will listen to Senator Leahy and others who say they are not inclined to filibuster. Whether they decide to vote against the nominee is entirely up to them, but denying the majority in the Senate a chance to vote to confirm the nominee is simply unacceptable, and it will not stand.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

5759,topic-id,353,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this measure. And I do so as someone who, in 2008, actually was a member of the conference committee when we passed the reauthorization of the Higher Education Unfortunately, that is the last time Congress has moved forward, and we are about 3 or 4 years overdue in terms of modernizing and updating that law.  But I can tell you, Mr.Speaker, having been to the meetings--and we actually met as conferees and we had votes and we had discussion, unlike a lot of the short-circuited processes that unfortunately dominates most of our business these days--it was a healthy process.                              {time}  1515  This issue of teacher preparation in setting up standards was totally noncontroversial. There were a couple of items on which the two sides actually debated, but this one was a no-brainer. It just makes perfect sense that we want to make sure that there is at least a minimum standard out there to make sure that kids are getting the opportunities they need, particularly with the changing demands and needs of the workforce.  What also just sort of astonishes me is the manner in which this regulation was issued, which was only last The ink is, really, barely dry on it. We have a new incoming administration with a new Secretary, whom I will talk about in a second, and they have more than ample opportunity to go back into the regulations process and amend it, make changes, if they so choose. Instead, rather than using a scalpel, we are using a chain saw to basically carve out, in essence, a section of the law because the ability of the Department's to go back and do a similar regulation is not allowed under the Congressional Review  This is a measure which, as I said, was just totally noncontroversial, on which we had a very strong vote, by the way, in terms of the final result of the conference that took place back in 2008, and the process that is being used is just tremendous overkill.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.  ",CREC-2017-02-07-pt1-PgH1041.txt,1836,LEGISLATIVE SESSION,2017.0,7.0,March
5760,topic-id,387,"Mr.Speaker, frankly, I think, as we stand here today in the Chamber--and just an hour or so ago, we had a Secretary who was confirmed in an unprecedented procedure during which the Vice President had to come in and break the tie--it, unfortunately, has the look of, really, being part of a pattern that we are seeing emerge here with the confirmation hearing process during which the incoming Secretary showed almost no regard for the notion of accountability in terms of charter schools and voucher programs, which, for the taxpayer and for the kids and the parents who really depend on our education system, is just a totally unacceptable approach.  As I said, this CRA bill on the teacher preparation program is just part of the same cloth. It is saying that we are just going to carve out a section which was a totally bipartisan, commonsense provision back in 2008 and that we are going to handcuff the ability of the Department to even come in with a substitute. The chances of Congress, at this point, coming in with new legislation--I mean, I am the eternal optimist. Hopefully, that will happen, but it sure hasn't happened over the last 3 or 4 years since the HEA, Higher Education Act, expired.  This is really, I think, a very unfortunate effort that is being put forth here on the floor. As I said, given what is going on with the Department and the vote that took place here earlier today, for those who really care about making sure that our free public education system, which has been, basically, part of America since Abraham Lincoln first proposed it back in the[[Page H1045]]middle of the Civil War, we need to be totally on guard--on standby--to make sure that the taxpayer is protected in terms of making sure these grant programs go to school districts and systems that are actually following through with programs of value and to make sure that we protect the pillars of public education. Anyone watching that confirmation process over in the Senate, I think, was extremely worried and alarmed, which is why, I think, we had this avalanche of emails and calls that came in all across the country during that process.  I strongly urge a ``no'' vote for all of the reasons I have stated.  ",CREC-2017-02-07-pt1-PgH1041.txt,1836,REPEATING THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP,2017.0,7.0,February
5769,topic-id,926,"Mr.Speaker, it is an honor to address this body, and I rise today to talk about H.1469, the Welfare BRAC  Before going into the specifics of the bill, I would like to talk for a little bit about how we have arrived at a point of needing such a fundamental restructuring of our Nation's antipoverty programs.  In 2015, the Federal Government spent $843 billion on welfare programs, means-tested welfare programs. By some estimates, we have spent more than $22 trillion on antipoverty programs over the past 50 years. Today, we have some 92 antipoverty programs run[[Page H2511]]by the Federal Government, all supposedly with the same goal: to alleviate poverty.  This chart to my left highlights those programs. If you look: 5, cash aid; 25, education and training; 2, for energy; 17, for food aid, and on goes the list.  So how did we come here? Well, as Ronald Reagan said: ``Government programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this Earth.''  Why is that true? Well, it is true because touching some of these programs is very polarizing. So when you touch them, they all have a constituency. And the reality is, if the 15th food aid program worked well, then the 16th wouldn't be launched. So if you want to address a new problem, well, then you launch the 17th food aid program.  What doesn't happen over the time is finding a way to get those programs to work together to be a coherent whole. So the solution, really in a lot of ways, is bipartisan. The Brookings Institution is rarely an ally to conservatives, and the Heritage Foundation is rarely an ally to the left. Yet they would both agree that employment, healthy marriages, and education alleviate poverty.  In fact, many of our programs, when we look at these listed, seek to address those needs. There are 92 programs. Maslow, in the hierarchy of needs, just addressed 5, and we have 92.  I think about the young social worker who wants to help someone who comes into the office and perhaps each of these programs has a 4-inch binder--a 4-inch thick binder, 92 of them. That is a pretty big bookshelf. What if she only had to know 20 programs? What if there were only 20 binders? What if there were only 5? What if there were 10?  I don't know whether the right number is a dozen or 20, but I don't think it is 92. So what is the solution? Well, I have a bipartisan solution that looks back to the history.  So in the Cold War, we had a very large Army, and, as we scaled down, it was very politically sensitive to try to deal with the problems of scaling down. Each base, each installation, had its own constituency, and so we created BRAC, the Base Closure and Realignment And the goal there was to have a quantitative set of objectives and to have a commission that was bipartisan that gave Congress a straight up-or-down vote. That worked, by and large, and we were able to scale down the military in a way that let the military focus on its mission.  So what I propose with H.1469, the Welfare Benefit Realignment Commission, is a four-Republican, four-Democrat commission, totally neutral. It also does not seek to take away a dime of spending in it. It seeks to reduce the number of programs so that the result is more focused.  When Lyndon Johnson launched his war on poverty, he said that the goal was to not just treat the symptoms but to find a cure and, if possible, to prevent poverty all together.  So perhaps if we had a more focused effort, perhaps if we all focused on the cause, instead of the programs, we could see results. Some of these programs are clearly more effective than others at helping people get out of poverty, yet the reality is, Americans have seen roughly the same percentage of their fellow Americans in poverty for the entire war on poverty.  So if we look at these programs under the same three goals--employment, marriage, and education--perhaps we can find things that are effective that lift people out, really, at the end of the day, giving as many people as possible the dignity of work and a path to escape poverty into a better future.  In fact, this path is very compatible with the Better Way agenda that we have laid out for poverty for the years. It is not focused on dollars. It is focused on efficiency. Later in the year, we are seeking to provide off ramps so that you don't find a trap in the ``Better Way.'' You don't find a trap--if you get a raise, you lose your housing, or if you take that next job, or you get married, you lose your education benefits, things that would provide an on-ramp and an off-ramp for this system.  So that is part of the agenda for the year for the I think this is very compatible with it. I am seeking cosponsors. I am seeking support for this bill, and it truly is with a spirit of embracing the common American value of providing a safety net for their fellow Americans, but they want it to be effective.  So this is not about the cause. The cause is good, and fewer programs lets it be more focused and, hopefully, get a good result.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this.

5704,topic-id,2208,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Texas, and I think the closing remarks were spot-on. We will disagree, we will debate, and we will have our differences, but we need to strive for common ground. That is what the American people sent us here to do. I hope we can find the common ground in this Chamber and in the House and with the new President after January 20. It is a challenge.  It is interesting to listen to the remarks from the Republican side of the aisle. There has been this appetite for so long to repeal I have lost track of how many times the Republican House of Representatives voted to repeal ObamaCare over the last 6 years. I believe it is over 60 times that they have voted to repeal it. Wouldn't you think that over a span of 6 years, with 60 different votes, they would have in their back pocket an alternative, a replacement? They don't. They still don't today.  For all of the speeches on the floor that have been given by my illustrious colleagues asking for a second opinion, most second opinions are something tangible that you can read, understand. But when it comes to a second opinion on ObamaCare, they have nothing to offer. Why is that? Why is it that they are so focused on this one issue--ObamaCare--and the Republicans have not come up with an alternative? It is hard. It is hard work. There are tough, difficult choices.  If we stick to the basic principles of the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, we run into some problems in a hurry. The first basic principle accepted by President-Elect Trump is that we want to make sure that no health insurance company can ever discriminate against you or your family because of a preexisting condition--a baby born with cancer, a child with diabetes, a spouse who survives a cancer scare. In the old days before ObamaCare, that meant that you either were disqualified from insurance for your family or you couldn't afford it. So we said as part of the Affordable Care Act: No more--they cannot discriminate against those who are less than perfect when it comes to health because so many of us are less than perfect. OK, my friends in the Grand Old Party, how are you going to deal with that? How are we going to make sure that every family is protected with their health insurance plan? We haven't heard a word.  President-Elect Trump said he is going to stick by that basic principle. But there comes with that principle a requirement as well--that you have a large pool of insured people that includes those who are healthy and those who may be less than healthy. If we are going to have a large pool of people, we must make insurance mandatory for many The Republicans have said they want to eliminate that requirement automatically. So the first issue is the preexisting condition. This is a Republican problem--an issue they can't answer and one that they have refused to respond to.  What about lifetime limits on health insurance policies? What if there is a policy that you buy for $100,000 and then you get a cancer diagnosis and the treatment is going to cost $1 million? What then? We say that there cannot be a lifetime limit on a health insurance policy. The Republicans want to repeal that. What would they replace that with? There is no suggestion.  The list goes on and on. What if you have a child who just graduated from college who is looking for a job or maybe has a part-time job that doesn't have benefits and doesn't have health insurance? We keep them under the family health insurance plan until they are 26, which gives peace of mind to thousands of families across Illinois and The Republicans want to repeal that. What will they replace that with?  I say to those who are receiving Medicare today--40-plus million in America: We closed the prescription drug loophole that stated they had to start paying out of pocket for prescriptions during the course of the year--the so-called doughnut hole. Republicans want to repeal that. Will that make Illinois's seniors and millions of seniors across the country vulnerable to higher prices? When you get beyond the 144 characters of a tweet, get beyond a sign on the Senate floor, and when you get beyond the facile political speech and get into real policy, it gets exceedingly difficult.  The bottom line is that 29 million Americans now have health insurance because of the Affordable Care We have the lowest rate of uninsured Americans in modern history, and now the Republicans want to repeal this. They say they are going to replace it. I think it is not repeal and replace they are looking for. It is repeal and retreat. They don't know where to turn. They are running away from the mess they will create by repealing We have a right to demand that if they have a better way, they present it and bring it up for a vote. Let's have some certainty about our future.  Already I have been warned by hospitals all across Illinois that repealing ObamaCare--repealing the Affordable Care Act--will be devastating to hospitals, particularly in rural areas in my State and to inner city hospitals. What are we going to do about that? Will there be special funds to help those hospitals stay in business? They will need it.  It isn't the only issue we will take up. There is another issue equally compelling, and that is the issue of immigration. I remember the speeches, and you do too--the excerpts at night on the news--that the President-elect talked about building a wall to the high heavens and making the Mexicans pay for it, and he talked about all those who are coming across the border and the dangers they presented to When it comes to immigration, there are 11 million people living in this country. The overwhelming majority of them are law-abiding. They are working. They want to be part of America's future.  The group I have tried to focus on is a group we call the Fifteen years ago, I introduced the first[[Page S12]]DREAM It was a bill that addressed the following situation: A child or an infant, brought to the United States by an undocumented family, who grew up here, literally has no home, no country. They are undocumented in America and brought here as babies, infants, toddlers, children, teenagers. Now they are graduating high school, and they don't know where to turn. The law in America is graphic, and it is grim. It says that if someone is found in that position, they are required to leave America for 10 years and must petition to return. We have 15-, 16-, and 17-year-olds who know no other country, who get up in the classroom every morning and pledge allegiance to the flag, just as the Members of the Senate do, and who believe in their heart of hearts that this is home. Yet they are undocumented.  So we introduced the DREAM Act, and we couldn't pass it. We passed it once in the Senate, and they passed it in the But we never could quite reach that super majority that we needed to pass it at the right moment. So President Obama stepped up and created DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, which, under Executive order, allowed those who would be eligible for the DREAM Act to apply, pay a fee of almost $500, go through a criminal background check, and, if they were approved, receive temporary authority to stay in the United States without fear of deportation and to work in this country. As of today, over 750,000 have done that.  During the campaign, President-Elect Trump said that he would abolish this program. Fortunately, after the election, he had a more moderate position, which I would like to quote from Time magazine. He said:       We're going to work something out that's going to make      people happy and proud. They got brought here at a very young      age, they've worked here, they've gone to school here. Some      were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they're in      never-never land because they don't know what is going to      happen.  That is a very thoughtful, sensitive, and promising statement. I appreciate it. I hope the President-elect will keep DACA in place until we have something that can work to succeed it.  I want to salute my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Republican Lindsey Graham of South He and I have joined in introducing the BRIDGE Act, which would give President-Elect Trump an opportunity to allow these young people to stay subject to the same approval, the same criminal background check, the same filing fee, and the same tax liability to stay on a temporary basis until we do our work in the Senate and the House on the issue of immigration. The BRIDGE Act is also cosponsored by Senators Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake, Republicans from Alaska and Arizona, as well as by my colleague Senator Schumer, the leader on the Democratic side, and Senator Dianne Other Democrats want to join as well. We hope to have a very strong bipartisan bill.  In my view, DACA is a lawful exercise of the In the view of many Republicans, it is not. The BRIDGE Act is the answer to both points of view. This is a fair, reasonable way to protect these young people until Congress comes up with better, more comprehensive answers when it comes to immigration reform.  Over the years, I have come to the floor, telling the story of the It is one thing for a Senator to give a speech and put it in the Congressional Record, but it really doesn't come home until you see and meet the young people I am talking about.  Let me introduce one today. This is Fernando He was brought to the United States from Mexico at the age of 18 months. He grew up in the city of Milwaukee, WI, and became an excellent student. At his Catholic high school, he received many academic awards. He was a member of the National Honor Society and the Jesuit Honor Society, and he received first honors all 4 years of high school.  Fernando was involved in many volunteer activities--the Latin club, math club, track and field team, and he was an instructor for a class preparing his classmates to take college entrance exams. He volunteered with the Youth Leadership He also volunteered with his school's Key Club and Big Brother mentoring program and as a middle school soccer and basketball coach.  At his high school graduation, Fernando Espino of Milwaukee, WI--a DREAMer brought here from Mexico at the age of 18 months--received the Jesuit Secondary Education Association Award, the highest award given by a Jesuit high school, which is presented to one graduate who, in their words, is ``intellectually competent, open to growth, religious, loving, and committed to justice.''  This amazing student was then accepted at Harvard He continued to give back to the community there. He volunteered as a tutor for kids in elementary schools and as a peer adviser to freshmen students at He became a competitive ballroom dancer and worked on the Harvard Business School newspaper.  Thanks to DACA, the program I mentioned earlier, Fernando was able to support himself. You see, these DREAMers don't qualify for a penny of Federal assistance for education. They have to pay for it. They have to come up with the money.  With DACA, he could work. He worked as a bartender. In May 2015 he graduated from Harvard magna cum laude, the highest honors, with a degree in economics and sociology. He worked for an investment management firm in Los Angeles and then as a market research consultant in He is now preparing to pursue an MBA in business school. He wants to be a leader in a major corporation and start his own company. In a letter he sent to me, he wrote:       Optimistic hope, is ultimately, what I believe makes this      country so great. Living as an undocumented immigrant, it is      easy to lose that motivating influence. DACA was a refreshing      and reinvigorating influx of that very same hope. DACA now      allows me to look forward not with doubt but with confidence      that the future is bright!  If DACA is eliminated, Fernando Espino may lose his hope. The day after DACA, Fernando Espino will no longer have official legal status. He will not be able to get his master's in business administration, and at any moment he could be deported back to Mexico, where he hasn't lived since he was 18 months old.  Fernando and so many other DREAMers can help America be a greater nation. That talent and determination he brought to his young life is a talent and determination America needs in its future. I hope President-Elect Trump will understand this and continue the DACA Program, but if he decides to end it, then his administration can work with Congress and make sure the BRIDGE Act is there as a protection.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-03-pt1-PgS11.txt,326,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT,2017.0,3.0,February

5731,topic-id,1691,"Mr.President, the highlight of the week, of course, is President Trump's speech to the joint session of Congress, the first major public speech he has given since his inauguration. The Chamber of the House of Representatives was filled with Members of both the House and Senate, the Supreme Court Justices, the Cabinet, and many other dignitaries for the speech. It went for about 60 minutes, which is reasonable under Presidential standards. Many have gone much longer, and I listened carefully to the statement by the new President to really glean his priorities, in terms of his administration and what he hopes to see happen in this country.  There were many issues that he touched on, but there was one he didn't. He didn't say a word--not one word--about the Russian intervention in our last Presidential campaign. This is not speculation. It is a reality that 17 different U.intelligence agencies have told us that Vladimir Putin and the Russian Government were attempting to subvert and undermine our Presidential election. To our knowledge, that has never happened at any time in the history of the United It is the first time a sovereign nation has tried to literally launch a cyber invasion of the United States of America to try to change the outcome of the most important electoral choice under the Constitution--the choice of President of the United It is a major issue. It is one President Trump cannot ignore.  During the course of that speech, he never once mentioned the word ``Russia.'' He never raised this issue as to whether it was worthy of investigation. He described it as a ruse. He has dismissed it and basically has paid no attention to it whatsoever and wants the rest of America to forget it as well.  That is not going to happen because the investigation about this Russian cyber invasion continues. We know the Federal Bureau of Investigation is deep into an investigation. I don't know what it will find. I don't know if they will find any complicity with anyone in the United States, anyone in the Trump campaign. It is only after we have an independent, complete, and credible investigation that we may know the facts.  We also have an investigation underway by many of our intelligence agencies, which are looking at the involvement of the Russians trying to change the outcome of our election. Those investigations are underway.  One element came up last night that has changed the conversation in Washington about this whole issue. Even before last night's news, we knew Attorney General Jeff Sessions needed to recuse himself from any Justice Department investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 election in support of the Trump campaign.  The Department of Justice standard for recusal--that is, the removal of the Attorney General from an investigation--is pretty clear. It requires recusal by someone who has ``a personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation.''  The Department of Justice regulations define ``political relationship'' to include service as a principal adviser to a candidate or campaign organization. Well, that certainly covers Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Trump campaign. Attorney General Sessions was named in March 2016 as chairman of then-Candidate Trump's National Security Advisory Steve Bannon, formerly of Breitbart News and now a close adviser to the President, described Jeff Sessions to the Washington Post as follows: ``Throughout the campaign, Sessions has been the fiercest, most dedicated, and most loyal promoter in Congress of Trump's agenda, and has played a critical role as the clearinghouse for policy and philosophy to undergird the implementation of that agenda.''  Attorney General Sessions close relationship with the Trump campaign creates a compelling basis for his recusal from any investigation of Russian involvement in that campaign.[[Page S1570]]  So far, to this day, to this moment, Jeff Sessions has refused to recuse himself from this investigation. He refused when I asked him about it during the course of the hearing, and he has refused since he was named Attorney Now it is clear that his unwillingness to recuse himself is no longer tenable or acceptable or even explainable.  Last night, the Washington Post reported that then-Senator Jeff Sessions spoke with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice during the Presidential campaign--in July at a Heritage Foundation event near the Republican National Convention and in September in a private conversation in the Senator's office. These communications came as a great surprise because until last night, Attorney General Sessions did not disclose them.  During his hearing in January, in preparation to become Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, then Senator, was asked by Senator Al Franken of Minnesota: ``If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what would you do?''  Jeff Sessions' answer under oath included this statement: ``I did not have communications with the Russians.''  Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont also asked Attorney General Sessions in writing: ``Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?'' Attorney General Sessions' response was ``No.''  It is hard to understand why Attorney General Sessions has not been more forthcoming and upfront with Congress and the American people about communications which we now know in fact did take place. If he thinks there was nothing wrong with these communications, why would he conceal them? It is deeply troubling.  The reality is, the Attorney General has compromised his credibility when it comes to investigating Russia's cyber invasion of America's election. His recusal is no longer an option, it is a necessity.  People say: Oh, of course, a Democratic Senator is saying that the Republican Attorney General should recuse himself. This morning, it has been reported that a number of top Republicans in Congress have called for the Attorney General's recusal, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Oversight Chairman Jason  It is imperative that career Justice Department professionals be allowed to follow the facts in this investigation to discover the truth. We may need a special counsel, but these steps alone are not sufficient. I believe we need an independent, bipartisan commission, led by Americans of unimpeachable integrity, to get to the bottom and get to the facts on this attack on our democracy.  I know the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is also conducting an investigation. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which, incidentally, is chaired by Representative Devin Nunes, who served on the executive committee of President Trump's transition team, agreed to the parameters of an investigation yesterday.  The Intelligence Committees cannot, by their very nature, provide the transparency and accountability that an independent commission would bring to this issue, and the chairmen of those two committees--House and Senate--have already raised serious questions about their own impartiality by calling on the media organizations at the behest of the White House to challenge news stories on this issue.  How could you possibly maintain objectivity if the elements of an investigation are compromised before the investigation even starts?  I am particularly concerned that Chairman Nunes has already publicly expressed views of the outcome of his committee's investigation before it has even started. That is not a professional, honest, or credible way to approach this.  We need an independent, bipartisan commission to get to the truth, and that may include taking a hard look at the Attorney General's communications with the Russians and at his refusal to disclose those communications. We also need to point out the obvious, which is that when it comes to investigating Russia's involvement in helping the Trump campaign, we have to follow the money, and that includes reviewing President Trump's tax returns, which, unlike any other Presidential candidate in modern times, he has refused to share with the American people.  Yesterday, Senators Stabenow, Wyden, and a number of my colleagues sent a letter to the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, of Utah, urging him to allow committee members to review the President's tax returns in a closed executive session. That is something the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has the authority to do. The letter pointed out that this oversight is essential given the media reports about Russia as well as the possible unconstitutional emoluments being accepted by President Trump's vast business empire.  I support this request from my colleagues. It is imperative that President Trump level with the American people about his business's foreign entanglements, especially those involving  This issue is not going away. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in pursuing all of the facts about last year's Russian attack on our democracy.  It was just a few weeks ago that the President's National Security Advisor, General Flynn, resigned. Do you remember why? He misrepresented to the Vice President and the American people conversations which he had had with the He ended up giving up his position as the 1 person in national security in the White  Now questions have been raised about the credibility of the Attorney General--the 1 person in the Trump administration when it comes to the administration of justice. What is the issue? It is the same issue as with General Flynn--conversations with the Russians which were not disclosed to the American public.  This is an issue that is going to continue to be in the forefront, as it should be, until we can bring the facts to the American people. The only way to reach that point is by having the Attorney General recuse himself from any investigation, appointing as a special prosecutor--or someone in that capacity--someone who is credible who can pursue this matter and then initiating an independent, bipartisan investigation by a national commission with credible chairs who have no political agenda and care enough for the United States to view this invasion by Russia as absolutely unacceptable.

5781,topic-id,2300,"Mr.President, I rise to speak on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.Supreme  It is important to reflect for a moment on how we have reached this moment. It has been more than a year since the untimely passing of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of 2016. Under article II, section 2 of the U.Constitution, President Barack Obama had a duty to make a nomination to fill that vacant seat. He met that obligation by nominating Chief Judge Merrick Garland in March of 2016.  Yet the leader of the Senate Republicans, Majority Leader McConnell, announced that, for the first time in the 230-year history of the Senate, he would refuse the President's nominee, Judge Garland, a hearing and a vote. Senator McConnell further said that he would refuse to even meet with Judge It was a transparent political decision made by the Republican leader in the hopes that a Republican would be elected President and fill the vacancy. It was part of a broader Republican political strategy to influence, if not capture, the judicial branch of government on every level of the court system.  Not only did the Senate Republicans keep a Supreme Court seat vacant for over a year, they turned the Senate's Executive Calendar into a nomination obituary column for 30 other judicial nominees who had been reported out of the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support. They were hoping a Republican President would fill all of those seats, and they were prepared to leave them vacant for a year or more to achieve that end.  What kind of nominees were they hoping for? Nominees who had been blessed by special interests, by big business, and by Republican advocacy organizations.  It was last year that then-Candidate Donald Trump released a list of 21 potential Supreme Court candidates who were handpicked by two Republican advocacy groups--the Federalist Society and the Heritage I am not speculating on the fact that they were chosen by those two groups, as President Trump publicly thanked the groups for giving him a list of names with which to fill the vacancies on the Supreme It was unprecedented for anyone, including a candidate for President, to outsource the judicial selection process to special interest[[Page S2024]]groups, but President Trump did it. True to his word to these special interest groups, he nominated one of the names on the list--Judge Neil  The first telephone call Judge Gorsuch received about his nomination was not from the White House; it was from the Federalist Society, which was one of these Republican advocacy groups. Eventually, Judge Gorsuch made it to the interview stage with President Trump's inner circle. He met with Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, and President Trump himself. Those men each took the measure of Judge Gorsuch and gave him their approval to serve for a lifetime appointment on the highest Court in the land. President Trump, who had announced numerous litmus tests for judicial nominations, appeared very satisfied with Neil Gorsuch as his nominee.  The President's Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, even said: ``Neil Gorsuch . . . represents the type of judge that has the vision of Donald Trump.''  There was certainly no political subtlety in that evaluation.  After Judge Gorsuch's nomination was announced, a dark money machine shifted into gear. A national campaign, which cost at least $10 million, was launched to support the Gorsuch nomination. Because it is dark money, there is no disclosure about who is bankrolling this effort, but it is a safe bet that the suppliers of dark money have at least a passing interest in cases before the U.Supreme  Despite this unprecedented and unsettling process that led to Judge Gorsuch's nomination, the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee gave Judge Gorsuch a courtesy that Republicans denied to Judge Garland--a hearing and a vote. Why? Because Senate Democrats take the Constitution seriously. We do not turn our backs on the constitutional responsibility of advice and consent, even though that is exactly what our Republican colleagues did when it came to Merrick  Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee met for 4 days to consider the Gorsuch nomination. In leading up to the hearing, I made it clear on the Senate floor that I thought that Judge Gorsuch had a burden to bear at that hearing.  On February 2, I said here on the floor that Judge Gorsuch needed to demonstrate that he would be a nominee who would uphold and defend the Constitution for the benefit of everyone, not just for the advantage of a privileged few who happened to engineer his nomination.  I also said that Judge Gorsuch needed to be forthright with the American people about his record and his views. I made it clear that avoiding answers to critical questions was unacceptable.  I said that he needed to demonstrate that he would be an independent check on President Trump and every President and that he was prepared to disappoint the President and the rightwing groups that handpicked him if the Constitution and the law required it.  Judge Gorsuch was given a full and fair hearing. He was given every opportunity to explain his judicial record and his views and to meet the expectations I laid out for him. I came away from this hearing firmly convinced that I must oppose the nomination of Neil  Here are the reasons:  Judge Gorsuch favors corporations and elites over the rights and voices of Americans, often using selective textualism to advance his agenda. Judge Gorsuch's hearing reinforced my fear that he would lean toward corporations and special interest elites at the expense of American workers and families.  Big business and special interests have found a friend under the Roberts Supreme I noted at the hearing a study by the Constitutional Accountability Center that found that under Chief Justice John Roberts the Supreme Court has ruled for positions that have been advocated by the Chamber of Commerce 69 percent of the time.  I am concerned, based on a review of his record, that Judge Gorsuch is likely to increase the pro-business leanings of the Roberts In a series of decisions--and I have read many of them--involving workers' rights, discrimination claims, consumer rights, and access to the courts, Judge Gorsuch has, time and again, favored corporations. He has often substituted his own judgment for those of the agencies that are tasked with protecting the workers.  No case was more egregious than the TransAm Trucking case, which was brought up repeatedly at the hearing. The facts are pretty well known by now. In January, Alphonse Maddin, a truck driver from Detroit, was stuck on the side of Interstate 88 in my home State of Illinois, and it was 14 degrees below zero outside. The brakes on his trailer were frozen. After waiting for a repair truck for several hours without his having any heat in the cab of his truck, Alphonse Maddin's body was starting to go numb. He called the trucking company one more time. They said: You have two options--stay in that truck or drag that frozen trailer down the interstate highway.  Both of those options were a risk to health and safety and common sense. So, instead, Al Maddin unhitched the broken-down trailer and drove to a gas station to fuel up and get warm and then returned to the disabled trailer. For this, the company fired him, and that firing blackballed him from ever working as a truck driver again.  Al Maddin came by my office and explained what he did. He had heard that there was some Federal agency that might consider what he had considered to be an unfair firing, so he went down to the agency and took out a ballpoint pen and filled out the complaint in longhand without the advice of counsel or any help. He was shocked when he won.  The case went further on appeal. Seven different judges heard Al Maddin's case. Six of them agreed that what had happened to him was unfair and unlawful. The only judge who found for the trucking company was Neil  Judge Gorsuch's dissent claimed that he was merely looking at the plain text of the law and the dictionary's definition and that was why Al Maddin had been fired. But the Tenth Circuit majority said that Neil Gorsuch was cherry-picking one dictionary's definition to come to his conclusion. Other dictionaries and the law's purpose of protecting health and safety had been ignored by Judge  Republican nominees like Judge Gorsuch often claim they are using the supposedly neutral philosophies of originalism and textualism to guide their decision making, but Al Maddin's case shows how Judge Gorsuch used a selective choice of text to advance a pro-business agenda at the expense of this American worker.  There are many other cases in Judge Gorsuch's record that demonstrate this trend, leading the Associated Press to say that Gorsuch's workers' rights opinions are ``often sympathetic but coldly pragmatic, and they're usually in the employer's favor.''  Take a look at the Hobby Lobby case. In that case, Judge Gorsuch expanded the idea that a corporation--a business--is a person. Why? He wanted to permit a for-profit corporation to impose its owners' personal religious beliefs on more than 13,000 employees who worked at that corporation and to limit their access to healthcare under insurance policies.  In finding for the corporation, Judge Gorsuch barely acknowledged that this decision burdened these thousands of employees and their personally constitutionally protected religious beliefs and choices.  Judge Gorsuch also has a troubling record when it comes to protecting the rights of Americans with disabilities and those who are victims of discrimination. It was quite a scene when, last week, in the midst of our hearing on Judge Gorsuch, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous ruling that rejected a standard that had been created by Judge I am sure that has never happened in history. This standard, which Judge Gorsuch had promoted for a case in which he wrote the majority opinion, weakened protections for students with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education  In 2008, Judge Gorsuch wrote in the Luke case that, under the IDEA, schools need only to provide educational benefits to students with disabilities that are merely more than de minimis.  At issue was the legal responsibility of a school district to provide educational opportunities for a child with[[Page S2025]]disabilities. In this case, Luke was a boy from Colorado who had suffered from severe autism. With the assistance and support of his teachers, Luke had made significant progress in school--in kindergarten and first grade. Then, when his family moved to a new home, he had to change school districts. At his new school, Luke began to lose the skills he had gained. His behavior was worse.  After unsuccessful attempts to address these concerns, Luke's parents decided that they ``could not in good conscience continue to expose their son, Luke, to this environment that was so detrimental to his educational and behavioral development.'' They decided to enroll Luke in a residential school that was dedicated to the education of children with his type of autism spectrum disorder.  A due process hearing officer, a Colorado State administrative law judge, and a Federal district court all found that the school district had failed to provide the education that was guaranteed to Luke under the Federal law of IDEA and that it was, therefore, required to reimburse the cost of the private residential school placement that Luke needed.  His parents were desperate to give Luke a chance in life, but then Judge Gorsuch ruled against them. In so doing, he created a new, lower standard for school districts in the process.  I asked Judge Gorsuch about this. He claimed he was just following the law and precedent, but as I pointed out at the hearing, that was not accurate. A legal analysis showed that Judge Gorsuch was the first judge in that circuit to add the word ``merely'' to the standard.  Luke P.'s father, Jeff, testified at the hearing and said that Judge Gorsuch's ``subtle wordcraft'' had the effect of ``further restricting an already restricted precedent with, unfortunately, my son in the bull's-eye of that decision.''  What did Chief Justice John Roberts of the U.Supreme Court say of the Gorsuch standard? Here is what he said: ``When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing `merely more than de minimis' progress [Gorsuch's words] from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.''  The Supreme Court sent a strong message when they released this opinion in the midst of Judge Gorsuch's hearing. The Court unanimously said that the Judge Gorsuch standard was inconsistent with the law. On this issue, Judge Gorsuch, the nominee, is somewhere to the right even of Justice Clarence This case is not an outlier. In fact, an analysis of his disability decisions shows that Judge Gorsuch has ruled against disabled students in 8 out of 10 IDEA cases.  There was also a consistent pattern of Judge Gorsuch's record on discrimination and retaliation involving employers. Bloomberg BNA analyzed this record and found that he ruled for employers 8 out of 12 times.  For example, he ruled against a sex discrimination claim brought by a UPS saleswoman; a disability discrimination claim that was brought by a college professor; an age discrimination claim that was brought by two maintenance workers; a race discrimination claim that was brought by an African-American grocery store employee who was called a ``monkey'' by his supervisor; a gender and disability discrimination claim that was brought by a female county accountant with multiple sclerosis; and a discrimination claim that was brought by a transgender woman who sought to use the restroom of her gender identity.  The case of Grace Hwang was particularly troubling to me. ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2019-4.txt,326,RESTRUCTURING HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA,2017.0,28.0,March

5693,topic-id,291,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor a living example of the American dream. At 101 years of age, Mr.John Massick of Davenport, IA, has spent a lifetime in service--as a husband, father, soldier, and hero of World War  John was born on Veterans Day 1915, which proved to be symbolic in his life to come. He enlisted in the Army in 1941 and rose to the rank of sergeant, leading soldiers in combat across Europe as a member of Patton's 3rd On his 29th birthday, while securing a bridge in Thionville, France, his unit suffered a perilous German attack, but John survived. It is a day Sergeant Massick describes as ``a birthday he'll never forget.'' He continued to serve through the end of the war in Europe, earning the French Croix de Guerre, Presidential Unit Commendation, and two Bronze Star Medals, among other accolades.  After the war, John returned to Davenport, married his now-late wife, Velma, and raised two sons while working as a carpet salesman and installer. He finally retired just 6 years ago at the ripe age of 94.  Today Iowans who visit ``Popcorn Charley's'' in northwest Davenport will hear John tell stories from the war. Some recall the harsh realities of combat, others remind us of our humanity, like the one he tells of how he caught a pig to fry porkchops for his men, bringing a bit of Iowa to the battlefields of John's stories, like his life's experiences, seem to strike the right balance between honor, humility, and a sense of humor.  I ask my colleagues to join me as I proudly recognize the service and the[[Page S2214]]sacrifice of SGT John Massick, an American patriot who epitomizes what is rightly referred to as America's Greatest                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2213-3.txt,2283,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,4.0,March
5755,topic-id,333,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.58, which would gut States' teacher preparedness programs.  This rollback is just one of many attempts by Republicans to dismantle the Department of Education by stripping its oversight and enforcement authority. The Trump administration has already made it clear its lack of regard for public education by picking an unqualified nominee to head the Department, and congressional Republicans are falling right in line by attempting to remove important rules to improve teacher preparedness.  This rule came into place as part of the bipartisan reauthorization of the Higher Education The reauthorization brought consensus measures to improve teacher training. But given the opportunity, Republicans are willing to forego public education all together by using the CRA to prevent the Department from overseeing State-led initiatives. And there is the crux of it. These initiatives are State-led and allow great levels of flexibility, provisions that Republicans championed during reauthorization. Now, they want to take advantage of an obscure congressional provision, used only once in our history prior to this This will tie the hands of future administrations from improving the transparency and quality of teacher preparedness programs.  If Republicans are happy with the rule and want to change it to improve the quality of education, this administration should use existing administrative tools to amend and revise the regulation. But that is not what this is about. This is about dismantling our public education system. Congressional Republicans want blanket deregulation of Federal education programs in order to allow States to ignore laws intended to protect disadvantaged students.  I invite my Republican colleagues to bring forth a plan that improves rules protecting our students, not to dismantle them. But this is simply not the way. I implore my colleagues to abandon this backdoor workaround and to work in a bipartisan fashion, like we did when Congress reauthorized the HEA, to develop ways in which we can improve public education for all of our children.

5794,topic-id,778,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.255, the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship  Our bill encourages the National Science Foundation to use its successful entrepreneurial education and training programs, such as the Innovation Corps, known as I-Corps, and Partnerships for Innovation, to inspire, recruit, and support women scientists and engineers who are interested in turning their laboratory discoveries into commercial technologies.  Mr.Speaker, you may ask: Why is it that we need a bill like this? We have these programs. Doesn't everyone know that we need more women in the STEM fields?  The answer is twofold:  Number one, we have a workforce shortage. If you take the field of advanced manufacturing by itself, in New England, there are 16,000 positions that are open currently. We have people who are looking for work--many of them women. They don't have the skill sets to meet that open job need right now, and that is a need for America to fill those jobs; so, number one, we need our qualified workforce with appropriate skills to meet the jobs of today.  We also need to think about the jobs of tomorrow. We are a wonderfully diverse country. Over half of our workforce is made up of women and people of color--historically, chronically, still--underrepresented in the STEM fields. There are problems we aren't even addressing and solutions we haven't thought of if we don't have more women with these power tools of the STEM skills to address the challenges and opportunities that this country is facing; so it is both a moral and an economic imperative that we equip more young women, and that is what our bill aims to do here today.  I have heard time and time again in my district, in which we have a lot of small startup companies and major universities, about this challenge that we face of bridging that gap between the laboratory and what happens in the commercial workforce. Through my work, I have formed a STEM advisory council and have met with them for the last 2 years. Among these are the problems they identified: limited access to capital, a lack of women mentors in the STEM fields, unmanageable expectations for work-life balance, and unconscious biases against women in the sciences. These are among the sorts of issues for which the I-Corps and the Partnerships for Innovation have been designed--in order to help close that gap to deal with these issues.  I want to give you examples of two of the women in my district with whom I have met who are benefiting from these programs and why we need to have more of them and the kind of difference that they will make.[[Page H274]]  The first is Zengmin She is a student at the University of Connecticut, and she helped the Wei Laboratory secure a National Science Foundation I-Corps grant to commercialize her work on tissue engineer scaffolds, innovative work which is going to help with bone repair and regeneration. She attributes her success to her female adviser and mentor, Professor Mei Wei, who encouraged her as a young woman to carry out her path forward in the biotech world. She helped her make that transition from the lab and the classroom out into the commercial world. She was lucky that she had a mentor with the experience to help close this gap.  Claire Leonardi is the CEO of Health Esense, which is a digital health startup firm in Avon, She received seed grant funding and gained access to hands-on training workshops to learn how to market her technology to consumers. She is now equipped with the tools to take her discovery and bring it into market.  Both of these women scientists are examples of the kind of innovation, the kind of economic engine, and the problem solving we need all Americans to participate in. That is what is at stake. That is why we are proposing this. This is not simply about having a poster with a diverse group of scientists to hang on the wall at the Air and Space Museum and inspire young people. That is important, but it is also important to build on the good work we have already done with the National Science Foundation--to really provide that equipment, those tools, those mentors, the training, and to take those lab discoveries, the basic R&D, and commercialize it.  I am very excited that we are reintroducing this bill.

5891,topic-id,1559,"Mr.President, I rise to recognize a pivotal moment in our Nation's history. On this day, 150 years ago, the Territory of Nebraska became the 37th State to enter the  Let me tell you the story of In a deep and powerful way, it is the story of America grew up in We were the first State admitted after the Civil War, but our admission was first vetoed by President Andrew It was the only time in American history that this had happened. The reason? President Johnson disagreed with a fundamental condition of Nebraska's statehood--that Black men be allowed to vote.  Fortunately, Congress overrode this veto, and on March 1, 1867, Nebraska became a I said before that Nebraska's statehood was a pivotal moment for our country. Nebraska gave America a chance to be better.  By bringing Nebraska into the Union, our country turned away from slavery forever. We turned toward the truth about humankind--that everyone is precious in Heaven's eyes. By making Nebraska a State, America reached for a future more closely aligned with that truth.  Since that new birth of freedom, our Nation has taken many more steps--some bold strides, some stumbles--but always we seek to be more fully the country we were made to be. At a crucial moment, Nebraska strengthened our commitment to do that. Nebraska renewed America's identity.  As a State, Nebraska had not only hard but also humble beginnings. They called it the Great American In the early 1800s, the famous military officer and explorer Zebulon Pike shrugged us off, saying simply: ``Not a stick of timber.'' A few years later, geologist Edwin James and MAJ Steven Long gave us this review: ``The land was uninhabitable by a people depending on agriculture.''  Today, wagon ruts can still be seen on Windlass Hill on the Oregon-California Trail, where settlers passed through. They were looking for greener pastures.  Well, last year Nebraska ranked 1 in the Nation in beef exports. The State ranked 1 in both the number of mother cows and cattle on feed. We are the beef We are Corn With both corn and cattle, we produce high quality protein products that are sought by consumers all around this globe. We are 1 in the Nation in great northern bean production, popcorn production, and irrigated acres of cropland. Nebraska agriculture is diverse and it is expansive.  We also have more miles of river than any other As we sit over the great High Plains in the Ogallala Aquifer, water flows to seven other States from Our abundant supply of groundwater makes us leaders in producing soybeans, wheat, pork, and grain sorghum.  But I am getting ahead of myself.  In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Homestead It made Americans really a simple offer: Strike out west, cultivate 160 acres of surveyed government land for 5 years, and at the end of that time, the land would be theirs. Families crossed the plains in covered wagons to take Mr.Lincoln up on that offer, and this time they stayed. In fact, the law's very first claimant was a doctor and a Civil War veteran named, fittingly enough, Daniel So powerful was his dream that Freeman filed his paperwork just a few minutes after midnight on New Year's Day, 1863, the day that law went into effect. His homestead lies just outside of Beatrice, NE, where today we find the Homestead National Monument of In this vast and ruthless land, the homesteaders made the American dream real. They tilled the earth, first to feed themselves and then to feed the world.  Nebraskans made the Great American Desert into one of the greatest agricultural exporting regions in world history. They did this in part by scientific discovery. Developments in agricultural technology, including the center pivot, pioneered in Nebraska, have allowed Nebraska ag producers to feed the world. Nebraska continues to lead the Nation in center pivot irrigation technology, and today we are home to the four largest irrigation companies in the United  Other technological breakthroughs came in transportation, especially rail. These developments helped us to connect our communities and our country. The route of the First Transcontinental Railroad runs through my Today, Bailey Yard in North Platte is the world's largest railroad classification yard. In addition, Nebraska now connects her families by 97,000 miles of public roads. Well, that is a far cry from those wagon ruts. These improvements allow us to continue that noble work which we gladly accept of feeding the world.  I would like to take a moment to reflect on something. Nebraska not only helped America find its moral compass again, but our State also shows what wonders a free and virtuous people may work, and it reveals the relationship between the two. When you seek the right thing first and you work at it hard, amazing things follow. This is true not only in our rural areas but also in our cities.  Omaha began as the ``Gateway to the West.'' Pioneers and immigrants made it a mighty city in its own right. From the former stockyards to the strong family businesses and Fortune 500 companies that you will find there today, the fingerprints of hardworking, dedicated people cover every inch of concrete.  Omaha leads in banking, insurance, telecommunications, transportation, and in medicine. Last year, the University of Nebraska Medical Center was ranked fifth in America among the best medical schools for primary care. I think Daniel Freeman, America's first homesteader, would be proud of that, but I doubt if he would be surprised. This is what happens when we work hard and let ourselves be guided by goodness.  It happened in Lincoln, our State capital, which was renamed after President Lincoln was assassinated. It happens in our Nebraska Panhandle towns and in our cities along the broad and braided Platte River, all along our I-80 corridor, and in so many rural small towns across our Nebraskans are a people who are engaged in manufacturing, technology, ag business, education, and the arts. We are strong people, and we build strong communities.  I have to say another word about doing the right thing. In 1879, Nebraska was the site of the first time that American Indians had their day in court, when Standing Bear made his famous statement: ``I am a Man.'' The U.district court eventually ruled what we all know to be absolute truth--that a person is a person. Here again, Nebraska gave America the opportunity to be better. There are many other moments.  Nebraska was the first State in which women were the two major party candidates for Governor, when Kay Orr, a Republican, defeated Helen Boosalis, a Democrat, in 1986.  I am on the Senate floor honoring the State I love on its 150th anniversary. I encourage you to come and see what the good life is about. See our cities--their industry, their creativity, their culture--where our innovators work new wonders, so much so that we are now called Silicon Feel the thrill of Memorial Stadium, which becomes our third largest city on a game day. Shout ``Go Big Red'' and cheer on the Delight in our opera and ballet. Breathe in our small towns. Stop in at a family-run bakery. Have lunch at a local cafe. Enjoy some of the national food sensations that began in Nebraska: Kool-Aid, our Reuben sandwich, and, of course, runzas.  Enjoy local favorites, like kolache, kuchen, fried tacos, and pork chili. Enjoy a Nebraska rodeo. Ride out to our rural areas, where, as Poet Laureate Ted Kooser says, the ``pickup kicks its fenders off and settles back to read the clouds.'' Be awed by the vastness of Nebraska, which gives us perspective on things great and small. Learn from Chimney Rock, our western buttes, and the Pine Ridge, how to stand tall no matter the weather or the season of life. Be soothed by the Sandhills--the largest grass-covered sand dunes in the world and God's own cattle country. Find peace in the song of the Sandhills cranes. Take in the Central Flyway, where millions of migratory birds fly, including our State bird--the western meadowlark. See our gently rolling eastern hills. Canoe our[[Page S1522]]rivers, fish our trout streams, and relax on our lakes. Follow the trails that tell the story of our history and the roads that lead to a bright future.

5785,topic-id,572,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about the effort by my Republican colleagues to gut critical consumer privacy protections. Last week, the Senate voted 50 to 48 to allow internet service providers such as Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T to freely collect, share, and sell its customers' private information. Later today, the House will vote on the same measure.  Let's be clear what we are talking about here. From web browsing histories to app usage information, broadband providers have easy access to a whole lot of Americans' personal information. Comcast knows exactly what ails you when you visit WebMD's Symptom Checker or that you have recently experienced a major life event when you are browsing maternity clothes on target.com. They would like the ability to use or sell this information to target advertising toward you, and they would really like to use or sell this information without first having to ask your permission.  Now, for me, the interests of consumers in Minnesota, Texas, and across our country have always come before those of big corporations. That is why I have long championed an internet that is open, accessible, and protects Americans' fundamental rights to privacy. For most Americans, I don't think those are controversial ideas.  For example, I suggest that most if not all of us in the Senate believe in the importance of ensuring that Americans have access to affordable high-speed internet. It is one of those great issues on which Members on both sides of the aisle can agree. See, we all know that Americans' cable and broadband bills are too high. The Consumer Federation of America recently reported that the average American household spends about $2,700 a year for phone, TV, and Internet services. That is why it is so disappointing that instead of acting to make broadband more affordable and more accessible for Americans, my Republican colleagues have actually paved the way for multibillion-dollar companies to make even more money off of their consumers by monetizing some of the most intimate details of their lives. Make no mistake about it, this is purely and simply a corporate handout at the expense of Americans' privacy.  When the FCC voted to pass the broadband privacy rules, the broadband industry was quick to oppose and oppose loudly. In recent months, internet service providers have used their vast resources to lobby the FCC and my fellow lawmakers. If House Republicans heed their call, as my colleagues in the Senate have done, companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T will be free to sell their customers' personal information to the highest bidder, and importantly, they will do so without the oversight or regulation of either the Federal Communications Commission or the Federal Trade  For my part, I have long held that Americans have a fundamental right to privacy. We deserve both transparency and accountability from companies that have the capacity to trade on their private information. Should some people choose to leave their personal information in the hands of those companies, they certainly deserve to know that their information is being safeguarded to the greatest degree possible. I am going to keep fighting on behalf of consumers in Minnesota and across the country to secure these rights because I work for them and not the broadband industry.

5872,topic-id,4396,"Mr.President, before I begin my remarks on Judge Gorsuch, I just want to take a minute to talk about the chemical attack in  Words cannot describe these vicious attacks against civilians. We have all seen the horrific footage of the victims, many of whom were children. These are innocent men, women, and children who, through no fault of their own, are caught in the middle of a bloody civil war, stuck between a brutal regime, armed groups, and foreign powers. My heart goes out to the victims and their families.  The world has come together and unequivocally condemned these acts and their perpetrators. We must work together to find a path toward peace and stability in Syria, and the United States must take a leadership role in that effort.  Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme After meeting with the nominee, carefully reviewing his record, and questioning him during his confirmation hearing, I have come to the conclusion that elevating Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court's bench would merely guarantee more of the same from the Roberts Court--a sharply divided, already activist Court that routinely sides with powerful corporate interests over the rights of average  I think it is important to start by acknowledging just exactly how it is that Judge Gorsuch came to be before the Senate; namely, this body's failure to fulfill one of its core functions. Immediately following the death of Justice Scalia, in a move as cynical as it was irresponsible, Senate Republicans announced that they would not move forward with filling the vacancy until after the Presidential election. Before President Obama had even named a nominee, the majority leader said: ``The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.'' The only problem with the majority leader's reasoning was the American people did have a voice in the decision; they had voted to make President Obama the President of the United Nonetheless, Republican members of the Judiciary Committee gathered behind closed doors and vowed to defy the eventual nominee a hearing. Many Republicans refused to even meet with the nominee. They said it didn't matter who the President nominated; they said this was about principle.  But Senate Republicans had a difficult time justifying their obstruction--that is, until they decided to mischaracterize a speech delivered by former Judiciary Committee chairman Joe Biden in June of 1992. In that June of 1992 speech, then-Senator Biden discussed the possibility of a Supreme Court Justice resigning in an election year in order to ensure that a President of the same party could name a replacement. Under those circumstances, he said, the President should refrain from nominating a replacement and the Senate should not hold confirmation hearings until after the election.  My Republican colleagues seized upon this small portion of Senator Biden's speech and dubbed it the ``Biden rule.'' Chairman Grassley said the Senate ought to abide by the Biden rule, which he said holds that there are ``no presidential Supreme Court nominations in an election year.''  The majority leader said: ``As Chairman Grassley and I declared . . . the Senate will continue to observe the Biden Rule so that the American people have a voice in this momentous position.'' So in order to justify a truly unprecedented act of obstruction, my Republican colleagues pointed to the so-called Biden rule and said they were standing on principle. That was the principle. But my Republican colleagues chose to overlook a few important details.  First of all, the scenario Senator Biden described in his 90-minute speech was not the situation our country faced last year. No one strategically resigned last year. A Justice died. No one dies to game the system.  Second and most importantly, my Republican colleagues ignored the actual point that Senator Biden made in that speech. If they had bothered to read the entire speech--and I suspect they actually had--they would have found that further down, Senator Biden said--and this is important. This is what Senator Biden said in the speech used as the justification not to take up Merrick Senator Biden said in that speech, ``If the president [then George Bush] consults and cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections absent consultation, then his nominee may enjoy my support, as did Justices Kennedy and Souter.''  Allow me to dwell on that for a moment. Senator Biden said that if a Supreme Court vacancy arose during an election year and the President consulted with the Senate or, absent consultation, put forward a moderate, consensus candidate, that candidate[[Page S2374]]should enjoy the support of the Judiciary Committee's chairman. That is the Biden rule. That is the Biden rule.  If Senate Republicans had actually followed the Biden rule, we wouldn't be here today. Merrick Garland would be sitting on the Supreme Court bench.  Over the past few days, I have heard my Republican colleagues denounce Democratic opposition to Judge Gorsuch by claiming that there never has been a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. But if the shameful and unprecedented obstruction that Republicans used to effectively block President Obama from appointing a Supreme Court Justice wasn't a partisan filibuster, then I don't know what is.  Perhaps my Republican colleagues were concerned that President Obama would seek to replace Justice Scalia--a reliably conservative member of the Court--with a jurist whose view would place him or her on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum. That seems to be the concern that my good friend Senator Hatch expressed when he said:       [T]he President told me several times he's going to name a      moderate, but I don't believe him. [President Obama] could      easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man. He probably      won't do that because this appointment is about the election.      So I'm pretty sure he'll name someone the [Democratic base]      wants.  But as it turns out, in recognition of the forthcoming election and the Republican-controlled Senate, President Obama did exactly what then-Senator Biden said a President should do: He named a moderate, consensus candidate. He named Merrick  Judge Garland was supremely well qualified for the job. Here is a guy who was his high school's valedictorian, who attended Harvard on a scholarship, won clerkships with legal legends like Second Circuit Judge Henry Friendly and Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, and left a partnership at a prestigious law firm to become a Federal prosecutor during the George H.Bush administration. He later joined the Justice Department, where he prosecuted the men responsible for bombing the Oklahoma City Federal Building in 1995, and Merrick Garland kept in touch with the survivors' and the victims' families. That is the reason why one of the very first of three Republicans agreed to meet with Judge Garland--Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, a staunch conservative--because people of Oklahoma had such regard for Merrick  After Judge Garland was confirmed to the DC Circuit in 1997, he earned a reputation for working with his colleagues from across the ideological spectrum to identify areas of agreement and to craft strong consensus opinions, often by deciding a case on the narrowest grounds possible.  Judge Garland was the right choice at the right time. He wasn't a partisan warrior or a partisan political animal; he was a judge's judge, and everyone knew it. That is why my Republican colleagues had to hide behind new and misleading so-called rules in order to deny him a hearing and a vote.  Judge Gorsuch is no Merrick Judge Gorsuch is a creature of politics. That is not what Judge Gorsuch told me when I met him earlier this year. I asked Judge Gorsuch if he was bothered by the way the Senate treated Merrick He responded by telling me that he tries to stay away from politics. But documents that the Judiciary Committee received from the Department of Justice, including emails between Judge Gorsuch and Bush administration officials, show that Judge Gorsuch was very heavily involved in politics. A resume he sent to President Bush's political director in November 2004--back when Judge Gorsuch was looking for a job--detailed his work on Republican political campaigns dating back to 1976 and highlighted an award he received from Senate Republicans for his work to advance President Bush's judicial nominees. Ken Mehlman, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, later recommended Judge Gorsuch for a post at the Justice Department and described him as a ``true loyalist.''  Understand, being politically active or being a Republican is not a disqualifying characteristic in a Supreme Court nominee, at least not in my book, but Judge Gorsuch's resume is relevant here because, contrary to what he told me, his resume establishes that he is not just intimately familiar with politics; he knows the politics of the judicial nominations process and he knows it well. Let me explain why I think that is important.  During the campaign, then-Candidate Trump spoke openly about his litmus test and what kind of a judge he would appoint to fill Justice Scalia's seat on the He said that he would ``appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.'' During the final debate, he said, ``The justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent.''  Part of the reason that then-Candidate Trump could say that with such conviction is because he had already outsourced the job of coming up with a list of potential nominees to the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, both rightwing organizations. The groups produced a list of 21 conservative judges for then-Candidate Trump, a list that included Judge Presumably, the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation knew something about the judicial philosophy of the men and women who it had decided to include on that list, given Judge Gorsuch's previous work to push judicial nominees through the I am sure he knew a thing or two about the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, as well.  In fact, Judge Gorsuch first learned that he was under consideration for the vacancy from the Federalist Society's vice president, who was working with the transition team. Judge Gorsuch went on to interview with a host of other members of the transition team, including now-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Chief Strategist Stephen Weeks later, President Trump had officially nominated Judge Both Mr.Reince Priebus and Mr.Bannon appeared before rightwing activists at CPAC and talked about his nomination. Mr.Priebus told the crowd that Justice Gorsuch would bring about ``a change of potentially 40 years of law.'' He said: ``Neil Gorsuch represents . . . the type of judge that has the vision of Donald Trump, and [his nomination] fulfills the promise that he made to all of you,'' gesturing to a crowd of conservative activists.  So whether Mr.Priebus was suggesting that, if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would unsettle 40 years of precedent--like Roe v. Wade or Chevron--or whether he was suggesting that Judge Gorsuch would be a reliably conservative vote for the next 40 years, it seems clear to me that confirming Judge Gorsuch is central to President Trump's political agenda.  Now, my Republican colleagues would have you believe that nothing could be further from the truth. In their view, they say that judges call balls and strikes--nothing more, nothing less. Earlier this week, for example, Senator Cruz said: ``Conservatives understand that it is the role of a judge, and especially the role of a Supreme Court Justice, simply to follow the law.'' He said that Senate Republicans ``are not confirming someone who will simply vote with our team on a given issue.'' It is Democratic judges, according to Senator Cruz who, ``by and large view the process as achieving the result they want and view the process of adjudicating a case as a political process.''  Let me explain why I take issue with that. If my Republican colleagues truly believe that a judge's proper role is to call balls and strikes and to decide cases narrowly, they would have confirmed Merrick Garland, a judge with a proven track record of crafting consensus opinions built on narrow holdings. But a judge who calls balls and strikes isn't really what my colleagues want. Contrary to what Senator Cruz said, what my Republican colleagues want is a results-oriented judge. Why else would they hold open a seat on the Supreme Court bench? Why else would they turn to the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society for candidates? Why else would they trample on the traditions of the Senate? What my Republican colleagues really want is a judge who will vote with their team, and that is the judge they will get by confirming Neil That is what this is all about. That is what this is about.  Unlike Merrick Garland, Judge Gorsuch has little interest in reaching consensus or in citing cases narrowly.[[Page S2375]]Now, Judge Gorsuch took great pains to paint himself as a mainstream nominee. He pointed out that the Tenth Circuit ruled unanimously 97 percent of the time, and that he was in the majority 99 percent of the time, but that is not unusual, and it doesn't provide any insight into his approach to being a judge. After all, the Courts of Appeals are required to follow Supreme Court precedent in all circuits around the country, and the vast majority of their cases are decided unanimously.  So in order to really understand Judge Gorsuch's approach to deciding cases--in order to really understand how he views the law--it is critically important to look at the cases where he chose to write separate concurrences or dissents. These concurring and dissenting opinions offer the clearest window into how he really thinks. Judge Gorsuch tends to write a lot of concurring and dissenting opinions. Even when Judge Gorsuch agrees with the majority and joins their decision, he frequently writes his own concurrence, setting out his own views. Judge Gorsuch has done this 31 times, including writing two concurrences to majority decisions that he, himself, had written. That is not seeking out consensus. That is holding his nose to join a consensus opinion, and then writing separately in order to point the way to broader, more sweeping rulings that other courts might issue in future cases--other courts like the Supreme Court, which doesn't have to follow precedent, which he is now poised to join and where he will not be restrained by precedent.  Judge Gorsuch is a results-oriented judge, and his record demonstrates that he approaches cases with a very specific outcome in mind. Contrary to what my Republican colleagues would have you believe, he doesn't hide that judicial philosophy. Whether it is his concurrence in Hobby Lobby or his dissent in TransAm Trucking, Judge Gorsuch wears that philosophy on his sleeve. It only underscores a disturbing pattern: siding with corporate interests over average  That philosophy was on full display in the dissent that Judge Gorsuch wrote in TransAm It seems clear to me that Judge Gorsuch approached this case with a specific outcome in mind, which was siding with a company over a worker. And in order to just justify that outcome in his dissent, Judge Gorsuch twisted himself into a pretzel.  You may have heard this story, but I want to lay it out as efficiently as possible because I think it reveals a great deal about Judge Gorsuch's philosophy, and it helps to explain exactly why I am voting against him. In this case, trucker Alphonse Maddin is driving a rig on the interstate through He is pulling a long trailer that is fully loaded. He makes a stop. He takes a break. Then, at 11 p.m., he is about to pull back onto the interstate, but discovers that the brakes on his trailer are locked. It is 14 below zero out. These brakes are literally frozen. So he calls his dispatcher to ask for repairs. And he waits.  While he is waiting, the heater in his cab stops working, and he falls asleep and is awakened by a call from his cousin. When Maddin sits up to answer the phone, he realizes that his torso is numb, and that he can't feel his feet. He is having trouble breathing. His cousin later says that Maddin's voice is slurred, and he wasn't tracking. According to the Mayo Clinic, these are all symptoms of hyperthermia. Maddin calls into the dispatcher again. He is told to hang on. He says: I can't. His boss tells him he has two choices, wait there until the repair truck comes, or he can take the whole rig on the road, including the trailer with frozen brakes. Those are the two options he is given by his boss. Maddin knows that if he waits, he may very well freeze to death. That is his first option, or he can go out on the interstate at 2 o'clock in the morning, dragging a fully-loaded trailer with frozen brakes at 10, maybe 15 miles per hour max, posing a safety hazard to other drivers at the interstate. Remember, it is 2 o'clock in the morning. It is dark. It is probably icy. Imagine a car going 80, 85 miles per hour--as people do at 2 o'clock in the morning on an interstate--coming up over a hill behind that rig, and then coming down and seeing this rig going 10 or 15 miles per hour, where you are going 80, 85. That would be like suddenly coming down on a stopped tractor trailer while you are going 70 miles per hour. That is his second option.  Instead, Maddin does what any of us would do. He unhitches the trailer and drives down the interstate to find someplace warm, and he does get warm. Then he returns to the trailer when the repair truck finally shows up, and he is fired. He is fired for abandoning his cargo. Now, there is a law to protect people in Maddin's situation. So he files a case. When it gets to the Tenth Circuit, a three-judge panel agrees with him, with They find that the trucking company shouldn't have fired Mr.Maddin, but one judge dissented--Judge Neil  So during my question, I asked Judge Gorsuch a very simple question: What he would have done if he had been the truck driver; if he had been driving that truck. I asked: Which would you have chosen? What would you have done? And here is Judge Gorsuch's response: ``Oh, Senator, I don't know what I would have done if I were in his shoes.''  Now, is there anyone here who would not have done what that driver did? I don't think so. Of course, you would unhitch the trailer and find someplace warm as quickly as possible--of course. But Judge Gorsuch said he didn't know what he would have done? Is that possible?  I asked him if he had even thought about what he would have done if he were You know, he had heard the case. He did not answer. So I asked him again. I asked him, given the choices of sitting there and possibly freezing to death or going on the road with an unsafe vehicle, or doing what Mr.Maddin did, and Judge Gorsuch responded: Senator, I don't know. I was not in the man's shoes.  Judge Gorsuch said he decides cases based on the facts and the law alone. ``I go to the law,'' he said. But so, in fact, did the majority. Here is the operable law. Here is the law: ``A person may not discharge an employee who refuses to operate a vehicle because the employee has reasonable apprehension of serious injury to the employee or the public because of the vehicle's hazardous safety or security condition.''  The majority ruled that the company could not fire the truckdriver because he had refused to operate the rig, the entire rig, because it was unsafe. But Judge Gorsuch said no. While operating the cab, he was operating the vehicle. Therefore, he did not refuse to operate a vehicle.  Judge Gorsuch said he made that decision by applying the plain meaning rule. I pointed out that the plain meaning rule has an exception: ``When using the plain meaning rule would create an absurd result, courts should depart from the plain meaning.'' It is absurd to say that this company was within its rights to fire him because he refused to choose between possibly dying by freezing to death or possibly killing other people by driving a semi on an interstate at 10 miles an hour at 2 in the morning. Frankly, the company is fortunate that Mr.Maddin made the choice he made because otherwise they may very well have faced a wrongful death claim.  Everyone who was in the hearing knows what Judge Gorsuch would have done in Alphonse Maddin's situation. If Judge Gorsuch had answered honestly, he would have said that he would have done exactly, exactly what the driver did. Everyone would. Judge Gorsuch just did not want to admit it. That is because there is no good answer.  If Judge Gorsuch said that he would do the very same thing that Mr.Maddin did, that would make his dissent look pretty bad. But if he had said ``I would have done what the company told me to do,'' that would be an absurd answer. That would make you question the man's judgment. No one would believe it. So, instead, Judge Gorsuch said: I don't know what I would have done. But of course he did. He just was not being honest. Judge Gorsuch approached Mr.Maddin's case with an outcome in mind, siding with the corporation, and the dissent that he wrote makes that perfectly clear.  When I joined the Senate back in 2009, I arrived here in June, a little later than the rest of my class. Just a few days later, my fifth day in office, Judge Sonia Sotomayor appeared before the Judiciary Committee for her[[Page S2376]]first day of her confirmation hearings for the Supreme I have been thinking a lot about Justice Sotomayor's hearings because the concern I expressed about the direction of the Court back then is just as relevant as today. Back then, almost 8 years ago, I voiced concern about it becoming more difficult for Americans seeking a level playing field to defend their rights and get their day in court, from bringing a discrimination claim to protecting their right to vote.  Back then, I said: ``I am wary of judicial activism and I believe in judicial restraint. Yet looking at recent decisions on voting rights, campaign finance reform, and . . . other topics, . . . there are ominous signs that judicial activism is on the rise.''  That was my first opening statement, the first opening statement that I ever delivered at the first confirmation hearing that I ever attended. But in the years that followed, my concerns have proved to be justified in one 5-to-4 decision after another. We have seen the Roberts Court go out of the way to answer questions not before it, to overturn precedents, to strike down laws enacted by Congress, and to do all of this at great cost to consumers and to workers and to small businesses and to middle-class  In decisions such as Shelby County, the Court gutted one of our landmark civil rights laws, 5 to 4. During the oral argument, Justice Scalia suggested that when the Voting Rights Act had last been passed 97 to 0 in the Senate, the Senate had done it because of the name of the Voting Rights How could you vote against the Voting Rights Act? What a great name. He was showing contempt for this body. What is more judicially active than overturning a law voted on unanimously in the Senate because the Senate just liked the name?  Of course what that did was get rid of preclearance. What is preclearance? Preclearance said that those States that had a history of suppressing the votes of minorities had to preclear any new voting law with the Justice  These were States that had a history of suppressing the votes of racial minorities. Well, that gets overturned. States like North Carolina, Texas, start passing new laws--voter ID laws. The second section of the Voting Rights Act still stayed, so you could appeal to a Federal court. But it takes a while to work its way through.  So finally, in early 2016, a circuit court, the Fourth Circuit I believe, ruled that North Carolina had targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision to suppress their votes. That is why you have preclearance. That is why you want preclearance. But in a 5-to-4 vote, preclearance was struck down. That is one 5-to-4 case. Concepcion, a 5-to-4 decision, allows corporations to force consumers into mandatory arbitration. There are a whole host of 5-to-4 decisions that make it impossible for people to get into the courts.  But the most egregious of all 5-to-4 decisions was Citizens United--another 5-to-4 decision that paved the way for individuals and outside groups to spend unlimited sums of money in our elections.  In each one of those 5-to-4 decisions Justice Scalia sided with the majority. So now this body considers replacing him with Judge I think it is important to understand the extent to which he shares Justice Scalia's views. Judge Gorsuch's record demonstrates that he is, in President Trump's words, a judge very much in the mold of Justice  During his time on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has consistently ruled in favor of powerful interests. He has sided with corporations over workers, corporations over consumers, and corporations over women's health.  A study published in the Minnesota Law Review found that the Roberts Court is the most pro-corporate Supreme Court since World War If the Senate confirms him, Judge Gorsuch guarantees more of the same from the Roberts Court, and I do not believe that is a Court that our country can continue to afford.  So I oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination. I urge my colleagues to take a close look at his record of siding with powerful corporate interests over average Americans, to consider carefully how he stands to impact the Court, and to reject his nomination.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Kennedy). The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

5696,topic-id,911,"Mr.Speaker, every time I have the privilege of addressing this body, I am reminded of[[Page H2579]]how lucky we all are to live in a country where I am free to speak my mind without fear of retribution or retaliation. It is one of the great privileges of being an Yet for far too many around the world, freedom of conscience is still a distant dream.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in Russia, where Vladimir Putin's thuggish regime has poisoned the promise of the post-Soviet era and day by day has slid Russia back into the dark shadows of autocracy. Just last Sunday, thousands of Russians took to the streets and squares in protest of the Kremlin's corruption. And in return, Russian police arrested hundreds of protesters, including Vladimir Putin's political challenger, Alexei  But the Putin regime's barbarity isn't just a polite policy difference. Russians of exceptional courage are dying, including as recently as last week, as the regime cultivates an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.  Vladimir Putin's campaign of murder is not limited to domestic political opponents. Like all dictators, Putin seeks to rally his nation's support by channeling public fear and anger against external enemies. Time and again, first in Georgia, then in Ukraine, and now in Syria, Vladimir Putin has warned us exactly who he is. As recent as last night, the commander of CENTCOM announced that Russia is likely providing support to the Taliban in  Mr.Speaker, I am afraid we have exhausted our warnings. Russian aggression, if left unchecked, may soon cross a line past which there is no return.  You see, what Vladimir Putin wants is fundamentally at odds with American interests. After the Second World War, America laid the foundation for a new and better world, drawn together by common values and forged from the fires of war. We did this not just because we are a generous people but because we are a wise people.  Farsighted American statesmen realized that creating the architecture for peace in Europe was a far better investment than returning to isolationism and then one day having to pay the butcher's bill, as we did twice during the first half of the 20th century.  As Europe is changing, Vladimir Putin dreams of restoring the Soviet Union's prestige and power, and his ultimate goal is clear: the end of the postwar-American project in Europe and the return of power politics unencumbered by the rules of the road that we established to our benefit in concert with our allies.  And so the stakes, in my mind, could not be any higher. If we do not stand up to Putin now, his aggression will continue until one day he goes too far. On that day, we may face an unimaginable choice between war or the destruction of the NATO alliance. And whichever we choose, we will have lost.  Despite Putin telling us exactly who he is, I have heard some say we should try to work with Russia to find areas of common ground. Yet we have seen firsthand how the last administration's reset has not led to better relations but to a tide of Russian aggression.  I do not believe Putin desires war with the United What he desires is the fruits of conquest without the cost. He holds the cards of a bluffer, and he is gradually raising the stakes in an effort to get us to fold. Fortunately, it is the U.S., not Russia, who holds the stronger hand. We cannot, and we must not, give Putin the acquiescence he requires to succeed in his plot to overturn the world we created.  When it comes to Russia's interference in our elections, we must put the country and the sanctity of our democracy far above partisan interests. For any American to collaborate against our own government with a government that seeks to undermine our country would, indeed, be nothing short of treasonous. But I call on my Democrat friends to resist the urge to treat this critical issue as nothing more than an opportunity to score political points.  And I call on my fellow Republicans to unwaveringly pursue investigations into efforts by Vladimir Putin to undermine our democracy, wherever they may lead.  I will close with this, Mr.In our twilight struggle against the clouds of dictatorship, we must maintain what the former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky calls moral clarity. Sharansky contrasts free societies with fear societies, where citizens live in perpetual unease. While even free societies are not perfect, they must never play into the hands of fear society propagandists who assert the dubious sense of moral relativism.  After all of these years, we are still Ronald Reagan's America--a light on a hill shining brightly as a beacon for all mankind. There is no moral equivalence between the United States and any society based upon fear, let alone Vladimir Putin's  American exceptionalism remains buried deep in all our bones. We are not just a free society; we are the model free society. Our values and our deeds will endure long after each of us in this Chamber is gone.  Mr.Speaker, the conflict before us is a simple one: we cannot fall prey to false equivalencies or fail to recognize our adversaries for who they are. Let us steel ourselves today in this Chamber and rise to stop Mr.Putin's aggression in its tracks, both against our own Nation and against those who have proven themselves to be our closest friends and allies.

5789,topic-id,1360,"Mr.President, I wanted to come to the floor again to express my strong support for a very mainstream, well-qualified nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil  Last week, this country got to watch the Senate Judiciary Committee carry out days of hearings that questioned and probed Judge Gorsuch's legal approach, that questioned his temperament to the bench, his suitability to be on our Nation's High I believe every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee had at least an hour to question Judge Gorsuch, to provide lengthy opening statements, to have an extended period of time to have a back-and-forth with Judge Gorsuch in order to go over his judicial philosophy--his approach--that he would take with him from the Tenth Circuit Court to the Nation's High  A number of interest groups and personal witnesses were talking about whether or not they believe Judge Gorsuch is qualified for the bench, and some were highly favorable and spoke very highly of him, and others opposed his confirmation. That is what is great about this country--to be able to come before our Congress, our government, and to testify for or against somebody who will be in that third important branch of government, the judicial branch. It is incredibly inspiring to watch this process unfold. There were student groups around the country, classes and teachers, who were watching the confirmation hearing as a project, as an educational experience, as a lesson in civics, democracy, and government.  I mentioned, of course, that Judge Gorsuch is a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court today. He is a fourth generation He was confirmed to that position in 2006, 11 years ago, unanimously. He was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court 11 years ago unanimously. Based on some of the comments we have heard opposing Judge Gorsuch, it is hard to believe that anybody would have supported him unanimously 11 years ago--based on the things we have heard from the other side of the aisle about him. Judge Gorsuch was confirmed unanimously by 12 current Democratic Senators who did not oppose his confirmation 11 years ago and who serve in this body today.  Twelve Democratic Senators serve in this Chamber today who agreed with his confirmation or didn't oppose his confirmation 11 years ago. In fact, not a single Democrat opposed his nomination--not a single one, and his nomination was unanimous--not Minority Leader Schumer, not Senator Leahy, not Senator Feinstein, not Senator Durbin, not Senator Cantwell, not Senator Carper, not Senator Menendez, not Senator Murray, not Senator Nelson, not Senator Reid, not Senator Stabenow, and not Senator Judge Gorsuch's nomination also was not opposed by then-Senator Barack It was not opposed by then-Senator Joe Biden, and it was not opposed by then-Senator Hillary  This level of support for the other party's nomination is almost unheard of in today's political climate. But now, these very same colleagues are vowing to break 230 years of Senate tradition, to dispense with 230 years of precedent, and to join a partisan filibuster of a nominee who has the right judicial temperament and holds mainstream views that are supported by the  Throughout the confirmation hearing process, we heard Judge Gorsuch talk about the over 2,000 opinions that he was a part of--2,700 decisions that he was a part of--and I believe he testified before the committee that he joined in the majority in 97 percent of those opinions. That is somebody who sounds to me like the person who could have received the unanimous support of the Senate--who did receive the unanimous support of the Senate, including colleagues who serve with us today.  But, unfortunately, across the aisle, we still haven't heard a reason articulated--a compelling rationale--for why this supremely qualified nominee should be opposed. Sometimes they will reference a letter from a law student at the University of Colorado, or perhaps they will find one case out of the 2,700 cases that tugs at the heartstrings but not at the law and try to hang their hat on that decision as to why they should oppose Judge To use a baseball analogy, it is a little bit like a batting average. You would think that a professional baseball player that had a 400 batting average was a pretty doggone good baseball player, but that would mean they missed the ball a heck of a lot much of the time. It seems to me the argument they are making with Judge Gorsuch is that unless he had a perfect batting average and never missed a single pitch and had a hit every single time--that is the standard, apparently, that our colleagues are looking for. It is a standard that no one has ever met in this country before.  We are looking for mainstream judges with the right temperament and the right philosophy, and that is what Judge Gorsuch has proven time and again in the Tenth Circuit Court--that temperament that we need on the highest  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle should abandon their threats of a filibuster and allow an up-or-down vote to occur for Judge It is what Senate tradition and precedent requires.  Today, though, I thought it important to talk about Judge Gorsuch's exceptionally strong record on religious liberty. Judge Gorsuch is perhaps widely known for his participation in the Tenth Circuit's Hobby Lobby case, a decision which involved the protections afforded by the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act and which was ultimately affirmed by the Supreme In his concurrence, Judge Gorsuch made a number of telling pronouncements regarding religious liberty. Regarding the case, he wrote that the law in question requires the owners of Hobby Lobby to ``violate their religious faith by forcing them to lend an impermissible degree of assistance to conduct their religion teaches to be gravely wrong.''  Let me say that again. In Hobby Lobby, Judge Gorsuch wrote that the law requires the owners of Hobby Lobby to ``violate their religious faith by forcing them to lend an impermissible degree of assistance to conduct their religion teaches to be gravely wrong.''  In determining which religious beliefs are entitled to protection, Judge Gorsuch said it doesn't matter if the beliefs are contestable or even offensive. It only matters if they are sincerely held--if they are sincerely held.  He went on to stress that ``it is not the place of courts of law to question the correctness or the consistency of tenets of religious faith, only to protect the exercise of faith.''  It is these same constitutional principles of religious liberty that Judge Gorsuch has also used to protect religious minorities and prison inmates.  In Yellowbear v. Lampert, Judge Gorsuch ruled that a Native American prisoner was entitled to the use of a prison sweat lodge under Federal law.[[Page S2032]]  Judge Gorsuch went on to stress that while prisoners give up many liberties, the freedom to sincerely express their religion is not one of them. His reasoning was later adopted by the Supreme Court to extend similar religious liberty protections to a Muslim prisoner. Judge Sotomayor even quoted the opinion of Judge Gorsuch in her concurrence in that case.  From his opinions, it is clear that Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream nominee who understands the importance of putting personal beliefs aside and applying the law as written. This is why George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley argued that Judge Gorsuch shouldn't be penalized for his past opinions. As he said, ``the jurisprudence reflect, not surprisingly, a jurist who crafts his decisions very close to the text of a statute and, in my view, that is no vice for a federal judge.''  It is for the reasons I have cited today and for the reasons we have seen over the past week that I am certain Judge Gorsuch will make Colorado proud and that his decisions will have a positive impact on the Supreme Court and this country for generations to come.  I look forward to working with my distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle to expeditiously confirm his nomination and to make sure that we uphold the best traditions and the precedent of this  Mr.President, thank you.

5770,topic-id,4527,"Mr.Speaker, it has been an interesting few weeks here in Washington, and we are not done with healthcare legislation. There has been a lot of talk about that, but, Mr.Speaker, I would like to say, I have been encouraged as today has worn on. We had a tough family meeting this morning together as Republicans, but, to me, what I felt was coming out of it in the end--disagreement on some important issues but agreement among Republicans that people are hurting under  People need relief from the high premiums, the high deductibles. So many people not only lost their doctor, lost their health insurance policy, but they can't afford--they tell us--to go to the doctors. We talked to constituents because they would have to get to several thousand dollars before the insurance portion would kick in.  People are hurting across the country, and, of course, we know that, without a single Republican vote, ObamaCare was passed, which cut Medicare by $716 billion dollars, with a ``B.'' And I know President Obama assured seniors: look, seniors, you know, you are not going to have to worry about this $716 billion in cuts to You won't be able to tell the difference. This is only going to affect the doctors, the healthcare providers.  What seniors have noticed who I have talked to around Texas and in other places in the country, they have noticed that when Medicare doesn't pay their doctor, doesn't pay for tests that are needed, and doesn't pay for medication that they specifically need then it does affect them personally.                              {time}  1915  The bill that we took up, that didn't get passed on Friday, that we didn't vote on, there was nothing that was going to help those on There is apparently some difference of opinion, but it appeared to many that some of us trusted that people between the ages of 50 to 64 were going to get hammered.  I am very encouraged to have seen Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy, Whip Steve Scalise, and our Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry incredibly busy today talking to Republican Members around the House about how we can get to a bill that will get 218--actually we need 216 right now--so that we can send it down the hall to the  Mr.Speaker, I am encouraged, and I hope others are, that we are not done. We had indications that the Senate was not going to take up the bill--even if we passed it on Friday, they were not going to take it up until sometime in So we have time to address this issue and come together on a bill that would pass.  Once again, a reference was made, Mr.Speaker--and it is so often that this event is referenced by Republicans when they get frustrated as to why we ended up with a bill that would require so many Republican arms to be twisted, that would endanger Republican seats to have to vote for it. People referenced back to this.  Remember some years back, some summers back--and I believe, actually, that was the last week of July of 2014, as I recall--in which Speaker Boehner had told us that he had cobbled together a bill that embraced 10 principles that every Republican in the House had agreed to. Some of them seemed a bit esoteric to me, but we agreed to them all. And we kept being told this is going to be a bill that embraces all the principles that all of us have agreed to.  So when the bill was finally filed on Tuesday evening, with Speaker Boehner having announced we were going to vote on it Thursday morning, for the first time, we got a look at the bill we were going to be voting on. By the time Thursday morning came rolling around, there had been so much information that came out--not opinion, but actually verbiage from the bill. It seems like it was around 60 pages, 70[[Page H2512]]pages, somewhere around there--but people were able to see for themselves what was there. There was so much commotion made about it that, by Thursday morning, much like Friday, Republicans made clear to our leadership--at that time Speaker Boehner--that they couldn't vote for it; that it didn't embody the 10 principles that we had all embraced.  I was so proud of my Republican Conference that Thursday because particularly a number of young Members, newer Members, got up in our emergency conference that they asked for. Speaker Boehner said: Well, I guess we just go on home and have the August recess.  Numerous Members said: No; let's have an emergency conference. Let's talk about this. We need to do something. We need to pass a good bill.  So people got up and they pointed out, like in a good family: Look, we have got differences, but we can reach agreement on this.  And there were probably 20 or so of us in a room for 2\1/2\ hours or so, and we compromised, and we got a bill that we could all vote on.  Unfortunately, at that time, there was a Democratic majority in the Senate, and we didn't get our bill passed through the Senate, but we showed that it could be done.  Once again, after Friday's problems, there are Members that are saying: Remember when we did that, where we just got people in a room and we agreed?  Mr.Speaker, I do believe, knowing so many of the Tuesday Group so well--they are good people--and the number one concern they have is their constituents and the things they are hearing from their constituents because they ran and they got elected to help people.  Everybody that I hear from on our side understands people have got to have help because ObamaCare is creating so many problems. I am hearing from many seniors, and it seems to be as a result of all of the $700-plus billion that Obama cut from  Whereas, 7 or 8 years ago, even 6 years ago, before ObamaCare really started being implemented, if they needed surgery, if they needed something, under Medicare, the doctors immediately took care of it. If it was medication, if it was a treatment, if it was surgery, whatever, they took care of it.  I am hearing more and more east Texans who are on Medicare tell me: Now, doctors are telling me they can't schedule it this week or next week like they used to because of ObamaCare; that the only way they can make ends meet and still stay in business, they need to schedule it a couple of months down the road.  Many of us on the Republican side were pointing out, when ObamaCare passed, that what this leads to is a form of rationed care. Whereas, right now, if you have good insurance and you like your doctor and you need something done, it gets done immediately. That is what made America's medical care so attractive to other countries around the world.  I have visited in Middle Eastern and north African countries where the wealthy would say: If I needed surgery done, I'd fly to the United Unfortunately, I have heard more than once that: Yeah, and the great thing was that I flew back and never had to pay for it.  Well, somebody paid for that, that is for sure.  It is important that we fix our healthcare system as best we can. I have an article from Conservative Review that came out today from Daniel I don't agree with everything in the article; but Daniel Horowitz, as usual, is quite thought-provoking.  He says: ``Earlier today, a couple of Republican officials, in a refreshing display of honesty, admitted what we have known all along: They don't want to repeal Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican from Kentucky, admitted there won't be another attempt.  ``He's certainly come a long way from his 2014 campaign promise to repeal ObamaCare `root and branch' and his 2013 CPAC speech in which he said `anybody who thinks we've moved beyond it is dead wrong.'  ``As we explained yesterday, the compromise solution for repealing the core of ObamaCare, but not quite all of it, is already on the table, and Paul Ryan, Republican from Wisconsin, has already agreed to and campaigned on it. Why aren't they doing it? Because they don't want to repeal ObamaCare and never intended to.''  That is the part I do disagree with.  I know we have all said this, but it was in Speaker Boehner's pledge that he and his leadership colleagues cobbled together back in 2010 and it was in the Better Way that Speaker Ryan and his leadership colleagues cobbled together last fall that we have got to repeal We can't get down to this rationed care system where we are currently headed.  This says: ``As early as 2014, the Chamber of Commerce made it clear that their official position was to fix, not repeal Money talks, everything else from there walks.  ``The sentiment was evident today when Senator John Cornyn, Republican from Texas, the Senate majority whip, said that they will no longer pursue repeal of ObamaCare through budget reconciliation and that `it needs to be done on a bipartisan basis, and so we're happy to work on it with Democrats if we can find any who are willing to do so.'  ``There you have it, folks. They know darn well there are no Democrats who will ever have incentive to work with them to repeal They have always known that this had to be done unilaterally either through reconciliation or by blowing up the filibuster. But Republicans never intended to do so. That's why we heard all these phony excuses about process limitations. Now that they are proven false, Cornyn is at least being honest by saying they will repeal it when Democrats help them. When hell freezes over . . .''  And the article goes on.  Mr.Speaker, what Leader McConnell and Senator Cornyn are talking about, I think they must have been discouraged when the House didn't pass a bill that would come their way. But good news for Leader McConnell and Senator Cornyn, we are not done. People are hurting, and we are going to come together on a bill.  For those who attempted to say that those in the Freedom Caucus kept moving the goalposts, I know that was not said maliciously, but it was said. Anyone who said that was speaking just out of ignorance of what actually was the case.  Anybody that bothers to actually check and get the facts will find that, as many problems as people in the Freedom Caucus--and I am probably the newest member, I guess--had with this bill, we were doing what we could to reach a compromise that would give enough help, enough relief to Americans who are desperate for that help and that relief that we could hold our nose and vote for it.  There were all kinds of issues in that bill that create problems. For one thing, I would have thought a good amendment that would easily be accepted would be that, since this creates a new entitlement program, a tax credit program where you actually can get more money back--like a child tax credit, where we have so many people who are actually illegally in the country, claiming children, as there have been reports--and, of course, not everybody cheats on this. But there are numerous examples of stories around the country of people claiming to have children--mass numbers, dozens of them in the same house, and we don't know if they are in the country, we don't know if they are in another country, we don't know if they exist--and people getting more and more money back.  I had a senior citizen from Tyler telling me she is no longer working for H&R Block, that she used to during tax season. But it just grated on her so much that it created tension headaches and she couldn't sleep during tax season because she had so many people who did not have a Social Security number. But they got a tax number, and she would fill out the returns for them. Invariably, each would pull out a sheet of paper and would say: Don't I get this?  And it was the income tax credit--child earned credit.  She would fill it out, as they requested. And, invariably, they would get much more money back than they paid in. So it was a way of redistributing--it is not wealth, because the people that are in east Texas paying[[Page H2513]]those taxes, they are not wealthy. They are struggling to get by. That is why they can't afford the high deductibles that ObamaCare has driven them to.  Here it looks like we are going to have another program unless we get this amendment in there when we bring the bill back up.                              {time}  1930  So I am hoping that that will be one of the adjustments because we were seeking to have something in there to require you to be legally in this country before you could get more money back from your income tax than you paid in. It is a new form of welfare, just like some have found the tax credit to be, where they get more back than they paid in.  So that is a concern, creating a new entitlement as we are about to go over the $20 trillion mark in debt, that we are coming up with a new way to go even deeper and quicker into further debt. But there were a number of issues here with the bill.  The thing that I kept hearing--and I had telephone townhalls, Mr.Speaker, with, really, tens of thousands of people that we reached out to in east The technology is so great, I can ask questions and have them punch a number for yes, no, and get results on what people are thinking. It was feelings about ObamaCare and the need to do something about it and the help that is needed and the losses of insurance they had before ObamaCare, problems they have had since  East Texans, my constituents, need help. They want help. They want ObamaCare repealed, and they want a system back where they can choose their doctor, they have a relationship with their doctor, and they don't have an insurance company between them and their doctor or their hospital telling them what they can or can't have. And they don't want the government in between them and their healthcare provider telling them what they can or cannot have.  The health savings accounts that Republicans believe strongly could get us off this final road to complete rationed care, socialized medicine, like they have in England--it was a pleasure to talk to the sister of a member of Parliament from I have been in his home in England; he has been in my home in Tyler, Texas, just a great  But talking about our systems, and I pointed out, I have a wife, I have got three adult daughters, and so I am kind of sensitive to being pushed into a system like England has, no offense to those in But when we saw the numbers back during the ObamaCare debate that indicated a 19 percent higher survivability rate from the same point of breast cancer being discovered, well, that is one out of five are dying in England unnecessarily, or at least back there when we got those numbers. I am not sure what the numbers are now.  It may be that ObamaCare has created more problems and now we are moving, already, toward the percentages of recovery that England had that were not as good as ours. But I would just as soon not lose one out of five women who have breast cancer, which we were not losing in the U.and they were losing in  It was interesting. I didn't realize, and I learned yesterday that, actually, that is why, in England, yes, they have socialized medicine, but you can also pay for private care on top of the socialized medicine because it just takes forever to get the kind of treatment that you need when you need it. So people with any means in England, they have the socialized medicine that is so inefficient, that tax funds pay for so inefficiently, and you get as much government as you do health care. But, if you have money, then, on top of the massive taxes you pay, you can also, then, pay for your own health care on top of that. That is different from  But, look, the bottom line is we don't need to continue down this route. So, again, I am encouraged we are going to come together and we are going to work toward a remedy.  It disturbed me that we heard from people who sounded like they knew what they were talking about, that rates are going to go up for a couple of years, and we are hoping that maybe 3 years after the Republicans would lose the majority in the next election because people are so upset about their higher premiums that then it might come down, premiums might come down 10 percent.  But the concern to me is not about losing the majority. It is about losing Americans unnecessarily if we don't fix this disastrous ObamaCare that is costing seniors. It is costing 50- to 64-year-olds. It is costing young people money that they shouldn't have to spend in the way that they are being required.  So some say we were moving the goalposts as the House Freedom Caucus, but, actually, from the beginning, we did indicate we would like to remove what experts are telling us in title I would dramatically bring down the cost of premiums very quickly--very quickly.  But we had agreed. Heck, we agreed with the Democrats, before they pushed through ObamaCare, let's work on a law together, bipartisan, that will make sure that insurance companies can't play games over preexisting conditions because it has resulted in unfairness and, at times, I can say as a former judge, actually, fraud. Let's work on that one.  Then I think there was fairly universal agreement on both sides of the aisle here that, if you are 26, you are still living with your parents, then you ought to be able to be on their health insurance. From my standpoint, I didn't even care. I didn't think we actually even needed an age, a cutoff age.  If you are 50 and you are still living with your parents, which we hope will soon be remedied by an economy turning around with a new President who knows how to get things going, but if you are still at home when you are 50, I don't have a problem. If you are still living with your parents, then you ought to be able to have a family insurance policy and be on it. So those were not problems.  I had a doctor friend back in east Texas who said I was a purist. I like him. He is a great guy. He apparently was a great surgeon. But I realized that, in his letter, he was speaking from a great deal of ignorance as he continued to point out things that simply weren't true, unless a purist is someone who says: I will vote for the bill, but you have got to give us something in the way of amendments to this bill that will help my constituents bring down the price.  Now, see, to me, that is not a purist because we were all willing to compromise in the Freedom Actually, in communicating with President Trump two different times, we thought we had an agreement. Then we would hear back from our leadership: You can't do that. Either there is a problem with the Parliamentarian and it puts the whole bill at risk, or, gee, you are going to lose votes from some other group.  But I still believe, as I did then, if we would get the intermediaries out of the way, that Republicans can come together, Tuesday, more moderate group, Freedom We can get people together like we did 3 years ago in We can get together and work out a compromise.  Now, to me, someone who agrees twice to a compromise that really bothers them is not the purist that I would expect, but then again, I guess it depends on your own personhood as to what you think is pure and what you think is not.  So, anyway, I appreciate very much, Mr.Speaker, the former Speaker, Newt Gingrich, pointing out yesterday that it is a good thing that this bill did not pass on Friday because we know, as Speaker Gingrich pointed out, in 1994, Democrats lost the majority in this room because they tried to push through We know that in 2010, Democrats lost the majority in this room because they had pushed through ObamaCare against the majority will of the American people.  As former Speaker Gingrich pointed out, if we had rammed through this bill and, for example, people didn't see premiums come down before the next election, we would justifiably lose the majority in this House, and there are some good people that are serving here that should not be defeated. They are doing the best they can.  But we can do better than where the bill stood on Friday, and I am very grateful to Speaker Ryan, to leader McCarthy, our whip, for working so hard today, reaching out, seeing them all over the place trying to work, talking with different ones of us. It is really encouraging, and I would hope, in[[Page H2514]]the future, that we will start those things, we will--yes, we appreciate all the listening sessions, but then, as happened too often under Speaker Boehner, somebody, we don't even know who--there were a couple of things that made me wonder: Who wrote this? Is this the insurance lobby? Where did this come from?  But bring the bill out and let us see it instead of telling every Republican: It is going to go through committee; and Democrats are going to have a million amendments and we have got to vote down every one of them; we don't want any Republican amendments; we are going to take it like it is.  Well, see, to some of us, that is not really regular order. Regular order is a chance to have amendments, and especially from people in the majority who see real problems with the bill.  So we can do that, and I look forward to doing that. And since we knew the Senate wasn't going to take it up until May sometime anyway, we have got time to do that.  Mr.Speaker, I hope you felt the same as I did hearing all across our Conference, people saying, look, this is important enough. We are going to have time where we go back to our districts between now and the middle of May when the Senate might take this bill up.  Let's make sure we don't go on recess, go back to our districts to have people scream at us because we hadn't passed something. Let's stay here, and let's get it done like we did 3 years ago on the border security bill.  But we have got a lot of work to do. There are serious problems with the bill. But we also now know, despite what some have represented, that, gee, we can't know what the Parliamentarians would say or recommend. It is great to know that the Parliamentarian in the Senate, actually, Assistant Parliamentarians work a great deal like our splendid Parliamentarian here.  If you are getting ready to file a bill or if you are thinking about an amendment, you can actually go to any one of our Parliamentarian or assistants, show them the language. They can't give an obligatory ruling, and they generally tell us when they advise us: This is what I think, how the rule would apply there, and you may want to tweak this or that.  They always have the caveat: But remember, I am the I don't rule on anything. All I would do, if I am allowed, or it is requested, I will whisper in the ear of the presiding--which, in the Senate, hopefully, would be Vice President  And, gee, the Byrd Rule is not that complicated. When you are under reconciliation, it needs to be about the budget. So, if anything that is amended or added to or part of the bill will materially affect the budget, it survives the Byrd Rule and it stays in. That is it.  The word in the Byrd Rule is ``incidental.'' It can't be just incidental or have an incidental effect on the budget. It has got to have a material effect; otherwise, it is considered extraneous.  Well, I would hope, knowing my friend, a former Member of the House here, former Conference chair, now Vice President, I would hope and certainly imagine if our friend, the Vice President, is in the presiding officer's chair in the Senate and a Democratic Senator stands up and says, ``I make a point of order because I believe this violates the Byrd Rule, where the House inserted a provision, you have to show that you are you lawfully in the U.in order to get the tax credit,'' well, there may be people that are so used to massive numbers here in Washington that they would say, well, those millions or tens or hundreds of millions, that may not be material, that may be only incidental.                              {time}  1945  I hope my friend, my Vice President, would understand that, to Americans, the kind of money we would be talking about is hard-earned and it is material to the budget. So what happens if the Vice President then rules--who is the President of the Senate--well, your point of order is overruled, it is not appropriate, it doesn't violate the Byrd rule. Well, then that same Democrat or another could jump up and say: I appeal the ruling of the char.  Then what happens?  Normally, a Republican would stand and move to table the appeal of the ruling of the And then there are far more than enough Republicans to vote to table the appeal of the ruling of the Chair, which means the ruling stands, nothing is fatal, and we get closer to a repeal of Even more important than that, we get closer to giving our constituents the help they really need.  So it has been a long few weeks. It was a very long conference, but I am encouraged, Mr.I hope that Americans end up encouraged. I am glad the bill didn't pass on Friday just as I was 3 years ago when the original de facto amnesty bill that Speaker Boehner tried to shove through. I think we can get to a good bill. I am looking forward to seeing that happen and working with my friends here to get it done.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2510.txt,1801,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,28.0,March

5751,topic-id,518,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.58. The purpose of the resolution under consideration is simple: reining in the Federal role in education and protecting State and local control promised to students, parents, and education leaders.  Under the Higher Education Act, teacher preparation programs are required to provide certain information to State leaders to help determine the effectiveness of those programs. The State then submits an annual report card to the Department of Education that highlights the quality of their teacher preparation programs. Additionally, the Higher Education Act provides TEACH Grants to high-achieving students who commit to teaching math, science, reading, or a foreign language at high-needs schools. To ensure taxpayer dollars are being used responsibly, the law requires that grant recipients attend an institution that provides high-quality teacher preparation and professional development services.  In 2012, the Obama administration began a rulemaking process to develop Federal criteria for State teacher preparation report cards. For the first time, and without congressional authorization, the rule that came out of that process tied eligibility for TEACH Grants to the State's teacher preparation report card. That flawed and controversial rule is the reason we are here today.  We all agree that accountability is important, particularly when it comes to ensuring our students receive the high-quality education they deserve. However, it is also important that State and local leaders have the flexibility they need to make decisions that affect the schools and programs in their local communities.  Teacher preparation should be addressed through reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, not unilaterally by executive fiat. That is exactly what the Obama administration did by forcing its one-size-fits-all approach to education on teacher preparation programs. The rule requires States to track new teachers across three performance levels: student learning outcomes, employment outcomes, and employer surveys. In doing so, it essentially creates a Federal mandate for teacher evaluations that Congress explicitly rejected with the Every Student Succeeds The regulation assumes the Federal Government knows better than local education leaders when it comes to what makes an effective teacher. And to make matters worse, it will also result in fewer teachers opting to teach students in low-income neighborhoods and schools.  Teachers play an important role in helping students learn and succeed both in and out of the classroom. Unfortunately, as it did so often, the Obama administration overreached and took a flawed approach to preparing teachers to meet the needs of their students. The teacher preparation rule blatantly ignores the principles guiding recent bipartisan education reforms and will make it more difficult for State and local leaders to help ensure teachers are ready to succeed.  The resolution under consideration, H.58, will block the implementation of this misguided policy and protect State and local control over decisions affecting their teachers and students. The Federal Government has played too large a role in education for far too long. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this resolution and help rein in the Federal Government's role in education.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

We are not changing the report card that schools have that teacher preparation programs have to provide.  This rule says that if a school doesn't score well on its report card then students in that program can't get TEACH grants, which tries to focus on getting teachers from teacher programs into challenging schools. So what happens is, if you are an outstanding student and you are trapped in a school, let's say, because where you can afford to go is not performing well, then based on your school not performing well, not on the merit of that future teacher, they are not allowed to get a TEACH grant.

Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the aisle have worked hard in recent years, particularly in the ESSA that we passed to make sure that we have local control of education, the idea that reforms that State and education local leaders know best. I think the same is true for teachers.  It is vitally important that we have teachers that are prepared to succeed. We want the best and brightest in the classroom that help ensure our students receive the quality education they deserve.

5746,topic-id,944,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday in the Subcommittee on Immigration, the chairman, the gentleman from Wisconsin, attempted to reprimand me by reminding me that House rules prevent Members from ``casting aspersions on the President of the United States.'' And what did I say to get this reprimand? I said that the President of the United States had said that Mexicans were criminals and rapists.  Well, as the sportscasters used to say, let's go to the videotape. Almost the first words out of Donald Trump's mouth when he descended the golden escalators to launch his Presidential campaign were this:       When Mexico sends its people, they are not sending their      best. They are bringing drugs. They are bringing crime. They      are rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.  Well, I left out that part about some, I assume, are good people.  But the chairman of the committee said I was not following House rules because I was casting aspersions on the President because, apparently, I was saying what the President, himself, had actually said. And if that was offensive to the chairman, I agree. It is offensive. That was the point of making the speech.  So is repeating the words of the President against House rules? And if so, why? Because they are hateful and ugly things to say about our fellow human beings?  I don't think we should be barred from repeating the words of the President because they are hateful and ugly things to say about our fellow human beings, because he said them, and he is the President, and I respect the office.  So maybe it has to be something else. Maybe we cannot say things the President has said because it is not appropriate to say some of the things he has said about people, like the dehumanizing language he uses when describing which body parts he can grab women by, for example.  Now, Mr.Speaker, rather than saying, as I said earlier, let's go to the videotape, I think every single American has seen that videotape. When I have discussed the President saying these awful, hurtful things about where he can grab women, either here on the floor or on the Judiciary Committee, I[[Page H2520]]have actually had to clean up the language so it is safe for daytime C-SPAN audiences.  So what is it about repeating the words of this particular President in the U.House of Representatives that the gentleman from Wisconsin feels is a violation of the rule?  Maybe it is the lies. I looked through the House rules, and I didn't see any section that said, Members, thou shalt not lie. No, Mr.Speaker, that wasn't in the House rules. But, clearly, repeating things that this President said means that you will be repeating lies, and it just goes with the territory.  There was the original lie as President, barely a few hours in office, saying that his crowd was the largest crowd in the history of Presidential inaugurations.  Then there was the one about the Muslim ban, which the President said was a Muslim ban; his key adviser, the former mayor of New York, said was a Muslim ban; his other key adviser, Stephen Miller, said was a Muslim ban; but which the White House tried to say was not, in fact, a Muslim ban because it didn't ban all  Several Federal courts have agreed with the President that what he ordered was a Muslim ban and disagreed with the President's lawyer saying that it was not a Muslim ban.  But what about when the President said that he saw American Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11? We know that was a lie. Or that 3 million illegal votes were cast on election day, causing the President to lose the popular vote, which he had walked back from the claim originally that 3 million undocumented immigrants had voted on election day? In either case, it was a lie.  Then there is the illegal wiretapping ordered by the previous President of the United States, President Obama, on President-elect Trump, which certainly looks like a lie at this point.  So, Mr.Speaker, I am starting to wonder if repeating a lie that the President has told the American people is against the House rules. Or maybe it is accusing the President of lying that is, in the words of the subcommittee chairman, casting aspersions.  But let's take a look. Here is the definition of the verb ``lie'' from Webster's Dictionary: ``to make an untrue statement with the intent to deceive; to create a false or misleading impression.''  By those definitions, I would say I am on pretty solid ground, from a factual standpoint, that the President of the United States has told lies.  Water is wet, dogs have four legs, and President Trump tells lies. There may be exceptions, but basically all three are truthful statements.  Unless we are outlawing the truth in Congress, I think that pointing out lies by our President is not only within the rules, it is our moral obligation and duty as elected leaders of a free nation to point them out.  So then I am left to wonder, ``What is it about repeating the President's words that so upset the subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Wisconsin?'' and I figured it out. It is upsetting to Republican Members of the House to hear the words of the President of the United States because they know they have to defend them as the leader of their party, and I can understand why that would make any human being very uncomfortable.

5916,topic-id,862,"Mr.Speaker, there is no doubt in my mind that the resistance to this President and his policies is growing in America's heartland. If the 1,200 people who came to my townhall meeting in Chicago on Monday night are any indication, there is a movement in the United States that is standing up to the fear, the racism, the lies, and the divisiveness that comes from the President, his people, and his Twitter account every single day.  The Logandale School auditorium and gym was packed. No, not like The National Mall on Inauguration Day with wide-open spaces and the President's imaginary crowd of 1.5 million people. No, my townhall was actually packed like The Mall on the day after the inauguration for the Women's It was a diverse crowd of people who care about America and defending their country. It was overwhelming.  We had Ahmed Rehab, the inspirational leader of CAIR-Chicago, talking about what was going on in Chicago to resist the President's new and unimproved ban on refugees and He was joined by Equality Illinois, Planned Parenthood, and the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization, talking about how the people of Chicago are coming together to resist the President's attacks on women's health, on LGBTQ rights, on public schools and education, on women's rights, and on the environment.  It was the intersection of all of the communities and the issues that are under attack by President Trump and his co-President This townhall was the mother of all intersectionality events--right there in Chicago, in America's heartland.  No, they were not paid activists. They were ordinary people trying to get answers and defend their community against an unprecedented threat coming from the White House and Republicans in  For more than an hour, I answered questions, and then I stayed in the parking lot for another hour and talked with people who still had questions--and some were heartbreaking.  A public school teacher I have known for years asked me how she can help her students. Her kids are being kept out of school or are losing sleep or are displaying signs of depression because of the fear that they have that they will be separated from their parents if they are deported. She wants to comfort them, but the reality is she cannot.  Individuals asked me how they can protect families who are terrified that they will get separated and destroyed.  Just this week, a mother I have known for years who has a stay of deportation and has been regularly reporting to ICE officials for years told me she is being deported in 6 weeks. She has a U.citizen husband and four U.citizen children, and she has complied with the law and she has complied and reported to authorities, only to be told that, under Trump, the rules have changed and she is now a top priority for deportation--not because she should be deported, but because she can be deported.  This fear is having an impact on families and children. But what came through to me at the townhall meeting is that families, vulnerable immigrants, and millions of children with a birthright to live as Americans are not alone. There are thousands and thousands of allies who are joining together to defend families in Chicago and everywhere else.  At the townhall on Monday, I appealed for help because this is the very same room that this coming Saturday, Mr.Speaker, my office will be holding a citizenship workshop. I asked those who are already citizens to come and help those who are applying for citizenship, and hundreds of hands went up in the air saying they are ready to help.  We scheduled the citizenship workshop because we are unable to satisfy my constituents' huge demand for citizenship information. Some days we have lines out the door at my office on Fullerton Avenue with people wanting to know: How can I become a citizen of the United States of America?  So all day Saturday, we will have a small army of family defenders trained in citizenship helping their neighbors pursue naturalization and the American Just as you see the school packed with voters and constituents, you will see the room packed this Saturday with people applying for citizenship to the United States of America and packed with Americans that are already citizens ready to help them.  That is what Chicago is all about, and that is what the heartland is all about, and that is what America is all about.  Women in hijabs and women in pink hats are standing together to fight attacks on Muslims and attacks on women's rights. Environmental activists are joining men and women who fly the[[Page H1952]]rainbow flag of the LGBTQ community to resist the President's agenda. The entire community will stand together as the mass deportation wave becomes a day-to-day reality in our communities.

5728,topic-id,2391,"Mr.President, in a little more than 2 weeks, the Judiciary Committee will open its hearing on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the U.Supreme This is the 14th Supreme Court confirmation process in which I have participated. Over that time, while some things have changed, others have stayed the same.  The conflict over judicial appointments, especially to the Supreme Court, remains at its core a conflict over the proper role of judges in our system of government. The two sides of this conflict want two very different kinds of judges. Some of my colleagues, joined by their liberal allies, instead want judges who owe their fidelity to a particular political agenda.  For them, the judiciary is simply a backup plan for achieving political objectives. If the legislative branch does not deliver, they go to the executive--as they often did in the previous administration. If that does not work, they figure that the courts offer a second or third bite at the political apple.  This vision is fundamentally inconsistent with the way our system of government was destined, designed, and intended to be. Instead, the Framers devised the role of the judiciary on the wisdom of Montesquieu, who posited:       Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the      life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary      control. . . . Were it joined to the executive power, the      judge might behave [as] an oppressor.  That was Reflecting this wisdom, the Constitution endows the judge with the role of saying what the law is, rather than what he wishes the law would be.  Alexander Hamilton rightly observed: The people's liberty cannot be endangered by the judiciary ``so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the executive.''  The stakes in this conflict over judicial power are really enormous. The choice determines whether the people or unelected judges will govern the country and define the culture. Our system of government and the liberty it makes possible allow only one answer. The confirmation process allows us to determine which kind of judge Neil Gorsuch is and which kind of Justice he will be.  The dynamics of the confirmation process often reveal what kind of judge Senators and interest groups really[[Page S1568]]seek. Those who want political judges, for example, use a variety of strategies to determine how a judicial nominee, especially to the Supreme Court, will rule on issues and cases they care about. In fact, most of the time it seems that the policy consequences of how a judge will rule is the only thing that some Senators and advocates really care about.  For example, when President Bush nominated Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005, one Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee said that the real question was this: ``Whose side is Judge Roberts really on, on the really important issues of our time?''  Another Democratic Senator said: ``Before we vote, it is important to know where Judge Roberts stands on key issues.''  Another said that she needed to know whether ``Judge Roberts will stand with us and with our families or be on the side of major special interests.''  Now, something is seriously wrong when the confirmation process for a Supreme Court nominee sounds more like an election campaign for a Senator or a Senate seat. Unfortunately, the same thing is happening again today regarding Judge If a corporation won a case before him on the Tenth Circuit, for example, those groups claim that he is a champion of corporate interests, no matter the legal grounds of the decision, the facts, or anything else.  If another decision's result does not sufficiently advance the feminist agenda, they say that he is anti-woman. This radical approach seems to say that judges are free to decide every case based on the political popularity of the result and, therefore, that the judge personally intends every outcome. These advocates do not distinguish between the commands of the law and the personal preferences of the judge.  In this view, statutes and the Constitution mean whatever judges want them to mean, making unelected, unaccountable, lifetime appointees the master of the people. Political judges take away from the people the power to govern themselves and undermine their liberty. Using political or theological litmus tests in the quest for such political judges, demanding that they take sides and insisting that they make commitments to certain policy agendas before even taking office, poses a similar threat to the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.  There is nothing mainstream about political judges and nothing mainstream in the tactics used to appoint them. In contrast, impartial judges are consistent with the principles on which our system of government is based and the independence that judges must have. When Judge Gorsuch took his seat on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in 2006, he took the oath required by title 28, section 453, of the United States He pledged to administer justice without respect to persons and to faithfully and impartially discharge his judiciary duties.  Now, I want to suggest that my colleagues try an experiment. Ask your constituents whether judges should make up their mind on a case before hearing all of the evidence and arguments. Ask whether judges should take positions on issues before those issues even come before them in court.  I know what Utahns would say. The ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, for example, twice states this principle:       A judge shall not, in connection with cases, controversies,      or issues that are likely to come before the court, make      pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with      the impartial performance of the adjudicative [functions and]      duties of judicial office.  State codes of judicial conduct include the same commonsense protection for judicial impartiality. The California code, for example, prohibits statements, whether public or not, that ``commit the judge with respect to cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the courts.''  Now, this has been the consistent practice of judicial nominees before the Judiciary Elena Kagan came before the Judiciary Committee in June 2010, after being nominated by President Obama to replace Justice John Paul On June 29, 2010, she said that it would not be appropriate for her to comment on an issue that could come before the  Samuel Alito--Justice Alito--came before the committee in January 2006, after being nominated by President Bush to replace Justice Sandra Day O'On January 11, 2006, he said:       But the line I have to draw, and I think every nominee,      including Justice Ginsburg, has drawn, is to say that when it      comes to something that realistically could come before the      Court, they can't answer about how they would decide that      question. That would be a disservice to the judicial process.  Ruth Bader Justice Ginsburg appeared before the Judiciary Committee in July 1993, nominated by President Clinton to replace Justice Byron On July 20, 1993, she said this: ``A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process.''  Antonin Scalia came before the committee in August 1986, after being nominated by President Reagan to replace Justice William On August 5, 1986, he said that taking positions in a hearing on issues that could come before him was not just a slippery slope but, in his words, a precipice. He said: ``I just cannot do it, and I think the only way to be sure that I am not impairing my ability to be impartial in future cases . . . is simply to respectfully decline to give an opinion.''  Let me reach even further back. Justice Abe Fortas came before the Judiciary Committee in July 1968, after being nominated by President Johnson to replace Chief Justice Earl The committee sent the nomination to the full Senate and said these words in its report:       To require a Justice to state his views on legal questions      or to discuss his past decisions before the committee would      threaten the independence of the judiciary and the integrity      of the judicial system itself. It would also impinge on the      constitutional doctrine of separation of powers among the      three branches of Government as required by the  Judge Thurgood Marshall came before the committee in July 1967, nominated by President Johnson to replace Justice Tom The committee sent the nomination to the full Senate and its report noted that the nominee had said he would ``wisely and forthrightly decline to give a judicial opinion on hypothetical questions.''  Just 2 years earlier, when the committee reported the nomination of Abe Fortas to be an Associate Justice, its report said: ``We have always felt it would be unfair to ask any nominee for any judicial office to give a legal opinion on the basis of a hypothetical question.''  I think the point is obvious. Every nominee, of either party, for decades has taken the same position, and it is the right position. It reflects a commitment to judicial independence, to impartiality, and to the integrity of the judicial branch of government.  If my Democratic colleagues and their liberal allies believe that Justices Kagan, Alito, Ginsburg, Scalia, Fortas, and Marshall were all wrong, they should say so. If they believe that judges should prejudge cases by committing to particular outcomes, then they should make that case. If they believe that the oath of judicial office and code of judicial conduct are all misguided, then, it seems to me, they should be upfront about it. I, for one, believe that judges should be impartial, that they should follow the law, and that they should stay within their designated role.  America needs impartial, not political, judges. I don't care which party you are in. If you are an attorney, you have to appreciate judges who are impartial, especially if you are an honest attorney.  We need judges who will follow, rather than lead, the law. The Constitution, after all, is the primary way that the American people set rules for government, and that includes--God bless it--the judicial branch. The Constitution cannot control judges if judges control the  Yesterday the Judiciary Committee received a letter signed by more than 30 prominent members of the Supreme Court bar. In combination, they have argued more than 500 cases before the U.Supreme Though they hold different political and legal views, they are united in strongly supporting Judge Gorsuch's nomination. They[[Page S1569]]write that he is fair-minded, principled, and ``has the unusual combination of character, dedication, and intellect that would make him an asset to our Nation's highest court.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  I believe the record demonstrates that Judge Neil Gorsuch is an impartial judge and will, when confirmed, be an impartial Supreme Court He will take the law as he finds it and apply it ``without respect to persons,'' just as the oath commands. With him on the bench, the law--made by the people's elected representatives--will determine winners and losers. In doing so, he will be exactly the kind of Justice America needs.  Judge Gorsuch has a tremendous reputation on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. Judge Gorsuch is a brilliant lawyer and an even more brilliant judge.  He is a person of impeccable reputation and integrity. He is exactly the type of person you would want deciding your case if you had a case before the Supreme He is exactly the type of person whom other judges could emulate and follow, so he is exactly the type of person we want on the Supreme  I have heard some ugly rumors that some of my colleagues in this body might, because of political concerns and political pressure, want to vote against Judge I would caution them not to do that.  I think Judge Gorsuch will basically please almost everyone in this body over the years that he serves as a Supreme Court He is a really fine man. He is a fine family man. He is a very fine lawyer and a fantastic court of appeals judge.  He will make a great Justice on the U.Supreme So I urge my colleagues on both sides to vote for him and help us fill this void so that the Court can continue to act as the Court should.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    March 1, 2017.

5875,topic-id,2907,"Mr.President, when Senate Republicans executed their unprecedented block of President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland, the well-credentialed, well-respected, moderate chief judge of the DC Circuit, they knew what they were doing. They were willing to set aside the history and practice of the Senate to make sure no nominee of President Obama's would fill the vacancy created by Justice Scalia's death.  As fate would have it, a Republican won the Presidency and then, the majority leader's path was clear. This is exactly what happened: President Trump selected Neil Gorsuch from a list put together for him by the ultraconservative Heritage Foundation and Federalist These organizations selected Judge Gorsuch because they want to preserve the conservative 5-to-4 majority of the Roberts  This majority has done terrible damage to many laws Congress has passed to protect ordinary Americans, and has made it more difficult for us to pass new laws. My colleagues and I have shined a spotlight on these rightwing organizations and the $10 million campaign they have run on Judge Gorsuch's behalf because they believe his view of the law matches theirs. And therein lies our concern.  These organizations have spent so much money and worked so hard on Judge Gorsuch's behalf because they could trust, perhaps not 100 percent of the time, but enough of the time, that Judge Gorsuch would decide cases in ways they would agree with and support.  Judge Gorsuch is an Ivy League educated lawyer with 10 years on the Federal bench. He is not naive. Even if he refused to acknowledge the fact that these groups are supporting him, Judge Gorsuch knows as well as we all do that politics have a real impact on the kinds of nominees selected to serve on the Supreme  We know he understands this because he said so in his 2005 National Review Online article, which was entitled ``Liberals'N'Lawsuits.'' In that article, he wrote that because Republicans had won elections for the Presidency and for control of the Senate, the Republicans were in charge of the judicial appointment process. As a result, he said, ``the level of sympathy liberals pushing constitutional litigation can expect in the courts may wither over time, leaving the Left truly out in the cold.''  This article demonstrates that Judge Gorsuch understands that judges appointed and confirmed by Republicans will have less sympathy for, as he put it, ``liberals pushing constitutional litigation.'' Clearly, judges do not make decisions divorced from their personal and philosophical leanings. However often or however loudly they might protest, conservatives understand that their arguments about the narrow role of judges--their claims that Justices are there only to modestly apply the law and adhere to the Constitution--are bunk. And Judge Gorsuch must know this too.  Nowhere is this brand of conservative judicial activism clearer than in the actions of the Roberts Court to reach into our elections to tilt the political landscape--with a significant impact on whose votes are heard in our political process and who is able to take part in our elections.  Based on his writings, Judge Gorsuch clearly understands the relationship between politics and the courts. I am convinced that adding Judge Gorsuch to the Roberts Court will only continue the Court's intervention into politics.  The actions of the Roberts Court are clear. This Court has issued a series of decisions that have made it easier for conservative organizations to spend unlimited and unregulated dark money on elections, and that may have made it harder for people to vote, harder for people to participate and have those voices heard in the political process. These decisions have changed who is able to participate in the democratic process, who gets elected, and, in turn, who gets nominated to the Supreme  Justice Felix Frankfurter's famous admonition that ``Courts ought not to enter this political thicket'' captures the challenges for courts treading into politics. Of course there are times when the courts must do so--to ensure one person, one vote, for example. But courts must also be careful when wading into politics because the legitimacy of the court is itself put at risk.  The most memorable example, of course, came when the Court effectively decided the 2000 Presidential election in Bush v.  In the Citizens United and Shelby County decisions, we have seen the tremendous damage the Court can do to democracy when it tilts the electoral process so heavily against ordinary  In the 2010 Citizens United decision, the Roberts Court struck down bipartisan laws limiting campaign contributions that went back more than a century. This decision opened an unrestrained flow of money and potential corruption that has dominated our politics and drowned out the voices of ordinary Americans ever since.  The Court's decision in this case was not an accident. Chief Justice Roberts engineered the decision in that case by steering it away from the narrow question before the Court about how to apply a particular law and into a broad constitutional question. His efforts[[Page S2380]]demonstrate that the Supreme Court has broad power and latitude to push and shape the law.  This kind of conservative judicial activism directly contradicts what Justice Roberts famously said during his confirmation hearing. He said the job of a Justice is to simply call balls and strikes.  Jeffrey Toobin, in a 2012 article in the New Yorker entitled, ``Money Unlimited: How Chief Justice John Roberts orchestrated the Citizens United decision,'' and in his recent book, ``The Oath,'' recounts very clearly how Chief Justice Roberts engineered this campaign spending decision.  The question originally presented to the Supreme Court in Citizens United, according to Toobin's account, was a narrow one. It involved whether one of the provisions of the bipartisan McCain-Feingold campaign finance law applied to a documentary criticizing a candidate and not just to television commercials. In fact, Ted Olson, the well-known conservative lawyer representing Citizens United, the organization that wanted to run the documentary, made a narrow argument that the McCain-Feingold law was not meant to apply to that kind of documentary. This was an argument based not on the Constitution, but on deciding the case before the Court in the narrowest possible way. Such a decision would have been restrained.  It became clear during oral arguments that the conservatives on the Court had the opportunity not just to apply the law, but to change it entirely. Chief Justice Roberts and the other conservative Justices on the Court began to do this by aggressively questioning the government's lawyer on issues not then directly before the As Toobin describes, ``Through artful questioning, Alito, Kennedy, and Roberts had turned a fairly obscure case about campaign-finance reform into a battle over governmental censorship.''  Now that it was clear to Chief Justice Roberts that there was a majority on the court for making a broader constitutional decision, he ordered that the case be reargued, rather than simply deciding the narrow question argued by both Olsen and the government's attorney. Chief Justice Roberts wanted the Court to take head-on a question that was not in fact before it and which the Court had decided the opposite way only 6 years before. When the Roberts Court decided Citizens United the following year, after reargument, it did so on the broadest possible ground--unconstitutional grounds--and found that corporations, like people, have First Amendment rights. It found that these rights could be violated by limits on campaign contributions.  Again, this outcome did not happen by accident; Chief Justice Roberts engineered the result. According to Toobin's account, Chief Justice Roberts chose to assign the opinion for the majority to Justice Kennedy, who was known to be very skeptical of campaign finance laws and believed that limits on campaign spending violate free speech. By doing so, Chief Justice Roberts ensured that the Citizens United decision would be a broad one, and it was.  The way the Court chose to reach out and change the law was wholly unnecessary to decide the case at hand. And it certainly was not judicial restraint; it was judicial activism. The Court in Citizens United reached out to overturn precedent and upend laws dating back more than a century to find new rights for corporations to funnel untold millions into our political system.  This decision also severely limited the ways in which Congress could take action to continue to pursue the aims of campaign finance laws to limit political corruption.  In his article, Mr.Toobin said:       [Citizens United] reflects the aggressive conservative      judicial activism of the Roberts It was once liberals      who are associated with using the courts to overturn the work      of the democratically elected branches of government, but the      current Court has matched contempt for Congress with a      disdain for many of the Court's own precedents.       When the Court announced its final ruling on Citizens      United, on January 21, 2010, the vote was five to four and      the majority opinion was written by Anthony Above      all, though, the result represented a triumph for Chief      Justice Even without writing the opinion, Roberts,      more than anyone, shaped what the Court did.  But the Roberts Court was not done with its activism to radically change the landscape of our elections. In another narrow 5-to-4 decision in Shelby County in 2013, the Court substituted its conclusions for that of Congress and gutted core protections of the Voting Rights Act--protections which were essential for the right to vote for millions of Again, this was not a decision the Court needed to or should have reached. And again, it was a decision engineered by Chief Justice John Roberts and the conservative majority on the Supreme  Back in 1982, Chief Justice Roberts--then a special assistant to the Attorney General--was the point person for the Reagan administration's opposition to strengthening the Voting Rights At that time, Congress acted to fix a hole in the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court had opened in a 1980 decision. John Roberts was opposed to these efforts to make clear that election practices or procedures that result in discrimination, not only those with the intent to discriminate, violate the Voting Rights  In 1982, Congress successfully passed their fix over the objections of John Roberts and the Reagan administration. If you look at John Roberts' memos and articles from that period of time--in which he was a strong advocate within the administration for the position it took--his view of the Voting Rights Act was clear. It was a view he would apply years later as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court when he led a 5-to-4 majority to gut section 5 of the Voting Rights  The preclearance provisions of section 5 mandated that any changes to voting laws in States with a long history of discrimination have to be approved in advance--or precleared--by the Justice Department or by the DC district court. These provisions, passed a century after the conclusion of the Civil War, for the first time effectively guaranteed the rights protected by the 14th and 15th Amendments in many parts of the country. Section 5 changed the landscape of our democracy and opened the door for millions of people to exercise their right to vote.  These provisions of the Voting Rights Act were reauthorized nearly unanimously by Congress in 2006. Before reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, the Senate Judiciary Committee alone held nine hearings on it. The thousands of pages of material the Senate reviewed, together with the record developed in a dozen hearings in the House, clearly established why it was so important to maintain preclearance in order to protect the right to vote in jurisdictions with a long history of voting discrimination.  Yet, in Shelby County, the Roberts Court ignored this evidence and the Court's long precedent. The Court made its own determination about the value of the extensive evidence reviewed by Congress and struck down these core provisions. The Court refused to defer to the extensive findings and determination of Congress even though Congress is expressly charged by the 14th and 15th Amendments to enforce the guarantees of those Amendments--the guarantee of the right to vote. The Court did what John Roberts fought to do years before and weakened the Voting Rights So much for judicial restraint. So much for just calling balls and strikes.  A Justice and a Court devoted to judicial restraint, with an understanding of the separation of powers, never would have ignored Congress acting at the height of its constitutional powers and its factfinding capacity. Yet Chief Justice Roberts and the narrow conservative majority on the Court chose to act--to reach out and to gut one of the core protections of the fundamental right to vote.  We now know that Congress got it right and the Supreme Court got it wrong in its judgment about the continuing need for section 5 of the Voting Rights Immediately after the Shelby County decision, numerous States previously covered by section 5 immediately passed onerous voter ID laws and other barriers that affected the right to vote of millions of people. Some of these laws were even enacted with discriminatory intent, not just discriminatory effect--in other words, they were blatantly meant to discriminate in voting.  These newly raised barriers had a clear impact in last year's elections.[[Page S2381]]For the first time in two generations, thanks to the actions of the Roberts Court, we risk unraveling the progress my friend John Lewis fought for alongside so many others during the civil rights movement.  During his confirmation hearing, I asked Judge Gorsuch about the Shelby County decision, since he often explained the constraints on his approach to judicial decision making in terms of the separation of powers. He said several times that judges make terrible legislators, that courts lack the staff, capacity, and training to do the kind of factfinding that is an essential part of the legislative process. Yet, when I asked him whether the Court's decision in Shelby County raised the kinds of concerns he had noted about the limits of judges as policymakers and legislators, he declined to answer.  But this is about more than Judge Gorsuch's refusal to answer. It is about more than the narrow view he expressed of the role of a judge or, particularly, a Justice--a narrow view that is not a reflection of the real world. Both the process and the outcome in Shelby County and in Citizens United raised exactly the kinds of concerns that make it so important for the Senate to understand Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy before putting him on the Supreme Judge Gorsuch would become part of a newly empowered 5-to-4 conservative majority on the Roberts Court, which has been anything but restrained in moving the law for the benefit of corporations and against individual rights.  Taken together, these two decisions, Citizens United and Shelby County, have made it harder for millions of Americans to have their voices heard in our election process and their votes counted at the ballot box. Since Citizens United, the floodgates have opened to unfettered corporate money in our elections. Since Shelby County, 13 States have enacted laws placing limitations on voting. Many of these are in States that would have been prevented from doing so in the first place before the Court gutted section 5 of the Voting Rights After Shelby County, these States could pass such laws, and they did, disenfranchising tens of thousands of voters in the process.  My Democratic colleagues and I asked Judge Gorsuch many questions to try to understand his pattern of narrowly interpreting laws meant to protect individual rights or worker safety in ways at odds with the law's purpose. For example, the narrow interpretation Judge Gorsuch took on the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, would have left Luke Perkins and thousands of special needs children like Luke without a chance to make educational progress. His interpretation was so at odds with the purpose of the IDEA law that the Supreme Court unanimously rejected and criticized Judge Gorsuch's narrow standard in a case they decided just a few weeks ago.  Time and again, Judge Gorsuch threw up his hands and told us that if we disagreed with this narrow reading of the relevant law, that Congress should do better. In his view, the problem was not the Court--which he seemed to cast as an innocent bystander--but, rather, the way Congress had written the law.  By tilting the political playing field so heavily toward corporations and unfettered dark money and against individuals, the Roberts Court has impacted the composition of who is in The Court has made it even harder for Congress to take meaningful action to, say, pass laws to protect workers' safety or the access of students with special needs to an education. In turn, these decisions have had a real-world impact by changing who gets to participate in the political process and therefore who gets elected and who has input on the kinds of laws that are passed--and, of course, who gets nominated to the U.Supreme  The actions of the Roberts Court in Citizens United and Shelby County make clear the stakes of the Gorsuch nomination. They make clear what the Senate Republicans had in mind in their unprecedented and arrogant refusal to consider President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme They wanted, instead, a Justice like Judge Gorsuch who would continue the rightward march of the 5-to-4 conservative majority on the Roberts And the United States Senate should not allow this brazen gambit to succeed.

I intend to vote for the defense bill next week when it comes to the floor, if, in fact, as the gentleman represents, it is substantively the same as the bill that we have already adopted.  What I am concerned about and what Members on my side of the aisle are very concerned about is that the remaining nondefense discretionary spending bills will be substantially altered from that which we would have passed in December of last year in the 2017.  Of course, we were 4 months late doing that--or 3 months late, at least: October, November, and But I am hopeful, Mr.Leader, that those bills will, in fact, be considered discretely so that the American public can see us vote on those bills and on the priorities that are incorporated in those bills.  Mr.Leader, it appears that the majority has stalled somewhat in their efforts in a path forward on repeal of the President Trump's address on Tuesday, it seems to me, didn't offer many details. He does say, however, that everybody is going to be covered--everybody--with better health care,[[Page H1485]]cheaper. If that bill comes to the floor, I am going to vote for it, Mr.I want you to know that. Health care for everybody--quality, accessible, affordable, and cheaper.  Now, as the majority leader knows, the budget resolution that was passed this year set a deadline of January 27 for committees to report legislation repealing the law. It is now March 2, and there are reports, Mr.Leader, that Republicans have a draft bill that perhaps is located in H-157, that it is not being posted, and that Republicans have been told they can view it in H-157.  I don't know that I have the room number correct, and I am not sure that the information that I have is correct, but I will tell you that Michael Burgess, or Burgess, on your side of the aisle said this. He said it yesterday: People need to have access to this document--apparently his presumption was he did not have access to the document or he believed others should; not only Members of our side of the aisle, but also the public--and if there are problems, let's talk through them. It's been a long time in the works. Most of the pieces that are in there, people have seen in the past, but it does need to be an open process.  Mr.Leader, let me repeat that. It does need to be an open process, according to  Gus Bilirakis says: We're not having a hearing or anything. We're not having a hearing or anything. But there'll be a place for us to view it, the draft.  Paul Ryan, the Speaker, said, 3 days ago: We're going through the committee process. We're doing this step by step. We're having public hearings. We're having committee work on legislation. This is how the legislative process is supposed to be designed. We are not hatching some bill in a back room--perhaps H-157; he didn't say that, I said it--and plopping it on the American people's front door.  Mr.Leader, you and I both were here when the Affordable Care Act was passed. There was a lot of talk about the Affordable Care Act and how it was passed in the dark of night. That was baloney, of course. We had 79 bipartisan hearings and markups over the 2 years that we considered the Affordable Care House Members spent nearly 100 hours in hearings, heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle, considered 239 amendments--both Democratic and Republican--and accepted 121 amendments.  The original House bill was posted online 30 days before the first committee began their markup and more than 100 days before the committee introduced their merged bill in the House Democrats posted the House bill--that was the final process--online 72 hours before the bill was brought to the floor, consistent with our rules.  Now, to my understanding, the Ways and Means Committee has been told this bill is going to be marked up on There will not have been a single hearing, there will not have been a single witness, and Members cannot, on our side of the aisle--as I understand it--see the bill today.  I don't know where all my Tea Party friends are who demanded full consideration and that everybody read the bill. I don't see them out on the lawn. I don't see them out on the plaza. I don't see them out on the sidewalk as they were when we were considering the bill and we had those 181 witnesses, the 100 hours of hearings that they thought weren't sufficient.                              {time}  1130  I don't know whether they will think that having a markup next Wednesday when the bill has not even been made available to Democratic Members of the Apparently, Republican Members have to go to a room to see it, and the public clearly has no idea of what that bill is.  Mr.Leader, I hope you will tell me that I am wrong, that there will be hearings consistent with what Speaker Ryan said 3 days ago. I hope you will tell me, yes, we are going to honor what Speaker Ryan said, that we are going to have those hearings, we are going to have witnesses, and we are going to consider amendments.  All of us understand that this is one of the biggest issues confronting the American people. We have had hundreds of thousands of people showing up at town meetings saying how concerned they are, yet, if my information is correct, Mr.Leader, they will have no opportunity to talk to the Committee on Ways and  I am further informed, and I hope the majority leader says this is wrong, that the markup will occur before the Congressional Budget Office has the opportunity to say how much it is going to cost. All this weeping and gnashing of teeth about balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility, a bill that affects 18 percent of the gross domestic product, and the critical need for people to have access to affordable, quality health care, not one of them will have an opportunity to know how much this repeal will cost.  Again, Mr.Leader, I hope you are going to be able to tell me, no, Mr.Whip, we are going to have hearings, we understand how important this issue is, how much interest there is in this country, and we are going to give time for serious consideration, and we are going to have witnesses come before those hearings; and then after the witnesses, we are going to have a markup after substantial debate and consideration is allowed on both sides of the aisle.  I now yield to the majority leader with the hopes that he will be able to give me some degree of confidence that Paul Ryan, our Speaker, was correct, that we are going to follow regular order and make a transparent consideration of this piece of legislation.

You have been here quite some time, much longer than I agree with you, this is a very big issue. That is why, for the last 6 years, we have had hearings because all those hearings you reported, I would have wished you would have listened during those hearings. I would have wished you would have been able to do a healthcare bill that actually works. The essence of what the ACA did, it was about exchanges and the expansion of  So my dear friend here tells me that was a big success. What do you tell all those people across this country?

With Humana pulling out, that gives 16 counties in Tennessee that have no one to care for them. The expansion of Medicaid--I know you are concerned about the budget, as am I--says within this 10-year window, in the tenth year, it will cost us $1 trillion. You know as well as I do that that is about the exact amount of money we spend for all discretionary spending in government today.

Because he has no score from the He can tell me all he wants about 6 years of waiting and listening. He has no score on this bill. My judgment is he will have no score when he marks it up. By the way, he will give no access, contrary to Speaker Ryan saying that we are going to go regular order. I reject, with all due respect, Mr.Majority Leader, the fact that we had a hearing a year ago or 2 years ago or 3 years ago, that the opinion that was given at those times by various witnesses who differed on their conclusions, that we can apply that to the bill that you have introduced now.  I don't know what the bill you have introduced is. I don't know whether you have introduced it or somebody else has introduced it. I don't even know whether it exists. I told the gentleman what I am told. He has not disabused me of any of the assertions I made. He has not disabused me that it is not available publicly. He has not disabused me of the fact that we can't see it. He has not disabused me of Burgess saying it ought to be seen by everybody and considered, it should not be in a secret room someplace that people have to go to, like it is a secret document. We have to go down to the Capitol Visitor Center in the secure facilities of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to see secret documents. Surely that is not the standard that we are giving to a bill that will have such, in my view, catastrophic effect on individuals, on jobs, and on businesses.  Mr.Speaker, I want to tell the majority leader that I do not accept the proposition that a hearing over 6 years about repeal only--and I am not sure how many hearings there were. Maybe the majority leader knows. But I know for a fact that proponents of the bill were very difficult to get on the list of witnesses that we wanted to testify at some of those hearings. The American people, the Tea Party, all those people for and against who came to these town meetings should really lament. And, frankly, I think that the Speaker's representation is not being followed. The assertion that it was done last year, the year before, we have a lot of new Members in this Congress who weren't here. Frankly, when we have bills introduced in Congress, we usually have hearings on them. That is the regular order.  Now, we haven't been following regular order on all these congressional review acts, Mr.Leader, so maybe the precedent nowadays is forget about hearings because most of the bills that we have considered during this Congress have not had hearings. The ramifications of the repeal of these rules no one knows. There were no hearings on those. Frankly, we didn't have hearings on those year after year after year in the past. So, Mr.Leader, it appears that the representation you are making is we know all about this, we don't need hearings, we have been talking about this stuff forever, we are just going to act. The courage, I would suggest to my friend, the courage would be to expose these to full and fair and open debate. That would be the courage.  Now, Mr.Leader, unless you want to respond to that, I will move on to a different subject.  Mr.Well, I would only like to end with this: I was here at the same time. I know you have your history, and I have the history that I remember. I remember seeing the Speaker at that time, now your leader, say we need to pass the bill to find out what is in it. I remember being here late that night. I remember a lot of people, citizens around this building complaining. You know what? The saddest part of all that, their fears became true. They didn't get to keep the doctor or the health plan that they were promised. The premiums they were told would go down $2,500, that didn't happen. They now find that they don't have the care that they were promised. We have spent our time.  You did make a statement that there are a lot of new people in this building. I would argue that is a reason why there are a lot of new people in this building, the ACA and the way you carried it out. That is why we did not do that. You stipulated a little earlier, trying to state about a 3-day rule. That wasn't your rule. That is a rule we instituted and changed when we became the majority, Mr. So we will have regular order. We will have regular order. We will take it through committee, we will have it open for debate, and we will bring it to the floor because we promised the American people, and we will keep our promise, just as the President, as you heard just this week, talked about the reform. We will protect preexisting conditions. We will make sure those who are 26 or younger can stay on their parents' plan. The bans or lifetime limits, we will protect those like we have always said we would. We will create a healthcare bill that actually empowers the individual, not more government. We will actually lower the premiums. That is the difference between us. We can have those debates, and I welcome them, because I think history will show your hearings and our hearings. But, at the end of the day, I want the history to show who actually did a better job of providing health care to the American people at a lower cost.

Mr.Leader, you said the following:       This bill is being pushed through because the majority in      the Congress refuse to listen to the people.  You said that on March 2, 2010. You were referring, of course, to us Democrats who refused to listen to the American people, because your presumption was the American people was not for the proposition we were promoting.  There were two candidates for President who got major votes in this election. One was Hillary Clinton, who said: I want to keep the Affordable Care And one was Donald Trump, who said: I want to get rid of the Affordable Care Although, he has said then and now that he wants to have everybody covered at a cheaper price with assured benefits. As I said, we would support a bill like that.  Of those two candidates that were running, one got 65 million votes and one got 62 million votes. Now, the one who got 62 million votes won the election. Why? Because of the electoral college. He is the legitimate elected President of the United I do not question that at all. But it ought to give some degree of humility that he got 3 million less votes than the person that espoused policies other than those espoused by President It ought to give some pause to let the American people into the process and testify.  I will tell the gentleman that what the Republican Party is recommending in repeal of the ACA will have very substantial consequences. You may think they are positive, I may think they are negative, but I hope neither one of us think that that won't have very substantial consequences for our country. In that context, we ought to have allowed, and we ought to allow, the people of this country to testify on those consequences.

I know the gentleman likes to make a lot of quotes, but I think if you take my quote and you look at the date and you want to go back in time and you look at the polling, I think my quote is right. I think the American people were at that exact same position.  You talk about consequences. The ACA has a tremendous amount of consequences on the American public, and, unfortunately, they haven't been positive. Some have, but the majority have not. That is why a number of people today, one-third of this Nation of the counties, 1,022, only have one healthcare provider.  I listened to our President just this week right down this well. I know you haven't commented about that or quoted anything he said there, but I listened to other people who commented about that, people who are on different sides of the aisle who I know did not vote for him.  Mr.Speaker, Van Jones, I know the man well. He and I philosophically disagree. But he said that night, listening to President Trump, that he became America's  So I just say to my friend across the aisle, Mr.Speaker, that I think 4 months is long enough to decide who won the race, and we don't have to come back to this.

The gentleman talks about 6 years. Not once in those 6 years, not once, has the majority party offered a comprehensive replacement for the Affordable Care They have talked about it.

It didn't say any of that. It said repeal the  So the polling data today, Mr.Speaker, is that more people want to keep the ACA prior to the consideration and adoption of a replacement than want to repeal it. I agree with you, that is a change from 2010. And the reason it is a change is because they are now looking at it very carefully. They are figuring out what, in fact, it has done for them and their families and for their children who had preexisting conditions and for their access to affordable health care, and they are saying: We are taking a second look.

5967,topic-id,374,"Lastly, Mr.Speaker, I want to say to my friend, the majority leader, that I look forward to working with him. I see that he recently observed that the attorney general ought to recuse himself in dealing with issues of the relationship between the administration during the course of the campaign and Russia, which the intelligence community has said interfered in America's election.  All of us ought to be concerned about that--a foreign government interfering in our democracy; particularly, a government that is hostile to our interests; particularly, a government led by Mr.Putin, who has committed international crimes, who, contrary to international law, invaded Crimea, still holds Crimea inconsistent with international law, and has been sanctioned. Hopefully, those sanctions will stay in place.  I agree with the gentleman that, at the very least, the attorney general ought to recuse himself. I have asked him to step down.  But we need to have, Mr.Speaker, an independent bipartisan commission with subpoena power, similar to the 9/11 Commission, for the security of our country and, yes, for the confidence building for our President to see what, in fact, were the relationships between his campaign and Russia and to what extent Russia involved itself in trying to impact on the elections of the United  I don't have anything further to say. Unless the gentleman wants to say something, I will yield back.  I yield to my friend.  Mr.I thank the gentleman for yielding.  This is a matter for investigation by the House Intelligence For years, we have investigated Putin's hostile international actions.  Just so the gentleman does know, Mr.Speaker, this week, Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff approved the scope of their committee's inquiry into Russia's measures of targeting in the 2016 election. I support this bipartisan investigation. I have great faith that the committee will fully investigate all of the evidence and follow the facts wherever they lead.  I know the gentleman, Mr.Speaker, made comments in regards to the attorney general. Attorney General Sessions stated this morning that whenever it is appropriate, he will recuse himself. I agree with those remarks.  As far as the ongoing investigation into Russia, I would, again, direct my friend to the bipartisan effort that is underway in the House Intelligence                              {time}  1200  ",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgH1484.txt,566,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT,2017.0,2.0,March
5968,topic-id,375,"I thank the majority leader for his comments.  Let me say that I was very disappointed to learn that Mr.Nunes, at the request of the administration, talked to members of the press before the investigations have occurred, before they have heard a single witness, to say that he really thought this was not a matter that really needed careful consideration. That is not a quote. I characterized what I read his comment to mean to the press.  In addition, I understand the Department of Homeland Security was also requested, and the FBI, to talk to the press to tamp down interest in those. The American people need to be very concerned about these issues. Every Member of this Congress, a separate and coequal branch of the Government of the United States, ought to be very concerned about that.  The Bible says that the truth will set us free. And the truth will give us confidence. And the truth should be known by the American people.  The problem I have with the Intelligence Committee is that the Intelligence Committee--most of the information they gather is not available to the public. I don't know what they will do moving forward.  But we found in the 9/11 Commission a perfect example of a commission equally divided with two extraordinarily respected co-chairs that got to the bottom and made significant recommendations, most of which--almost all of which--were adopted in a bipartisan fashion by this  So, Mr.Speaker, I would hope that we would pursue that not in lieu of the Intelligence Committee--not in lieu of the Intelligence Committee--but in addition to.  Benghazi, we had seven committees, and you thought on your side of the aisle that wasn't enough, so you spent some $4 million on an additional special committee to find exactly the same conclusion.  So, in this case I do not oppose the work of the Intelligence Committee, but I certainly believe the American people would expect and would want a similar bipartisan commission as they saw work on the 9/11 tragedy to give them the confidence that Russia is not in any way undermining the independence of our government or undermining the democracy that we hold so dear.

5822,topic-id,2490,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr.Raskin of Maryland, for his incredible leadership and for the opportunity to continue to lead the Special Order hour for the Progressive Caucus here every week. And every week we do try to pick a different topic.  For those of you in the audience, we pick a different topic, and this evening that topic is the ties to Russia of this administration.  Yesterday, Sean Spicer told veteran White House correspondent April Ryan that she was ``going to have to take `no' for an answer'' when she asked him about the President's collusion with  Well, Mr.Spicer, we are here to tell you that we will not just take ``no'' for an answer. We are not going to sit back and believe everything that is coming out from the White House when there is mounting evidence that President Trump's campaign may have colluded with Russia to tip the election in his favor.  And for those of you who saw the Judiciary Committee today, we had a resolution of inquiry from Representative Hakeem Jeffries and Ted Lieu about this very issue in relation to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his ties to  Let's not forget that President Trump's former national security adviser and campaign adviser only lasted a record-setting 24 days in the role because he blatantly lied about meeting with Russia's Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, during the campaign.  So what other ties to Russia have been confirmed?  There are so many of these ties that I thought it might be helpful to have a diagram and to really show exactly what the connections have been between top Trump officials during the campaign who are now the same officials that are serving in the White House and are the President's close and personal confidants. The fact that a diagram is even necessary tells us something.  Let's start at the top with the President himself.  President Trump has a long history with His first trip to Moscow was actually 30 years ago. He went to explore potential real estate opportunities. His relationship with the country has clearly grown.  In the late 1990s, Trump started banking with Deutsche Bank, which has since been investigated for funneling Russian money offshore.  Soon after that, he linked up with a Russian company called the Bayrock Group, which has ties to the Mafia and to criminal interests in Their partnership was integral to helping to[[Page H2553]]expand The Trump Organization to new heights, with properties springing up across the country.  His ties to Russia only grew deeper. In the late 2000s, several Russian businessmen bought properties from The Trump Organization, netting them hundreds of millions of dollars in profit.  Now, let's fast-forward to 2016 when then-candidate Trump was building his team. He brought on Carter Page, who is now under investigation for communicating with Russian officials. And, in fact, it was the Trump campaign's former manager, Corey Lewandowski, who gave Carter Page the green light to visit Moscow just last A couple of weeks later, Mr.Page met with Sergey Kislyak, but he said that he will not reveal the details of that conversation to the public.  This is a very important, consistent fact that we see. Our resolution of inquiry today that we debated in the Judiciary Committee was about the release of information so that we understand what is going on. Without any accusations, what we are trying to say is let us investigate what these ties are, what the conversations were, and let us determine, in an independent, bipartisan way, let us determine that there has not been collusion, and let us make sure that there is no foreign government that is affecting our democracy.  So various members of Trump's team met with Russian officials during the campaign. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions didn't just meet with officials, he lied about meeting with officials during his confirmation hearing.  And again, the top prosecutor in the United States of America lied under oath during a confirmation hearing. This cannot be ignored.  Once again, we are not saying don't have conversations, but don't lie about them. Don't make us wonder what happened during those conversations. How do we trust the Attorney General of the United States of America to fairly and impartially preside if he has shown that he is willing to make false statements just to get the job?  He is not the only high-level Trump official who has been blatantly dishonest with the American people. Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser, was put in place by President Trump and resigned due to the shady backdoor dealings that put him in the pocket of Russian officials. He was paid $45,000 to attend a state-sponsored gala dinner and sit at the table of Vladimir  These connections are more than just mere coincidence.  And in addition to Flynn, Page, and Sessions, there are several others who have been implicated: Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort; former campaign adviser, Roger Stone; his personal lawyer--all of these folks are up here--his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, are all under investigation for their connections to And now President Trump's son-in-law, who has become one of his top advisers, is under investigation as well for his actions during the campaign.  Not only did Jared Kushner meet with Ambassador Kislyak, he met with the Russian bankers as well. And the White House has claimed that the meetings were ``diplomatic,'' but it is deeply troubling that one of the bankers that he met with was Sergey  I want to be clear about who this person is. He is a graduate of the Russian Academy of the Federal Security Service, which is an academy that is tasked with training individuals to become members of Russia's security and intelligence forces. He is now the chairman of the Vnesheconombank, and he was appointed by Putin, himself. This is not a mom-and-pop bank. This is a state-owned corporation that has been under sanctions by the United States for the past 3 years. And that is a big deal.  Jared Kushner, whose family is worth nearly $2 billion, has real estate interests around the world, sat down, allegedly under the auspices of his role with the President, to chat with this owner of the bank. A spokesperson for the Kremlin has alleged that this meeting was ``absolutely the bank's prerogative'' and that the Russian Government was unaware of the meeting.  We need more information to know what happened in that meeting because, otherwise, where there is smoke, we think there is fire. So we need to have the information so that we can actually determine what is happening with these connections because, if somebody from the Trump campaign and the Trump administration is meeting with Russian officials and they don't want to tell us why or what is discussed, then we have to start wondering whether the conversations are in the interest of the American people or in the interest of the Russian  We also have Rex Tillerson, President Trump's Secretary of State, who has strong business ties to Russia and was awarded the Order of Friendship from Vladimir Putin in 2013. This is the highest honor that Russia can bestow on noncitizens. Just 2 years prior, Tillerson had struck a massive $500 billion oil deal with the Russian  Now, we could go on and on with this, but what is important for the American people to understand is that we have expectations that the President of the United States and that his Cabinet are working in the interests of the American people.  We have expectations that, if a deal is struck, it is not for the benefit of some other country or for the personal benefit of any individual in office, but that it is for the public's benefit. And if a deal is struck that takes benefit away from the public in order to give it to a foreign government or to an individual personal interest of our government, then that is an enormous disservice to our democracy, and, of course, there are constitutional ramifications for all of this.  This administration has tried to tell us that the conversations between Trump's advisers and high-level Russian businessmen and officials were about diplomacy. Yet this shroud of secrecy that continues every time we try to get information, every time we try to make sure that there is an independent, bipartisan investigation, the shroud of secrecy continues, and it begs the question: If this is really about advocating for the interests of the American people and not the Russian Government or the pocketbooks of Cabinet members, then why the secrecy? What is there to hide?  We don't understand that. If there is nothing to hide, then let us have the information. There have been plenty of requests to do that in a classified way in case there is some information that is classified.  But why are the President's campaign advisers and officials denying under oath that they have communicated with Russia only then to be forced to walk back their statements or recuse themselves, as Jeff Sessions had to do, or to even resign?  Foreign policy is key to American interests, but these backroom conversations and subsequent lies are doing nothing to make the American people feel confident in an administration that is supposed to represent them. It is clear that there is a strong tie here that was only strengthened during the campaign.  But let's be very clear about what is the connective tissue in all of this, in all of these lines that go back and forth. What is the connective tissue that connects all of this? It is money.  How did we get to this point?  Of course, we remember the hacking of the election that occurred last year. It is in the process of being investigated, even though the chairman of the Intelligence Committee feels that his first duty is to the President and not to the members of the committee.  But last year, President Trump defended Vladimir Putin by placing the blame on the Democratic National Committee to distract the American people; and then, in July, he outright urged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails, saying: ``Russia, if you are listening, I hope you are able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.''  In December, a CIA assessment concluded that Russia was trying to help then-candidate Trump win the election. Why? Because they know that they have an ally in President They have someone who is willing to do business with them, even if it may not be in the best interests of the American people. They know that they are well connected at every level of his administration.  And let's be clear about who we are talking about with Mr.This is a[[Page H2554]]dictator, a human rights abuser, somebody whom Republicans and Democrats, alike, have said we cannot be associated with.                              {time}  1745  You have heard of ``The Manchurian Candidate.'' In the most recent election, we may have ended up with the Kremlin candidate, and the script truly writes itself.  We were hoping to have a chance to get to the bottom of this, as I said. We were hoping to have a chance to get to the bottom of this in a hearing in the House Intelligence Committee, but we never got the chance.  Last Tuesday, Representative Nunes went to the secret briefing in a National Security Council facility, and what he found apparently wasn't good for the President because he ran over there to tell the Instead of doing his duty and reporting the information to the House Intelligence Committee, he went straight to the White House with his findings. And he is supposed to be chairing an investigation into what happened, not being the runner for information to the  After briefing President Trump, Representative Nunes canceled the hearing, denying Americans the opportunity to hear from former Acting Attorney General Sally And Ranking Member Jim Himes was right when he said that ``the Monday hearing last week was, I'm sure, not to the White House's liking.''  He went on to say: ``Since Monday, I'm sorry to say, the chairman,'' Chairman Nunes, ``has ceased to be the chairman of an investigative committee and has been running interference for the Trump White House.''  This is absolutely unacceptable. The fact that we are questioning whether or not several members of the President's Cabinet--not just one, not even just two, but several members of the President's Cabinet, including the President, himself--are guilty of collusion with a foreign government is a downright outrage.  In my home district, the Seventh District of Washington State, I have been receiving numerous calls, hundreds of calls from constituents since day one, saying: How can this be happening in this democracy? How is this possible in America? How do we make sure that our government is representing us and not a foreign entity?  Why is it that somebody would lie about whether or not they had a conversation with the Russian Government if there was nothing to hide?  People are losing faith in the United States It is a crisis of democracy when people can't trust that their government is actually trying to get to the bottom of what is going on and actually representing the interests of the American people.  The White House may have a friend in Representative Nunes, but I want the American people to know that they have a friend in us. We won't back down on our demands. Representative Nunes should recuse himself from this investigation. There is no way we can expect a full and impartial investigation after what has just occurred.  This should not be a partisan issue. Every Member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, should be demanding to know the facts. We are not making judgments. We want to know the facts. If there are facts that we don't know that say, no, there were very legitimate conversations, there was no collusion, then we are done. Why tie up the airwaves with this?  So tonight, as we think about where we are in this debate and we think about the fact that, for 3 months, this administration has been under the shadow of secrecy, under the shadow of mistrust from the American people, there is a very easy way to clear all of the names of the people who are on this list, including the President of the United States, and that is to ensure that we have an independent investigation; to ensure that Representative Nunes recuses himself and steps down as the chair of the Intelligence Committee, given what has happened; and to ensure that, at the end of the day, we remember that the Government of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the Congress of the United States of America, our one duty is to represent the people of the United States of  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.Raskin) for his leadership.

5725,topic-id,953,"Mr.President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to support H.37, a resolution disapproving of the Federal Acquisition Regulation issued by the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space  As is the case in so many of these rules and regulations, it has a really nice name. It sounds really good--the fair pay and safe workplaces rule--but the bottom line is, because of the substance of this rule, it has become commonly known as ``the blacklisting rule.'' Had it been up to me, I would have called it ``the blackmailing rule.'' Let me explain why.  It requires contractors and subcontractors submitting bids on Federal Government contracts to disclose any proven or alleged violations within the last 3 years of 14 different labor laws, plus ``equivalent State laws.''  Now, that may sound reasonable, but it is not. And it is entirely unnecessary. Any competent purchasing manager--again, I come from the private sector, and there are a lot of competent purchasing managers--could readily obtain the information required by this regulation. And, of course, any competent purchasing manager should also always be evaluating the qualifications, integrity, and the past performance record of any kind of potential suppliers.  This rule also has the very real potential of subjecting perfectly innocent contractors to blackmail and extortion tactics during union contract negotiations.  In case anyone thinks I am overstating this threat, listen carefully to the following quote from one union describing an ``ideal message'' their union president should convey to a general manager of a business negotiating a union contract:       Putting it plainly: unless you settle this strike within      the next few days, and the union withdraws its charges--  Those would be those allegations; unless the union withdraws those charges--     you are likely to be marked as a ``repeat labor law      offender,'' one of the highest categories of wrongdoing under      the President's Check this out with your hotshot legal      team.  This union message goes on:       Counting all of its divisions, this corporation has federal      contracts in the hundreds of millions. Do you really want to      jeopardize this pot of gold to save a few hundred thousand      dollars to the union contract?  This is the kind of negotiating tactic that illustrates exactly how this regulation would be used as a form of federally sanctioned blackmail. There would be no due process for contractors wrongly accused. There would be no way for them to defend themselves or avoid being blacklisted.  As if the blackmail potential of the rule isn't bad enough, the Obama administration admitted that the final rule would cost at least $398 million to comply with every single year. And except for the benefit that extortion leverage provides to unions, I can think of no financial benefit to taxpayers or our economy--and neither could the Obama administration, as they were unable to quantify any financial benefit for this rule in their regulatory filings.  In addition to the $398 million annual regulatory cost, the agencies themselves detailed the following regulatory burdens:  The rule will affect over 24,000 contractors. Industry estimates are even higher.  The rule imposes costly reporting requirements on small businesses that many simply cannot bear.  And it also reduces the availability and increases the price of much needed supplies and services, including to our military.  Others have pointed out even more problems with the rule. For example, it does not define what the ``equivalent State laws'' are that have been included in the disclosure requirement. Also, the definition of a violation that is reportable is incredibly broad. It is not limited to government contracts and includes pending and other nonfinal disputes--in other words, mere allegations of wrongdoing.  This, in particular, is a slippery slope. For example, in fiscal year 2016, the National Labor Relations Board received over 21,000 unfair labor practice charges, but more than half of those were withdrawn or dismissed, and less than 6 percent resulted in a formal complaint by the Also in fiscal year 2016, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission received over 91,000 complaints but issued a ``determination of reasonable cause'' in only 3,113--about 3.4 percent of those--and filed enforcement suits in only 114--about 0.1 percent of the 91,000 complaints that were filed.  Various studies report that it costs $2 trillion per year to comply with Federal Government regulations. That is $14,800 per family per year. Of course, no one writes a check for $14,800. Instead, those costs are realized in reduced opportunities, higher prices to consumers, and stagnated wages and benefits for hard-working  Economic growth is the primary component of a solution for many of our country's problems, yet Washington continues to stifle growth by adding layer upon layer of regulation. The blacklisting rule is just one harmful example.  Fortunately, last October, the U.District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued a nationwide preliminary injunction the day before this rule was set to go into effect. The judge issuing the order noted there was merit to the claims that this rule violates statute, exceeds Executive authority, and is unconstitutional. The court found that letting this rule go into effect would cause ``irreparable harm.'' But the case is still pending. Until we act to decisively repeal this rule, a significant burden hangs over our country's contractors and suppliers.  Through the use of the Congressional Review Act, we have the opportunity to reduce that regulatory burden and repair a small portion of the damage done by President Obama's regulatory overreach.  We owe it to the American people and American businesses to start providing them with regulatory relief.  I urge my colleagues to vote yes to disapprove and repeal this very harmful, very costly, and completely unnecessary rule.  With that, I yield the floor.

5844,topic-id,766,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to President Trump's ever-growing risk of personal and business entanglements. They call into question his ability to serve impartially in the interests of the American people. Both he and his administration remain closely linked to private companies and foreign entities whose interests are often in direct opposition to those of the United  For example, we are well aware of the increasing boldness of the Chinese regime and its efforts to extend their economic and military influence. Despite portraying China publicly as a threat to economic growth of the United States, the President has selected Goldman Sachs' executive, Gary Cohn, to be his director of the National Economic That is about one of seven individuals from Goldman Sachs who have been brought into this administration. Mr.Cohn has just sold his $16 million holding in a Chinese bank. This same state-owned Chinese bank also happens to be the largest tenant in Trump Tower in Isn't that a coincidence?  Wilbur Ross, President Trump's choice for Commerce Secretary, presents similar conflicts of interest. As a man who will play a major role in shaping U.trade policy, Mr.Ross continues to hold a stake worth tens of millions of dollars in the international shipping company, Diamond S Shipping Group, a company that not only operates ships that fly the Chinese flag, but those ships also call on ports in countries, such as Iran and Sudan, that are under U.sanctions for being state sponsors of terrorism.  We also know that The Trump Organization was recently awarded sole rights to the President's name for products sold in He had waited 10 years to get those rights. The case was settled just mere days after President Trump's phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when the President reversed his prior stance on Chinese unification and gave a full-throated endorsement to what he termed ``One China'' policy. That was a reversal from what he had done just after the election.  Meanwhile, according to The New York Times, President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was recently negotiating a real estate deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars with a Chinese company closely tied to its government. And while it has been reported that the deal was called off, the fact that Mr.Kushner is continuing to negotiate private real estate deals while serving as a White House employee is deeply troubling.  It was announced last week that Ivanka Trump will now be joining her husband in the White House as an adviser to the President with top secret security clearance. While she has stepped down from her former role at her fashion licensing company that uses the Trump name, her decision to transfer her brand's assets into a trust run by her own brother-in-law--and her arrangement to continue to receive fixed payments from the company--is a matter of serious concern given her role in the administration.  The ever-growing list of valid concerns about the Trump administration's conflicting entanglements are taking place at the same time that the President is proposing $18 billion in reductions for the 2017 appropriations process--while he himself, his daughter, son-in-law, and his Cabinet members continue to benefit off the American taxpayer.  While the President spends millions of tax dollars on securing his residences in New York and in Florida and flying to his so-called southern White House almost every weekend, he is slashing to zero the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative--an absolutely critical program that directly impacts my district and many others responsible for preserving the world's largest body of fresh water from serious and growing environmental threats. What is right about that?  President Trump also wants to eliminate TIGER grants, a highly successful transportation program that provides[[Page H2636]]funding for communities across America with backlogged infrastructure projects that create jobs and produce robust economic benefits. Everyone agrees on that.  He has also called for a nearly $3 billion draconian reduction to foreign operations endangering our national security.

5808,topic-id,2497,"Mr.President, in 2010, when I ran for Congress, all the questions circled around the Affordable Care Every townhall meeting, every conversation, everyone who caught me in the grocery store, everywhere I went there was a conversation about the Affordable Care What is going to happen? Where are things going to go? And there was a lot of concern about it.  The President promised at the time that if you liked your insurance, your doctor, and your hospital, you would keep it, and it would just get better. Prices would go down; options for insurance would go up. There would be marketplaces where more and more companies would rush in, and that would drive the prices down.  Now, 7 years later, the greatest fears of a lot of the Oklahomans I am around all the time have come true. Here is the crisis in Oklahoma dealing with health care: We have the highest rate increase in the entire Last year, our rates went up in Oklahoma 76 percent; the year before that, they went up 35 percent. That is an 111-percent rate increase in 2 years in my Over the course of the last 3 years, insurance companies have left my All 77 counties of Oklahoma now have one insurance carrier left. I met with that insurance carrier before, and they are seriously looking at how they stay functional in Oklahoma in the days ahead, which is a concern to me. There is a possibility that we may have zero on our marketplace in some counties and in some locations in  With a 76-percent increase, I have had some folks who caught me and said: Well, your State didn't expand That is the problem. If you had expanded Medicaid, then it wouldn't have been an issue. Well, I will tell you that a study from HHS has now come back, and they have confirmed that it is true. If our State would have expanded Medicaid, it would have reduced our costs by 7 percent. That means instead of having a 76-percent increase, as we had, we would have had only a 69-percent increase of health care costs in our[[Page S431]]Zero competition, dramatically higher deductibles, dramatically higher premiums--every hospital in my State, rural and urban, has more charity care now and more bad debt now than they had 7 years ago.  Insure Oklahoma, a program we set up a decade ago to take care of people who did not have access to insurance, continues to falter because my State is playing ``Mother May I?'' every year with the Federal Government on whether we can maintain a program that our State had and was growing. Small risk pools are not allowed. People still don't know the price of their health care. Electronic health records still can't talk to each other. There is still a rise in the cost of prescription drugs. We still have overlapping administrative costs on dual eligibles, Medicare and Medicaid, for senior adults. Compliance costs for our doctors, clinics, and hospitals have skyrocketed. Physician-owned hospitals, which we have quite a few of in Oklahoma, have been cut off and limited since 2010 and are slowly struggling just to be able to stay afloat. Fewer doctors are taking Medicare and Medicaid patients.  On the horizon, it gets even worse because most people don't realize that the Affordable Care Act was backloaded and that the worst of the worst of it wouldn't be for several years out. Well, guess what. It is now several years out.  Union households in my State are about to take a major hit with the Cadillac tax that is coming because union households in my State have insurance that is too good, and those individuals will face a tax increase.  The insurance company tax is coming, which is a massive tax increase on insurance companies. They will pass that cost directly down to consumers, so it will go up again. We continue to fight off the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a board specifically set up to be able to cut options for patients if they cost too much. That is still out there on the horizon, not to mention the tax penalties that go up even more next year.  People ask me: Why are you still focused on repealing ObamaCare? Why is this such a big deal? It is because the people in my State are struggling under the negative effects of this, and it has to be dealt with. Let me just give you a couple of real life stories.  An Oklahoman from Altus, OK, in the southwest part of my State wrote me and he said:       Senator Lankford, I came home tonight . . . having finished      cotton harvest and looking forward to celebrating with my      wife and kids. I was greeted at the supper table with somber      news about our health care premiums from my distraught wife.      Our premium is going from $960 a month to $1,755 per month!      That's with a deductible of $6,000. I can't even process how      to handle this. I think I'm through. Done with any hope of a      bright future for my family.  An Oklahoman from Poteau, OK, wrote me and said:       My husband and I have had Healthcare Marketplace health      insurance for the past 3 years. The first year my monthly      premium was over $1,200.00, this year I pay $1,923.84      monthly. Now I get a letter from [my health insurance      carrier] that my monthly premium will [go up next year to]      $3,540.07. That is an increase of approx. 84%. . . . How is      this possible? Why can't anything be done about this?  When individuals ask me about ObamaCare, they say: You are just arguing about something because of disdain for the No, this is what we have disdain for; this is what people are frustrated about: People who work, people who pay for their health care insurance cannot pay their mortgage and their health insurance anymore because they are literally priced out of it. This is what Bill Clinton meant in October of last year when he made this statement:       So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25      million more people have health care and then the people who      are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up      with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.      It's the craziest thing in the world.  I could not agree with Bill Clinton more on that because that is exactly what is happening in  But now, here is what is happening because for years Americans and Oklahomans have said: We have to do something to stop this. It is choking out my family.  We are finally at a point we are going to do something about it, but I have colleagues who are now spreading fear all over the country that suddenly everyone is going to be thrown off their insurance and we are going to have people living out on the streets without coverage.  I have heard on the floor of this Senate that 30 million people could die if we repeal I have heard 20 million people will lose their insurance. I have heard there is no replacement plan, and people will get sick because their coverage will be gone.  Well, let me just go through a couple of those because there are people calling my office and writing me who are very concerned. They are cancer patients, they are diabetics, they are people with long-term blood diseases, they are people who have difficulty getting insurance, and they are being told: All those mean Republicans up there don't like you and don't care about you, and all they want to do is throw you out on the street. When people say that, it couldn't be further from the truth. It may make for good politics, but it is using people who are in a very vulnerable spot in a negative way.  First, let me get a couple of facts straight. This ``30 million'' number that is being thrown around--even past President Obama doesn't agree with that. It is not 30 million; in fact, it is not 20 million. It is 14 million people who gained access to health care coverage, if you count the people who have actually gained coverage and paid for their premiums through the course of the year or have been a part of the expansion of Of those 14 million people, 11.8 million gained additional coverage from Medicaid, not from the exchanges, and, of that, almost 12 million people got expanded coverage from Jonathan Gruber, as one of the architects of ObamaCare, made the statement that from their own studies, the vast majority of those people who were added to Medicaid weren't added to Medicaid because of expanded coverage; they were added to Medicaid because of promotions through advertising. They were already eligible for  So we are talking about 6 million people or so that have been added to it. I am not belittling those 6 million people; that is a lot of people. But it is not 20 million, and it is not 30 million.  So now what? As people address this to me, they ask about what just happened on January 6 when the Senate and later when the House voted to start the legislative process to repeal What happened was we just actually started the process. It wasn't a total repeal. No one has been thrown out. It starts a legislative process.  As we start that legislative process of what is called reconciliation and as we work through that process, it is a very simple process. It starts the opening conversation to work through committees, to work through debate on the floor so that in the days ahead we will bring a full repeal of ObamaCare and a replacement. But that replacement is not going to be a 2,700-page bill to replace the previous 2,700-page bill. It will be a series of solutions, and it will deal with things on a long-term basis.  There was no vote to suddenly end people's health care in one day. This begins a transition point to make sure that we are watching out for those individuals, such as those cancer patients, diabetics, and individuals who are in very vulnerable situations and over the next couple of years will be able to transition to other care. We are watching to make sure this is not some sudden shift for those individuals. There are very vulnerable people who are in health care options right now and need to know that there is still that safety net there for them and that moving forward, we will continue to be able to watch for them.  We want to be able to move a lot of those decisions back to the Quite frankly, that is where those decisions were before. And we want to be able to allow those individuals who are in very vulnerable situations to seek out the doctor they want, to get the options for health care coverage they want, and to have greater access to health insurance, not less.  The people in my State who had been added and who received those subsidies are grateful to be able to have health care, but there are also individuals in my State who can now literally no longer afford to have health care because they have been priced out of the[[Page S432]]market, and they are stuck. ObamaCare moved the system from one uninsured group of people to now another uninsured group of people.  Let me read a statement coming from a person from Oklahoma who said:       My wife and I will be going without health insurance next      year! I do not resent anyone who is able to afford      healthcare, I just resent a government system that causes      [us] to be priced out of the reach of working people.  Why is it we can argue about ObamaCare and people can say those individuals got coverage and people are not paying attention to a whole new group of Americans who no longer have coverage because they literally have been priced out of the market?  Why is it that for the sake of 6 million people, we have affected the cost of health care for millions and millions of other Americans?  We can do this transition. We will do this transition. It will take a couple of years. It is not going to be rapid, and there will be a large debate that will happen nationally in the process. That is appropriate, but allow us to be able to walk through this process together.  One quick illustration and then I will be done. I have a friend who discovered last year that she had mold in her house. Initially, there were some treatments that were done. She had been very sick for a while and didn't know why. They did treatments to the house and such and thought that would settle it. It didn't. Eventually, she had to move out of her own home.  Now they have had to actually strip out the walls and take out all the sheetrock. They are literally replacing studs and everything in the house. It will be a long-term issue to be able to get it all right.  I tell that simple story to say that anyone who says replacing health care is going to be some simple ``spray everything down and that will fix it'' strategy just doesn't understand the difficulties of the American health care system. This will be much like my friend who is having to do a pretty radical transition that is going to take a long time, but that will actually get her house whole and healthy again.  If we want to have a healthy nation again with people who have access to health care, regardless of what class they are in, it is going to take a while to make this transition, and it will be difficult in the process. But I can assure my colleagues that this Congress is watching out for all people, of all ethnicities, of all neighborhoods, of all diseases, to make sure that we are paying attention to this one simple thing: When ObamaCare was put into place, it punished people. We should encourage people to be able to get health care, and we should be able to walk through it with people in their most vulnerable moments and make sure they are able to make personal decisions, have access to their own doctors, have access to hospitals that can afford to stay afloat, and to provide the ability for people to choose their own health care. Why is that so radical? It used to not be.  There are things that need to be fixed, but it begins with giving the power of the decision back to the patient and back to people, where it needs to be.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan). The majority leader.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS430-2.txt,2050,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,24.0,March
5782,topic-id,1167,"Mr.President, the most solemn and serious and consequential act that the United States can undertake at any moment is to make the decision to send Americans into war. From time to time, war may be an unfortunate decision but a necessary decision--a necessary and potentially tragic function of any republic. And it might be necessitated by the need to safeguard the rights and the freedoms of the government's own citizens from foreign states--from those who would harm us. Yet we should enter into those wars and enter into any alliances that could lead to war only after utmost deliberation and strategic consideration, focusing specifically on the well-being of the American citizens--those people whom we are sworn to protect, those people whose safety is at stake whenever we go to war.  That is why, for the past several months, I have asked that the Senate have a rollcall vote on the measure to ratify Montenegro's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty, and that is why I will be casting my vote against expanding NATO later today.  Of course, treaties and alliances with other countries can be beneficial; there is no question about that. But the Founders of this country understood that their seriousness needs also to be considered--that the seriousness of a treaty needs to be taken into account in the same way that you have to consider very carefully the seriousness of going to war, and for the very same reasons. That is why both of these powers--the power to make and ratify treaties and the power to declare and execute war--are given not to one single branch of the Federal Government, but rather they are shared by the legislative and executive branches acting together. In addition to this, treaty ratification requires not just a majority vote, but a two-thirds supermajority vote within the  The United States should enter into treaties and alliances with foreign nations that will enhance the ability of American citizens to exercise their rights and freedoms and to safeguard those same people. At the heart of the NATO alliance is the article 5 guarantee for collective defense, stating, in essence, that an attack against any one NATO ally will be perceived and responded to as an attack against all. This means that the United States is obligated by treaty to make war because of an attack on an ally, and those allies are obligated to us for the same purpose and to the same extent. This, of course, is a very significant agreement. It is one that we should never take lightly. It is never one that we should just assume into existence any time we have a decision to make.  Simply put, I don't see how the accession of Montenegro--a country with a population smaller than most congressional districts and a military smaller than the police force of the District of Columbia--is beneficial enough that we should share an agreement for collective defense. Montenegro becoming a member of NATO is certainly attractive to European countries because it makes the United States the security guarantor of yet another country in a region prone to instability and ethnic unrest, but that doesn't automatically make it of interest to the American people. It doesn't automatically mean that the benefits outweigh any risks to the American people by bringing this country into  On the other hand, I believe the risks could outweigh the benefits to the detriment of the American people and result in more of our servicemembers being deployed overseas and at risk. The resolution of ratification on which the Senate is voting states that ``an attack against Montenegro, or its destabilization arising from external subversion, would threaten the security of Europe and jeopardize United States national security interests.''  This makes NATO responsible not only for external security but for combating destabilization in a historically volatile part of the world. Undertaking obligations like this only increases the likelihood of Americans being placed in harm's way, of our brave young service men and women having to go into a potential field of battle.  Further, expanding NATO does not address some of the systemic problems that U.administrations from both sides of the aisle have long pressed to their European counterparts: the failure of many NATO countries to meet decades-old defense spending obligations and the increasingly concerning behavior of some NATO members.  For example, several weeks ago it was announced that American military personnel are now being used in northern Syria for the purpose of preventing infighting between one of our NATO allies--Turkey--and our Kurdish allies in the coalition against This was followed in short order by a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and the Netherlands--both NATO allies--in which the Turkish President accused the Dutch Government of fascism. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in February rejected calls from the Trump administration, which were similar to pleas from the Obama administration, for European countries to increase their own defense spending in fulfillment of their existing obligations through  Addressing such issues is much more vital to the future of NATO and American interests in Europe than further rounds of expansion.  Finally, some of my colleagues have argued that we should move forward with Montenegro's accession into NATO because the Russians oppose it, just as the Russians have opposed all previous rounds of expansion. This is not the basis for a sound foreign policy. While the United States should not let another country have a veto over our national security decisions, it would be equally unwise for the United States simply to engage in certain actions just because geopolitical adversaries might oppose them. Such reactionary statecraft contradicts the ideals of prudence and practicality that our Founders hoped would guide our foreign policy.[[Page S2027]]  On a more practical level, it still doesn't mean that we should just be willing to put our Armed Forces in a position where our brave young men and women might have to go into harm's way as a result of the fact that a geopolitical adversary takes the opposite viewpoint.  Further, elected officials should not have their patriotism or loyalty to country questioned because of their understandable concerns about national security, treaty obligations, and war. There are many thoughtful leaders and policy experts who have legitimate concerns--both, about Russia's behavior and about the direction of NATO--and who support meaningful pressure against Russia through economic and diplomatic means, as well as the modernization of our strategic deterrent and missile defense systems.  This vote, of course, is likely to pass and Montenegro will become the newest member of NATO this year. It is my sincere hope that the country will be a constructive force in addressing the operational and mission problems that I have described and that the Trump administration will press for needed reforms. But I also hope that American diplomatic leaders and Congress will work to identify and act on the security interests most relevant to the American people and think more strategically about our alliances and treaty partners in the future.

5874,topic-id,4184,"Thank you, Mr. Mr.President, confirming a Supreme Court Justice is one of the if not the most important responsibilities we have as It is a vote we cast knowing full well that the tenure and the influence of the nominee who is before us will likely be greater and much more long-lasting than our own in the  After meeting with Judge Gorsuch and reviewing hours of his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, I have decided to oppose his nomination, and I come to the floor this evening to talk about the reasons why.  I am deeply concerned about the politicization of the Supreme Court and its recent capture by corporate and special interests. I am convinced that Judge Gorsuch would exacerbate that slide and continue the activist bent of the existing Court, and for that reason I won't be supporting him in the vote tomorrow.  There is no doubt that Neil Gorsuch is a well trained, very intelligent lawyer who likely has the right disposition to serve on our Nation's highest Court, but that is not the end of the analysis that I or any of us are required to conduct. I am concerned about Judge Gorsuch's record of putting corporate interests before the public interests. His past decisions demonstrate a resistance on his part to put victims' and employees' needs above those of large corporations. He has regularly sided with employers over workers, corporation's rights over the rights of employees to make personal healthcare decisions. While he admirably claims to rest his decisions on the law rather than his political views, his consistent support for the powerful over the powerless doesn't seem coincidental.  The Roberts Court, in my mind, has swung dramatically in favor of the rights of corporations and special interests over those of individual I would have supported a mainstream nominee, but the risk that Judge Gorsuch will inject his political judgment over a process that already too often favors the rights of corporations over individuals is too great a risk for him to earn my support. That was the statement I released upon making my decision. I wanted to begin my remarks with it.  I want to talk a little bit about the elements inherent in my decision to vote against Judge Gorsuch because I don't take that decision lightly. I have said throughout the beginning of President Trump's tenure that I do believe we owe some degree of deference to a President in making choices as to who will serve him in his administration, and I think that likely applies to the question of whom a President chooses for the Supreme Court as well. I think I voted that way. I certainly voted against many of President Trump's nominees, but I voted for many of the nominees with whom I had very deep disagreements with over policy as well. So it is not a question of whether Judge Gorsuch would be my choice; it is a question of whether I think he is going to be in the mainstream on the Supreme Court or whether I think he is going to be an outlier and bring potentially radical views into the courtroom.  But it is kind of silly for us to pretend this debate is happening in a vacuum. I am making my mind up on Judge Gorsuch, as I will try to outline this evening, based upon my review of his record and my belief about who he will be as a  We would all be lying if we said as Democrats that we don't remember what happened on the floor of the Senate all throughout 2016. Merrick Garland should be on the Supreme Court today, or if not Merrick Garland, someone else who was nominated by President Barack The Supreme Court vacancy occurred with nearly 12 months left in his term--25 percent of a term that he was elected to by the people of the United The Constitution doesn't allow for 3-year terms. It[[Page S2377]]doesn't say the President becomes illegitimate once he hits the final 12 months. The Framers of our Constitution were hopeful that the President would be President for all 4 years. That last year was robbed not just from President Obama but from the American people by Republicans in the Senate when they treated Judge Garland with such disrespect.  It would have been one thing to simply vote against him because you didn't want to let the President of an opposing party fill that seat, but to not even give him a hearing, to not give him a vote, to not even take meetings with him, which was the decision of many Republican colleagues, that was a show of disrespect to Judge Garland that I don't think any of us could have imagined. It was a show of disrespect to this Chamber, to the traditions of this body that those of us who may have supported Judge Garland remember. That bad taste still sits in our mouth.  So I am here to state that my vote against Judge Gorsuch is not payback for the way in which Merrick Garland was treated, but I remember what happened.  To the extent that my Republican colleagues are suggesting that we should vote for Judge Gorsuch or at least vote for cloture tomorrow as a means of upholding the traditions of the Senate--spare me. Spare me. There isn't a lot of interest on this side of the aisle in upholding the traditions of the Senate if we are the only ones doing it.  Some people say: Well, if you voted for cloture on Gorsuch tomorrow and let it go to a final vote, then maybe Republicans would keep the rules as is.  That is belied by the facts. Last year, the Republican majority made it pretty clear that they were willing to break all tradition, all precedent, and all comity in the Senate in order to get their person on the Supreme That wasn't just a 2016 issue; that is the new normal for Republicans in the So whenever Democrats raised an objection to a nominee to the Supreme Court, the rules were going to change because Republicans made it clear that their first priority is to get their people on the Supreme Court and their second priority is to think about and try to preserve the way in which the Senate has run.  I am not voting against Neil Gorsuch because I am mad about what happened, but to the extent that I have heard Republicans in the Senate lecture us about violating the traditions of the Senate, it makes my blood boil because I was here in 2016. I saw what the Republican majority did to Merrick  Maybe we can sit down after this is done and talk about how the Senate just doesn't get into a giant vortex of devolvement, tit for tat, such that all of the reasons why people run for the Senate--the individual prerogatives that Senators have, the demand to find consensus in a way that doesn't exist in the House--all vanish. Merrick Garland is still here, and it would be silly for us to try to pretend he isn't.  One of the reasons I am so worried about Judge Gorsuch is because of his enthusiasm for a brand of judicial interpretation called originalism. It doesn't sound that radical, right, originalism? The idea is that one interprets the Constitution as the Founding Fathers intended it to be; one doesn't place it in the context of today. Simply think to yourself, what would those White men who wrote those words--what would they think about the case before us? What did they mean back in the late 1700s? On its face, it is an absurd way to think about judging cases because so much of what is before a Justice had no relevance and did not exist back in the 1780s, so questions about what these men thought about various questions regarding technology or civil rights are irrelevant because the Framers of the Constitution simply weren't thinking about the same things we are thinking about today.  One of our most famous jurists understood this right from the outset. Justice John Marshall wrote in McCulloch v. Maryland: ``We must never forget that it is a Constitution we are expounding, intended to endure for ages to come and consequently to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.''  Even those who were judging the Constitution at its outset understood that, as the questions presented to this country changed, originalism--the idea that you only look to the thoughts and words and deeds of the Founding Fathers--probably wouldn't be an efficient way to decide cases.  Justice Brennan gave a wonderful speech at Georgetown in 1985 that is worth reading tonight. Justice Brennan said:       We current Justices read the Constitution in the only way      that we can: as Twentieth Century We look to the      history of the time of framing and to the intervening history      of interpretation. But the ultimate question must be, what do      the words of the text mean in our time? For the genius of the      Constitution rests not in any static meaning it might have      had in a world that is dead and gone, but in the adaptability      of its great principles to cope with current problems and      current needs.  He went on to say:       Time works changes, brings into existence new conditions      and purposes. Therefore, a principle to be vital must be      capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it      birth.  It is a wonderful turn of phrase.  He said:       This is peculiarly true of constitutions. They are not      ephemeral enactments, designed to meet passing occasions.      They are, to use the words of Chief Justice John Marshall,      ``designed to approach immortality as nearly as human      institutions can approach it.''  He said:       Interpretation must account for the transformative purpose      of the text. Our Constitution was not intended to preserve a      preexisting society but to make a new one, to put in place      new principles that the prior political community had not      sufficiently recognized.  Senator Klobuchar asked Judge Gorsuch at his hearing if, because the Constitution only uses the word ``he'' or ``his,'' it meant that a woman could not be Well, the Constitution doesn't specifically speak to this question, but if you were an originalist, I can imagine how many of those Founding Fathers would have answered that question. Why? Because they didn't believe that women deserved the right to vote, so why on Earth would they believe that a woman should be President? At the time, Blacks were considered to be subhuman. They were granted three-fifths status in the They were slaves. To read a document only through the lens of a group of White males who did not believe that a woman should be allowed to vote, who did not believe that Blacks were human beings and on equal footing with the rest of us, is to freeze this document in a time and ask us to, consequently, freeze ourselves in that time as well. If you do not allow the document to move, then you do not allow the rest of us to move either.  Originalism is a fraud, and what it has become is a mask for politics.  Now, what do I mean by that?  When you insist on interpreting the Constitution based only on the ways in which the writers of that document viewed the world, you have no way to base decisions in current times that are based on any real text or set of historical facts because, of course, the Founding Fathers had given no thought to many of the most important questions that are presented to us today--for instance, questions about what rights individuals have with respect to government surveillance over their cell phones, which is a question that the Founding Fathers--the Framers of the Constitution--could never have considered. It allows you to, essentially, make it up for yourself because there is no way that you can find a quote from any of the signers of the Constitution as to what they thought about these modern questions. You can spin it any way that you need to.  Originalism is an invitation to bring politics onto the Court because anybody can make up a reason as to why the people who wrote the Constitution would, ultimately, have decided the way that that jurist wants the decision to turn out.  It connects with other troubling writings of Judge Gorsuch's. He proudly calls himself an originalist. Historically, if we look at the broad swath of jurists who have gotten on the Supreme Court, it is not a mainstream school of judicial interpretation, but he has other radical views as well.  The Chevron deference standard is named for a 1984 case in which the Supreme Court held that it should defer to regulatory agencies when they interpret ambiguous laws that are passed[[Page S2378]]by We pass ambiguous laws, sometimes on purpose and sometimes by accident. But we often do it on purpose because we, ultimately, leave it to the regulator to fill in the details--to proffer regulations, to work out the details of enforcement. We often do not define every single term, in part, because we know that there is going to be the executive branch and people working for an elected official--the President of the United States--who are going to carry out that act and, ultimately, be responsible to the people.  What Judge Gorsuch has suggested is that maybe it is time to overturn the Chevron deference standard. Maybe we should not give any deference to administrative agencies any longer. Maybe the Supreme Court, on every single law, should do a de novo review of its constitutionality and give no deference to the executive branch.  First of all, that would be pandemonium. It would greatly accelerate the number of cases that come before the Supreme Court and the number of major--potentially life-changing--decisions that the unelected Court is making. Why? Because we are always passing statutes here that leave room for interpretation. Again, we do it many times intentionally and sometimes unintentionally, but it happens every single month here that we pass statutes that leave room for interpretation.  We often do that knowing, as I said, that the Executive will make some of those secondary interpretations. We are comfortable with that because, if his interpretation goes wrong, then that Executive is never more than about 3\1/2\ years from an election.  The executive branch is responsible to the people. The courts are not. These are lifetime appointments that we make. If every single statute that we pass is interpreted from the foundation by the Supreme Court and if they get it wrong, there is no way to get rid of them. There is no way to roll that interpretation back. In fact, that is one of the reasons for the Chevron deference--the reluctance of the Court to make itself an active political player in the process of interpreting statutes.  So it is radical that Judge Gorsuch is suggesting that, if he were put on the Supreme Court, he would overturn that 1984 case. Justice Scalia was one of the primary defenders of Chevron for that very reason, in that he saw that the legitimacy of the Court--indeed, the legitimacy of the entire judicial system--would be put in jeopardy if it inserted itself as the primary arbiter of ambiguous statutes, of statutes that needed interpretation.  Originalism is an invitation to take your politics onto the The evisceration of the Chevron deference would, inherently, make the Court a political body. If you combine the two together, you will start to see a Justice who will likely continue this trend line of its being an activist Court that makes political decisions in substitute of the  We have all seen it happen, whether it be in the voting rights case, in which the unelected Supreme Court decided that racism was not something that we had to think about any longer due to their vast experience in the South and in dealing with cases of voter suppression, or in their arbitrary decision that corruption should be very narrowly defined and that we need not pay attention to the slow, creeping corruption that happens when donors get access to the political process through donations of thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars. The Supreme Court is telling the people of this country and this Congress what corruption is and what it is not.  Those are political decisions that the Court has made--an activist Court--that now may have among its members a Justice who has, effectively, advertised himself as being willing and eager to join that trend line on the  Individual cases raise concerns as well. In Riddle v. Hickenlooper, Judge Gorsuch expressed an openness in providing a higher level of constitutional protection to a donor's right to make political contributions than the Court currently affords the right to actually vote--donors having more rights than voters have.  As for the result of applying strict scrutiny, which is the term that he is referring to with regard to political donations, we do not exactly know what would happen, but it likely would have the consequence of making it almost impossible to regulate campaign finance. Ninety-three percent of Americans, in a recent poll, think that government should be working to limit the impact that big donors have on politics today. Yet Judge Gorsuch has suggested that, as a Supreme Court jurist, he may move the law in the opposite direction, robbing from both of us--Republicans and Democrats--the ability to do what 93 percent of Americans want us to do, which is to restrict the ability of a handful of billionaires to affect the political process.  In the Hobby Lobby decision, yet again, Judge Gorsuch suggests that corporations, in this case, have more rights under the Constitution than do the individuals who work for them--that the religious freedom rights of the corporation trump the religious freedom rights of employees. Once again, it ruled that those with power--big donors or corporations--have more rights than those with less power--ordinary voters, employees of these big companies.  Years ago, Judge Gorsuch wrote in a complaint, according to him, that liberals were using the Court to try to push their political agenda rather than to bring it here to the The reality is that, over the course of the Roberts Court, the exact opposite has happened. It has been Conservatives who have brought their complaints to the court system--their complaints about voting rights, their complaints about campaign finance, their complaints about the Affordable Care Act--rather than to have brought them to the floor of this body.  As the House of Representatives abandons, for the time being, the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, their allies continue to push cases through the court system that would attempt to unwind it. Judge Gorsuch has been, in his writings at least, blind to this idea that Conservatives have spent just as much time over the past 20 years in trying to push their agenda in court as have Progressives have done that as well.  Clearly, we have full marriage rights in this country because of court cases that Progressive groups push. I am not denying that there is not this trend line on both sides of the political spectrum, but Judge Gorsuch seems to only recognize it in his writings when it comes to the liberals who are pushing these causes.  These are the most important decisions we make. Many of us may only get to vote on a Supreme Court Justice once or twice. This is my fifth year in the Senate, and this is my first vote. My first vote should have come in 2016, but it is coming now in 2017. I do not take it lightly, but there is a reason--when you go back to your apartment here in Washington--that you are watching TV commercials that are paid for by big corporations and billionaires who support Judge Gorsuch's nomination.  He says that he is going to play it straight. He says that he is not going to be affected by his political agenda. I hope that he is right, but the folks who are fronting the money for these ads do not believe him. They think they know how he is going to rule. Believe me. They would not be putting up all of this money on TV if they did not think that Judge Gorsuch was going to be a friend to the big companies, to the billionaire donors who want more and more protection through the court system.  Donald Trump was right about something when he ran for He was not right that elections are rigged, but he was right that, in general, the system--our economic state of affairs--does seem to be pretty rigged against regular people. Economic mobility, which is how we define ourselves as a country, is further away from the people whom I represent in Connecticut than ever before, and the statistics bear that out.  Your ability to move from poverty to prosperity is less today than it has been at any point in our lifetimes. It does feel like the powerful and the rich have recovered very nicely from this recession and that nobody else has. It feels like they have a voice here in Washington that no one else has either.  If you are President Trump, having run on this promise to unrig the system, boy, this doesn't seem like the person you should be sending to the[[Page S2379]]bench, somebody who has openly advertised his enthusiasm for voting with billionaires, with corporations, with folks who have lots of political power already.  The TransAm case, which has been talked about enough on the floor, is a unique one. It is the case of a trucker who was being potentially left to die by his employer on the side of the road, who left his truck to save his life and potentially the lives of others on the road, had he chosen instead to operate it. Judge Gorsuch ruled with his employer, effectively suggesting this man should have risked his life or the lives of others to comply with the strict letter of the law.  Judge Gorsuch was asked in the Judiciary Committee what he would have done: What would you have done if you had two options--sit in that truck and face death or put it back on the road and potentially kill others? What would you have done? Judge Gorsuch said that he hadn't thought about it.  I don't want my Supreme Court Justices to be political. I don't want them to be us. It really is our job to think about, in a real, tangible, grassroots way, the effect of our laws on their lives. But I don't want a Justice who doesn't even contemplate the answer to that question, the impact of the law on regular people. I don't want a Justice who views the law only through the eyes of a group of White men who lived in a fundamentally different world. I don't want a Justice who isn't thinking about how the law applies to people who need a statute's protection, rather than thinking about those who, frankly, don't need the protection of statute because they have been handed a pretty good lot in life from the start.  I am going to oppose cloture tomorrow, and if we eventually get to a vote, I will oppose Judge Gorsuch on final passage.  My final comment is this: When that moment comes, I do hope that our colleagues will think twice about changing the rules of the They had already broken with precedent once in 2016 in a way that I think is unforgiveable. To do it twice in a 24-month period puts this place on a downward spiral that I am not sure we can recover from. If we just want to be the House of Representatives, let's just do it. But there is another way to go, to select a nominee who could truly get bipartisan support.  As my colleague Tim Kaine is fond of saying, there is only one appointment by the President of the United States that needs 60 votes. There is only one person the President picks who needs to get more than 60. That is the Justice of the Supreme Court because it is permanent, because it is important, because it lasts longer than we do. There is probably good reason for that.  Precedent and comity were broken in 2016. I will never, ever forget the disrespect shown to Judge Garland and to everyone in this body, but to double down on that break with precedent, on that break with tradition, by changing the rules of the Senate permanently with respect to Supreme Court Justices--I know they can say that Democrats did it a few years ago. That is true. But the Supreme Court is a different animal entirely, and the decision is one I hope my Republican colleagues will rethink.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

That cancer consists of questions pertaining to the relationship of this administration with  We know that the Russians intervened in the last election with the goal of advantaging Trump's campaign over Hillary We know that there were numerous Trump campaign transition team and administration officials in contact with the Russians--prior to, during, and after the campaign.  We know that there is a pattern of these individuals at first denying such contacts but later, after being forced to come clean, admitting them.  Examples to date include: former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Roger Stone, who admitted that he was in contact with Guccifer 2.0, the hacker that the CIA says is a Russian front for military intelligence.  We know that the Attorney General gave false testimony, deliberate or otherwise, to the Senate regarding meetings with Russian officials.  We know that President Trump has financial ties with Although he denies it, we now know that there are large Russian investments in The Trump The President's son, Donald Trump, Jr., said a few years ago that money was ``flowing in'' from That obviously can have a major influence on the President and on the decisions of his administration.  We know that there was a change in the Republican platform dealing with Ukraine to favor Russia, a change that was engineered by the Trump campaign.  We even know who in the Trump campaign gave the instruction to make this change.  We know that there is an ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI of possible collusion by the Trump campaign in the admitted Russian intervention in the attempt by Russia to subvert the 2016 Presidential campaign.  Knowing all this, it is impossible to ignore or to dismiss questions concerning the credibility of the administration, and, certainly, we must ask questions regarding its legitimacy as well, if there is persuasive evidence that crimes were committed in colluding with Russia to subvert the election.                              {time}  1730  We have a duty to resolve this question, to get answers, to pursue the truth, and to remove any cancer that we may find.  A few weeks ago, the Judiciary Committee considered a resolution of inquiry that I introduced dealing with a number of issues, including the President's conflicts of interests, his possible violations of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, and any information about possible criminal or counterintelligence investigations related to the President and/or his associates. Yet, to date, the Republicans have opposed our amendments and voted down our resolutions of inquiry, in effect, abdicating their constitutional obligation to provide oversight and enforce the law.  Now we have the spectacle of the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee conducting an obvious coverup, failing to share important information with members of the committee--information, I would add, that revealed President Trump's allegations against former President Obama as completely false--while inappropriately briefing people at the White House on the committee's investigation, the very same people who are the subjects of the investigation.  This is so absurd, so inappropriate, and beyond belief that it is tough to accept the reality of the situation. Sadly, this isn't a television drama we can turn off or walk away from. The integrity of our democratic system of government is at stake.  What we need is honesty. The American people must have faith in the integrity of our government, and it is our job to ensure it. It is time for answers.  If there is no evidence of misconduct, then we should move on. But if the truth reveals a conspiracy, if there is proof of criminal conduct, Donald Trump must be held accountable, and the people around him must be held accountable, and we must act.  There is no superior way to get at the truth and to fulfill our duty to the people of this country than to have an independent investigatory commission established beyond any partisan control. So I urge that that be done so that the people of this country can have confidence once again in their government.  ",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgH2550-8.txt,850,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,29.0,January

5823,topic-id,3438,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for her fantastic leadership for the people of Washington in the city of Washington and her zealous advocacy for all of the American people.  Mr.Speaker, let me try to recap some of the themes that we have brought up this evening and talk about what is really at stake here. But I want to start with some good news, because there was really some great news out of Russia on Sunday, where more than 75,000 people across the country braved the tyranny and despotism of their government to go out into the streets to express their commitment to democracy, human rights, and against corruption.  They were focused very specifically on some of the oligarchs who surround Vladimir One of them, Prime Minister Medvedev, it has just been learned, has amassed more than $1 billion, as a public servant, in mansions, in vineyards in Italy, in fancy cars, in jewelry--$1 billion. And the people of Russia are up in arms about the corruption, the kleptocracy, the stealing from the Russian people, which is increasingly impoverished by the imperial designs and the corrupt practices of Putin and his team.  So tens of thousands of people went into the streets to protest. These are brave people, because you are talking about an authoritarian government there, a dictator, a despot, someone who orders out for the assassination of his political enemies. Many of them were arrested. Hundreds of them were arrested in Moscow, and some of them are still in jail right now.  Mr.Speaker, we should be on the side of the protesters in That is who we are as We are a nation conceived in revolutionary insurgency against corruption, against monarchy, against dictators and autocrats and theocrats and kleptocrats who steal from the people. That is who we are.  We should be meeting with them. We should be meeting with the human rights activists. We should be meeting with the anticorruption marchers who are putting themselves on the front lines of history. We should be meeting with the dissenters and the critics of Vladimir Putin and the oligarchs and big business kleptocrats who surround him. But, instead, our government has aligned with Putin himself, with the insiders in That is totally antithetical to the design of America, when you think about it.  Mr.Speaker, we have the great good fortune to go to work every day surrounded by portraits of people who built this country, like George Washington, who is right over there. We have got portraits of Thomas We have got portraits of Frederick We have got portraits of Abraham Lincoln, who actually served in this body and, when he was here, spent a lot of his time railing about a war that was concocted with lies by President James Polk, the Mexican  But Lincoln knew how delicate and precious and precarious an enterprise democracy is. In the Gettysburg Address, he posed the question of how long government of the people, by the people, and for the people can last. Will it perish from the Earth? And he put the question to the people because, he said, it is up to us.  Democracy is a rarity in human history. Democracy is not the norm. That is why America is a miraculous experiment on If you don't do anything, you are going to end up with dictators and despots and kleptocrats who steal from their own people, like Vladimir  But America started a different way. The first three words of our Constitution are ``We, the people.'' We, the people; we flipped the whole design. Before that, the whole theory was that the king had the power, and the king got power directly from God; and everybody was a subject of the king, and everybody served the king.  Our Founders had the vision, in that outburst of enlightenment and enthusiasm, to say, no, we are going to try something different:  We are going to start a government based on we, the people, and we are going to separate church and state; and we are not going to dictate to people their religious worship, and we are not[[Page H2555]]going to dictate to people their political beliefs. There is going to be freedom of thought and freedom of speech.  We don't trust the collapse of all powers into one, which Madison said was the very definition of tyranny. We are going to separate powers. The legislature, Congress, will come first, Article It will represent the people. But then we are going to have someone else execute the laws of the people, faithfully execute the laws of the people. That will be the And when there are disputes, they will be adjudicated in a third branch of government, by the Supreme Court, to figure it out.  But we are going to separate the powers, because when one guy has got all the power, it endangers the freedoms and the liberties of everybody else. We even said, even though our President is limited by the separation of powers, we are going to make sure that the President and also the Members of Congress will have an undivided, zealous loyalty only to the American people.  Article I, section 9 says we cannot accept presents, emoluments, which are any kind of payments, offices, or titles from foreign princes, foreign kings, or foreign states, period. We can't accept them without the approval of It doesn't go.  There were all kinds of powers that were sending spies and saboteurs to Washington, when the country first began, to try to pay off elected officials, but our Founders had the vision to say: No, we are not going to accept that. We are not going to allow payments and bribes and fancy presents being given to our elected officials.  So one government, separated powers, based on public integrity, honesty, and devotion to the people. That is the model here.  Now, we should be on the side of democratic movements all over the Earth, like the people who assembled in Moscow on Sunday, who assembled in Siberia on There were marchers even there. It was like our Women's It took place all over the country. Those are our people. We should be on the side of the people who are trying to overthrow the despotism in  But look what is happening. Tyranny and authoritarianism are on the march all over the world. Russia is the headquarters of it, but you can find it everywhere you look:  Philippines, a madman dictator who thinks he has the power to send his agents out to go and shoot people on the street because they look like they are a drug dealer and brags about it, Duterte;  Hungary, another favorite of Vladimir Putin, Mr.Orban, who is cracking down on press freedom, on human rights in his country;  Iran, authoritarian, theocratic state; people being thrown in jail for blasphemy, for heresy, for apostasy, for religious offenses;  Saudi Arabia, fomenting racist, anti-Semitic propaganda and sending it out, oppressing people based on religion, not even allowing women to drive in their society.  Everywhere you turn, tyranny, despotism on the march.  And Mr.Putin has a plan. How do we know it? Do we know it from the Democratic Caucus or the Republican Conference? We know it from our intelligence agencies, from the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence  Seventeen of America's intelligence agencies came back with a report, and they said Vladimir Putin has a plan to continue to destabilize and undermine liberal democracy all over the world.  Brexit was part of it. The intervention in our election was part of it. They are going after France, where they want the rightwing, ultra nationalist, anti-immigrant campaign of Marine Le Pen to triumph in They are trying to do it in Germany, which is now the strongest outpost of liberal democracy left on Earth, as of yet, uncontaminated by the penetration of Russian intelligence and Putin's agents.  But what did they do to us? What is this all about?  Well, we had an election in 2016. The sovereign people of America had an election. Now, unfortunately, we are still using the electoral college, which is antiquated and obsolescent. There is a movement to change it afoot to the national popular vote. But be that as it may, that is our system. We haven't reformed it yet. It is our system. It is our elections here in But the electoral college makes it more vulnerable because you just have to intervene in a handful of States in order to sway the vote.  What did Putin do? Again, we know this. I am not making this up. We know this from our intelligence agencies. If you don't believe me, you go to your computer and you just look up the intelligence agency report on Russian interference and espionage and sabotage in our 2016 election.  And what did they do?  They spied on different Democratic institutions, like the Democratic National Committee, and they spied on particular people.  They engaged in not just cyber espionage, but cyber sabotage.  They orchestrated a series of leaks which dominated election coverage in the United States for several weeks.  They orchestrated a campaign of fake news and propaganda in order to undermine Hillary Clinton, who was reviled--and is reviled, presumably--by Vladimir Putin because she challenged him, and she challenged the human rights situation in Russia and the involvement of Russia with various dictators in other parts of the world. So they interfered in our election.  When I first got to Congress, that was still being disputed. When we tried to talk about this, it was being said, well, there is no evidence that Russia did this. Well, guess what? The evidence is replete. It is decisive. It is determinative.                              {time}  1800  Now we are not hearing from our friends on the other side: Well, Russia didn't do this.  Now they are saying something different: Well, Russia may have done that. It may have been this massive, orchestrated campaign to undermine and subvert our elections, but there is no proof that that was actual collusion by the Trump campaign.  About that, I want to say two things. Number one, it shouldn't make any difference. Let's say nobody in the Trump campaign knew anybody in Russia and never heard of Vladimir It would make no difference because we should still view this as a radical threat to the political sovereignty of the American people.  But the second answer is even more important. As all of my colleagues were pointing out before, every day we get more evidence not just of contacts and connections, but actual collaboration and cooperation between people in the Trump campaign, the Trump family, and the Trump universe with Vladimir Putin and his closest agents and assets throughout Russia and around the world.  Let's just recap a few of those: former national security adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign, or I guess he was fired by President Trump after he failed to disclose the scope of his contacts with Russians, including Ambassador He was paid more than $33,000 in 2015 by Russian-funded propaganda media, and the full extent of his relationship to the Russians is still being investigated.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from this whole matter because he met several times with Ambassador Kislyak, who has been described as Russia's top spy in America during the 2016 election. Then--I will speak charitably here--he misled his own colleagues in the Senate about it at his Senate confirmation hearing raising the issue and then denying that he had had any contact with the Russians at all.  Senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner met with the Russian Ambassador at Trump Tower a few months ago in December of 2016. We have got former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page, who has admitted that he met with the Russian Ambassador and other Russians in Cleveland at the Republican National Convention and met with managers from Rosneft, the Russian-owned oil company. He himself owns shares of a Russian energy company called  Roger Stone, Trump's longtime buddy and political adviser, was working with WikiLeaks, which published documents during the election based on information divulged because of Russian interference and espionage that[[Page H2556]]tilted the scales again in favor of Trump in the campaign, and he hosted a series on the Russian propaganda network.  Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager for 6 months, was an adviser to Ukrainian oligarchs who got sweetheart business deals from Putin's associates. He was also a business partner of Russian oligarchs close to He resigned in August of last year after reports surfaced that suggested that he had received $12.7 million from Ukraine's pro-Russia former president Viktor He was on the payroll for $10 million, it has just come out, in order to promote the Russian perspective and Putin's propaganda in Washington, D.C., and throughout the United States in order to change the course of U.politics.  Now, I am sorry to put these out there as a bunch of clues. I wish we had a coherent story to tell. We don't, because what we need is a comprehensive 9/11-style independent investigation to figure out what precisely happened. In America you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Nobody is putting any of these people in jail, but it has come out, despite their best efforts in some cases, that they are up to their necks in the Russian connection.  What does that mean for American democracy?  What we know is there was a massive independent expenditure in 2006. That is what we call it under our FEC law when you go out and spend money to try to destroy one candidate and help another. There was a massive foreign independent expenditure orchestrated by Vladimir  The question is: Was it, in FEC terms, a coordinated expenditure? That is, did the Trump team actively work with them?  As we are saying, there are lots of clues that suggest it is so. I am not willing to say that they were definitely in cahoots with them. I am not willing to say that they were necessarily collaborating the election. But the evidence accumulates every single day that points in that direction.  Now every day in Washington, D.C., what we are doing is running around because there is a coverup that has been unfolding. Today, of course, we are dealing with a resolution in the House Judiciary Committee to try to get to the bottom of what Chairman Nunes of the House Intelligence Committee actually did when he ran over to the White House with some information that he had about Trump apparently being picked up incidentally in conversations that were being tapped by the American intelligence community with foreign operatives. Again, it is shadowy because we don't know the whole thing. But what we do know is that Chairman Nunes went to the White House to tell President Trump or his deputies before he told anybody here in  Now, we have been saying from the beginning we want an independent, objective 9/11-style commission--no Democratic politicians, no Republican politicians, and no elected officials. Let's agree on gifted statesmen and stateswomen who can really get to the bottom of this if we care about the truth. Their answer has been: No, we have got the Intelligence Committee to do it instead.  But now what we have got is the Intelligence Committee chair traveling back and forth to the White House, spilling the beans, which undermines everybody's confidence in the integrity of the investigation that is taking place into the Russian connection and what actually happened in the 2016 election.  Mr.Speaker, in the American system of government, elected officials have to have undivided loyalty to the American people. That is why we have got the Emoluments Clause: no presents, no emoluments, no offices, and no titles from foreign governments. That is why we swear an oath to the Constitution of the United States of Each one of us who has the great honor and privilege of coming to Washington, D.C., to represent the people swear an oath to our Constitution and to our people.  We are not a country, like so many, that are defined by one religion. We are not defined by one race. We are not defined by one ethnicity. We are not defined by one political party. We are not defined by one political ideology. We are defined by one That is what unifies us as We must be constitutional patriots here and insist upon our constitutional values and the rule of law for democracy to be meaningful in the 21st century.  There is a new model of tyrannical government traveling all over the world, and all the bullies and despots have found each other. They are in league together. They want government as a moneymaking operation. They want government as a moneymaking operation for private elites in their country, whether it is in Russia or the Philippines or Saudi Sad to say, we are starting to see the development of that right here in the United States of  So we have the opportunity and we have the responsibility to exercise our rights as citizens under the First Amendment and to exercise our privileges as Members of Congress under the speech or debate clause to speak up against the march of tyranny all over the We have got an obligation to resist the corruption--the same corruption that the people in Russia were marching against on We must demand real answers about what took place in our Presidential election in 2016. The intelligence agencies warned us that what happened in 2016 was a dress rehearsal for what is going to happen the next time and the time after that.  I want to say something about the geopolitics of this. Think about it for a second:  Who has got the strongest economy on Earth?  We do, the freest, the original democracy. We have got the strongest economy.  Who has got the strongest military?  We do.  Russia can't come close. But the way I understand what happened in 2016 was that Vladimir Putin--who is not an honest man, but he is a clever man--decided that this was a moment of opportunity for He is the former chief of the Let's not forget that. He is the guy who said that the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century was the collapse of the Soviet He is an irredentist imperialist who wants to go back and reconstruct the Russian empire.  But what he saw was an opportunity, which is that today the whole world is linked, and it is linked by the internet. He created something that I think of as a Manhattan Project for military conquest and defeat of the liberal democracies in the 21st century.  He set about to figure out this question: How can we undermine and subvert the liberal democracies?  These are open societies. America is an open society. We pride ourselves on the First Amendment, on freedom of speech, and on free dialogue and discussion.  So he said to himself: How can I subvert and undermine that?  The answer became very clear: to create--really on the cheap, because compared to military might, this is pennies on the dollar--he was going to create an internet army, in effect, to try to undermine and subvert our democracy with fake news, with propaganda, and with paid trolls to get information out to try to destroy the reputations of opposition politicians and to try to promote the parties that he viewed as ``within his camp.''  Guess what?  It still is going on today. It is still happening. We are not talking about ancient history. We are talking about an ongoing project. That is why I am proud to be a member of the minority caucus here, the Democratic Party caucus, which is insisting that we create an independent, objective, neutral, 9/11-style commission to investigate the Russian connection and what happened with the attack on American democracy in 2016.  We have got to get to the bottom of it. Two-thirds of the American people in public opinion polls say that they support such a commission. There is nobody who would oppose it except for somebody who has got something to hide. But for the rest of us, we have every reason to get to the bottom of this plot to destroy our election in 2016, and we have every reason to defend this great constitutional democracy with everything we have got.

5892,topic-id,1154,"Mr.President, if I could just begin with a hearty ``amen'' to the great words of my senior Senator, it felt like old home week there for a moment, with the quote about the Nebraska sky. My kids--I have one of them with me almost every week in We commute, and I bring somebody with me. Another two of them are almost surely going to be exploring along the Platte River later this afternoon, as happens almost every day. As for the comments about the 1986 campaign between Kay Orr and Helen Boosalis, it was the first time in America that two women had run for Governor of any I worked for Kay, the Republican Governor; it was the first campaign I had ever worked on as a 14-year-old. And then, most fundamentally, were her great words about the Homestead Act and the settling of I am a fifth generation Nebraskan and descended from homesteaders in the exact counties that the Senator was talking about engaged in Jefferson  Our State on its 150th anniversary, looks back on a history built by grit from homesteaders, as Senator Fischer mentioned, to a football team at Memorial Stadium in Today, we celebrate all of those things that make Nebraska special: hard work, resolve, and love and care for our neighbors.  Millions of men and women settled Nebraska when our State was still known as the Great American The Homestead Act made land ownership accessible to anyone--to widows, to former slaves, to immigrants. People of totally different backgrounds could legally own 160 acres of American land, and as long as they worked and lived on that land for 5 years, they would get the deed. Your care of the land is what mattered, not your background, not your status, not your family name, but your willingness to work and to contribute and to feed the world as our State still does today.  Today, Nebraska is the breadbasket of the world, exporting more than $6 billion a year of agricultural products. We have cared about the land for this last century and a half, but we care even more about our neighbors. Two towns tell that story well.  During World War II, North Platte launched a hospitality initiative that reached 6 million American troops as they would head for Pacific and European theaters in World War Folks in the town saw trains stop in North Platte every day and decided that they would cheer those servicemen who were on their way to the war to fight for our freedom.  On Christmas Day in 1941, a young woman named Rae Wilson, a 26-year-old saleswoman, founded the North Platte For 4 years, volunteers would meet each train--full of troops and passing through North Platte--with candy, with fruit, with smiles, with hugs, and with encouragement, thanking those men for how they were going to fight to defend the freedoms that made places like Nebraska and the rest of this Nation great. Some soldiers would go on to become POWs, including the first train of men that went through North Platte on Christmas Day in 1941. They had been sent off by these women of North Platte with food and with encouragement for their fight. Some never returned home. Who knows how much the kindness of those women meant to people from all of the States as they passed through Nebraska on the way to their deployments.  In recent years, that same generosity has shown up in Pilger, In June of 2014, twin tornadoes ripped through this small Nebraska town, killing two and leveling the entire town--destroying 78 buildings. Only in the two corners of the town were structures left standing. Some people might not consider a town of 352 people a top priority, but those folks are not from From all across our State, thousands of volunteers just began driving to this town where tornadoes had destroyed people's livelihoods and their homes, bringing meals and sorting through rubble with people who had been strangers until the volunteers arrived and became family.  Young and old, Nebraskans from all across our State pitched in 2\1/2\ summers ago. One retired teacher would drive 180 miles every day round trip to serve in this community, helping people dig out of the rubble. One little girl sent $70 in from her lemonade stand. Pilger became the town known as the town too tough to die.  When we are not coming together to help our neighbors, we are usually coming together to celebrate Husker football. Our team represents something much bigger than just a typical collegiate sports team. It is about toughness, and it is about community. The Bugeaters, as the Nebraska Cornhuskers were first known in the 1890s, started with a volunteer coach and now boast many Heisman Trophy winners, five national titles, and a sellout streak that dates to October of 1962.  For those of you who think there are football teams in your States--and I say this with all due respect to the Presiding Officer, who comes from a State that has passable football--and for those of you who think you are from States where football is taken seriously, there has not been a seat available to a game in Nebraska since October of 1962. Nebraska has had, by far, the biggest winning streak--the winningest team--over the course of the last half century in American college football.  Nebraskans know and love this team, not just because of the prowess on the field but because Nebraska football is the undisputed champion of Academic All-Americans in the country, having a 43-award lead over the second closest team in the history of Academic All-American Awards and American life.  That is Penn State, not North Carolina, that is in second place, I say to the Presiding  We live, we breathe, and we love our football team. After each Husker win, church attendance goes up, and crime goes down. Literally, for generations, half of the boys in Nebraska grew up wanting to play quarterback for Tom Osborne in the option offense. Why only half, you ask? It is because the other half wanted to play Blackshirts defensive football to smack the snot out of whoever was going to line up against the Huskers on a given  Success on the field is great, but the real reason Nebraskans are so proud of this team is that the Cornhuskers embody the hard work, resolve, teamwork, passion, and sportsmanship of the Nebraska people. While these are the trademarks and hallmarks of our football, they are really the hallmarks of our community associations--of Nebraska's pioneers, of our farmers, our ranchers, our teachers, our small business men and women, our churches, and our Rotary clubs.

5783,topic-id,860,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to talk about the importance of the Senate's vote to ratify the accession of Montenegro into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or I am confident we will see an overwhelming, bipartisan majority of our colleagues here in the Senate support Montenegro's effort to join This is in Montenegro's interest, it is in Europe's interest, and it is in the national security interest of the United  NATO is the most successful security alliance in history, and it is essential to the stability, freedom, and prosperity that Europe enjoys and that the United States has enjoyed, and, really, to that stability that has existed since after World War NATO has provided the security and stability for the freedoms we enjoy and the prosperity. Montenegro's accession to NATO will help the alliance become more resilient, and it will deter Russian aggression on Europe's eastern flank, which is why the alliance invited Montenegro to become its 29th member last year.  I agree that Montenegro is a small country, but it is geopolitically important. Its membership in NATO will complete the alliance's control of the Adriatic coastline, and that will strengthen NATO's southern border.  Since its independence from Serbia 10 years ago, Montenegro has pursued inclusion in Euro-Atlantic institutions, and it has been a good partner to For example, Montenegro has contributed ably to the mission in Afghanistan, which is the only time article 5 of NATO has been invoked. It was after the attacks of 9/11 on the United States, and our response was to go into Montenegro joined us, along with our other NATO allies in this effort. Montenegro also imposed sanctions on Russia for its aggression in  Montenegro's accession to NATO is also critically important for the wider Balkan region, which faces increasing Russian influence and interference. After all, remember that the two major wars of the last century, World Wars I and II, started in the We need to do everything we can to maintain stability there. This is one of the things that I believe Montenegro's accession to NATO will help us do. We saw the increasing Russian influence and the increasing effort to destabilize the Balkans last year in Montenegro's fall elections.  Since those elections, Montenegrin authorities have arrested several people in connection with a coup attempt and a plot to assassinate Montenegro's Prime There is indisputable evidence that ties both violent plots back to Russia, which was trying to eliminate a high-profile supporter of Montenegro's accession to NATO and install, instead, a pro-Kremlin political party there. Montenegrin police are still working with international authorities to locate the suspected Russian masterminds of these efforts.  But when the bipartisan codel from the Senate and House, led by Senators McCain and Whitehouse, went to the Munich Security Conference in February, we had a chance to meet with Montenegro's Prime Minister He told us in very vivid detail about the efforts to assassinate him and about Russia's efforts to install instead a pro-Russian government. Do we really think that Mr.Putin, who desires nothing more than to weaken the NATO alliance, would work so hard to disrupt Montenegro's inclusion in NATO if he didn't think it would strengthen the alliance?  Approving Montenegro's accession to NATO would signal support for Montenegro's independence and sovereignty and for their continued efforts to move towards the West and away from It would also demonstrate our solidarity with countries like Montenegro that Vladimir Putin is trying to bully, especially in light of our own recent experience with Russian meddling in our Presidential election. Now is a critically important time to send Russia the message that we will not tolerate this behavior. Last fall, a bipartisan group of diplomats, national security experts, and former administration officials sent a letter to Congress urging quick action on Montenegro's accession.  Earlier this month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson wrote a letter to Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer detailing the reasons Montenegro's accession to NATO is in our interest and urging that we schedule a prompt floor vote on the accession. Virtually all NATO members have already formally blessed Montenegro's inclusion in the alliance. So it is just the United States that hasn't taken this important step forward.  The case for the Senate to support Montenegro's NATO accession is overwhelming. That is why it is so frustrating that it has taken so long. With Senator Johnson, I cochaired the Foreign Relations Committee hearing on this subject back in September of last year. In December and again in January, the Foreign Relations Committee approved Montenegro's accession protocol, and efforts were made to secure the necessary agreement for the full Senate to do the same. These efforts have been blocked by just a few Senators, despite the overwhelming bipartisan support for approval.  I am glad that Montenegro's accession is finally getting the vote in the Senate that it deserves. The United States has long stood for freedom and democracy in Europe, and I urge my Senate colleagues to stand strong for freedom and democracy now by voting to approve Montenegro's accession to  I yield the floor.

As I have also been saying, it is the people who make Alaska truly special, the Alaskans, people throughout my State banding together to form warm communities in cold climates.

That award is named after Audrey Kolb, who is a legend in the library world in Alaska, and Joyce has that award as well as our award.  Delta Junction, where she lives, is a beautiful community of about 1,000 residents, surrounded by 3 spectacular mountain ranges. The community is about 150 miles from Fairbanks, in Alaska's interior.

Joyce brings all sorts of services and learning to the library, including bands, authors, cooking classes--``what the community wants and needs,'' she said. Sometimes those needs entail sitting someplace warm and reading a book.

5784,topic-id,1746,"Mr.President, last week the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Everything we heard from this nominee confirmed what has been clear from the beginning: Judge Gorsuch is the kind of judge all of us should want on the Nation's highest  Judge Gorsuch obviously has a distinguished resume. He graduated with honors from Harvard Law School and went on to receive a doctorate in legal philosophy from Oxford University, where he was a Marshall scholar.  He clerked for two Supreme Court Justices--Byron White and Anthony Kennedy--and he worked in both private practice and at the Justice Department before being nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, where he has served with distinction for 10 years.  He is widely regarded as a brilliant and thoughtful jurist and a gifted writer whose opinions are known for their clarity. Most importantly, however, Judge Gorsuch understands the proper role of a judge, and that role is to interpret the law, not make the law; to judge, not legislate; to call balls and strikes, not to rewrite the rules of the game.  It is great to have strong opinions. It is great to have sympathy for causes or organizations. It is great to have plans for fixing society's problems, but none of those things has any business influencing your ruling when you sit on the bench. Your job as a judge is to apply[[Page S2028]]the law as it is written--and here is the fundamental thing--even when you disagree with it.  ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge,'' Judge Gorsuch said more than once. Why? Because a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is likely making decisions based on something other than the law. That is a problem. Equal justice under the law, equal protection under the law--these principles become meaningless when judges step outside of their role and start changing the meaning of the law to suit their feelings about a case or their personal opinions.  Judge Gorsuch's nomination has attracted support from both sides of the political spectrum. I think the main reason for that is because both liberals and conservatives know they can trust Judge Gorsuch to rule based on the plain text of the law, irrespective of his personal opinions. Here is what Neal Katyal, an Acting Solicitor General for President Obama, had to say about Judge Gorsuch:       I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will help      to restore confidence in the rule of law. His years on the      bench reveal a commitment to judicial independence--a record      that should give the American people confidence that he will      not compromise principle to favor the President who appointed      him.  The Colorado Springs Gazette recently highlighted a letter signed by 96 prominent Colorado lawyers and judges and sent to the senior Senator from Here is what those individuals had to say about Judge Gorsuch:       We hold a diverse set of political views as Republicans,      Democrats, and Many of us have been critical of      actions taken by President Nonetheless, we all agree      that Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally well qualified to join      the Supreme We know Judge Gorsuch to be a person of      utmost character. He is fair, decent, and honest, both as a      judge and a person. His record shows that he believes      strongly in the independence of the judiciary.  A former law partner and friend of Judge Gorsuch--a friend who describes himself as ``a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates and progressive causes''--had this to say about the judge:       Gorsuch's approach to resolving legal problems as a lawyer      and a judge embodies a reverence for our country's values and      legal system. The facts developed in a case matter to him;      the legal rules established by legislatures and through      precedent deserve deep respect; and the importance of      treating litigants, counsel and colleagues with civility is      deeply engrained in him. . . .       I have no doubt that I will disagree with some decisions      that Gorsuch might render as a Supreme Court Yet, my      hope is to have Justices on the bench such as Gorsuch . . .      who approach cases with fairness and intellectual rigor, and      who care about precedent and the limits of their roles as      judges.  Again, that is from a self-described ``longtime supporter of Democratic candidates and progressive causes.''  During his years on the bench, Judge Gorsuch has had a number of law clerks. On February 14, every one of Judge Gorsuch's former clerks, except for two currently clerking at the Supreme Court, sent a letter on his nomination to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Here is what they had to say:       Our political views span the spectrum . . . but we are      united in our view that Judge Gorsuch is an extraordinary      judge. . . . Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has devoted      himself to the rule of law. He believes firmly that the role      of the judge in our democracy is to apply the laws made by      the political branches--that is, to adhere to our      Constitution and statutes our elected representatives have      enacted, and not to confuse those things with a judge's own      policy preferences.       As law clerks who have worked at his side, we know that      Judge Gorsuch never resolves a case by the light of his      personal view of what the law should be. Nor does he ever      bend the law to reach a particular result he desires.       For Judge Gorsuch, a judge's task is not to usurp the      legislature's role; it is to find and apply the law as      written. That conviction, rooted in his respect for the      separation of powers, makes him an exemplary candidate to      serve on the nation's highest court.  That is the unanimous opinion of 39 of Judge Gorsuch's former law clerks, whose political views in their own words ``span the spectrum.'' Unfortunately, no amount of testimony in favor of Judge Gorsuch will ever be enough for some Senate  The Senate minority leader took to the floor last week to announce a determination to oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination. He also announced his determination to push for a filibuster of Judge Gorsuch's nomination. The minority leader's reasons? Well, for starters, the minority leader apparently doesn't trust that Judge Gorsuch will use the bench to implement the leader's preferred policies. He disagrees with some of Judge Gorsuch's decisions, and he apparently considers that sufficient grounds to bar Judge Gorsuch from the Supreme The minority leader demonstrated little interest in whether Judge Gorsuch's legal interpretations were correct. For the minority leader, judging is about getting one's preferred outcome, irrespective of what the law actually says.  The minority leader also mentioned another reason for opposing Judge Gorsuch: He doesn't trust the judge to be independent or impartial, even though liberals and conservatives alike have praised Judge Gorsuch's independence and impartiality as two of his defining characteristics.  The minority leader also made the laughable claim that Judge Gorsuch is somehow out of the judicial mainstream. Well, let me quote what the Wall Street Journal said on this subject. In February, the Journal wrote:       Judge Gorsuch has written some 800 opinions since joining      the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006. Only 1.75 percent      (14 opinions) [out of 800] drew dissent from his colleagues.      That makes 98 percent of his opinions unanimous even on a      circuit where seven of the 12 active judges were appointed by      Democratic Presidents and five by  Let me repeat that last line: ``That makes 98 percent of his opinions unanimous even on a circuit where seven of the 12 active judges were appointed by Democratic Presidents and five by Republicans.''  Well, I wonder if the minority leader intended to suggest that the entire Tenth Circuit is composed of extremist judges or that all of the judges on the Tenth Circuit lacked impartiality or independence, because, logically speaking, if you are going to suggest that Judge Gorsuch is an extremist, then you would have to argue that his colleagues who agreed with his opinions 98 percent of the time are extremists too.  The truth is, Democrat opposition to Judge Gorsuch has zero to do with whether Judge Gorsuch meets the qualifications of a Supreme Court It is obvious that the judge has all the qualifications one could want in a Democrats are opposing Judge Gorsuch because they are mad. They are mad that their party didn't win the Presidential election, they are mad that their party doesn't have control of Congress, and they are mad that they are having to consider a judge nominated by a Republican It doesn't matter how qualified Judge Gorsuch is, how impartial he is, how independent he is, some Democrats are just going to oppose him anyway.  This isn't the first time Judge Gorsuch has been before this body. Back in 2006, the Senate considered Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Tenth At that time, the judge's nomination sailed through the Both of his home State Senators--one a Republican and one a Democrat--supported his nomination, and he was confirmed by unanimous vote. Then-Senator Obama could have objected to the nomination, but he didn't. The current minority leader, who was serving in the Senate at that time, could have objected to the nomination, but he didn't. Senators Biden or Clinton could have objected to the nomination, but they didn't. Why? Presumably because they saw what almost everybody sees today: that Judge Gorsuch is exactly the kind of judge we want on the bench--supremely qualified, thoughtful, fair, and impartial. It is incredibly disappointing that some Democrats are now planning to oppose this eminently qualified Supreme Court nominee simply because they can't deal with losing an election.  The Senate has a 230-year tradition of approving Supreme Court nominees by a simple majority vote. There has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in 230 years, and the only ones who have ever attempted one are the Well, some Democrats may follow the minority leader in opposing Judge I am hopeful that others will listen to the many voices, liberal and conservative, speaking out in support of his nomination.[[Page S2029]]  There is no good reason to oppose Judge Gorsuch, and there is every reason to support him.

Quite a milestone.  I was chairing a subcommittee hearing this morning and was not able to be on the floor during the majority leader's remarks, and so I take a moment to now pay tribute to Senator Cochran at this milestone in his career and in the history of the  Most Senators do not know Senator Cochran and I were born in the same small town. We are both natives of Pontotoc, We are alumni of the same university. We are both Ole Miss We also share the same political lineage in Mississippi of being early pioneers in the development of the Republican I was the first Republican Member of the House of Representatives in my congressional district, the First District of Mississippi, back in 1994. Senator Cochran[[Page S1571]]blazed an even more significant trail by becoming the first popularly elected Republican Senator from Mississippi back in 1978--in over a century. He succeeded former President pro tempore Jim Eastland, of  I have been able to watch him and be somewhat of a teammate over the decades, and I just want to pay tribute to Thad Cochran as being a trailblazer for quite some time. This is a milestone, and it is a testament to the proven record that Senator Cochran has built over 38 years in this He served for 6 years in the House prior to that, so he has been around a long time. He has always been a good public servant. He has always been a strong He has always been a good member of the troop.  He is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and a lot of funds are distributed through that committee. He is part of the team, and his committee is part of the team. Again, a lot of our colleagues do not realize this, but we set budget numbers--the House and We come to an agreement, and we set those spending levels. Then the Appropriations Committee, under the leadership of Thad Cochran, does the hard work of figuring out how to abide by those budget caps, and they do it year in and year out. With leadership like Senator Thad Cochran's, usually, the numbers are crunched, and they make it work on a bipartisan basis. Many of the votes in the Appropriations Committee last year, under the leadership of Chairman Cochran, were unanimous votes or virtually unanimous votes.  At the same time, he has been able to, within the constraints of those budget caps, take care of the needs of our country and certainly the needs of our State of Mississippi at some very dark moments in the history of our Hurricane Katrina--the worst natural disaster in recorded history ever to hit the North American Continent--was visited upon our State, and we were certainly fortunate to have the leadership of Senator Thad Cochran, and I was glad to be his partner in that regard. After Deepwater Horizon, the entire gulf coast region--and in fact the entire Nation--benefited from the leadership of Senator  He makes us proud, and he has made us proud for years and years now. He was called by someone the ``quiet persuader,'' and that nickname has stuck and has been appropriate for quite some time. Throughout his time in Congress, indeed, Thad Cochran has been the quiet persuader. Not a lot of demagoguery, not a lot of arm-waving, not a lot of rhetoric comes from this desk in front of me--but leadership and resolve and taking care of business on behalf of the United States of  Before he was a Congressman, Thad Cochran was a successful young lawyer, and before that, he was a member of the He served our country well. Before that, he was perhaps the most outstanding law student with perhaps the highest grade point average ever in the history of the ``Ole Miss'' law school. So he has made us proud in so many ways.  Although I was not able to be on the floor at the moment when Senator McConnell made this recognition, I did want to come, now that I have a moment or two, and add my words of encouragement and congratulations to Thad Cochran, but also my words of appreciation on behalf of a grateful State and a grateful Nation for the many ways in which Thad Cochran has made us a better and a stronger country.

The first story is the original Underground Railroad, and the other story is of Josiah  Students across the country have heard stories about the Underground Railroad during the Antebellum Period; however, there was a Road to Freedom that existed before the United States was even established, and that road went south to the free territory of Spanish In fact, the National Park Service held its sixth annual Underground Railroad Conference in Augustine in 2012 to highlight this very story which started with eight recorded families seeking freedom in 1608 in  During this period, thousands of men, women, and children fled from the colonies of North Carolina, South Carolina, and These individuals headed to Florida to gain their freedom thanks to the Edict of 1693, which was issued by the then-Spanish Government that stated that any man, woman, or child who found their way to Spanish Florida would be granted freedom.  The people at the heart of this story are the Gullah Geechee who trace their lineage to West Once free in Florida, the Gullah Geechee people thrived, establishing communities, forts, and deep roots throughout Florida's Third Congressional District, roots that still can be felt today.  The second story is of Josiah He was a man who was born into slavery in 1842 in He worked as a slave. The Civil War broke out, and he was conscripted by the Confederate Army to serve as a cook in the Civil He got freed by the Union soldiers, served with the Union soldiers, and after the war, he moved to Florida to fight in the Seminole American wars. During that time period, the war ended, and he moved to Gainesville, Florida, where he became the first African-American mayor of our city where I come from.  During that time, he became a very successful businessperson. He was elected to the Florida Assembly, and then later he was elected to the U.Congress, serving in this very body here today. His elections got challenged, and he lost his role as a Representative in the He ran again the next year, won again, and served a full term. Then the third term he ran, he won again. His election got challenged by a Confederate soldier, and he lost his seat.  He went on to become a prominent businessman in north central Florida, owned a farm, and was very successful until the freeze of 1906, which put him out of business. He moved to Tallahassee and became a newspaper owner and printed a local newspaper.  He rose to prominence, but at his death, he was but a footnote in the histories not just of our State, but of our country. Here is a man that was born into slavery, rose to prominence, and was forgotten by history.  I tell these stories because these stories, like many stories in our early history, must never be forgotten and must be remembered by our history lest we repeat it. It must also be taught to our children so that they are inspired and they see themselves in the history books like these other folks.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgH1361.txt,2115,AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH,2017.0,28.0,March
