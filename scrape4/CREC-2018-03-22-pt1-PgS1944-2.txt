                     TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY P. CAMPBELL

 Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and 
extend my sincerest congratulations and happy birthday wishes to 
Dorothy P. Campbell, who will celebrate her 100th birthday on March 23, 
2018.
  Dorothy was born in Langdon, NH, on March 23, 1918, to Frank and 
Frances Pelton. On October 4, 1936, Dorothy married Rodney H.J. 
Campbell, and together, they raised 11 children in the same town where 
Dorothy was born. Dorothy is extremely proud of her 32 grandchildren, 
44 great-grandchildren, and 20 great-great-grandchildren.
  Dorothy spent several years as a homemaker before beginning work as a 
spinner in a local mill. Dorothy also drove a school bus before her 
retirement. Today Dorothy spends her free time playing cribbage, 
completing puzzles, reading, and crocheting. In the last 10 years, 
Dorothy has crocheted nearly 160 blankets for each of her family 
members and for several charities. As an active member in her 
community, Dorothy is involved in the Congregational Church, the 
Langdon Community Club, and the Warren Pond Grange.
  I hope you join me, Dorothy's friends and family, and many people in 
the town of Langdon and across the Granite State in wishing Dorothy 
Campbell a very happy 100th birthday.
