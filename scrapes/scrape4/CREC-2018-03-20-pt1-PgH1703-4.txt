                           BOOTS TO BUSINESS

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of 
the Boots to Business program.
  Running a small business requires a wide variety of skills. One day 
you are the company's accountant, the next day you are researching 
marketing strategies.
  Many of our servicemembers have the temperament and experience to 
excel as small-business owners and entrepreneurs, but they lack the 
industry-specific skills to turn their dream into a reality.
  The Boots to Business program helps bridge this gap by offering 
exiting servicemembers and spouses a 2-day in-person course on business 
ownership, followed by more in-depth instruction through an 8-week 
online course.
  Since the program launched in 2013, more than 50,000 servicemembers 
and spouses have participated, learning how to start and grow 
businesses and, thereby, grow our economy.
  This month, I introduced the bipartisan Veteran Entrepreneurship 
Training Act with my friend from Iowa, Congressman Rod Blum. The bill 
would codify the Boots to Business program. Our veterans serve our 
country with honor. They deserve our support as they transition from 
military to civilian life. I urge my colleagues to join me on this 
bipartisan effort.
