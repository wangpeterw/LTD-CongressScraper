                        RECOGNIZING LARRY HANSON

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
Larry Hanson's 42 years of public service, including 22 years as the 
longest serving city manager for Valdosta, Georgia.
  Members of the Valdosta City Council say that appointing Mr. Hanson 
to city manager was one of the most important events in recent history 
for the community.
  One of Mr. Hanson's first initiatives after becoming city manager was 
to hire a new police chief, fire chief, city engineer, and reorganize 
the entire city marshal office. A testament to his efforts, he received 
countless awards, including Outstanding Public Official and Georgia 
Trend Magazine Excellence in Public Service.
  On December 8, Mr. Hanson will officially retire from his position as 
Valdosta city manager. The next city

manager will certainly have large shoes to fill.
  In Mr. Hanson's next move, he will become the executive director for 
the Georgia Municipal Association, overseeing 500 Georgia cities, which 
I am sure will benefit from his assistance.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Larry on his years of public service, and 
best wishes for his future endeavors.
