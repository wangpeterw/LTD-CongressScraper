              HONORING FORMER CONGRESSMAN MAURICE HINCHEY

  (Ms. SLAUGHTER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of 
Maurice Hinchey. He was an extraordinary friend who had the courage to 
take on all of the tough issues.
  We served 4 years together in the New York State Assembly and 20 
years together in Congress. I watched him do what he did best: defend 
the constituents and the land that he represented.
  He is remembered as an environmental hero for his promotion of 
renewable energy and for sounding the alarm on the risks of hydraulic 
fracturing. Maurice did more to support the natural resources of the 
Catskill Mountains and Hudson Valley than anyone else.
  From his efforts to clean up the Hudson River to the establishment of 
the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area, his legacy will endure.
  To the millions of visitors who enjoy the Catskill Mountains or 
explore the Hudson Valley, you have a champion to thank. His name was 
Maurice Hinchey.
