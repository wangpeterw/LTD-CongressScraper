              NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I have supported and continue to support 
increased Federal funding for the promising research going on at the 
National Institutes of Health in order to encourage more progress 
addressing the Alzheimer's situation.
  November is National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. There are 
an estimated 5.5 million Americans living with this debilitating 
disease, and we know it often goes unreported or undiagnosed.
  This issue is near and dear to my heart because it has touched my own 
family, and I have seen firsthand the challenges of supporting a loved 
one battling the disease. I have been frustrated by the lack of 
progress.
  Again, Mr. Speaker, together, we will improve the quality of life for 
those who are suffering and work toward finding a cure. We must have 
funding for the NIH to get this done.
