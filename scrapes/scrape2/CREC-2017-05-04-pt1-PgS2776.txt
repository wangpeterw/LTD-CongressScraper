                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS

                                 ______
                                 

SENATE RESOLUTION 154--PROMOTING AWARENESS OF MOTORCYCLE PROFILING AND 
    ENCOURAGING COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION WITH THE MOTORCYCLE 
    COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO PREVENT INSTANCES OF 
                               PROFILING

  Mr. JOHNSON (for himself and Mrs. Shaheen) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 154

       Whereas motorcycle ridership has continued to increase over 
     time with registrations growing from 3,826,373 in 1997 to 
     8,600,936 in 2015;
       Whereas, as of August 2016, the ongoing National Motorcycle 
     Profiling Survey 2016, conducted by the Motorcycle Profiling 
     Project, found that approximately \1/2\ of the motorcyclists 
     surveyed felt that they had been profiled by law enforcement 
     at least once;
       Whereas motorcycle profiling means the illegal use of the 
     fact that a person rides a motorcycle or wears motorcycle 
     related apparel as a factor in deciding to stop and question, 
     take enforcement action, arrest, or search a person or 
     vehicle with or without legal basis under the Constitution of 
     the United States;
       Whereas complaints surrounding motorcycle profiling have 
     been cited in all 50 States;
       Whereas nationwide protests to raise awareness and combat 
     motorcycle profiling have been held in multiple States;
       Whereas in 2011, Washington signed into law legislation 
     stating that the criminal justice training commission shall 
     ensure that issues related to motorcycle profiling are 
     addressed in basic law enforcement training and offered to 
     in-service law enforcement officers in conjunction with 
     existing training regarding profiling;
       Whereas reported incidents of motorcycle profiling have 
     dropped approximately 90 percent in the State of Washington 
     since the 2011 legislation was signed into law; and
       Whereas in the spring of 2016, Maryland became the second 
     State to pass a law addressing the issue of motorcycle 
     profiling: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) promotes increased public awareness on the issue of 
     motorcycle profiling;
       (2) encourages collaboration and communication with the 
     motorcycle community and law enforcement to engage in efforts 
     to end motorcycle profiling; and
       (3) urges State law enforcement officials to include 
     statements condemning motorcycle profiling in written 
     policies and training materials.
