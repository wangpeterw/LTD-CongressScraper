  CONGRATULATING GRANDVIEW HIGH SCHOOL BOYS AND GIRLS BASKETBALL TEAMS

  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize both the 
Grandview High School boys and girls basketball teams. These two teams 
from Grandview are now the State of Colorado's 5A high school 
basketball champions.
  The Grandview boys basketball team had a spectacular season, 
finishing the season with an impressive 24-4 record, and the 
culmination of the season was its first-ever boys basketball State 
Championship title.
  The Grandview girls basketball team also had a tremendous season, 
finishing with an equally impressive 25-3 record, and the culmination 
of its season was its second consecutive girls basketball State 
Championship title.
  The teams were led to their respective championship titles by their 
coaches: Josh Ulitzky for the girls team, and Michael Rogers for the 
boys team.
  I also commend these two coaches, their coaching staffs, and all 
their supporters at Grandview High School for all they have contributed 
to the success of the school's boys and girls basketball programs.
  I am incredibly proud to represent Grandview High School in the 
United States House of Representatives. Again, congratulations to the 
Grandview High School girls and boys basketball team on this impressive 
victory in Colorado's 5A State Championship.
