                  OBAMACARE FAILED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare has failed the 
American people destroying jobs. All across South Carolina, premiums 
have skyrocketed, small-business jobs have been terminated, and our 
State is now down to a single insurance provider on the exchange. This 
is not what families were promised 7 years ago.

those with preexisting conditions, returns power to the States, allows 
young adults to remain on their parents' insurance until they are 26,

  I am grateful that the American Health Care Act is supported by the 
NFIB, the Susan B. Anthony List, Americans for Tax Reform, the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, the National Taxpayers Union, the Institute for 
Liberty, the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, and dozens of 
other advocates promoting creating jobs.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
