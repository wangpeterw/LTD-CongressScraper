             HONORING THE LIFE OF VIETNAM HERO THOMAS COREY

  (Mr. MAST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I dedicate my time today to a man whom I am 
honored to represent in Congress. His name is Mr. Thomas Corey, a 
decorated Vietnam hero who proudly served our country as a combat 
infantryman.
  During the 1968 Tet Offensive, he received an enemy round in the neck 
that struck his spinal cord, leaving him paralyzed, a quadriplegic for 
life. But with true American grit, that did not stop him from 
dedicating his life and his work to our veterans and to our country. He 
was a tireless patient advocate, working on medical research and family 
support for disabled veterans.
  Mr. Corey returned to Vietnam 16 times, promoting reconciliation for 
individual veterans, accounting for those missing in action, and to 
study the health effects of Agent Orange. For these extraordinary 
efforts, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. He was also the 
first recipient of the Vietnam Veterans of America Commendation Medal, 
their highest award for service.
  Mr. Corey, your Nation is grateful to you. I am grateful for you. 
America is proud and blessed to have men like you who never stop 
fighting for this country on and off the battlefield. And, Mr. Corey, I 
salute you.
