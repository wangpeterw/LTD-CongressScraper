                         HONORING ISRAEL BONDS

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am so honored that the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) is here to listen to this important 1 minute, 
as he always does.
  Israel Bonds recently hosted its annual award ceremony at the 
Fontainebleau Hotel located in Miami Beach, in my congressional 
district.
  For over 30 years, Mr. Speaker, Israel Bonds has honored members of 
the Jewish community from all over the country who have made an 
incredible impact on the U.S.-Israel relationship and who have helped 
make Israel's economy one of the world's strongest.
  I have had the privilege of working with Israel Bonds over the years 
and the many individuals who helped make its mission such a success.
  One of those individuals, who I know is a friend of the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), Alex Halberstein, was honored with the 
Israel69 Award for his commitment to strengthening the economy of the 
democratic Jewish State of Israel.
  Mr. Speaker, Alex is the chairman of Israel Bonds for south Florida. 
Alex and his wife, Monique, are deserving of such a high honor. I 
congratulate them both for such a tremendous achievement.
