                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Faithful Father, as our lawmakers face the challenges of this day, 
infuse their minds with a renewed sense of how much You have invested 
in them. Lead them to live for Your glory, embracing Your vision for 
our Nation and world. Lord, guide and inspire them with the great plans 
You want to accomplish through their work. May the knowledge that You 
are with them eviscerate fear, for You are our Lord and Savior.
  Help us all to surrender to Your transforming power so that Your will 
may be accomplished on Earth, even as it is done in Heaven.
  And, Lord, bless our wonderful pages as they prepare to leave Capitol 
Hill.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
