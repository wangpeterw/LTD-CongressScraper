                HONORING DR. ROBERT ``BOB'' BILLINGSLEA

  (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dr. 
Robert ``Bob'' Billingslea of Orlando, who passed away on Friday, 
September 1.
  Dr. Billingslea was the founding executive of Walt Disney's Corporate 
Urban Affairs and Development department, and served as its vice 
president until his retirement in 2012. In this position, he led the 
company's minority outreach efforts, and was a firm believer that 
diversity drives growth, creativity, and innovation.
  Bob's unwavering commitment was evident by his service. He served on 
numerous organizations and boards, including Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities, Boys and Girls Clubs, and founded the 
Orlando Urban League, to name a few.
  When Bob walked into a room, people noticed; and when Bob spoke, 
people listened. Bob Billingslea was smart, impactful, and 
unforgettable. He made a difference.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing time for this tribute as we 
celebrate the life of Dr. Bob Billingslea.
