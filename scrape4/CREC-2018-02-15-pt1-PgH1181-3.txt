                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  We thank You, O God, for giving us another day. Enlighten the hearts 
of those who are faithful and tireless in securing equal justice under 
the law. Fulfill the hopes of those who long for peace and security for 
their children. Guide and protect all elected officials and all who 
choose to serve this Nation and their local communities through public 
service.
  May Your will be done in and through the Members of this people's 
House, those who trust in Your divine guidance and those, as well, who 
rely upon the gifts You have endowed them with. Even in the midst of 
conflicting opinions and philosophical differences, may they strive to 
come to mutually beneficial ends.
  Unite Your people and keep them focused on the essentials that 
reflect Your kingdom. May the fire of divine love and human freedom 
renew the face of the Earth.
  May all that is done today be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
