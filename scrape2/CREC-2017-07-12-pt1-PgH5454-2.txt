     agree with the recommendation for classification submitted by 
     the manufacturer or importer, the response shall include a 
     detailed description and justification for such 
     determination. Within 30 calendar days after granting such a 
     request, the Secretary shall publish a notice in the Federal

     SEC. 809. GAO STUDY OF ISSUES REGARDING FIRST CYCLE APPROVALS 
                   OF GENERIC MEDICINES.

       (a) Study by GAO.--The Comptroller General of the United 
     States shall conduct a study to determine the following:
       (1) The rate of first cycle approvals and tentative 
     approvals for applications submitted under section 505(j) of 
     the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)) 
     during the period beginning on October 1, 2012, and ending on

     tentative approvals shall be determined and reported per each 
     GDUFA cohort year during this period.
       (2) If the rate determined pursuant to paragraph (1) for 
     any GDUFA cohort year is lower than 20 percent, the reasons 
     contributing to the relatively low rate of first cycle 
     approvals and tentative approvals for generic drug 
     applications shall be itemized, assessed, and reported. In 
     making the assessment required by this paragraph, the 
     Comptroller General shall consider, among other things, the 
     role played by--
       (A) the Food and Drug Administration's implementation of 
     approval standards for generic drug applications;
       (B) the extent to which those approval standards are 
     communicated clearly to industry and applied consistently 
     during the review process;
       (C) the procedures for reviewing generic drug applications, 
     including timelines for review activities by the Food and 
     Drug Administration;
       (D) the extent to which those procedures are followed 
     consistently (and those timelines are met) by the Food and 
     Drug Administration;
       (E) the processes and practices for communication between 
     the Food and Drug Administration and sponsors of generic drug 
     applications; and
       (F) the completeness and quality of original generic drug 
     applications submitted to the Food and Drug Administration.
       (3) Taking into account the determinations made pursuant to 
     paragraphs (1) and (2) and any review process improvements 
     implemented pursuant to this Act, whether there are ways the 
     review process for generic drugs could be improved to 
     increase the rate of first cycle approvals and tentative 
     approvals for generic drug applications. In making this 
     determination, the Comptroller General shall consider, among 
     other things, options for increasing review efficiency and 
     communication effectiveness.
       (b) Completion Date.--Not later than the expiration of the 
     2-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, 
     the Comptroller General shall complete the study under 
     subsection (a) and submit a report describing the findings 
     and conclusions of the study to the Secretary, the Committee 
     on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, and 
     the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of 
     the Senate.
       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:
       (1) The term ``GDUFA cohort year'' means a fiscal year.
       (2) The term ``generic drug'' means a drug that is approved 
     or is seeking approval under section 505(j) of the Federal 
     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)).
       (3) The term ``generic drug application'' means an 
     abbreviated new drug application for the approval of a 
     generic drug under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
     and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)).
       (4) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health 
     and Human Services.
       (5)(A) The term ``first cycle approvals and tentative 
     approvals'' means the approval or tentative approval of a 
     generic drug application after the Food and Drug 
     Administration's complete review of the application and 
     without issuance of one or more complete response letters.
       (B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``complete 
     response letter'' means a written communication to the 
     sponsor of a generic drug application or holder of a drug 
     master file from the Food and Drug Administration describing 
     all of the deficiencies that the Administration has

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. Walden) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Oregon?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2430, the FDA 
Reauthorization Act--FDARA--of 2017.
  While it may not be headline news, for almost a year now, the Energy 
and Commerce Committee has been working in a bipartisan fashion on this 
critical legislation which will build on the landmark 21st Century 
Cures Act. The FDARA will ensure that innovative and lower cost 
treatments, as well as lifesaving medical technologies, reach patients 
sooner.
  Last month we reported this bill out of committee on a 54-0 vote. 
Unanimously, Mr. Speaker.
  For starters, the FDARA updates and reauthorizes four user fee 
programs at the Food and Drug Administration. Though they sound like 
just another set of wonky Washington acronyms, the UFAs, as they are 
called--user fee agreements--are absolutely critical to the Food and 
Drug Administration's timely and consistent review of brand and generic 
drugs, biosimilars, and medical devices. They also maintain the 
agency's gold standard of patient safety.
  Before the generic drug user fee program was established 5 years ago, 
there were literally thousands of applications pending at that agency--
thousands. Significant strides have been made to clear that backlog, 
and the FDARA will build on that progress so that generics come to 
market as soon as safely possible. Make no doubt about it, this bill 
will increase competition and it will provide lower cost alternative 
medications to patients.
  Through a series of hearings and markups at the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, Members on both sides of the aisle proposed a number of 
additional provisions to improve the processes at the FDA and to 
strengthen this legislation in ways that will benefit patients, medical 
product manufacturers, and the agency itself.
  For example, my colleague from Oregon (Mr. Schrader), who I know is 
on the floor, partnered with the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) 
on meaningful ways to incentivize generic entry into markets where 
competition was lacking and patients were being exploited by bad 
actors. I thank them for their work on this effort. Their work will 
save patients money, and their work will get new products into the 
market sooner.
  In addition, there are a number of improvements to the regulation of 
various medical technologies that will expand access, that will 
streamline bureaucratic processes, and that will lower costs.
  Further, this legislation includes provisions that have been 
championed by Republicans and Democrats alike in both Chambers 
throughout their discussions on the user fee agreements, including a 
range of improvements to the pediatric drug and device development 
process, and guidance on ways to expand patient access to clinical 
trials.

[[Page H5478]]

  Finally, this legislation includes a revised version of the RACE for 
Children Act that Representatives McCaul, Mullin, and Butterfield have 
worked tirelessly on for quite some time.
  H.R. 2430 is the product of significant bipartisan and bicameral 
discussions with a wide range of stakeholders that went throughout 
regular order at the committee after a series of substantive hearings 
and then received a unanimous vote. Which, Mr. Speaker, is probably why 
nobody will ever read about this or see it on television, because we 
actually worked together and did it in a bipartisan way and achieved 
the unanimous vote that will bring drugs and devices to patients 
quicker, sooner, and safer in the long run.
  This legislation is yet another example of Congress getting good 
things done. We are working together. And it is important to thank my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their work on this 
legislation, particularly full committee Ranking Member Pallone, Health 
Subcommittee Ranking Member Green, Health Subcommittee Chairman 
Burgess. This bipartisan work has produced a big win for patients.
  The FDARA will help bring lower-cost generic drug alternatives and 
biosimilars to market faster, increasing competition, lowering drug 
costs. It will streamline the process for reviewing or approving new 
treatments and cures for patients, ultimately delivering new and 
innovative therapies, drugs, and devices to patients more quickly.
  Finally, this bill is a big win for the millions of Americans working 
in the healthcare sector and the drug and device manufacturers that 
help us live better and healthier lives.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I want my 
colleagues and all Americans to know this is just step one in a long-
term effort in our committee to help patients get access to better 
medicines and lower costs.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization 
Act, a bill that would allow the FDA to continue its critical mission 
of reviewing and approving drugs and medical devices that save lives 
and improve the quality of life for many Americans.
  The legislation before us today is the product of compromise and 
almost 2 years of work between FDA, Congress, industry, and other 
stakeholders. The FDA Reauthorization Act reauthorizes FDA's medical 
product user fee agreements, providing FDA with the resources the 
agency needs to continue its critical public health work and hire the 
necessary scientists and review staff, and improve the certainty and 
efficiency of the drug review process.
  The sixth reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act will 
maintain current review timelines, modernize the user fee structure, 
and build on the work of 21st Century Cures Act by investing resources 
in the development of biomarkers and innovative clinical trial designs.
  The fourth reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments 
includes some important new policies that will help to increase the 
consistency, efficiency, and effectiveness of drug and medical device 
reviews.
  The bill advances the use of the patient perspective and the risk-
benefit assessment of medical devices. It establishes a system 
utilizing real world data for pre-market approval of new uses and post-
market safety monitoring, and it improves presubmission communication 
with manufacturers in an effort to expedite the review process.
  This legislation also reauthorizes two of our newer user fee programs 
for generics and biosimilars. Both of these programs strive to expedite 
access to high-quality, lower-cost drugs for American families.
  The FDARA will also allow the agency to undertake new initiatives to 
create a category of over-the-counter hearing aids, advance the 
development of pediatric cancer treatments, and provide greater 
assistance and incentives to encourage additional competition for 
generic drugs.
  Since this is a bipartisan compromise--and I want to stress that--as 
my colleague Mr. Walden said, it really is important and people should 
take note that this is a major piece of legislation that is being done 
on a bipartisan basis by our committee. But it does not address every 
issue that I would have liked. It also includes troublesome language 
prohibiting the FDA from making the investments the agency needs as 
part of future user fee agreements. It is important that the FDA 
maintain a work environment that allows the agency to recruit and 
retain the world's best and brightest. I am concerned that this final 
agreement preserves language advanced in the Senate bill that will make 
it difficult in the future for the FDA to make the investments needed 
to recruit personnel and meet performance goals set out in the user fee 
reauthorizations.
  This is a concern, again, that was put in by the Senate that I hope 
we can address in the future. But I do want to stress, at the end of 
the day, that this final product represents all of the significant 
discussions and compromises that were made, and, of course, the 
legislation that is going to be effective is the result of compromise.
  I am pleased that we are considering this in a very timely fashion, 
because, as I mentioned, we don't want the personnel who work at the 
FDA to be affected; and if we do this in a timely fashion, they won't 
have to worry about pink slips or their jobs.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2430 so 
that we can continue to give the FDA the tools and resources it needs 
to continue doing the critical work of reviewing and improving 
lifesaving drugs and medical devices.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his 
good work and kind comments on our legislation that we put together.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Barton), the former chairman of the full committee.
  (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman Walden and Ranking Member 
Pallone, along with subcommittee Chairman Burgess and subcommittee 
Ranking Member Green for their excellent leadership on this piece of 
legislation.
  If you look at the front page of The Washington Post this morning, 
you will see on the left-hand column the story about a miracle living 
drug to help cure cancer in children that have leukemia.
  In the legislation before us, as the chairman just pointed out, there 
is the RACE for Children Act, which was introduced by Congressmen 
McCaul, Butterfield, and Mullin, and which I am a original cosponsor, 
that will make it possible to help children sooner.
  This particular drug that is discussed on the front page of The 
Washington Post took decades to develop and has just now been approved.
  How many thousands of children have died while that drug was being 
developed?
  The legislation before us includes, as I said, the RACE for Children 
Act, which will make it possible to bring these innovative drugs to 
market much more quickly.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend all the leaders and the members of the 
committee for this bipartisan piece of legislation, as Mr. Pallone has 
just pointed out. I am proud to vote for it, and I encourage all 
Members of the House to do the same.

                              {time}  1345

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Gene Green), the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee.
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2430, 
the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017.
  For many months, we have worked on a bipartisan basis to negotiate 
and prepare for the four FDA user fee agreements for reauthorization, 
across party lines, and you are seeing that. That is why I am proud to 
be a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. We will fight when we 
have to, but we also can work together on things that are really 
important to our country.

[[Page H5479]]

  These programs must be reauthorized in a timely manner to avoid a 
meltdown of the medical product development pipeline. We have had great 
collaboration and strong bipartisan working relationships throughout 
the process, from the publication of the goals letters, to the 
hearings, and the markups in the Health Subcommittee, all the way 
through the unanimous vote out of the Energy and Commerce Committee 
last month.
  Since the first PDUFA was established in 1992, Congress has created 
additional user fee programs for medical devices, generic drugs, and 
biosimilars. In this cycle, we see shortened review timelines and have 
given the FDA new tools to harness the latest science and streamline 
the review process.
  FDARA would build on previous success by reauthorizing the user fees 
and make improvements in the review process like advancing the use of 
biomarkers and patient experience data. The bill includes additional 
provisions beyond the underlying agreements that are worthy of support.
  To give some examples, it will promote generic drug development and 
competition, establish a category of over-the-counter hearing aids, 
crack down on counterfeit drugs, and foster innovation in medical 
imaging.
  FDA approval is the global gold standard and reauthorizing the user 
fee programs will ensure the agency has the resources--particularly 
capable, qualified staffers--to fulfill this mission.
  I look forward to working with my colleagues to establish a user fee 
program for over-the-counter products and reform the monograph systems 
once we have reauthorized the existing user fee programs that will soon 
expire.
  I want to thank Ranking Member Pallone, Chairman Walden, and the 
chair of the Health Subcommittee, Congressman Burgess, for their work 
and commitment into timely user fee reauthorization.
  I also want to thank the staff, Kim Trzeciak and John Stone, and my 
own staff, Kristen O'Neill, for the countless hours of work they did to 
get us to this place.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2430.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Burgess), chairman of the Subcommittee on Health.
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the 
time.
  It is significant today to be here and be supporting H.R. 2430, the 
Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017.
  The passage of this bill provides certainly the security to the 
scientists who are working even now in pursuit of better cures and, of 
course, hope for patients across the country who are awaiting better 
treatments of the diseases that are afflicting them.
  By reauthorizing the Food and Drug Administration user fee program, 
we are ensuring that the Food and Drug Administration can continue to 
officially operate and approve new drugs for the market.
  Upon becoming chairman of the Subcommittee on Health this year, I had 
the privilege of convening four separate legislative hearings on the 
policies that are included in H.R. 2430. In each of those hearings, we 
heard about the tremendous success of the user fee programs in 
expanding access to affordable medications, supporting biomedical 
innovation, and maintaining high standards at the FDA for safety, 
efficacy, and quality.
  H.R. 2430 will build upon these successes and will also build upon 
the achievements that we achieved in the last Congress, in the 21st 
Century Cures Act. And now we can ensure that the FDA has resources 
necessary to get medical treatments and cures to patients and 
healthcare providers as quickly as possible.
  This bill is an important step forward for our committee and for this 
Congress, and we continue to pursue meaningful improvements to the 
healthcare system.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Gene Green, 
Ranking Member Pallone of the full committee, all members of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee, both subcommittee and full committee, who 
worked hard to improve the substance of this bill as it came through.
  Clearly, I wish to thank the majority and minority staffs who worked 
so hard to bring this to fruition.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, 
and I, too, want to thank all of the Members and staff who were engaged 
in preparing this bill for a vote on the floor of the House.
  I wanted to focus on two of the amendments that are included in the 
bill--I am grateful for that--that I sponsored.
  First, it includes my amendment to create a pilot project to evaluate 
postmarket safety of medical devices. It also includes my amendment 
which states that Congress and Federal agencies need to work together 
to lower drug prices. Everyone has been impacted by rising costs of 
prescription drugs, which is why 60 percent of Americans believe 
addressing the cost of prescription drugs needs to be a top priority.
  The drug pricing crisis cannot be attributed to a single bad actor or 
a few blockbuster drugs. A recent study found that 97 percent of widely 
used brand name drugs had a price increase that exceeded inflation.
  This crisis requires a comprehensive solution that increases 
transparency; lowers prices for patients, Medicare, and Medicaid; and 
ensures that every American can get access to the drugs that they need.

  It is time for Congress to get serious about lowering the cost of 
drugs for Americans, and I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. Upton), the former chairman of the committee, and the 
leader of the 21st Century Cures Act legislation.
  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, so this is a jobs bill. And those who know me 
know that I have a long record of supporting innovation when it comes 
to research and development of new drugs and devices.
  That is why I was proud to help author the 21st Century Cures Act 
with my Democratic colleague Diana DeGette. This bill broke down the 
barriers for research and development, put a greater focus on patient-
centered care, and gave billions in resources to the National 
Institutes of Health.
  President Obama signed our bill into law at the end of 2016. It 
marked a truly great victory for both patients and researchers across 
the country. And now that Cures is law, we have got to make sure that 
the FDA is able to handle the new breakthrough treatments in a timely 
and predictable fashion, all while still maintaining the highest levels 
of patient safety. That is why this agreement is so important.
  My district in southwest Michigan has literally thousands of jobs on 
the line that are affected by this legislation, and whether it is on 
the drug side at Pfizer, or the device side at Stryker, or the generic 
side at Perrigo--all in my district--passing this legislation is vital 
to those good-paying local jobs, as well as to the patients who will 
benefit from the new therapies that get those products to market.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).


 =========================== NOTE =========================== 

  
  July 12, 2017, on page H5479, the following appeared: 1\1/2\ 
minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Butterfield).
  
  The online version has been corrected to read: 1\1/2\ minutes to 
the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).


 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 

  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time 
and for his leadership on the committee.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2430, the FDA 
Reauthorization Act of 2017, which reauthorizes the FDA's user fee 
programs that are critical to drug development, the medical device 
approval process, and, most importantly, to the patients who will 
benefit from these advances.
  While I support this critical bill overall, I want to highlight, in 
particular, sections 503 through 505, which is the RACE for Children 
Act that my friend Mike McCaul, Congressman Mike McCaul, and I 
introduced earlier this year. Scientific advances have shown that some 
childhood and adult cancers share the same molecular targets.
  RACE, Mr. Speaker, will help facilitate the expeditious development 
of innovative and promising treatments for children living with cancer 
by providing the FDA new authority to require a pediatric investigation 
into an adult cancer drug if that drug uses molecular targeting and is 
relevant to the cancer.

[[Page H5480]]

  I am grateful to Mr. Walden and Ranking Member Pallone and their 
respective staffs for understanding the urgent need to enact the RACE 
for Children Act and for working with me, working with my staff, to see 
that it was included.
  I would also like to highlight section 701 and 702, which is the text 
of a bill I introduced with Dr. Bucshon to modernize and streamline 
FDA's medical device inspection process by moving to a risk-based 
inspection approach. The provision will allow FDA to better use its 
limited resources and improve patient safety by focusing on facilities 
that have the most potential to impact public health.
  Finally, passage of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 will send a 
strong signal to the administration that Congress values the critical 
importance of medical research and patient safety.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Lance), a very important member of our committee.
  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the chairman, the ranking 
member of the full committee, and the chairman and the ranking member 
of the subcommittee for this important work.
  I rise in strong support of the Food and Drug Administration 
Reauthorization Act. We need a strong FDA to make sure lifesaving 
medicines reach the market and that patients have the peace of mind of 
a safe regulatory process. This bill ensures the wheels of creation 
keep turning, and in no part of our Nation is this more important than 
New Jersey, one of the medicine chests of the world.
  It means that patients here in the United States and hundreds of 
millions around the world have benefited from the genius of our 
biopharmaceutical and life science industries. Patient safety is always 
the critical priority, and I am pleased this legislation includes 
language I authored to crack down on counterfeit drugs that are 
flooding into the United States. Too many Americans are falling victim 
to knockoffs that have infiltrated the U.S. supply chain, and this 
legislation significantly changes that.
  Disease knows no bounds and, one way or another, each of us is 
affected by disease. This work makes a difference in patients' lives 
and makes sure the system from idea to pharmacy is working.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to support this product.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Ms. DeGette).
  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, at a time of hyperpartisanship when 
traditions of consensus are seldom upheld, I am pleased to see Congress 
continue its tradition of passing FDA user fee reauthorization with 
broad bipartisan support.
  It is absolutely critical that the FDA continue to promote medical 
innovation and support public health. To do so, it must have consistent 
funding, which this bill helps assure. I am also so proud that this 
bill builds directly on the 21st Century Cures Act, which I coauthored 
with Representative Fred Upton.
  Consistent with Cures, the bill before us today ensures that both the 
patient's voice and evidence from clinical practice can be considered 
during drug development when it is appropriate. It also helps establish 
a process for the FDA to qualify so-called biomarkers, which will 
facilitate the development of future cutting-edge therapies.

  By reinforcing these key provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act, I 
am fully confident that the bill will help deliver on our bipartisan 
promise to jump-start treatments for families and for patients with 
unmet needs.
  Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Chairman Walden and Ranking Member 
Pallone for incorporating provisions into the bill that will deepen our 
understanding of the psychosocial impact of disease. These provisions 
are based on the bipartisan Patient Experience in Research Act which 
Representative Lance and I coauthored.
  As more is learned about the social and emotional effects of disease, 
we can deliver better outcomes for patients by improving medication 
adherence, tailoring treatment regimens, and enhancing participation in 
clinical trials.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a very important member of our committee.
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the passage of the 
FDA Reauthorization Act. With this legislation, we can modernize the 
FDA and reduce the barriers to innovation and competition.
  If America is going to lead the world in biomedical innovation, we 
need an FDA that can efficiently review and approve new drugs. The FDA 
must act with the same urgency that patients feel waiting for cures.
  Importantly, this bill includes a bipartisan provision that I 
authored with my colleague Kurt Schrader.

                              {time}  1400

  The provision uses free market policies to help spur the development 
of new generic drugs, increase competition, and combat high drug 
prices.
  I am also pleased we are including in the RACE for Children Act an 
important provision to advance pediatric cancer research and 
development.
  With today's bill, we have an opportunity to truly make a difference 
for our families, our friends, our neighbors, and the millions of 
Americans living with a deadly disease. Let's get this done.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Vermont (Mr. Welch).
  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of our committee, our 
ranking member, Dr. Burgess, and Mr. Green.
  Facilitating the approval of these drugs, having the FDA work in a 
safe and constructive way, and having a quicker turnaround time is all 
really good. It is really important. I thank them for their leadership. 
This is something that had to be done. It is going to benefit everyone.
  I want to talk about another issue that we didn't address but we did 
debate, and that is the high cost of prescription drugs.
  In this legislation, on the one hand, we are accommodating a 
reasonable request by the pharmaceutical industry for a fast and 
efficient approval process; but on the other hand, we are denying any 
relief to consumers who are getting absolutely hammered day in and day 
out with unjustified price increases because of the pricing power of 
the pharmaceutical industry.
  Yes, they do do good things, life-extending and pain-relieving drugs, 
but that doesn't justify grinding consumers into the dust who can't 
afford the cost of these prescriptions, where it is just within reach 
that they can provide relief to their family.
  We know how much pharmaceutical prices have been going up. It is 
hurting our employers, who are working hard to provide good healthcare 
to their employees. It is hurting taxpayers.
  But every single one of us has met a constituent like a mom who is 
struggling with this choice of trying to afford something she can't 
afford or risk a loss she would never endure. I am talking about the 
EpiPen; $600 to get an EpiPen here in the United States.
  Mylan makes that. They are a Netherlands-based company now. They 
moved over there for tax reasons. In the Netherlands, you can get it 
for $100. This isn't justified. The chairman, the ranking member, and I 
know this.
  When Elijah Cummings and I met with President Trump, he knows it. He 
talked about the rip-off pricing. He talked about the possibility of 
importation of safe drugs from Canada as a way of getting some price 
pressure on these companies.
  We have got the committee that can address this. I would like us to 
do that.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).
  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, the FDA Reauthorization Act we are 
considering today provides the FDA the resources it needs to ensure 
innovative and lifesaving drugs and medical devices are brought to the 
market in a safe and expedient manner, while providing transparency and 
certainty to manufacturers.
  Further, the device inspection and regulatory improvements title 
reflects language I introduced with Representatives Brooks, Peters, and 
Butterfield, which sets forth a risk-based approach to medical device 
establishment inspections and improves predictability for scheduled 
inspections, among other provisions.

[[Page H5481]]

  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I look 
forward to moving it through Congress and sending it to the President's 
desk.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. Schrader).
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the FDA 
Reauthorization Act, FDARA as it is called.
  It could not be more evident that the time has come for Congress to 
reckon with the growing problem of exorbitant drug prices. Every few 
months sees the headlines about another extreme price hike, as was just 
mentioned. Some unscrupulous pharmaceutical CEO buys the rights to 
produce drugs that have been on the market for decades, usually where 
there are no competitors, then, seemingly overnight, they raise the 
price astronomically.
  In the case of Daraprim, a drug that is used by some transplant 
patients and people living with AIDS, the price went from $13.50 per 
pill to $750. That is outrageous, a price increase of 5,000 percent. 
For this drug and many others, the drugs have been off patent for ages 
and there is no generic competitor on the market.
  Competition from generic drugs saves patients and the government 
billions of dollars on a weekly basis. Unfortunately, generic drug 
manufacturers who want to bring these markets to competition face a 
long approval process, steep costs, and uncertainty. This FDA act 
reckons with that.
  It is time for Congress to act, also, on those unscrupulous 
providers. Gus Bilirakis and I introduced a bill providing competition 
to drive down those costs. We provide new incentives for generic drugs 
to come to market and reform the process.
  I am in support of the bill.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleague from Oregon 
for his good work on this part of the bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. 
Mullin).
  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, this spring in my district in Oklahoma, the 
McAlpin family of Tahlequah lost their 2-year-old son, Kai, to 
pediatric cancer. Kai's parents refer to Kai as Warrior Kai because he 
fought cancer every day with courage and dedication like a true 
warrior. Included in H.R. 2430 today is the RACE for Children Act, 
which aims to create new and better pediatric treatment options for 
warriors like Kai.
  Currently, there are over 900 drugs in development to treat cancer in 
adults, while only a handful of drugs are being developed to fight 
cancer in children. Clearly, those statistics show that the law has not 
kept up with scientific innovation.

  RACE can help deliver lifesaving treatments for pediatric cancer 
patients by updating the Pediatric Research Act. This bill requires all 
drug manufacturers to test a new drug in a pediatric population before 
applying it to children during cancer treatment. RACE for Children puts 
safety first and ensures that researchers use scientific evidence when 
declaring effectiveness of a drug before providing it to patients.
  I am glad to see the RACE for Children Act included today, and I 
thank Chairman McCaul and Congressman Butterfield for their work on the 
bill. The fight of Warrior Kai continues with us.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).
  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden, Ranking Member 
Pallone, Ranking Member Green, and Subcommittee Chairman Burgess for 
their leadership in uniting our colleagues across the aisle on a bill 
that supports patients and the life sciences industry. This user fee 
bill is a testament to what can be achieved when we debate policies in 
the open and confront challenges together.
  I would also like to specifically focus on one piece of the 
legislation, the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2017. A few weeks 
ago, a friend of mine wrote to me and shared her story of hearing loss. 
A 34-year-old lawyer, it nearly derailed her career by leaving her 
unable to argue cases in the courtroom. She continued by outlining the 
often overlooked side effects brought about by hearing loss--isolation, 
anxiety, depression, and memory loss--all compounded by prohibitive 
costs for hearing aids that aren't covered by Medicare or most private 
insurers. Faced with prices upwards of $5,000, many Americans are 
denied the relief and the treatment that they deserve.
  With this bipartisan bill, we will not only spark innovation and 
competition, we will help our constituents in their communities, 
offices, factory floors, and even their own homes. I hope my colleagues 
will support this bill.
  I want to thank Representative Blackburn for her tireless work in 
getting it across the finish line as well.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. Walberg).
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the FDA 
Reauthorization Act, and I want to thank Chairman Walden and the other 
bipartisan leadership on the committee for bringing this bipartisan 
bill to the floor today.
  As science and technology advances at a rapid rate, the potential for 
breakthroughs to treat and cure some of the worst diseases are truly 
within our reach; yet all too often, our laws and regulations are stuck 
in the past. That is why reauthorizing the Food and Drug 
Administration's user fee programs is so important.
  This bipartisan bill builds off the important work we accomplished 
through the 21st Century Cures Act. It will help speed up the approval 
process for lifesaving drugs, foster greater competition, and bring 
down costs for patients. It will also help ensure America remains on 
the forefront of medical innovation and that good-paying jobs in the 
medical device industry remain here at home.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, and together we 
can offer a healthier future for our patients.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. Cardenas).
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 
2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act.
  I also would like to thank the chairman and ranking member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee for working so hard to get this important 
bill on the floor here today.
  This reauthorization bill provides the FDA with the resources to 
complete an important and difficult job: ensuring timely and efficient 
drug review processes while maintaining rigorous scientific and safety 
standards to maintain the safety, efficacy, and security of drugs, 
biological products, medical devices, and therapies that Americans have 
access to today and tomorrow.
  I am lucky to have been born and raised in this great country where 
we have access to the latest innovation in the life sciences sector. I 
wish my parents had been raised right here in this great, wonderful 
country so they may still be here today, so that they could enjoy time 
with their grandchildren if I have been so blessed to do so myself.
  The FDA is seen as the gold standard around the world, and this bill 
keeps us right there, right at the top.
  I am encouraged to see my colleagues working together to ensure that 
the FDA is able to continue to fulfill this responsibility, and I look 
forward to continue working to have this reauthorization passed out of 
Congress.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), who is from the Philadelphia suburbs and 
is an important member of our committee.
  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
the FDA Reauthorization Act, which is very important to our country and 
to Pennsylvania's Sixth Congressional District.
  Many communities in my district are at the forefront of innovation in 
the life sciences industry, and this legislation will make sure our 
businesses remain competitive and on pace with public health needs.
  This bill is critical to allowing us to continue our bipartisan work 
to reduce drug costs, to advance therapies that can save lives, and to 
develop safe and innovative treatments for patients and their families.
  Finally, Mr. Speaker, it is important the public is aware that this 
is a bipartisan bill. There are some things that perhaps some 
Republicans would have liked to have seen in this bill that

[[Page H5482]]

didn't make their way in, and there are some things that perhaps some 
Democrats would have liked to have seen make their way into this bill 
that didn't. We found consensus and we worked together. It was a 
unanimous vote out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I am proud to 
stand behind that, and this is a good day for America.

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).
  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2430, the 
FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017.
  We all have loved ones, friends, and neighbors who are suffering from 
life-threatening diseases and illnesses and who want hope that that 
next generation treatment or therapy will still be available to them.
  It is our shared responsibility to support the FDA as well as 
countless researchers and patient advocates across the country who are 
working to bring new cures to market. This critical, bipartisan 
legislation helps us achieve that important goal by reauthorizing user 
fee programs at FDA for 5 years.
  I want to thank Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, Chairman 
Burgess, and Ranking Member Green for continuing the longstanding 
tradition on the Energy and Commerce Committee of advancing this 
legislation in a bipartisan manner. Our work together on this bill 
should be a model for how we can cooperate on other issues in the 
future, and it is good that we are passing this bill on the House floor 
well in advance of the September 30 deadline.
  I also want to thank the committee for including provisions that I 
worked on with Mr. Lance, Dr. Burgess, and Mr. Green to enhance 
penalties for counterfeit and diverted drugs, and for including Mr. 
Kennedy's over-the-counter hearing aid bill, which will go a long way 
to providing real relief to the 30 million Americans who suffer from 
hearing loss.
  Hearing loss is a quality-of-life issue, plain and simple, and 
passage of today's legislation will help many receive the treatment 
that they need in a quick manner, while also ensuring safety.
  It is a good bill that deserves our support.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Carter), who is the resident pharmacist on the committee.
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support 
of H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act, because of its importance to 
our healthcare system and the millions of people who depend on it. The 
FDA Reauthorization Act is essential as we seek reforms to the way we 
develop new drugs and therapies and the ways in which we are able to 
get those to market.
  Under this legislation, we are streamlining the approval process to 
maintain the provisions that make our market, while making changes to 
ensure new therapies aren't unnecessarily held up.

                              {time}  1415

  We have set benchmarks for reviews to ensure that the drug approval 
process is moving along and doesn't get bogged down by bureaucratic red 
tape. And most importantly, we are providing patients with a chance to 
pursue new and innovative drugs that can really make a difference in 
their life.
  We have seen progress in the approval of rare disease drugs, helping 
millions who suffer from diseases that often have no treatment. With 
this bill, we can provide them with new opportunities.
  Additionally, we will be able to see more generics entering the 
market, increasing competition and driving down costs for consumers.
  I applaud Chairman Walden, Chairman Burgess, and all of my colleagues 
on the committee for helping to get this essential legislation to the 
finish line.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. McCaul), chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and one 
of the authors of a portion of this bill that is really important for 
kids.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden for including my 
bill, the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity, or RACE, for 
Children Act, in this FDA reauthorization. I introduced the bill with 
my colleague, Mr. Butterfield, to strengthen the FDA's ability to 
require pediatric studies of cancer drugs during development.
  Despite current programs in place to require similar studies, they 
have never been undertaken for cancer drugs. This bill will require a 
study into any cancer drug that uses ``molecular targeting,'' which 
attacks specific cancer cells rather than the part of the body where 
the cancer resides. By requiring these studies, doctors can determine 
whether a drug is safe and effective in children and, ultimately, 
provide accurate labeling for pediatric use.
  I founded the Childhood Cancer Caucus when I first entered Congress 
to give a voice to the 15,000 children diagnosed with cancer every year 
and the hundreds of thousands of survivors who face a lifetime of 
medical challenges. Passing this bill will provide these children 
access to the treatments they deserve.
  I thank all those involved for their tireless work in bringing this 
bill to the House floor. As my good friend, little Sadie Keller, who is 
battling leukemia as I speak, once said: ``Together, we can make a 
difference.''
  To Sadie and all the children who are in the fight of their lives, I 
want you to know that today we are making a difference.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. Biggs), a passionate advocate for those who really need 
access to medications at the end stage of their lives.
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this bill 
forward and also for granting me time to speak on an issue that I am 
passionate about, which is Right to Try.
  I support the underlying bill and hope that we have a chance, soon, 
to consider the Right to Try bill, which has been worked on by myself, 
Senator Johnson, and Representative Fitzpatrick.
  As many know, Right to Try would allow terminally ill patients who 
have no other options left to receive drugs that have passed the Food 
and Drug Administration's basic safety testing but which have not been 
fully approved.
  In 2014, my home State of Arizona passed a similar Right to Try law 
with nearly 80 percent of the vote, due in large part to the heroic 
efforts of my late friend, Laura Knaperek, who was battling incurable 
cancer at the time.
  Today, nearly 40 States have enacted Right to Try legislation. This 
is a bipartisan cause and one that has received strong support from the 
White House. I look forward to continuing to work with the chairman to 
find a path forward for Right to Try.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, as I said before, I am very proud of the fact that this 
bill is bipartisan, continuing a tradition of dealing with these FDA 
user fee and authorization bills on a bipartisan basis.
  We worked long and hard to get this accomplished in a timely fashion, 
in particular, so that the personnel at the FDA are not threatened in 
any way. I am very hopeful that this will pass today, go over to the 
Senate and also pass there quickly, and be signed by the President 
soon.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. 
As I have said, it is a bipartisan bill. I think even more importantly 
than that, Mr. Speaker, this legislation will save lives. It will bring 
about quicker cures for those who need new medicines and medical 
devices.
  This is the finest work that we can do in this body, working with 
those scientists and innovators in helping develop a system where they 
can get approvals and get new medicines to market that are safe and 
that will save lives. We are doing that today.
  I want to thank the staff, who have been incredibly important in this 
effort and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who worked 
together. We didn't get everything everybody wanted in this bill, but 
we got a bill that passed unanimously out of our committee and that I 
believe the Senate will take up

[[Page H5483]]

and adopt, as well, and we can move forward in such a positive 
direction for people that you heard about today from my colleagues.
  Lives that are on the line can be saved by innovation. The quicker we 
get that innovation to the market, the more we can reduce costs and 
save lives.
  Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support passage of this very 
important lifesaving legislation, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2430, the FDA 
Reauthorization Act of 2017 to reauthorize four important user fee 
programs: the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the Medical Device User 
Fee Act, the Generic Drug User Fee Act, and the Biosimilar User Fee 
Act. These critically important laws have improved patient access to 
important therapies and expedited the FDA's approval times while 
upholding the most rigorous standards for patient safety.
  The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was enacted in 1992 when 
drug review times were lagging and FDA simply couldn't keep up with the 
flood of new drug applications. Through user fees paid by applicants, 
PDUFA gave FDA the resources it needed to hire and support more staff. 
The program has been successful in reducing review-time backlogs and 
expediting safe and effective therapies to patients.
  My legislation created the Medical Device User Fee Act (MDUFA), which 
was enacted in 2002 and has resulted in significant changes to the 
medical device industry and within the medical device center at the 
FDA. Through this user fee program, the device center has improved its 
efficiency and reduced the time it takes to bring effective medical 
devices to market. This legislation builds on the progress made in 
previous user fee agreements and will produce important developments 
for the medical device industry.
  The Generic Drug User Fee Agreement (GDUFA) was enacted in 2012 and 
takes important steps to bring lower-priced drugs to the market more 
quickly for the American people. Finally, the Biosimilar User Fee 
Agreement (BsUFA), which was first enacted in 2012 through legislation 
I authored, is critical to supporting the nascent biosimilar industry 
and will lead to meaningful progress, breakthroughs and cures for the 
American people.
  Previous user fee reauthorizations have included significant gains 
for pediatric populations. Before the Better Pharmaceuticals for 
Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), which 
I authored, the vast majority of drugs (more than 80 percent) used in 
children were used off-label, without data for their safety and 
efficacy. Today, that number has been reduced to 50 percent because of 
my legislation. Both programs were permanently reauthorized in 2012, 
and while this agreement includes important changes to BPCA and PREA, 
there remains a need for more meaningful improvements. This legislation 
lays important groundwork and provides the foundation for future 
progress.
  Finally, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up this 
legislation swiftly. It's imperative that both houses of Congress pass 
this legislation and send it to the President in a timely manner for 
him to sign into law in order to provide essential resources to the FDA 
so they can continue to do their critical work.
  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2430, the 
FDA user fee reauthorization bill that I worked on with my colleagues 
on the Energy & Commerce Committee.
  Without Congress' swift action to reauthorize this bill, the FDA 
would not be able to conduct its critical work ensuring that our 
nation's drugs and devices are safe and effective.
  Patients and families across the country battling diseases like 
Alzheimer's, cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS), and diabetes, rely on 
innovation to provide new life-saving and life-enhancing treatments and 
hopefully one day, cures. Without the FDA, we would not be able to 
ensure that those treatments and cures work and that they're safe.
  To quote Dr. Jeff Allen of the Friends of Cancer Research, ``for the 
people who currently depend on safe and effective medicines . . . for 
those who are holding strong for breakthroughs to come . . . and for 
every future patient . . . there isn't time to waste.''
  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill.
  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the 
House is considering H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017. I 
note that H.R. 2430 would provide the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) with new statutory authority to require the sponsor of an orphan-
designated drug, which has certain similarities to an already approved 
drug, to demonstrate ``clinical superiority'' compared to the already 
approved drug as a condition of receiving seven years of market 
exclusivity.
  This authority will limit the number of drugs that are automatically 
entitled to seven years of exclusivity, while maintaining incentives 
for the development of innovative treatments for rare diseases.
  I also note that the bill would improve transparency of the FDA's 
execution of the Orphan Drug Act. Specifically, the bill directs the 
FDA to notify a sponsor in writing of any clinical superiority 
rationale on which the FDA relied in designating the sponsor's drug as 
an orphan drug. Further, it would require the FDA to publish its 
clinical superiority findings summaries for all drugs granted 
exclusivity based on a demonstration of clinical superiority.
  I urge my colleagues to support the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania). The question is 
on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) that 
the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2430, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

                          ____________________
