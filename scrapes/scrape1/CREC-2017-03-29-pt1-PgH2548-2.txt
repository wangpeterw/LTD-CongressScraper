                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

  Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, during yesterday evening's vote series, I 
was present on the House floor. However, my vote was not recorded on 
rollcall No. 202, due to a technical malfunction. Had I been recorded, 
I would have voted ``no'' on S.J. Res. 34.
