CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS PROVIDE STUDENTS OPPORTUNITIES 
                          FOR TODAY'S ECONOMY

  (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of 
today's legislation to advance our country's career and technical 
education programs. These programs help students learn the skills 
needed to be competitive and set our young people on the path to 
success.
  I have visited with our manufacturers regularly, and they have 
repeatedly told me that more skilled workers are needed.
  As a former vocational teacher, I have seen firsthand the fulfillment 
a student can find from getting real-world training in a useful skill, 
and I am encouraged by the positive steps this bill takes to address 
this skill shortfall.
  There are many paths to success, and the Strengthening Career and 
Technical Education for the 21st Century Act helps us pave the way for 
a high-skilled workforce of Americans to have successful, fulfilling 
careers.
