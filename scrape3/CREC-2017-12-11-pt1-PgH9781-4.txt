                        CLOSE THE INVESTIGATION

  (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, there is an intractable bias and prejudice 
that infects Robert Mueller's investigation of President Trump and his 
team.
  Look no further than Peter Strzok. He was central to clearing Hillary 
Clinton by changing the information in her exoneration statement from 
grossly negligent to extremely careless. Then, somehow, he gets drafted 
into the Mueller probe and starts sending anti-Trump, pro-Hillary text 
messages to his mistress.
  Then we learn that Bruce Ohr, who was also involved in the 
investigation, met with Fusion GPS officials proximate to their 
interactions that impacted the election. Now we have learned that the 
wife of Bruce Ohr--the wife of a senior official involved in this 
investigation--was moonlighting, working for Fusion GPS and bringing up 
scandalous, unverified, and salacious accusations against the 
President.
  Even Mueller's number two, Andrew Weissmann, praised Sally Yates for 
defying a direct order from the President.
  It is time to bring this witch hunt of an investigation to a close 
and move on to Make America Great Again.
