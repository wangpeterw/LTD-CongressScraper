                CONGRATULATING FAIRMONT HEIGHTS HORNETS

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the 
Fairmont Heights Hornets for winning their first State basketball 
championship in 36 years.
  After trailing by as much as 9 points, the Hornets, under the 
leadership of Coach Chuck Henry, won the 1A boys State title by a score 
of 65-52. The team of young scholars was resilient, played hard, and 
never panicked.
  Credit is due to Coach Henry, who has taken his team to the State 
championship after only 2 years on the job. He is a role model, had 
high expectations for his students, and constantly pushed them to play 
better on the court and achieve more in the classroom. Throughout the 
season, Coach Henry never lost faith in his young team.
  Mr. Speaker, the students on the winning Fairmont Heights team may 
not go on to play in the NCAA or the NBA, but the memories of this 
moment, the bonds they have built, and the lessons they have developed 
will stay with them for a lifetime.
  Fairmont Heights High School has a proud legacy. When it opened its 
doors in 1950, it was only one of two high schools in the State of 
Maryland for African Americans. Now, nearly 70 years later, the school 
has made history again. This team has made Prince George's County and 
the entire Fourth Congressional District very proud.
  Go, Hornets.
