                     HONORING COMMANDER PAUL BAUER

  Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to 
Commander Paul Bauer, a 31-year veteran of the police force who was 
fatally shot on Tuesday February 13, 2018, while in the line of duty. 
Commander Bauer had a remarkable career with the Chicago Police 
Department and will be remembered by his colleagues as a model police 
officer. Commander Bauer made the ultimate sacrifice while protecting 
our city and its people, and I am thankful for all of his years of 
service. He leaves behind his wife, Erin, of 16 years and his 13-year-
old daughter, Grace. May his service, sacrifice, and kind spirit serve 
as an inspiration to us all.
