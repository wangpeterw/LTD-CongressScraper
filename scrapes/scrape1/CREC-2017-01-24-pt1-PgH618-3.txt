                            GLOBAL GAG RULE

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, look at this 
picture. Where are the women?
  Yesterday, the President signed an executive order affecting and 
restricting health care for millions of women across the world while no 
woman was present. Clearly, he did not hear the voices of the millions 
of women who marched for their rights and for their health care this 
past weekend. Reinstating the global gag rule will cut off funding for 
global healthcare organizations that offer reproductive health care for 
women from some of the poorest and neediest countries in the world.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the global gag rule and 
any other assault on women's rights in America or around the world.
