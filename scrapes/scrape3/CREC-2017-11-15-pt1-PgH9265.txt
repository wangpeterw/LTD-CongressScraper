             HONORING THE SERVICE OF DR. EUGENE E. WILLIAMS

  (Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true servant to the 
people, Dr. Eugene E. Williams. He is a dedicated husband to his wife, 
Daisy, a wonderful father, grandfather, veteran, and pastor.
  Sunday will be Dr. Williams' 59th anniversary as pastor of Mount 
Beulah Missionary Baptist Church in Ferriday, Louisiana. Over the 
course of his 59-year career, he has ministered to four other churches 
across Louisiana, which include Mount Sinai Baptist Church and Mount 
Olive Baptist Church in Ferriday, St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church in 
Jonesville, and New Hope Baptist Church in Ruston.
  In addition to his service as a pastor, he was a teacher, community 
organizer, and the director of the LaSalle Head Start program for 28 
years.
  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Williams is a model citizen for the people of the 
Fifth District of Louisiana, and I would like to thank him for his 
selfless service to the community and for making my State a better 
place.
