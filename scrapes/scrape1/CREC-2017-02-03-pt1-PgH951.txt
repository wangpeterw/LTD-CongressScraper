                      OPPOSING THE BAN ON REFUGEES

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong 
opposition to President Trump's ban on the entry of refugees from 
around the world as well as the ban on refugees and citizens from seven 
select countries.
  This ban, whether temporary or not, is shameful, and wholly un-
American. There are better ways to protect our Nation, ways that are 
effective and stay true to our American values.
  For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of my constituents 
fled the horrors of war and genocide in Vietnam and in Cambodia as 
refugees. Today, these immigrants and their children are doctors, 
lawyers, teachers, parents, students, all integral to the success of 
our Nation.
  America has long endured as the shining beacon on the Hill. Sadly, 
that light was dimmed by the President's immigration executive order. 
Our Nation is great because it has been built by refugees and 
immigrants from every part of the world.
