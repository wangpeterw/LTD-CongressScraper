                              GOP TAX SCAM

  (Mr. McEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, according to the nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office, the Senate's version of tax reform would increase the 
deficit by $38 billion in 2018. By 2027, the debt would increase by a 
whopping $1.4 trillion.
  I stand here today calling for tax reform legislation that would help 
my constituents and millions of other Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, the GOP tax plan is irresponsible governing. Many of my 
constituents say that their families have yet to recover from the great 
recession, and I hear them loud and clear.
  I cannot stand by silently while my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle rush through a bill for which it will take years for our 
economy to recover. This bill raises taxes on 82 million middle class 
households solely to create giveaways for the wealthy few.
  We have only 9 legislative days left this calendar year. It is time 
to focus on legislation that will give Americans a better deal. We need 
commonsense, reality-based legislation that will create opportunities 
for all Americans, not just the select few.
