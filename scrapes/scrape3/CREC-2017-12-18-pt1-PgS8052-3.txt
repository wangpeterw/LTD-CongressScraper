                    TRAIN CRASH IN WASHINGTON STATE

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, our hearts go out to everyone who 
has been affected by that horrible train crash near Seattle, WA. I know 
that authorities are still investigating what caused the crash. We have 
to find out what went wrong and then work to fix it. We in New York 
know what this is like. We have had a few of these derailments and 
crashes--Spuyten Duyvil on the Metro-North, where four people died 
about a year and a half ago or a year or two ago. It was very bad. We 
have to work on train safety, and there are lots of things to do. I am 
not going to talk about that now, but we do have to. For now, we are 
wishing the very best for everyone on that train, and we remain deeply 
grateful to the first responders who reported to the scene.
