                                 ______
                                 

                       REMEMBERING JAMES ROBESON

 Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would like to take this 
opportunity to recognize the heroic life of Scranton firefighter 
Captain James Robeson on the 10th anniversary of his death.
  Captain Robeson was more than just a firefighter. He was a loving 
husband to his wife, Linda, and a caring father to his son, Ryan. He 
was a friend to many, a mentor to his colleagues, and a hero to us all.
  Captain Robeson made a career out of service and protection. He 
willingly served and courageously protected his colleagues, the city of 
Scranton, and all of us who inhabit it. Each time duty called, Captain 
Robeson heroically was one of the brave individuals running into the 
flames and chaos, while everyone else was running out. Captain Robeson 
was a man of high honor and integrity, two qualities demonstrated when 
he laid down his own life in an attempt to save another.
  Ten years after his death, it is still my honor to have been given 
the opportunity to serve a man as brave, honorable, and respected as 
Captain Robeson. His unquestioned willingness to serve others and 
courageous ultimate sacrifice is a reminder to me about the true 
meaning of public service.
