                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Scott Wilson, Capitol Hill Presbyterian Church, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Our loving God, we pause this morning to give You thanks for the many 
blessings that we have received. We are thankful for this land where we 
can freely worship and speak Your truth and seek Your justice.
  We pray today for a spirit of unity. You have blessed us with a 
country, a nation, of magnificent diversity, yet our oneness is that 
which we celebrate. Each person is a separate treasure, unique, from 
different backgrounds, but each of us share in our humanity a common 
need for the essentials of life. We recognize and even rejoice in the 
ways we differ as we seek to be one people.
  We pray today for all Representatives, staff and their families, that 
they may enjoy safe travel, a blessed rest, and renewal on this 
Thanksgiving holiday. May all feel Your presence and Your peace in this 
season.
  Amen.
