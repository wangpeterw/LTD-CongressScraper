           By Mr. GOSAR:
       H.R. 2371.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3. (Commerce Clause) The 
     Commerce Clause give Congress the power to ``regulate 
     commerce . . . among the several States.'' If the matter in 
     question is not purely a local matter or if it has an impact 
     on inter-state commerce, then it falls within the power of 
     Congress. National Federal of Independent Business v. 
     Sebilius, (2012).
