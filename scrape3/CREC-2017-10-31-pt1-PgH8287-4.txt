                   HELP AMERICA VOTE ACT ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago this week, Congress passed 
the Help America Vote Act, which provided much-needed Federal aid to 
overhaul our aging election infrastructure.
  I was proud to support this investment in our elections, which helps 
States expand opportunities for all Americans to cast ballots and know 
that they were properly counted.
  Unfortunately, today, much of our election infrastructure is again in 
need of a refresh. Among many challenges, Russia has mounted a direct 
attack on our elections, and it is absolutely imperative that we shore 
up our defenses.
  To address this issue, among others, I introduced the PAPER Act with 
Congressman Mark Meadows, to provide States with resources to assess 
the security risks posed to their election systems and implement 
cybersecurity best practices, including postelection audits of paper 
ballots.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time to recommit to the ideals of HAVA. I urge my 
colleagues to pass the PAPER Act and restore the integrity of our 
elections.
