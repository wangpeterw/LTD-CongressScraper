                BOY SCOUT TROOP 728 CELEBRATES 70 YEARS

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today to celebrate 
the 70th anniversary of Boy Scout Troop 728.
  This troop's longstanding commitment to instilling positive social 
values and building self-esteem and self-reliance in young men has 
provided a great benefit to our community.
  Opened in 1947, Troop 728 has produced a tradition of excellence. It 
has been led by many dedicated Scoutmasters over its 70-year history, 
each of whom has contributed to the legacy of the troop. These 
passionate, active leaders allow the memories of past leaders to 
continue to flourish in the troop's culture today.
  Traditions of Troop 728 include Scout breakfasts, hiking, camping 
trips, and summer camp. Additionally, Scoutmasters focus instilling 
leadership skills in troop members and developing leaders for the 21st 
century.
  Troop 728 has produced over 30 Eagle Scouts, the most prestigious 
award that any young man can earn in Scouting. This demonstrates their 
continued commitment to their long legacy of service throughout the 
community.
  On this special anniversary, I would like to congratulate the leaders 
and members of Troop 728 for all of their successes.
