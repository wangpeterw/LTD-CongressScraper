SENATE RESOLUTION 208--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT FLOWERS 
GROWN IN THE UNITED STATES SUPPORT THE FARMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES, JOBS, 
 AND ECONOMY OF THE UNITED STATES, THAT FLOWER FARMING IS AN HONORABLE 
   VOCATION, AND DESIGNATING JULY AS ``AMERICAN GROWN FLOWER MONTH''

  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. Murkowski) submitted the 
following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 208

       Whereas cut flower growers in the United States are hard-
     working, dedicated individuals who bring beauty, economic 
     stimulus, and pride to their communities and the nation;
       Whereas the people of the United States have a long history 
     of using flowers and greens grown in the United States to 
     bring beauty to important events and express affection for 
     loved ones;
       Whereas consumers spend almost $27,000,000,000 each year on 
     floral products, including cut flowers, garden plants, 
     bedding, and indoor plants;
       Whereas nearly 30 percent of households in the United 
     States purchase fresh cut flowers and greens from more than 
     16,000 florists and floral establishments each year;
       Whereas the people of the United States increasingly want 
     to support domestically produced foods and agricultural 
     products and would prefer to buy locally grown flowers 
     whenever possible, yet a majority of domestic consumers do 
     not know where the flowers they purchase are grown;
       Whereas in response to increased demand, the ``Certified 
     American Grown Flowers'' logo was created in July 2014 in 
     order to educate and empower consumers to purchase flowers 
     from domestic producers;
       Whereas as of April 2017, millions of stems of domestically 
     grown flowers are now ``Certified American Grown'';
       Whereas domestic flower farmers produce thousands of 
     varieties of flowers across the United States, such as 
     peonies in Alaska, Gerbera daisies in California, lupines in 
     Maine, tulips in Washington, lilies in Oregon, and larkspur 
     in Texas;
       Whereas the 5 flower varieties with the highest United 
     States production are tulips, Gerbera daisies, lilies, 
     gladiolas and irises;
       Whereas people in every State have access to domestically 
     grown flowers, yet only 1 of 5 flowers sold in the United 
     States is domestically grown;
       Whereas the domestic cut flower industry creates almost 
     $42,000,000 in economic impact daily and supports hundreds of 
     growers, thousands of small businesses, and tens of thousands 
     of jobs in the United States;
       Whereas more people in the United States are expressing 
     interest in growing flowers locally, which has resulted in an 
     approximately 20 percent increase in the number of domestic 
     cut flower farms between 2007 and 2012;
       Whereas most domestic cut flowers and greens are sold in 
     the United States within 24 to 48 hours after harvest and 
     last longer than flowers shipped longer distances;
       Whereas flowers grown domestically enhance the ability of 
     the people of the United States to festively celebrate 
     weddings and births, and honor those who have passed;
       Whereas flower-giving has been a holiday tradition in the 
     United States for generations;

       Whereas flowers speak to the beauty of motherhood on 
     Mother's Day; and to the spirit of love on Valentine's Day;
       Whereas flowers are an essential part of other holidays 
     such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa;
       Whereas flowers help commemorate the service and sacrifice 
     of our Armed Forces on Memorial Day and Veterans Day; and
       Whereas the Senate encourages the cultivation of flowers in 
     the United States by domestic flower farmers: Now, therefore, 
     be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates July 2017 as ``American Grown Flower 
     Month'';
       (2) recognizes that purchasing flowers grown in the United 
     States supports the farmers, small businesses, jobs, and 
     economy of the United States;
       (3) recognizes that growing flowers and greens in the 
     United States is a vital part of the agricultural industry of 
     the United States;
       (4) recognizes that cultivating flowers domestically 
     enhances the ability of the people of the United States to 
     festively celebrate holidays and special occasions; and
       (5) urges all people of the United States to proactively 
     showcase flowers and greens grown in the United States in 
     order to show support for our flower farmers, processors, and 
     distributors as well as agriculture in the United States 
     overall.
