                              NOMINATIONS

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, we have a long list 
of legislative priorities to tackle in the coming weeks, but 
legislation is not the only bipartisan business that the Senate needs 
to handle. Yesterday afternoon I filed cloture on three nominees to 
fill important positions in the administration: Alex Azar, to serve as 
Secretary of Health and Human Services; Sam Brownback, to serve as 
Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom; and Jerome 
Powell, to serve as Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
  Today the Senate is considering the nomination of Mr. Powell, who 
brings with him degrees from Princeton and Georgetown and a record of 
high achievement in both the public and private sectors. Since his 
nomination to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 
2011, which received strong, bipartisan support, he has served as a 
steady voice and a thoughtful leader. I very much look forward to 
supporting his confirmation as Chairman.
