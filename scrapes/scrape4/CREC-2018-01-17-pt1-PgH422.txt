                       URGENT NATIONAL PRIORITIES

  (Ms. McCOLLUM asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party has total control of 
Washington. Yet, instead of fulfilling their responsibilities to fund 
the government, President Trump and the Republicans wasted the last 4 
months on their tax scam.
  Because they haven't done their jobs, Republicans now tell us we need 
to kick the can down the road again. Minnesotans and Americans deserve 
better. We need a budget deal that keeps our government open, protects 
our national security, meets our commitments to hardworking families. 
We need to reauthorize community health centers which will otherwise be 
forced to lay off healthcare workers. We need to protect workers' 
retirements by enacting responsible pension reform. And, yes, we must 
pass the Dream Act.
  There is bipartisan support for these priorities. The only thing 
standing in the way is Republican's failure to govern responsibly.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time for President Trump and the Republicans to 
end the chaos and to work across the aisle to meet the urgent needs of 
the American people.
