                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God of Light, in whom there is no darkness, thank You for the 
illumination of Your presence. As we begin a new year and a new 
Congress, please be the guide that will lead us to fulfill Your 
purposes.
  During this 115th Congress, awaken our lawmakers to Your inescapable 
presence. Keep them from thinking that You are absent from our world or 
disinterested in it. Lord, enable them to feel You in their midst as 
they grapple with the problems and challenges of our time. May they 
seek first to embrace a humility that strives to understand instead of 
striving first to be understood. In a special way, bless our new 
Senators and all of their loved ones with Your grace, mercy, and peace.
  We pray in Your sovereign Name. Amen.
