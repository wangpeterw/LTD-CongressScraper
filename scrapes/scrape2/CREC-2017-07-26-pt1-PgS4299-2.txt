                       TRIBUTE TO ABIGAIL KOSIAK

 Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today I recognize the hard work of 
my Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee intern Abigail 
Kosiak. Abigail hails from Sioux Falls, SD, and is a rising junior at 
Utah State University.
  While interning on the Commerce Committee, Abigail worked in the 
committee's front office, assisted the Communications, Technology, 
Innovation, and the Internet Subcommittee and gave tours of the 
Capitol. She is a dedicated worker who was committed to getting the 
most out of her internship. I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation 
to Abigail for all of the fine work she did for the Commerce Committee 
and wish her continued success in the years to come.
