   RECOGNIZING RECIPIENTS OF THE 2017 MONTANA CONGRESSIONAL VETERAN 
                              COMMENDATION

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Montana 
veterans who have served our country and continue their service in our 
communities.
  I recently asked Montanans to nominate a veteran for the 2017 Montana 
Congressional Veteran Commendation, a tribute to recognize those who 
have served honorably in uniform and in our communities. The response 
from Montanans was overwhelming. Fourteen veterans are receiving the 
2017 Montana Congressional Veteran Commendation:
  Richard Allgood of Big Sky;
  Gene Bell of Belgrade;
  William Charles of De Borgia;
  Richard Gale of Bozeman;
  Gary Germundson of Scobey;
  Theron Gertz of Butte;
  Michael Lawson of Butte;
  Phillip Lyons of Butte;
  Daniel Ritter of Bozeman;

  Frank Stoltz of Miles City;
  Kevin Strickler of Belgrade;
  Kyle Sukhbir of Livingston;
  Loice Trotter of Libby;
  Stanley Watson of Forsyth.
  On behalf of all Montanans, I thank the recipients of the 2017 
Montana Congressional Veteran Commendation for their sacrifices and 
selfless service.
