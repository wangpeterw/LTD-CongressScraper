                  HAPPY 75TH BIRTHDAY EARL F. HILLIARD

  (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with friends and 
family of our former colleague and my personal friend, Earl F. 
Hilliard, who this weekend will be celebrating his 75th birthday.
  While a Member of this body, Earl and I worked very closely together 
preserving the integrity of Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities and supporting the preservation and restoration of 
historic sites and buildings.
  This weekend, a gathering will establish a scholarship in his honor 
in order for more rural Alabama young men and women to have 
opportunities to further their education.
  I want to congratulate my friend for reaching this milestone in his 
life--a place I got to last year this time--and wish him a happy 
birthday and further success in establishing benefits for young men and 
women throughout Alabama.
