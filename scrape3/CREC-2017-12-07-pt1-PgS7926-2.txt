                    TRIBUTE TO DONALD HARLAN HANSEN

  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate, recognize, 
and acknowledge the longtime public service that Donald Harlan Hansen 
has provided to the State of Utah.
  This month, Donald Hansen will officially retire as the civil 
litigation chief for the Salt Lake County district attorney. He has 
worked for the district attorney since 2001, where he served as lead 
counsel in jury and bench trials before State and Federal courts and 
countless administrative proceedings.
  Prior to his work with the Salt Lake County district attorney, he 
worked for the Utah Attorney General, in which capacity he served as 
litigation counsel for critical legal cases throughout the State. Utah-
born and bred, Donald graduated from the University of Utah before 
obtaining his law degree from the S.J. Quinney College of Law.
  Donald has been published in many legal proceedings and is admitted 
to practice law before the Utah Supreme Court, the U.S. District Court 
for the District of Utah, the Oregon Supreme Court, the U.S. District 
Court for the District of Oregon, the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of 
Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court.
  Donald currently lives in the Mill Creek area of Salt Lake and is the 
father of four children and the grandfather of 12. He is a dedicated 
public servant, and I wish him the very best in his retirement.
