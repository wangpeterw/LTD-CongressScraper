1387,topic-id,201,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the growing threat to our overseas military facilities posed by the Russian  Today, one of the serious risks to our bases in Europe is Russia's corner on oil and natural gas. One such facility is the Army's new medical complex in Germany, planned to be located near Ramstein Air Base, where I was the installation commander.  It would be financially irresponsible and strategically reckless to spend $1 billion for a state-of-the-art hospital, only to have the design of the new facility compromise the very reason it exists by relying on Russia as its primary source of fuel. There are local mixed-fuel energy supply options readily available, and it would be inexcusable not to make them part of the design of this project. This is good strategy, good economics, and just plain common sense.  We can't allow ourselves to be put in a situation where Russia has the ability to cut off energy to our forward bases, especially when we could have averted this tragic vulnerability ahead of time.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House and Senate to join me in exercising aggressive oversight of this threat to our national security.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgH6512-2.txt,99999999999999,FIRST 100 DAYS ACCOMPLISHMENTS,2017.0,27.0,June
1414,topic-id,645,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of this bipartisan effort to protect victims of nonconsensual sharing of intimate media in the Armed Forces and to hold those who engage in this dishonorable practice accountable under the military law. This is a bipartisan effort, and I appreciate that. It should be. This is a terrible thing that we have to fix.  I am a five-time commander. I was on the front lines fighting this as a commander. I court-martialed those who abused others. I proudly did so. I was recognized as having the best Sexual Assault Response Program in the Air Force back in 2008 and 2009.  Also, I am proud to stand here in this bipartisan effort as a husband, a father of a daughter, and a grandfather of three little granddaughters. We have got to do better, and we stand in this together to make a difference.  Last month we observed Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and I spoke to the body on the obligation we share as elected leaders to support those who have been victims of sexual violence and exploitation. It is, therefore, fitting that we continue this campaign by turning our good words into legislative action. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for inviting me to speak on this subject.  As members of the Armed Forces, we are taught the values of honor, integrity, loyalty to our Constitution, to our flag, and to the Republic for which it stands. From our earliest days in uniform, we are also imbued with an unbreakable commitment and trust in each other as warriors and teammates. These are not abstract concepts of quaint notions of a bygone age. Rather, they are the foundation of combat readiness and competence under fire. Mr.Speaker, I submit these ideals are the very essence of our strength of arms as a nation.  That is why when someone in our midst betrays this trust and dishonors our code, the consequences go far beyond an individual act of depravity. It strikes at the heart of our core values and threatens the foundation of our combat readiness. And when the victims of these crimes perceive they are condoned by the very institution they serve, the damage is greater still.  That is why Congress has an obligation to act and to remove any doubt that those who traffic in intimate pictures of their teammates and wrongfully share them not only violate the bonds of human decency, but are breaking the law.  That is why I am proud to stand in a bipartisan effort and also with Representative McSally and colleagues on both sides of the aisle as an original cosponsor of H.2052, the PRIVATE Act, to amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice to prohibit the wrongful broadcast of intimate visual images. This is important to change the It will protect the victims of this crime, hold those who engage in these acts accountable, and make absolutely clear--zero doubt--to every member of the Armed Forces that such conduct is unacceptable and will be prosecuted under the law.  Those of us in the House who have served in uniform and have been entrusted with the responsibility of command know firsthand the importance of disciplined adherence to standards and of creating a climate of mutual trust that treats all members with dignity, fairness, and respect.  For those of us who have fought to enforce our laws and protect the victims of all forms of sexual assault and exploitation in the military, this is not just what is right; it is also very personal.  Mr.Speaker, I am proud to stand with my fellow Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle in support of this important legislation, support for our military, support for our culture, support for the defense of our country. I thank those who are leading the effort tonight.  ",CREC-2017-05-02-pt1-PgH3052-5.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,2.0,June

Manufacturing  ",CREC-2017-07-20-pt1-PgS4094.txt,1464,UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS DAY,2017.0,20.0,April
1315,topic-id,1984,"Mr.President, the White House started out this week with all kinds of activities on the White House grounds pertaining to things that we make here in America and the importance of manufacturing and, frankly, the kinds of good jobs that have traditionally come with manufacturing.  When we have an economy that focuses on making things and growing things, that has always been the strongest economy for working American families--an economy that competes, an economy that produces. Where the Presiding Officer and I live in Louisiana and in Missouri, in the middle of the country and close to that great transportation corridor and close to the resources of the country, we always particularly thrive when we are in an economy that is focused on making things.  With all of the other discussions this week, it would be a shame to not think about those products from every State that the President talked about this week, that were on the Capitol grounds, and that are reflective of companies that are almost brandnew and companies that are a century old, where people had figured out how to be competitive enough in what they were doing that they could make a living for themselves and lots of other people, doing just that. In fact, manufacturing employs 12.3 million people in the country today, including more than 260,000 people in my State of There is no doubt that we benefit from those kinds of jobs.  I was glad that in 2014 we were able to get the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act signed into law. This was a new way, a new opportunity for businesses to link with each other and to link with training facilities, maybe research universities. You have to have that kind of public partner, as well, to see what we could be to be even more competitive than we are. When we looked at Germany and other countries, they were not only doing this sort of thing, but they were doing it in a way that made it really hard for us sometimes to keep up with that level of interaction between innovation and manufacturing, innovation and labor.  Businesses are really very much impacted, jobs are very much impacted by the decisions that government ultimately sets the stage for. If you are going to make something in America today, the first two boxes I think you would have to check would be can you pay the utility bill and does the transportation system work with what you are trying to do. If you can't check those two boxes, no matter how great that workforce and that location might be, you are not going to take those jobs there. So government, either as a regulator or as a provider, is going to be very involved in whether you can pay the utility bill.  That is why I was really glad to see the new director at the Environmental Protection Agency look at the power rule. The courts fortunately had already said you don't have the authority to do that--only Congress can do what you want to do here--which is look at the power rule and look at States like many of our States in the middle of the country where, in my State, the so-called clean power rule would have doubled the utility bill for families and the places they work in about 10 or 12 years. By the way, nobody pays the utility bill for you. The utility bill is paid based on how many utilities you use. There is no mythical big government to come in and pay the utility bill unless we are going to have a totally different system than we have now. The utility bill would have doubled.  I have often said that in the last three years in this fight to see that this didn't happen to Missouri families--and I said it again on the radio this morning in an interview, thinking that this fortunately had not happened--I said: If you want to test what happens if the utility bill is allowed to double because of some needless government action--and double before it has to because you are doing things before they have to be done--the next time you pay your utility bill, just as you are writing your checks out of your checkbook, pay it one more time and see what you are going to do with the rest of your family's money that month, which suddenly you can't do because you are paying the utility bill twice.  There are ways--when we need to transition to some other kind of utility provider if we want to transition in fuels or sources or whatever--there are ways to do that. The way to do that is to say that the next time you have to build something, the next time you have to borrow money that the utility users are going to pay back over 20 or 30 years, once you have paid for what you are doing now that has met all the requirements, you have to do it differently than what that silly rule would have said, because it would have said you have to pay for what you already have, but you have to also be paying for what you immediately had to replace it with.  This would have been like if you had the CAFE standards, the miles-per-gallon standards, if that same agency would have said: OK, we are going to have new miles-per-gallon standards and they are effective immediately, and if you have a car that doesn't meet those standards, you of course have to keep paying for your car, but you also have to have a new car. That is what we were about to tell utility users and families. And if you don't think that would have had an impact on jobs, you are just not thinking about jobs.  There was a water rule, the waters of the United States, that would have done about the same thing. Both of those have been pushed back by the courts, and hopefully we are walking toward a more reasonable situation where we are thinking about how to accomplish the same goals in a way that lets families accomplish their dreams.  Then the second thing, the transportation issue: Does the transportation system work for what you want to make? Can you get the material where you need to get it? Can you get a product in a way that continues to make you competitive? And the State and Federal Government and local governments are very, very much in charge of the decisions that make that environment whatever it is.  So when we are thinking about ``Made in America,'' we have to think about those things. Then we have to think, with that infrastructure in place, what is the third and crucial piece of that puzzle coming together? It is a workforce that is competitive and prepared and an education system that is prepared to help with whatever comes next.  If we think we know what the average person, or any person, is going to be doing and how they are going to be doing it 20 years from now, I suspect none of us are quite that able to predict what 20 years from now is going to look like. In fact, if we had thought about the way we do most of the work we do now 20 years ago, it would be amazing: Oh, it is just 20 years later, but we didn't have the cell phone, we didn't have an iPad, we didn't have a computer. There was nothing at the factory that did what that machine does right now. We have to have a workforce that is ready, and we have to do all we can to make that workforce ready.  On the infrastructure front, we need to look not only at the infrastructure bill that is coming up, but also how many more tools can we put in the tool box. Senator Warner and I reintroduced the BRIDGE Act to provide one more tool to create more incentive for private sector partnerships, to do things differently than we have done them before. If we are going to get different results, we have to do different things. If we do just exactly what we have been doing, we are going to get just exactly what we have been getting.  So as the President focuses, I think properly, on the kinds of American jobs that create stronger families and more opportunities, we don't want to lose[[Page S4107]]this week without also thinking about those jobs, thinking about the 12.3 million Americans who work at making things, thinking about the more than a quarter of a million Missourians who do that. Think about the others who work at growing things and how an economy that makes things and grows things is a stronger economy than an economy where people just trade services with each other. There is nothing wrong with trading services, but if you do that on top of a productive economy, it has a much better likelihood for everyone involved to serve the people who provide the services, as well as the people who are out there making things that are competitive in the world to have better opportunities.  I appreciate the President and Vice President this week calling attention to that important part of what we do as we move toward transportation and infrastructure and other things.                Thoughts and Prayers for Senator McCain  Mr.President, while I am on the floor, I want to mention for just a minute our friend, John I know lots of prayers have been said for Senator McCain and his family. Lots of stories today have been told and traded, and there are lots of stories to tell.  When I was in the House for 14 years, I was often in brief meetings with Senator Frankly, I never grew to appreciate him anywhere near like I did when I had a chance to begin to work with him every day. For me, at least, he was an acquired taste. It took time to really see his strength, his tenacity, and to understand that irascibility was just part of who he is and part of his determination to make the country and the Congress and the Senate better.  It would be hard to find anyone more determined or less fearful. In fact, someone in a recent debate in the last year or so said that Senator McCain had--I think a reporter said that Senator McCain had done something because he was afraid to do the other thing. When asked about it, Senator McCain said: Well, it has been a long time since I was afraid.  He is a man who served his country day after day after day, and still does; a believer in what we stand for; someone who has traveled all over the world, as I have had a chance to travel to dangerous spots and other places. Over and over again, as I would get there, people would say: Here is what Senator McCain had to say when he was here. Here is what Senator McCain did when he was here. Senator McCain was here last week. He was there, always proud of the independence and determination and democracy and freedom that he stands for.  We all know he is in a fight right now, but we all also know he is a fighter. He is not a man who surrenders. I know the prayers of not only the Senate but so many people all over the country and, frankly, all over the world go out to help John McCain as he faces this fight.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1488,topic-id,386,"Mr.Chairman, the amendment I am offering with my colleague, Representative Susan Davis, strengthens coordination between subsidized employment through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, program, other Federal workforce development programs, and the Federal Work-Study program.  The goal of the Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act is to help low-income individuals gain the experience and skills necessary for long-term success in the workforce and access to family-sustaining wages. Yet studies of the long-term effects on unemployment from short-term, subsidized employment programs demonstrate differing outcomes, which is why I commend my colleagues for including robust reporting and evaluation requirements in the underlying bill.  We already know that other efforts have clear long-term benefits. Adults who attain postsecondary credentials and degrees are much more likely to be employed and much less likely to rely on public assistance. For example, about 90 percent of young adults who earn a bachelor's degree are employed. The employment rate for those who don't complete high school is just 48 percent. Not surprisingly, the vast majority--approximately 93 percent--of TANF recipients did not attain education beyond high school.  Helping more low-income adults complete postsecondary credential programs and degrees is a proven strategy for reducing reliance on public assistance and promoting self-sufficient households. This is a bipartisan goal.  Our amendment advances this goal by helping to give more low-income parents high-quality work opportunities while enrolled in postsecondary programs. Currently, the Federal Work-Study program provides part-time jobs to students. Studies show that those students who are lucky enough to get a Federal Work-Study job have higher completion rates and are more likely to work in a position that aligns with their program of study.  Unfortunately, Federal Work-Study alone cannot meet the demand for connecting low-income students with valuable, work-based learning opportunities. In fact, only about 2 percent of community college students participate in Federal Work- The subsidized employment program authorized in the bill we are debating today could help address this unmet need and target additional support to low-income student parents, helping[[Page H5120]]them attain a credential or degree and vastly improving their long-term employment prospects.  Administering the subsidized employment program in conjunction with the Federal Work-Study program requires coordination among State agencies and higher education institutions. My amendment encourages this coordination, and I encourage Members to support it.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-06-23-pt1-PgH5114-6.txt,2092,RECESS,2017.0,23.0,August
1489,topic-id,190,"Mr.Chairman, a number of State programs leverage Federal Work-Study funds to help TANF recipients who are enrolled in community college programs meet work requirements and get real-world experience in jobs that reinforce what they are studying.  Additionally, the Government Accountability Office has recommended improving coordination between employment and training programs, and the Department of Health and Human Services guidelines on helping TANF recipients succeed in career pathways makes recommendations for using the Federal Work-Study program in conjunction with TANF to boost the attainment of industry-recognized credentials.  There is precedent and widespread support for improving the coordination of programs that help low-income individuals gain work experience to subsidize employment. Again, our amendment does not require States to devote funds from TANF-subsidized employment programs to low-income student parents, but it does ask States to consider how they are using subsidized employment--whether through TANF or Federal Work-Study--in concert to give more people the opportunity to earn a higher education degree or credential and, thereby, a significantly improved chance at finding a long-term, living-wage job.

1486,topic-id,420,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today to provide relief to the people of Cairo, Illinois, and other communities across the country who have fallen victim to corruption in their local housing authorities.  Last year, the Department of Housing and Urban Development took control of Alexander County Housing Authority in my district after decades of fraud and mismanagement. Many of Cairo's public housing units were falling apart, rating somewhere between dangerous and unlivable. All the while, the housing authority's senior staff continued to cash in: excessive pay, great benefits, large pension payouts, and big consulting contracts for former executive directors. All of this was paid for with taxpayers' money.  An investigation by The Southern Illinoisan newspaper found local residents coping with leaking roofs, moldy living facilities, broken heating and air conditioning, rats, and cockroaches--unbelievable living conditions.  This didn't happen overnight. It happened after many years of neglect. The situation is so bad that the worst housing units in Cairo are being destroyed, and families are being required to move.  Sadly, Cairo's story is not unique. Similar stories of mismanagement and fraud have occurred in housing authorities across the country. While I continue to fight for families in Cairo, we must work to help those who have been relocated at no fault of their own.  My amendment would require the State applications include plans to help these families transition to their new communities and find work. This will be an important step forward for Americans already fighting to stay on their feet.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I want to say to everyone, if they can, to support this amendment.  I want everyone to know also that it is my hope that both State and Federal authorities pursue, in this particular case, those who have abused the system, that they prosecute them, and that they are put in situations where they are in prison, because there they will receive better housing conditions than what they left these people with.  Now, this amendment deals with the fact of allowing them the opportunity to work and to step them up into a better life.

In virtually all matters, the Deputy Secretary has the authority of the That is why I look at this position with such an important critique, because we know in past positions there have been conflicts, and we know we have important policies to discuss, and we need to make sure we have no conflicts of interest.  I have made no secret that I have concerns about this nomination. Mr.Bernhardt is no stranger to this body and he is no stranger to the Department of the He held a number of senior political positions in the Department during the Bush administration beginning in 2006.  After leaving the Department in 2009, he returned to a successful private practice. For 8 years, he has represented a wide range of clients, including oil and gas companies, mining companies, and water supply interests in California, just to name a few. If he is confirmed, he will oversee the same companies at the Department of the Interior; that is, he will be making decisions on the same things that he lobbied for at the agency, and now he will be on the other side of the table and be able, after a short period of time, to make decisions in those areas.  So, as I said at his confirmation hearing--I'm not suggesting that just working for the private sector disqualifies someone, but when you have a wide range of issues that you have worked on in the private sector and now you are going to be on the other side of the table, it brings up concerns.  The President of the United States traveled the country when he was campaigning and said he wanted to drain the swamp from special interests, and he has repeated that many times over the last few years. But with Mr.Bernhardt's nomination, I am afraid he is not draining the swamp, he is actually helping to fill it.  The nominee's private sector experience as a registered lobbyist for companies whose main public policy focuses are in the Department of Interior creates an appearance of a conflict of interest. Also, the nominee wants to lead the Department that he sued four times.  It is true that Mr.Bernhardt has considerable experience. We saw another nominee come to this same post in a past administration on the same basis. People thought he had a lot of experience in a lot of these cases, but he obviously didn't follow the law and ended up going to jail because of his overreaching within the agency and organization.  So these are very important public policy issues, public lands issues--interests that the American people need to make sure are aboveboard and no conflicts of interest.  Mr.Bernhardt served in the highest levels of the Department of the Interior at a time when the inspector general called it ``a culture of ethical failure.'' I know that at the hearing he told us he tried to help change that failure of culture within the agency. The Inspector General also testified that ``ethics failures on the part of senior department officials--taking the form of appearances of impropriety, favoritism and bias--have been routinely dismissed with a promise `not to do it again.' ''  While Mr.Bernhardt has given testimony about the fact that he tried to help change and get away from that culture, I still have concerns that his private sector client base poses a significant problem. The nominee's extensive client base in the area, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, creates at least an inherent appearance of conflict. He and his clients have lobbied extensively on such matters as the Cadiz pipeline in California, opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, and weakening the Endangered Species He has advocated in favor of expanding offshore drilling and lifting the moratorium in the Gulf after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. He also represented Westlands Water District, the Nation's largest irrigation district, as a registered lobbyist. His law firm represented Westlands in four different lawsuits against the Department of the  In November 2016, he joined the Trump transition team, and Mr.Bernhardt deregistered as a lobbyist for Westlands yet continued to work for them in some capacity.  As the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I raised concerns about these issues with the nominee during his confirmation hearing. He has submitted required financial disclosure and ethics forms, but there are specific questions we want to make sure are addressed.  He has declined to comment on recusing himself beyond just the 1-year minimum that is required by the ethics rules. I know Mr.Bernhardt says he will comply with whatever the organization and agency requires, but we don't have the time, given the long list of conflicts of interest and given that past case representation, to constantly know every issue and every meeting and every oversight to make sure that undue influence is not being pressured at the Department of  The President of the United States, who nominated Mr.Bernhardt, told the Times just yesterday in a conversation about the Attorney General: ``If he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked someone else.'' Well, I hope that is not the issue here. I hope the agency isn't running fast toward somebody who just won't recuse themselves in hopes that they will get someone who will do the bidding of these interests and not take into consideration the complexity, the legal structure, and the challenges that dealing with these issues takes.  In fact, as late as March of this year, Mr.Bernhardt's firm was submitting invoices to Westlands for lobbying charges with itemized expenses. Documents show he was engaged in regular contact with congressional offices and working on legislation and efforts to inform administration policy at the same time he was serving on the Trump transition team.  Even the appearance that Mr.Bernhardt was still lobbying on behalf of clients that do business with the Department of the Interior at the same time he wants to help lead it validates some of the concerns we have been expressing.  I remain concerned about his record on behalf of these corporations at the expense of the environment and his tenure at the Department of the Interior and many other challenges. The Department's responsibilities and jurisdictions are just too vast. They are too important to the American people to just green-light someone who I believe will be very challenged in doing this job. So I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination.  Just today, a complaint was filed with a U.Attorney about this nominee's alleged lobbying activities based on new records available pursuant to California public records law. I want answers from the nominee. We are going to continue to ask questions.  In the meantime, I ask my colleagues to oppose this nomination.

1607,topic-id,757,"Mr.President, I wish to introduce the Medicare Home Health Flexibility Act of 2017. I am pleased that my colleague, the senior Senator from Nevada, Mr.Heller, has agreed to cosponsor this bipartisan, no-cost legislation that would allow occupational therapists to perform the initial home health assessment visit and comprehensive assessments in cases in[[Page S2620]]which occupational therapy is ordered by the physician, along with speech language pathology and/or physical therapy services, and skilled nursing care is not required. Our bill will help ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive timely access to essential home health therapy care.  Occupational therapists have long been recognized as a valuable component of our Nation's healthcare workforce and a critical aspect of home healthcare because of their focus on patients' functional capabilities and their expertise in home safety. Physicians frequently order occupational therapy as part of an initial plan of care for patients requiring home health care, alongside the qualifying services of physical therapy, speech-language pathology, and skilled nursing. Under certain circumstances, an occupational therapist is allowed to perform the comprehensive assessment to determine a Medicare beneficiary's continuing need for home healthcare. However, under current Medicare law, occupational therapists are not permitted to conduct the initial assessment for home health cases, even when occupational therapy is included in the physician's order and when the case is exclusively related to rehabilitation therapy. Additionally, occupational therapists are not allowed to complete the comprehensive assessment unless occupational therapy is the qualifying service.  By permitting occupational therapists to perform initial home health assessment visits and comprehensive assessments in limited circumstances, the Medicare Home Health Flexibility Act can help prevent delays in the time it takes for Medicare beneficiaries to receive essential home healthcare, especially in underserved areas where access to physical therapists and speech language pathologists may be limited. On January 13, 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, released the final conditions of participation, or COPs, for home health agencies participating in Medicare and These new COPs expand the content of the home health comprehensive assessment to include the patient's functional, psychosocial, and cognitive status, all of which are areas of expertise for occupational therapists. The new COPs also require the creation of a patient-centered plan of care that is informed by the comprehensive assessment. As a result of their comprehensive education and unique training, occupational therapists are qualified to perform the necessary assessments to adhere to these new CMS home health guidelines.  It is important to note that the Medicare Home Health Flexibility Act would apply only to rehabilitation therapy cases in which skilled nursing care is not required. Nurses would still be required to conduct the initial assessment for all home health cases in which skilled nursing care is ordered by the physician. Also, although the legislation would allow occupational therapists to conduct the initial home health assessment visit and comprehensive assessments, it would not alter the existing criteria for establishing eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit.  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Heller and to support the Medicare Home Health Flexibility Act to correct the discrepancy in Medicare regulations between therapy providers and to help ensure timely access to essential, high-quality home health therapy care for Medicare beneficiaries.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 977       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

1374,topic-id,1952,"Mr.President, I am here to speak about a topic which, wherever I go, people speak about--the replacement of the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare, as people call it. Clearly, we need action.  I had a Facebook post maybe a week or two ago from Brian in Covington, He said: My family plan is $1,700. The quote goes on to say how his family cannot afford that $1,700.  Rates are going up, which I have said time and time again. My friend back in Baton Rouge, he and his wife are 60, 61. The quote for their insurance last year was $39,000--for 1 year. That is clearly not affordable. This is not just in Louisiana; it is in Washington, DC, it is in California, it is across our Nation where individual market quotes are going up that they cannot support.  Most recently, Connecticut insurers--there are two--are proposing rate increases that are 15.2 percent and 33.8 percent, on average, respectively. They are quoting 22 percent over 2017. In Maryland, some insurers are going to raise rates as much as 59 percent for those individual plans.  I am a physician. I learned a couple of things in my 20 or 30 years of practice. One, to lower costs, the patient must have the power; and, two, the insurance must be affordable; and, three, that the insurance they receive must be adequate. President Trump totally got this. On the campaign trail, President Trump said time and again--what I call his contract with the voter. He wanted folks to maintain coverage with lower premiums, care for those with preexisting conditions, and eliminating mandates. I think President Trump just knew it. I shorthand this, if you will, saying, if we focus on lowering premiums and making sure it passes the Jimmy Kimmel test. The late-night comedian, when his child was born with a terrible heart problem, immediately got the care that child needed. So if we can have insurance that passes the Jimmy Kimmel test--lowering premiums, taking care of the rest of President Trump's goals, then I think we can accomplish it. We need to talk to experts, actuaries, those who[[Page S3259]]design insurance plans, to make sure we come up with something.  There is something else the President said that I want to focus on. This is just before he took the oath of office. He said people covered under the law--meaning the Republican replacement--can expect to have great healthcare. ``It will be much simplified.'' One of the complaints about the Affordable Care Act is it is so complicated. Even online, 16 pages online, with your W-2, if you don't get it, you get booted out. The President said we must have a much simpler way of going about this--much less expensive and much better.  What could this look like? Let me propose some conservative solutions that could be in a Republican plan that would achieve the President's goal. First, the patient has to have the power. In my 30 years of practice, I found that if the patient has the power, the system lines up to serve her. One example is price transparency. If we can put in that a provider has to publish the provider's price, so the patient getting the blood test knows the cost of the blood test at that moment and can compare it to someone down the street, we will lower cost.  One example just came up in a newspaper out of New Nola.com is their website. A woman went in and got blood tests. She received a bill weeks later and her bill was for $324. She found she could have gotten the same blood test for $34 right down the street. A woman from Texas came up. She said she heard me speak of price transparency--the power of negotiating, if you will. The doctor ordered an MRI on her son's shoulder. She called up the different places where she could have it done and she got a price of $667. On my Facebook page is a little video of her speaking: I got it for $667. Then I remembered what you said: If you pay cash, you get a discount. I called them back. I said, if I pay cash, will you give me a lower price? They said: Pay us cash, we will cut that $667 to $400. The patient had the power. So she ended up paying far less for the procedure the doctor ordered. That is one conservative solution, give the patient the power.  Secondly, let States innovate. We need to take all of this power that ObamaCare brought to Washington, DC, and push it back out to the If we do that, we are going to accomplish something. Let's just acknowledge that there are 700,000 people or so in If you took a map of the State of Alaska and put it over the lower 48, it would stretch from roughly Georgia to the Pacific Washington, DC, has almost the same population as Alaska, and you can walk across the city in a morning. Clearly, you need different solutions for an area you can walk across and an area you cannot fly across in the same time that you would walk across Washington, We have to return power back to the patients. We have to engage doctors and patients so those patients with complex conditions get their healthcare managed. I use the example of a diabetic. She perhaps developed childhood diabetes, and now she is 35 years old. If a doctor is managing her condition, she works, stays at home, her complications are minimal, and her life is much better. If her condition is not managed, she comes to the emergency room three times a month with diabetes out of control. That just shoots a hole in the bucket of fiscal responsibility and also in her health. Instead of working, keeping a family, she is coming to the hospital, getting care through the emergency room, which she cannot afford to pay for, and that cost is shifted to everyone else. That is not the way to manage that. We need to engage doctors with patients.  Another conservative solution is we need more competition between insurers so there is not just one insurance company in the market that can therefore set prices but rather we have multiple. So if we give the patient the power by giving the patient a tax credit that she can use to purchase the insurance she wishes to have, that will create competition as more insurers enter the market. If we have that competition--those market forces--prices come down.  When the President said we have to make things simpler, I think that also includes how we enroll people in insurance. We figured that out on Under Medicare, if someone turns 65, they are on It could not be simpler. They get a letter. They are on If they don't want to, they can call: Hey, I don't want to be on But as a rule, they are on  Fortune 500 companies have figured out the same thing. In order to enroll people into retirement plans they say: Listen, you are in the 401(k) plan unless you choose not to be. That makes it simpler to get a 95-percent enrollment in retirement plans. Now, you could say: Hey, listen, you have to fill out a bunch of forms. If you don't fill out these forms, you are not going to be enrolled. But that would not work for It would not work for 401(k)s. It has not worked under  We need to take those same sort of solutions we have found for both Medicare and enrolling people in their retirement and do it for the Republican alternative.  The Republican alternative would say: We make it easy to enroll. You are in unless you are out. So if you are eligible for a tax credit, you would receive it. You would then have the insurance. If you were passive about it, you would have a default policy. But if you are active, you could do more with it. But by doing so, you actually increase the number of people insured.  Now, when you increase the pool of those insured, you lower premiums. We had Blue Cross look at our proposal to make it easy to enroll: You are in unless you are out. That would lower premiums by 20 percent, just by expanding the number of those who are insured--20 percent.  So when President Trump says he wants to continue coverage, caring for those with preexisting conditions without mandates and lowering premiums, doing this feature where you are in unless you call us and tell us you don't want to be and making it simple achieves all four goals.  We would increase coverage. By that, we would lower premiums, taking care of those with preexisting conditions. Now, again, it is using the mechanism that is already used in Medicare and in Fortune 500 companies, making it easy to enroll. There are some who don't want to give States the options. They don't want to give patients the options. They don't want to make it simple to enroll. They want to replace, if you will, the tyranny of ObamaCare--where all of this power is taken to Washington, DC, and States and people were told what they had to do--with a different sort of tyranny, telling States what they can't do.  I think we ought to give as much power to the States, as much latitude to the patients to come up with the solutions that work for them. That is the conservative way to go.  But I will say, in speaking with conservatives, that I very much invite our Democratic colleagues to come to the table. There are some of my Democratic colleagues who have said they just want Republicans to work through this, thinking that it might be a political train wreck that would work to their advantage. But in those States there are Americans whose premiums are becoming unaffordable.  I mentioned earlier that in Connecticut premiums are rising 15 and 34 percent this year. In Oregon, it is as high as 22 percent, and Maryland is as high as 60 percent.  Now, who cares if the person is a Democrat or a Republican? If her premium is increasing 60 percent, she cannot afford it. So I challenge my Democratic colleagues to get off the sidelines and engage. Try to do something not for political purposes but for the purpose of that person who is at home struggling to pay the bills and deciding that she can no longer afford insurance, but, perhaps unbeknown to her, she has a cancer brewing inside her. Just when she decides she can no longer afford coverage because premiums have risen 60 percent, that is when her cancer is discovered.  We have to address this. It will take us on either side of the aisle--both Democrats and Republicans--to work together. I will finish with a quote from a fellow from Covington, Brian, on my Facebook page. He said that his family plan is $1,700 a month, for him, his wife, and his two children. The ACA, the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, has brought him to his knees. I hope we can get something done. The middle class is dwindling away. Can everyone just come together and figure this out?[[Page S3260]]  This is a cry for help. It is a challenge to Republicans and Democrats to come up with a plan that is not a red plan or a blue plan but an American plan to address his needs, his wife's needs, and those similar to him across the country.

1602,topic-id,405,"Mr.President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin, in introducing the Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act of 2017.  Every day, an estimated 43 million family caregivers attend to loved ones who are experiencing chronic, disabling health conditions. While many of these individuals care for an older adult, almost one-third of caregivers attend to persons under the age of 50. Caregivers help individuals remain at home, often delaying the need for nursing home or foster care placements. The value of their efforts are tremendous, amounting to more than $470 billion in uncompensated care. This task, however, can take a toll. Caregivers experience higher mortality rates and are more likely to acquire acute and chronic health conditions. That is why respite care is so important. It provides temporary relief to caregivers from their ongoing responsibilities, reducing the toll they experience. Respite care helps keep caregivers healthy, keeps families intact, and provides a substantial public value.  Recently, the Senate Aging Committee, which I chair, held a hearing on age-friendly communities. Meg Callaway, the project director of the Piscataquis Thriving in Place Coalition in Dover-Foxcroft, ME, testified that ``the one most critical service is respite.'' We have heard this time and time again.  In 2006, when the Lifespan Respite Care Act was originally enacted, the goal was to improve the delivery and quality of respite care available to all caregivers. Since that time, 35 States and the District of Columbia have received grants to increase the availability and quality or respite services.  Still, with an increasing number of Americans with chronic conditions who require some amount of caregiver support on a daily basis, the need for respite care continues to increase and outpace available resources.  The legislation that we are introducing would authorize $15 million per year for 5 years, through 2022, to extend the program. Such funding would provide competitive grants to States to establish or enhance statewide Lifespan Respite systems that maximize existing resources and help ensure that quality respite care is available and accessible to all family caregivers. This reauthorization also would require grantees to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of programs and activities funded under such grants.  Thirty-six aging and disability organizations have endorsed the Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act, including the ARCH National Respite Network, the Alzheimer's Association, the Michael Fox Foundation, and the Elizabeth Dole  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-23-pt1-PgS3092-3.txt,2121,TRIBUTE TO DR.

Federal workers are hardworking civil servants. They serve the American people. I know my friend from Florida agrees. The overwhelming majority of them are dedicated. They seize a mission every day, whether it be at the VA, the Social Security Administration, or our Nation's parks. They are dedicated to the proposition that they are there to serve the American people. It is important to honor their service, to respect their service, to not allow even the inference to be drawn that a negative example somehow could be construed as characteristic of the whole, for that is false.  That is the narrative we Democrats and, hopefully, a number of Republicans want to change, because it is not true. We want to honor those civil servants.

1397,topic-id,474,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I reluctantly rise in opposition to H.883, the Targeting Child Predators Act of 2017.  You see, child sexual exploitation and abuse are reprehensible crimes committed against the most vulnerable members of our society. Unfortunately, these offenses have been increasingly facilitated by the use of the internet in recent years. H.883 would change the administrative subpoena statute to facilitate the prosecution of criminals who commit these terrible crimes against children.  Without question, I support the goal of pursuing these criminals, but, nevertheless, I am concerned that this bill would eliminate judicial oversight of nondisclosure orders currently required prior to the issuance of the administrative subpoenas.  Section 3486 of title 18 of the United States Code authorizes investigators to request a 90-day order of nondisclosure from a district court judge. The order of nondisclosure forbids the recipient, such as an internet service provider, from alerting the target of the investigation of the law enforcement's inquiry. H.883 would extend the nondisclosure period from 90 days to 180 days to allow investigators more time to complete their investigations before the target is informed of the inquiry.  Although I would like to have more information about why it is necessary to extend this time period, it is particularly problematic combined with the other significant change to the law made by this very legislation. H.883 would allow investigators to require nondisclosure of internet service providers without the approval of a judge, thereby eliminating any judicial oversight prior to issuance of the subpoena.  The administrative subpoena authority is an extraordinary power given to certain agencies by Congress under its limited circumstances. While the legislation would allow a recipient to challenge a nondisclosure order in court, I am concerned about the bill's elimination of judicial approval on the front end.  I understand the desire to do more to facilitate the investigation of these crimes and that the online context for them has raised issues that we should continue to examine, but I do not believe we have been given enough information justifying this bill, at least in its current form.  Elimination of prior judicial approval of nondisclosure orders is a step we should undertake only based on evidence and careful deliberation. A bill such as the one before us warrants at least a legislative hearing to consider its potential ramifications. I don't think that is asking too much that we have a hearing on this matter before we decide what to do with the proposal rather than not have one at all. Our committee has not had the benefit of any such hearing on this legislation, and I think this is not the proper way the members of the House Judiciary Committee, who are mostly lawyers, should proceed.  Mr.Speaker, accordingly, I oppose H.883, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-05-22-pt1-PgH4406.txt,229,ACCELERATING INDIVIDUALS INTO THE WORKFORCE ACT,2017.0,22.0,May

1368,topic-id,1383,"Mr.President, I came to the floor to talk about other matters, and I will get to those in a moment. I can't help but be struck by the Democratic leader's sudden interest in addressing healthcare reform.  It is a fact that even if Hillary Clinton were elected President of the United States, we would be revisiting the failed promises of the Affordable Care For example, premiums, since 2013, have gone up 105 percent in the individual market. Those are people who don't have employer-provided coverage or aren't on Medicare or Small businesses and individuals who have to go out and purchase their[[Page S3256]]healthcare have seen premiums go up 105 percent.  We hear stories every day--and I will recount some of those from Texas--where people say they have zero choices. For example, in Iowa, we learned there are no insurance companies that are willing to sell health insurance on the individual market. That isn't because of anything that President Trump or the Republican majority have done. These are the failures of  President Obama made extravagant promises about ObamaCare, none of which has really proven to be true. He said he would bring down premiums $2,500 for a family of four. Well, these folks in the individual market have seen their premiums go up 105 percent since 2013. He said that if you like your policy, you could keep your policy. That proved not to be true because unless you bought the government-approved healthcare policy, insurance companies couldn't sell it on the exchanges. He said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.  But as people found out when their policies changed, frequently the doctors in the network they could see changed. People saw premiums go up. They lost coverage they liked, and they lost the doctor they had confidence in.  So the suggestion of the Democratic leader that somehow this current situation is a result of President Trump or congressional action is ludicrous. I think people understand that, but I just couldn't resist responding a little bit to what he had to say, because sometimes when people don't respond they assume there isn't a response, and clearly there is.              Tribute to Texas Military Academy Appointees  Mr.President, it is good to be back at work here in Washington after a work week at home. I had the honor, starting on Memorial Day, of spending some time with Texas's newest recruits to our country's military academies.  Every year, now for the 11th year, I have had the privilege of hosting an academy sendoff ceremony in ``Military City U.S.A.,'' my hometown of San This annual gathering recognizes the bright young Texans who have accepted an appointment to one of the premier military academies that serve our Armed Forces, and I am always proud to celebrate the incredible achievement they have made so far in their young lives and encourage them as they begin a life of public service. It is truly inspirational, and it is my favorite event of the year.  This year about 272 young Texans have answered the call to get a service academy education and a career in military service. It is a good deal if you can qualify for it because basically you get a free ride to one of these premier service academies, and we train the next generation of military leaders, which is good for all of us.  My wife Sandy and I look forward to this event each year, and we find that Memorial Day is a fitting time to send off these young men and women, while we at the same time remembering the ultimate sacrifice made by those who gave their lives answering that same call to service.  I try to recruit a top-tier speaker to these events, somebody who will challenge and inspire these young men and women, and this year was no exception. ADM William McRaven, the Chancellor of the University of Texas System, spoke to these incoming midshipmen about lessons he learned in public service and his 37 years in the U.Navy as a Navy  He spoke candidly that this would be the greatest challenge of their young lives but also the most rewarding. He said it would be a decision they would never regret. He also spent some time--appropriately, on Memorial Day--talking about the heroes who have sacrificed all to serve the military in the greatest country in the world. So all in all, Memorial Day was a great day, and it was a great event for these young men and women.    Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower                             Protection Bill  Mr.President, as we come back the week after Memorial Day, I know I am not the only one encouraged to find better and more effective ways to serve our country. Fortunately, this Chamber in the Senate will have a chance to do that. Soon we will vote on a bill that will reform the U.Department of Veterans Affairs, a Department riddled with inefficiencies and marked too often by scandal and corruption.  This is a huge government department. At last count, some 330,000 people worked for the Veterans' Administration and, unfortunately, we have all become familiar with the horror stories of fake scheduling, indicating that people actually were being seen who were not seen, huge wait times, and people literally dying as a result of not getting the treatment they earned by virtue of their service in the military through the Department of Veterans  The legislation we will vote on is called the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection It will protect the Veterans' Administration employees who care deeply for veterans by protecting them as whistleblowers. It also provides managers with the tools they need to address poor performance and misconduct. To sum it up, this bill will make it easier for VA employees to be held accountable, and that is something the Veterans' Administration and our veterans desperately need, and it has for some time. It will make the VA work better for the men and women who have served us so well.  I should point out that at a time when I suspect people doubt whether there is any bipartisanship in the Congress or in Washington, this is a bipartisan piece of legislation. It was voted out of the Veterans' Affairs Committee by a voice vote 2 weeks ago, which essentially is by unanimous consent.  It has growing support among groups focused on helping our returning warriors to get the treatment, care, and support they need. That is because the VA bill will do what it is supposed to do and, unfortunately, hasn't always done well, which is to serve our veterans.  Like all of us, I have the honor of meeting with our veterans regularly and working with them to help them succeed after giving so much of themselves to keep our country safe.  One other example of bipartisan legislation that was signed last week by the President of the United States is a bill called the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act, a bill that I introduced to help connect veterans to opportunities in law enforcement in their local communities. So it is another example--perhaps, not in the headlines. There is not a big partisan food fight over it. So maybe most people are not aware of it. But I think it is important to remind people that, amid all of the distractions they see in Washington and in the news, there is important work being done to benefit people who certainty deserve it, and that would be the case for our veterans.  I am thankful for the work of the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Isakson, as well as the diligent and thoughtful work of the Senator from Florida, Mr.Rubio, on this important veterans bill. I look forward to passing this bill soon.  Mr.President, I also look forward this afternoon to confirming the nominee for general counsel of the Central Intelligence Director Pompeo has been there for some time now, having been nominated by President Trump and confirmed. He is an outstanding choice to be the Director of the Central Intelligence Like every organization, it seems these days, the CIA needs a good lawyer to lead its effort to make sure that it conducts itself precisely in accordance with the rule of law.

In her many years of public service and private practice, Courtney has earned the esteem of her colleagues across both parties and two administrations. David Kris, an Obama appointee, calls her ``a first-class lawyer.'' Ben Powell, a Bush appointee, calls her ``one of the finest lawyers of her generation.'' Caroline Krass, another Obama appointee, calls her ``an excellent choice.'' And Wan Kim, another Bush appointee, says she is ``careful, brilliant, and highly accomplished.''  In other words, you don't need me to tell you Courtney Elwood is a first-rate attorney. In fact, you don't need anyone to tell you that because her accomplishments speak for themselves.

Rather than responding with anger and hate, Idaho is moving forward with a positive spirit of renewal and inclusiveness. Dan Prinzing, executive director of the Wassmuth Center for Human Rights that built the memorial with support from the Carr Foundation and others and now partners with Boise Parks and Recreation to maintain the memorial, said, ``An act of hate by an individual is not us, the community's response to the act is what defines who we are and the values we share.

The love and care, including the support of Idaho students and their families, that went into this memorial's creation is prevailing upon its restoration and contributing to ongoing human rights discussions.

I believe the data point outlined in my amendment will further help Congress measure the performance of this program in the scope that should apply to all of our Nation's welfare programs: placing people into meaningful work and helping them and their families achieve self-sufficiency. We need this data to ensure the project is truly working.  When I worked in manufacturing, data was a vital component to solving problems. It showed me what worked best, what failed, and, most importantly, what needed to be changed and how to get to the root cause. The same science applies to solving problems here and to this program.

1479,topic-id,806,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman and both my colleagues, though I respectfully disagree that this Congress has placed any priority on helping get people out of poverty. Indeed, when it comes to poverty in America, this Congress has largely been silent. I think the Congress itself is impoverished when it comes to ideas about how to lift people up into the middle class.  We talk here so much about the middle class, and appropriately so, but there are millions of people out there who are struggling to just climb up that first or second rung of the economic ladder and work themselves into the middle class, and this Congress is doing little, constructively, to assist them.  The need for real and meaningful change is particularly evident in my home State of Texas, where the State legislature has been so incredibly indifferent to this problem. There, one out of every four children is below the poverty level, and over one-third of all Texans live in the shadow of poverty, meaning that their income is less than twice the poverty threshold. The Corporation for Enterprise Development ranked Texas near the bottom among all States on key measures related to financial security.  Now, here is what today's bipartisan bill does to respond to that, and it is really a story of the number one.  Of the several Republican proposals that were originally advanced by now-Speaker Paul Ryan two years ago, some introduced by Republican colleagues and some containing good ideas, this is the one last bill standing.  With the notable exception of a budget that is devastating to opportunities for poor Americans, this is the one and only bill on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, previously known as welfare, that Republicans will even permit us to discuss on the floor of this  This one very modest bill does not add one new dollar to address the challenges that those who want to rise from welfare to work need. It simply segregates $100 million from an existing fund for one year.  Now, get this: the fund from which they are segregating the $100 million from, Donald Trump is seeking to abolish the entire fund so that no moneys for this proposal will be available after one year.  This bill gives the States no new flexibility, and no new authority. It does not authorize them to do anything that they cannot do today. Indeed, some States--and I think my colleague from Illinois referenced one of these--are already finding ways to, in appropriate situations, subsidize employment.  What this bill does is to say that on this particular $100 million fund, as long as it lasts, until President Trump eliminates it entirely, that the States must use the money in a particular way. In other words, it seeks to restrict the States who receive these moneys to require them to use it for one particular way to assist those who are in poverty.  It is also significant that the Trump budget cuts are so far-reaching in trying to undermine efforts to raise people out of poverty, and for those who are not able-bodied, to provide them the support that they need. This bill deals with a little less than one-half of one percent of the Trump budget cuts.  I believe, sincerely, that we need a better approach, that we have ideas on both sides of the aisle that are being blocked by a determination to not address root causes of poverty.  First, we should support initiatives that strike at the early seeds of poverty, like the Home Visiting Program that will expire in a mere three months, which helps to improve opportunities for at-risk children and helps their parents be the parents they want to be; and certainly, early childhood education is a key part of that.  Second, we should increase efforts to help people gain the skills they need to secure jobs through which they can support their families at a living wage, and that is the challenge here. Sure, some employers will love to have taxpayers subsidize their workforce, pay part of the wages that they would otherwise have to pay, and sometimes this is a valuable support, particularly for people that are reentering our society after incarceration and other groups of particularly hard-to-place employees. But for many folks, the big question is, when the subsidy ends, when the taxpayer stops paying, will there be a job there? Is there a job ladder that will allow that person to work themselves up, or are they essentially participating in minimum wage employment that will not support their family and will not provide them a future?  There are in-demand skills-training programs that do work and do offer an alternative, but they are not free. They take an investment. An example is Project QUEST in San  The The time of the gentleman has expired.  ",CREC-2017-06-23-pt1-PgH5114-6.txt,303,RECOGNIZING PENN MEDICINE'S MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS,2017.0,23.0,May

I know there are similar programs in other parts of the country that do the same. They are not subsidized employment, but they are working with poor people to get the skills that they need for an in-demand job and working with local employers to find out what types of jobs are most needed. In many parts of America, our economy is being held back by a lack of qualified workers.  Then, one of the areas that is so important to all parents, but particularly to single moms that are in poverty, is childcare. President Trump is proposing not one, but three cuts to childcare, cutting out hundreds of millions of dollars of support to childcare, which stands in the way of many individuals from working their way out of poverty.  I believe that we need to be working together to try to find genuine solutions and that working together is not just here in this House, in Congress, because the big problem here is that, when we voted in 1996--and I voted for it, for moving from welfare to work--we expected the States to be partners in that effort. Today, as much as we talk about work and getting from welfare to work, exactly 8 cents out of every dollar being spent on the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program--8 cents--goes to work supports. And not very much more than that goes to childcare, and President Trump, of course, wants to reduce that.  It is only by having a comprehensive program that is really focused on the roots of poverty and assisting those[[Page H5117]]who would help themselves that the promise of that welfare law can become effective.  Unfortunately, while we did change fundamentally and end welfare as we know it, it became welfare for Republican Governors who wanted to use these Federal moneys not to assist the poor, but to assist their States fill various budget gaps. We have a great example of where block grants fail. I hope we can find ways to succeed.                              {time}  0930  ",CREC-2017-06-23-pt1-PgH5114-6.txt,303,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,23.0,April

I want to thank Mr.Hoyer, the gentleman from  Let me start by thanking the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr.Royce of California, for authoring this legislation and working to bring it to this floor.  By now we have seen the footage. We went to the film and saw the footage of Turkish thugs attacking peaceful protesters during President Erdogan's visit to Washington a few weeks ago. It is bad enough when we see governments anywhere crack down on basic rights like the freedom of assembly or expression. It is bad enough to see that sort of oppression in the streets of Ankara or Istanbul, but it is becoming more and more common as Turkey slips towards authoritarianism.  But to see that on the streets of Washington, D.C., is absolutely unacceptable--especially at the hands of foreign government officials who are guests in our country. We cannot allow these actions to remain unnoticed and to trample on our constitutional rights.  We know that President Erdogan was never in danger. He simply decided to treat Americans the way he treats his own people. His guards even had the nerve to attack law enforcement officials who were protecting him and his delegation.  This behavior cannot stand, and the resolution before us sends a clear, decisive message that Congress won't tolerate it. The State Department must do whatever it takes to make sure that this does not happen again, and those responsible for these heinous acts must be held accountable. Charges must be filed and pursued.[[Page H4631]]  I am glad to support this measure that puts the House on record saying that we won't stand for this type of bully who attacks American citizens and American democracy.  Mr.Speaker, free speech, free assembly, and free expression are at the core of any democracy across the world. Turkey is certainly a partner and an ally, and it is deeply concerning to see the steady erosion of democracy in that country.  But we cannot tolerate that sort of behavior here in our country. When you are in the United States, you play by our rules, and that means obeying our laws and respecting our values. Those responsible for violence against American citizens should face the consequences. Otherwise, what is to stop them from doing this once again?

Mr.Speaker, I rise today to honor Emil Ogden of College Station, Texas, who passed away on July 25, 2017.  Emil Ogden was born on September 15, 1927, in Blackwell, He was raised by his loving mother, Mary Ogden, in Bowling Green, Growing up during the worst of the Great Depression, Emil experienced poverty firsthand and lived in a one-room house. To provide for her son, Emil's mother worked as a maid at his grandfather's hotel for $2 a week. To help the family, Emil worked any odd job he could find.  During this time, an act of kindness from a member of the local Rotary Club would change his life. Emil was enamored with baseball and would often visit the local hardware store owned by Rotary Club member Ed Ed noticed that Emil loved baseball but could not afford the equipment. He sent a bat, a glove, and a ball to The care that Ed and the Rotary members showed to Emil put his life on a better course.  Emil valued their support, once stating: ``I could have been very rebellious as a child. Things like poverty can make you grow up with some resentment. But all of a sudden, I had a whole town of surrogate fathers, and they cared about me. It motivated me to be a better example as a young man. The leaders of the community who we respected were all members of the Rotary, and I didn't want to disappoint them after they had taken an interest in me.''  In 1945, Emil joined the U.Army Air Corps and was assigned to the 503rd Army Air Forces Base Unit, better known as the Brass Hat The Brass Hat Squadron was a group of esteemed Army pilots whose job it was to fly high-profile persons around the world to significant events.  Based out of Washington National Airport, the squadron flew senior government officials, including senators and congressmen, U.and foreign dignitaries and, military leaders, among others.  Personally, Emil flew dignitaries to events such as the Nuremberg war trials, the atomic bomb tests on Bikini Atoll, and the national independence celebration in the Due to his service in the military, Emil had visited more than 30 countries before his 20th birthday.  In 1947, Emil married his high school sweetheart and the love of his life, Clementine                              {time}  1415  Clementine was the center of Emil's life for over 69 years. Her support and encouragement always kept Emil grounded. Their love and commitment to each other, their Catholic faith, and the values upon which they built their lives, endured until his death. Together they had six children, whom they both loved dearly. At the time of his passing, their legacy included 22 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.  After his service in World War II, Emil went on to play professional baseball in the minor leagues, playing for both the Brooklyn Dodgers' and the Baltimore Orioles' organizations. His career lasted from 1949 to 1953. His baseball career took place in west Texas, first for the Midland Indians and then for the Odessa During his playing days, Emil met several baseball legends, including Jackie  Emil's baseball career came to a close when Clementine gave him an ultimatum: either stay married or keep playing baseball. Emil was a wise man, and he chose to focus on marriage.[[Page H6568]]  Emil began college at Texas A&M University as part of the class of 1953. In the 1980s, he finished a degree in philosophy while he was in his sixties. Upon finishing his degree later in life, Emil said: ``Too many of us grow older and we sit back and say, `Well, I've lived my life. There's nothing else to do. I'll try to live on my past experiences and past knowledge and hope that I survive with some dignity.' I think that person has already partially died.'' Emil's love for learning and his intellectual curiosity would continue through the end of his life.  In 1953, Emil returned to Abilene, Texas, to begin his career in the oil industry. While starting his career, he worked odd jobs to help make ends meet for his growing family. One of those odd jobs was playing the trumpet in local dance bands on the weekends.  In 1973, his independent oil and gas operations hit it big when the properties he was leasing dramatically increased in value, creating the nucleus of Emil's business success. The oil and gas business eventually brought Emil back to College Station in 1979, where he would be instrumental in developing the successful Bryan Woodbine Oil Field in the 1980s.  Passionate about educating youth, Emil helped found the Ogden-Chaparral Entertainment Company, where he produced an educational children's television show called ``ImagineLane'' in the 1990s. The first show aired on KAMU-TV in the Brazos Valley and was eventually shown on stations all across the United  Even with all of his business accomplishments, Emil will best be remembered for his philanthropic efforts in the Brazos His upbringing in poverty and struggles during early life are something Emil never forgot, and it made him empathize with those in need.  He served on the board of directors for the local Boys & Girls Club, in multiple positions for the Knights of Columbus, as chairman of the Arrow Moon District of the Boy Scouts of America, and he was also a member of the Bryan Rotary  A lifelong conservative, Emil also gave to many conservative causes, including donating the seed money to the 40 Days for Life campaign, which began at College Station and advocated for pro-life causes around the world today.  He also sponsors three Habitat for Humanity homes, saying that it was ``my way of giving thanks.''

1417,topic-id,722,"Mr.Speaker, today, I rise to honor Reverend Wilbert Austin of Waco, Texas, who passed away on June 19, 2017.  Wilbert grew up poor in a small shack in the southern part of Waco in a racially segregated area called His father was a day laborer who picked cotton for a living, while his mother was a laundress and cafe worker. Wilbert used to play by the old rendering plant that was next to the cemetery in  Even in their poverty, Wilbert's parents were able to raise five children. His meager upbringing is something that would shape him for the rest of his life and molded him into a great servant.  During his life, Wilbert worked many jobs, including working for a glass bottle manufacturer, Owens-Illinois, and as a leader of the local chapter of the During his time at the NAACP, he was known for advocating for civil rights in Always seeking to make Waco a better place, he would often make sure that children and families had a safe area to play and enjoy by keeping out drug dealers, doing so on a face-to-face basis, if needed.  Wilbert was a passionate advocate for his Christian faith and decided to share his faith in the pulpit. He became a pastor of Moody's Peaceful Rest Baptist Church, where he would serve for 38 years. He was known to his congregation and around Waco as someone with a servant's heart. Wilbert would mow lawns for the elderly and collect gift cards at Christmas to distribute to needy families.  In 1974, Wilbert led an effort to change local city government, and that made him an important part of Waco's history.  In the 1950s, the city had adopted an at-large district after an African-American individual nearly won a city council seat. As a result of his tireless and dedicated efforts, Waco dropped the at-large system and divided its city into five districts, with each district having a single elected representative. His perseverance changed the at-large system because it did not fairly represent the electoral choices of the African-American areas of  Though he never believed he would run for city council, Wilbert's desire to serve eventually led him to campaign for a seat. Wilbert showed great perseverance as he ran for city council five times, ultimately winning a seat in 2006.  He went on to serve as the councilman for District One for 11 years before having to step down earlier this year due to declining health. Today's Waco is a diverse and inclusive city because of his community service.  Wilbert was also a devoted and loving husband to his late wife of 50 years, Annie Pearl Austin, who passed away from breast cancer in 2012. Annie was supportive of her husband's efforts to help Waco and would often tell her children: ``No matter what or why he's out in the public, always love your dad and support him.'' They were blessed with 5 children, and they were the grandparents to 10 grandchildren.  During the last years of his life, Wilbert fought a battle with cancer that he ultimately lost. Throughout his battle, he never lost sight of where he was going. In a farewell address at his retirement party, Wilbert stated: ``I'm all packed up. When you hear of my passing, don't grieve for me. I'm just another soldier going home to be with the Lord.''  Mr.Speaker, Wilbert Austin worked tirelessly to better our central Texas community and did so by serving his congregation, his community, reducing crime, and serving in elected office.  He is loved by our community and certainly left an enduring impression on the greater Waco area. He will forever be remembered as a community leader, pastor, civil rights activist, servant, husband, father, grandfather, and friend.  My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the Austin family. We also lift up the family and friends of Wilbert in our prayers.  I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the United States Capitol to honor the life and legacy of Reverend Wilbert  As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country during these difficult times, for our military men and women who protect us from external threats, and for our first responders who protect us here at home.

1418,topic-id,619,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to honor General Joe Hanover of Woodway, Texas, who passed away on May 22, 2017.  Joe was born in McGregor, Texas, on February 10, 1918. He grew up in a farming community and attended grade school in Wheelock before graduating from Franklin High School in 1938.  Wheelock was a special place to Joe because it is where he met the love of his life, Lucille, in the first grade.  During his high school years in Franklin, Joe became interested in engineering, an interest that would guide much of the rest of his life. Upon graduation from high school, Joe went to Texas A&M University in College Station, where he would go on to earn a bachelor of civil engineering degree in 1940. In 1941, he married Lucille and started his engineering career by working for the Texas Highway Department in  World War II interrupted Joe's early career and family life, as he was called[[Page H5368]]into Active Duty in 1941. He was commissioned into the U.Army 10 months prior to Pearl Harbor and still carried his original orders to report to Camp Wallace, Texas, until the day he passed away.  During his service in World War II, George served in the European theater, notably in Belgium and He served in the 54th Coastal Artillery, a division that had 3,000 African-American soldiers in it.  At the conclusion of the war, Joe was given command of a German prisoner of war camp in Marseilles, In an interview with the local newspaper, Joe was quoted as saying: ``I started as a commander of Black soldiers, fighting against the world's greatest racist, Adolph Hitler, and finished as the commander of a prison holding German soldiers who had tried to carry out Hitler's plans.''  Joe's enlistment lasted 5 years, and he was given orders to go home in February 1946. He also joined the Army Reserve, from which he retired in 1971 with the rank of brigadier general. When he returned to the United States, he went back to work for the Texas Highway Department, embarking on a career that would last for more than 35 years.  Joe worked on numerous projects throughout the State and is best known in College Station for overseeing the completion of the University Drive overpass. On the 50-year anniversary of the opening of that structure, the City of College Station declared March 21 of each year going forward to be Joe Hanover  Texas A&M played a large role in Joe's life, and he was known for his great love of the university. He regularly attended Fightin' Texas Aggie sporting events, especially baseball and football games. When recounting the best days of his life, Joe would routinely tell you that the day he married Lucille and the day he was baptized were the two greatest days of his life.  Mr.Speaker, Joe Hanover fought in service of our country and worked tirelessly to better the Bryan-College Station area. He is loved by our community and certainly left an enduring impression on the Brazos He will be forever remembered as a hero, community leader, husband, and friend.  My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the Hanover family. We also lift up the family and friends of Joe Hanover in our prayers.  I requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol to honor the life and legacy of General Joe  As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country during these difficult times, for our military men and women who protect us from external threats, and for our first responders who protect us here at home.

1483,topic-id,184,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment to H.2842, Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act, would make two changes to the bill. The first part of the amendment would encourage the demonstration projects created under this bill to direct beneficiaries toward jobs in an in-demand industry sector or occupation, as identified by workforce boards in their States and local communities.  Today, in this country, there are approximately 6 million jobs that remain unfilled because they require technical skills and knowledge related specifically to an industry or occupation. If we want to help participants move from government assistance and hold a job, then we must set them on a path toward jobs and industries that are currently, and will remain, competitive in the evolving 21st century economy.  The second part of my amendment would include in the reports from States that establish these demonstration projects information about their efforts to ensure nondisplacement of workers and to address grievance claims.

1307,topic-id,1828,"Madam President, it is my honor to come to the Senate floor today to talk in support of a fellow Coloradan's nomination to be the Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior--David I am very excited about his nomination, strongly support his nomination, and believe that my fellow Coloradan will do an absolutely incredible job for Colorado and for the rest of this country at the Department of the  I had the great honor just a month or more ago of welcoming David to the committee and welcoming his beautiful family there with him that day. I reminded his oldest son Will about the connection that my family and our oldest child will always have with Will, because when my wife Jaime was working at the Department of the Interior, our oldest daughter Alyson spent some time at daycare with David Bernhardt's son Will, as well. It was the same daycare and the same work Jaime and David did at the Department of the Interior, working together[[Page S4097]]all those years. But there is more than that. There are more connections I will share, between David Bernhardt and me, and one of the many reasons why I support him.  I have known him personally and professionally for nearly two decades. We both grew up in rural I am from the Eastern Plains of Colorado, and Mr.Bernhardt is from the Western I am from the flatlands, and he is from the mountains. We share a lot of common interests in rural development and saving small towns.  We both began our public service 1 year apart, interning in the Colorado State Legislature for a member of the Colorado State Legislature named Russell George, who would go on, eventually, to become the Colorado speaker of the house.  I will never forget when I began. It was in the second term of then-State Representative Russell I worked for him on Tuesdays and Thursdays in an internship through Colorado State He said: You should reach out and meet last year's intern because I think he could help you figure out the ropes around here and what you should know about the internship. He gave me the phone number for David So I followed in the footsteps of David Bernhardt at the capitol, and I am excited to see the work that he continues to do.  As I mentioned, Mr.Bernhardt worked with my wife Jaime at the Department of the Interior, and, at one point, their offices were just around the corner from one another. His personal background and public and private sector professional experiences prove that he is a strong voice for the West and extremely well-qualified for the nomination to be Deputy He has extensive insight on western water policy, natural resource policy, and Indian affairs, just to name a few. Those who have worked with Mr.Bernhardt commend him for his integrity and wealth of knowledge on the issues under the jurisdiction of the Department of the  In 2008, after the Department reached the largest Indian water rights settlement in the Nation's history, Secretary Kempthorne personally acknowledged Mr.Bernhardt's work as then-Solicitor and stated: ``His effective coordination--both within Interior as well as with the local, tribal, state and congressional leaders--was essential to the success we celebrate today.''  The country will indeed benefit from having Mr.Bernhardt serve as Deputy Secretary, a position that is the second ranking official within the Department and has statutory responsibilities as the chief operating officer.  Along with Mr.Bernhardt's professional career, I believe it is important to fully understand his background and the foundation of his interest in public lands, which further qualifies him for this very important role.  Mr.Bernhardt is originally from the outskirts of the small town of Rifle, CO, located on Colorado's Western If you have driven through the Eisenhower Tunnel, the Veterans Memorial Tunnels, or if you go to Grand Junction, CO, you will have been right by and through Rifle,  Few places more fully embody the spirit and mission of the agency he has been nominated to lead as Deputy Growing up in rural Colorado instilled in David strong western values and interests, and, to this day, Mr.Bernhardt enjoys hunting, recreation, the outdoors, and fishing.  Rifle is located in Garfield County, an area where about 60 percent of the lands are Federal public lands. Think about the work he is about to take on upon confirmation: 60 percent of his home county is public lands.  Rifle was founded as a ranching community along the Colorado River, and it retains that heritage today, along with tremendous opportunities for world-class outdoor recreation, including fishing, hiking, skiing, rafting, and rock climbing. It also sits at the very edge of the Piceance Basin, an area in Colorado which has vast amounts of natural gas.  David grew up in the oil shale boom and bust and has said that the boom-and-bust cycle in Western Colorado has made him more sensitive to the potential benefits and the potential impacts--both environmental and social--of resources development.  In the 1980s, his hometown of Rifle was hit hard by the State's oil shale crash, and he personally experienced some of the hard times the Nation's rural communities often face. Much like the Department of the Interior itself, Rifle is a community that is a product of its public lands and the western heritage around it. It is centrally located, just a few miles away from the iconic Grand Mesa, the world's largest flat top mountain. The flat top's wilderness and the Roan Plateau represent a home base among these public lands, with virtually unmatched access to world-class outdoor experiences, which is why Mr.Bernhardt has such a passion for these issues.  His background and outlook on public lands and water issues assisted him in his prior service at the Department of the Interior, including in the Solicitor's role. Mr.Bernhardt's confirmation as Solicitor was confirmed by voice vote by the U.Senate in 2006. By voice vote, he was approved the last time he served at the Department of the  There have been other nominees--I think this has been a subject of debate on his nomination--considered by the Energy Committee and by this body who practiced private law from the time between their public service appointments at the Department of the Interior and the time they would come back to the administration. Mr.Bernhardt has taken the same steps these nominees did in order for his nomination to move forward today.  I think it is important to point out the Hayes-Schneider standard that was established for the Department of the  David Hayes, nominated for Deputy Secretary in the Obama administration, was confirmed by the He had previously served in the Clinton administration, and then he served in the Obama administration. In between that time, he had a private law practice.  Janice Schneider, nominated for Assistant Secretary under President Obama, served in the Clinton administration but in between served in a private law practice. What we see is another nominee who is a dedicated public servant, has gained experience in the private sector, and is willing to come back to public service to give back to our great country.  Mr.Bernhardt's integrity and ability are two of his strongest qualities for his nomination. Public service requires certain sacrifices. I certainly appreciate Mr.Bernhardt's and his family's acceptance of the nomination that will be considered by this body today.  I hope the Senate process has not become a broken process, which disincentivizes qualified people--like Mr.Bernhardt, who is held in high professional regard--from serving and from returning to public service. That is why I hope his nomination today receives strong bipartisan support.  As the Senate takes up the vote on this nomination, I urge my colleagues to hold this nominee to the same practice, the same process to which we hold all nominees who are under consideration before the U. There are a number of individuals and organizations that support David The Southern Ute Indian Tribe in Colorado has written a letter of support for his nomination; the Colorado Water Congress, a very important organization made up of environmentalists and water users and municipalities, supports David Bernhardt's nomination; the Colorado River District supports David Bernhardt's nomination.  Why are these important? Because these are people who have worked with him throughout his career, from the time he was an intern for Russell George in the State legislature to the time that he worked with Scott McInnis, to the time he worked at a law firm, to the time he worked at the Department of the Interior, all the way up until today.  The National Congress of American Indians supports David Bernhardt as Deputy Secretary of the Interior; Ducks Unlimited applauds the nomination of David Bernhardt as Deputy Secretary of the Interior; the Boone and Crockett Club supports David Bernhardt's nomination to be Deputy Secretary of the The list goes on and on.

These are Republicans, Democrats, and Independents across the country who believe David Bernhardt would do an incredible job at the Department of the  Here is a letter of support for David Bernhardt from the chief of the Penobscot The National Cattlemen's Beef Association supports the nomination of David The list goes on and on.

1396,topic-id,511,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, over the years, we as a society have made great strides in combating crimes against children. As with many crimes, however, law enforcement often struggles to keep pace with modern technology. That is why H.883, the Targeting Child Predators Act, is both an important and a timely piece of legislation.  While many of the bills we have discussed today have been aimed at prevention and punishment, H.883 provides law enforcement with the tools necessary to stop ongoing abuse, occurring in real time, and to locate offenders.  Because of the severity of sex crimes committed against children and the often irreparable harm they cause, we must take steps to ensure that law enforcement has the ability to swiftly locate sexual predators.  In 1998, Congress recognized this urgency by passing the Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act, which permitted the FBI to use administrative subpoenas in cases of child exploitation. That legislation was intended to enhance the FBI's ability to[[Page H4407]]investigate online child exploitation offenses in an expeditious manner.  Administrative subpoenas are especially useful in child exploitation cases because they are not burdened with grand jury secrecy obligations, so the information may be shared among law enforcement to quickly locate offenders in emergency situations.  Under current law, the FBI is permitted to use an administrative subpoena to obtain non-content information from internet service providers in child exploitation cases.  H.883 allows the government to prohibit the recipient of a subpoena from disclosing the existence of the subpoena, provided the government certifies there is reason to believe that disclosure may result in endangerment to the life or physical safety of any person, flight to avoid prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence, or intimidation of potential witnesses.  Presently, if agents want to obtain this information with a nondisclosure provision, it must go through the courts, which, of course, defeats the purpose of a speedy mechanism to obtain non-content information.  Importantly, the bill contains a provision that allows a company in receipt of such a subpoena to insist that the government obtain a court order prohibiting the company from disclosing the subpoena to the target. Alternatively, the company may initiate such proceedings itself in a relevant court to challenge the nondisclosure requirement.  Mr.Speaker, a nondisclosure provision is vitally important in child exploitation cases. If a bad guy who has taken a child knows that law enforcement is on to him, or is looking for him, what might he do to get away? What might he do to that child?  H.883 is an important bill which promotes Congress' original intent to ensure law enforcement has quick access to this information. It is narrowly tailored to ensure that its provisions apply in cases where time is of the essence. It provides a mechanism for companies to challenge the nondisclosure requirements.                              {time}  1730  I commend Mr.DeSantis, the gentleman from Florida and a member of the Judiciary Committee, for introducing this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-05-22-pt1-PgH4406.txt,446,PROBATION OFFICER PROTECTION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,22.0,June
1398,topic-id,332,"Mr.Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.DeSantis), who is the chief sponsor of this legislation.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, every year, thousands of children are victims of cyber exploitation. As a former prosecutor who has handled child exploitation cases, I know just how important it is to preserve evidence that can bring predators to justice.  After speaking with Florida law enforcement officials about the challenges they face when tracking suspects online, I introduced the Targeting Child Predators This is a sensible reform that will better protect our children by preventing suspected child predators from destroying evidence and covering their tracks.  When tracking a suspected child predator online, law enforcement far too often hits roadblocks that can critically threaten their investigation. Internet service providers who have been issued a duly issued, lawful subpoena from law enforcement will often inform the suspect that police investigators have requested their information. Once notified that they are the target of an investigation, child predators can wipe their systems clean and go into hiding, leaving law enforcement empty-handed and potentially putting their victims at further risk.  The Targeting Child Predators Act is a simple and necessary amendment to our criminal code requiring that ISPs wait 180 days before disclosing to suspected child predators that their information has been requested by law enforcement. The bill is narrowly targeted to child exploitation cases where the destruction of valuable evidence could endanger the safety of a child or seriously jeopardize an ongoing investigation. Additionally, the Targeting Child Predators Act provides judicial review of subpoenas and affords both ISPs and suspects due process as required by law.  The Targeting Child Predators Act will protect our children from those who wish to exploit them while maintaining the constitutional rights of suspected criminals. This is an issue that should garner wide bipartisan support from the  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to step up. Let's support our vulnerable children.

1476,topic-id,653,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding to me and for his work on this bill, as well as Chairman Bishop's work on this legislation and those on the other side of the aisle.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of H.954. This bill simply removes 20-year-old deed use restrictions on 1 acre of land in Rockingham County,  For over 25 years, a little over 3 acres of land and its associated buildings previously held by the Federal Government have been maintained by Rockingham County in the Plains Area Daycare Center in the Sixth District of  In 1989, the Federal Government deeded these 3 acres of land, with restriction, to Rockingham However, even prior to this official declaration, Rockingham County had already been faithfully maintaining the property no longer utilized by the Federal  The government transferred this land to Rockingham County in 1989 under the condition that this property was to be used for public purposes. The county then decided that the nonprofit Plains Area Daycare Center in Broadway, Virginia, which provides childcare on a sliding scale to many families who otherwise could not afford such a service, would benefit from the use of the old garage located on the property.  Therefore, in 1990, Congress enacted Public Law 101-479, which allowed the deed to be changed from public use to the particular use of the childcare center. Donations by the community, totaling $75,000, turned the building into a nursery, daycare, and afterschool care facility.  Additionally, the establishment of the daycare center provided for the creation of a playground that the center supports and opens for public use. To[[Page H5404]]be clear, the center and the playground are the sole reason this previously abandoned government land is being used by the community.  I have visited the Plains Area Daycare Center on many occasions, and I have seen the immeasurable investment this center is making in the community by providing high-quality childcare. Since opening in 1991, the center has always been at capacity and is the only facility of its kind in the community.  However, after 2 decades of consistent use, the facility is in desperate need of repairs. Unfortunately, because of the narrow way Public Law 101-479 was drafted and because of the terms of the deed, the daycare center has been unable to obtain a loan to complete much-needed renovations. To solve this problem, my legislation would remove the deed's use restrictions from the 1 acre of property on which the building resides.  While I would like to have seen the entire 3 acres released, this legislation is the result of a compromise that has been endorsed by the National Park Service and Rockingham By passing this legislation and allowing Rockingham County and, in turn, the Plains Area Daycare Center more authority over the land, we will ensure that more children and more of the community will be served.  Mr.Speaker, while my legislation today is simply a formality, it is of great importance to those being served by this daycare center in the community. For 25 years, the land has been deeded to Rockingham County, but with overbearing restrictions. Since it is clear the Federal Government no longer has a vested interest in the land, it is time to lift those restrictions to allow the Plains Area Daycare Center to reach it full potential.  Twenty years ago, Congress made its intention clear that a daycare facility was to have use of the property, and I am pleased to lead the charge in fixing the law.  Again, I thank Chairman Bishop and his committee for bringing this bill before the I also thank my legislative assistant, Angela Inglett, for her hard work on this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I urge passage of H.954 to simply remove the deed restrictions on 1 acre of land so that the necessary upgrades may be made to the childcare center and so that this community investment may continue.

1310,topic-id,1561,"Thank you, Mr. President Ronald Reagan used to say that people are policy. Attacking a new President's policies, therefore, often includes undermining his or her ability to appoint men and women to lead his or her administration.  The Constitution gives to the President the power to appoint executive branch officials. The Senate has the power of advice and consent as a check on that appointment power.  In the early months of the Obama administration, Senate Democrats were clear about how we should carry out our role in the appointment process. Less than 2 weeks after President Obama took office, the Judiciary Committee chairman said he wished that the Senate could have put the new Justice Department leadership in place even more quickly. Just 3 months into President Obama's first term, the chairman argued that, ``at the beginning of a presidential term, it makes sense to have the President's nominees in place earlier, rather than engage in needless delay.''  Well, actions speak much louder than words. With a Republican in the White House, Senate Democrats have turned our role of advice and consent into the most aggressive obstruction campaign in history.  This chart is an illustration.  Democrats complained about obstruction when, during the first 6 months of the Obama administration, the Senate confirmed 69 percent of his nominations. Today marks 6 months since President Trump took the oath of office, and the Senate has been able to confirm only 23 percent of his nominations.  I ask my Democratic colleagues: If 69 percent is too low, what do you call a confirmation pace that is two-thirds lower?  Democrats do not have the votes to defeat nominees outright. That is why the centerpiece of their obstruction campaign is a strategy to make confirming President Trump's nominees as difficult and time-consuming as possible.  Here is how they do it. The Senate is designed for deliberation as well as for action. As a result, the Senate must end debate on a nomination before it can confirm that nomination. Doing so informally is fast. Doing it formally is slow.  In the past, the majority and minority informally agreed on the necessity or length of any debate on a nomination, as well as when a confirmation vote would occur. The first step in the Democrats' obstruction campaign, therefore, is to refuse any cooperation on scheduling debates and votes on nominations. The only option is to use the formal process of ending debate by invoking cloture under Senate rule A motion to end debate is filed, but the vote on that motion cannot occur for 2 calendar days. If cloture is invoked, there can then be up to 30 hours of debate before a confirmation vote can occur.  The Democrats' obstruction playbook calls for stretching this process out as long as possible. While informal cooperation can take a couple of hours, the formal cloture process can take up to several days.  The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said that you are entitled to your opinion, but not to your own set of facts. I would state, then, to let the confirmation facts do the talking.  President Trump and his three predecessors were each elected with the Senate controlled by his own political party. This is another illustration right here. At this point in the Clinton and George Bush administrations, the Senate had taken no cloture votes--nothing, none whatsoever--as you can see, on nominations. We took just four nomination cloture votes at this point during the Obama administration. So far in the Trump administration, the Senate has taken 33 cloture votes on nominations. Think about that. If that isn't obstruction, I don't know what is. It is not even close.  There is one very important difference between cloture votes taken in the beginning of the Clinton, Bush, or Obama administrations and those taken this year. In November 2013, Democrats effectively abolished nomination filibusters by lowering the vote[[Page S4099]]necessary to end debate from a supermajority of 60 to a simple majority. It now takes no more votes to end debate than it does to confirm a nomination. In other words, the Senate did not take cloture votes during previous administrations, even though doing so could have prevented confirmation.  Today, Democrats are forcing the Senate to take dozens of cloture votes even though doing so cannot prevent confirmation. At least half of these useless cloture votes taken so far would have passed even under the higher 60-vote threshold.  Earlier this week, 88 Senators, including 41 Democrats, voted to end debate on President Trump's nominee to be Deputy Secretary of We have seen tallies of 67, 81, 89, and even 92 votes for ending debate. Meanwhile, these needless delays are creating critical gaps in the executive branch.  A clear example is the nomination of Makan Delrahim, a former Senate staffer whom everybody on both sides knows, is a wonderful guy, and who everybody knows is honest. But this clear example is the nomination of Delrahim to head the Antitrust Division at the Department of Antitrust enforcement is a critical element of national economic policy. It protects consumers and businesses alike, and, without filling these important posts, uncertainty in the market reigns. This is a particular problem at a time of common and massive mergers and acquisitions. Yet Mr.Delrahim, like dozens of others, has been caught in the maelstrom of delays. Mr.Delrahim was appointed out of the Judiciary Committee on a 19-to-1 vote. Everybody there knows how good he is, how decent he is, how honorable he is, and how bipartisan he has been. He is supremely qualified and enjoyed broad support throughout the Senate as a whole. Yet his nomination, like so many others, languishes on the floor because of Democratic obstruction. Indeed, it has taken longer to get Mr.Delrahim confirmed than any Antitrust Division leader since the Carter administration. Keep in mind that this is a former staffer of ours who served both Democrats and  Regarding the delay of Mr.Delrahim's confirmation, I ask unanimous consent to have two news articles printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From www.wsj.com, July 12, 2017]              Senate Fight Over Trump's Nominees Heats Up                 (By Brent Kendall and Natalie Andrews)       Washington--A congressional battle over President Donald      Trump's nominations for a range of influential positions is      escalating and becoming more acrimonious, creating additional      uncertainty over when some notable government vacancies might      be filled.       Mr.Trump has been slower than recent presidents to roll      out nominees. But for an array of people the president has      selected, Senate Democrats are using procedural tactics to      slow the confirmation process to a crawl--at least in part to      object to the lack of open hearings on health-care      legislation, Democratic leaders say.       More than 30 nominees are sitting on the sidelines while      they await a final Senate confirmation vote. Those include      several picks for the Justice and Treasury departments, as      well as new commissioners for a federal energy regulator that      has been unable to conduct official business because of its      vacancies.       If the currept pattern holds, many of these people may not      be confirmed for their jobs before the Senate takes a break      in mid-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D.,      N.Y.) in most circumstances has been invoking Senate      procedures to require up to 30 hours of debate per nominee,      an amount of Senate floor time that means lawmakers can't      confirm more than a handful of nominees each week.       The minority party often waives a requirement for lengthy      debate, but Democrats are generally declining to do so. In      response to GOP complaints, they cite what they call      Republican obstructionism under President Barack Obama,      including Republicans' refusal to hold a hearing or vote on      Mr.Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick       In the current environment, even noncontroversial nominees      can take up several days of Senate time. For example, the      Senate spent much of the first part of the week considering      the nomination of David Nye to be a federal judge in      Mr.Nye was originally nominated by Mr.Obama and Mr.Trump      renominated him after taking office.       Senators took a procedural vote Monday on Mr.Nye, but he      wasn't confirmed until Wednesday afternoon, on a 100-0 vote.       Raw feelings on both sides of the aisle erupted this week.      Republicans accused Democrats of unprecedented obstruction,      saying it would take the Senate more than 11 years at the      current pace before Mr.Trump could fully staff a government.       White House legislative affairs director Marc Short, in a      press briefing Monday, accused Mr.Schumer of being an      irresponsible champion of the ``resist'' movement. Senate      Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) cited the issue as      a top reason for his decision to push back the Senate's      planned August recess by two weeks.       On the Senate floor Wednesday, Mr.McConnell said Democrats      were ``bound and determined to impede the president from      making appointments, and they're willing to go to      increasingly absurd lengths to further that goal.''       Democrats dismiss such characterizations given what they      see as unprecedented Republican tactics toward Mr.Obama's      nominees, especially Judge In February 2016,      Republican Senate leaders said they wouldn't consider a      Supreme Court nominee until after the election.       Democrats also note that Mr.Trump has yet to name people      for hundreds of vacancies and say there have been paperwork      problems with a number of people he has chosen.       ``Our Republican friends, when they're worried about the      slow pace of nominations, ought to look in the mirror,'' ",CREC-2017-07-20-pt1-PgS4094.txt,1351,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,20.0,June
1311,topic-id,2472,"Mr.President, Mr.Delrahim's appointment is just one example among many. This particular example serves an important case in point. Democrats are deliberately slow walking dozens of confirmations in a cynical effort to stall the President's agenda and hurt the President, but they are hurting the country, and they are hurting the They are hurting both sides.  I don't want to see Republicans respond in kind when Democrats become the majority and when they have a  It won't surprise anyone to hear that they are not limiting their obstruction campaign to executive branch nominees. In fact, looking at the judicial branch shows that this is part of a long-term obstruction strategy. In February 2001, just days after the previous Republican President took office, the Senate Democratic leader said they would use ``any means necessary'' to obstruct the President's nominees. A few months later Democrats huddled in Florida to plot how, as the New York Times described it, to ``change the ground rules'' of the confirmation process. And change the ground rules is exactly what they did.  For two centuries, the confirmation ground rules called for reserving time-consuming rollcall votes for controversial nominees so that Senators could record their opposition. Nominations with little or no opposition were confirmed more efficiently by voice vote or unanimous consent.  Democrats have literally turned the confirmation process inside out. Before 2001, the Senate used a rollcall vote to confirm just 4 percent--4 percent--of judicial nominees and only 20 percent of those rollcall votes were unopposed nominees.  During the Bush Administration, after Democrats changed the ground rules, the Senate confirmed more than 60 percent of judicial nominees by rollcall vote, and more than 85 percent of those rollcall votes were on unopposed nominees.  Today, with a Republican President again in office, Democrats are still trying to change the confirmation ground rules. The confirmation last week of David Nye to be a U.district judge was a prime example. The vote to end debate on the Nye nomination was 97 to 0. In other words, every Senator, including every Democrat, voted to end the debate. Most people with common sense would be asking why the cloture vote was held at all and why the delay.  But Democrats did not stop there. Even after a unanimous cloture vote, they insisted on the full 30 hours of postcloture debate time provided for under Senate rules. To top it off, the vote to confirm the nomination was 100 to 0.  I don't want anyone to miss this. Democrats demanded a vote on ending a debate none of them wanted, and then they refused to end the debate they had just voted to terminate--all of this on a nomination that every Democrat supported. That is changing the confirmation ground rules.  Only four of the previous 275 cloture votes on nominations had been unanimous. In every previous case, whatever the reason was for the cloture vote in the first place, the Senate proceeded promptly to a confirmation vote.  In 2010, for example, the Senate confirmed President Obama's nomination of Barbara Keenan to the Fourth Circuit 2 hours after unanimously voting to end debate.  In 2006 the Senate confirmed the nomination of Kent Jordan to the Third Circuit less than 3 hours after unanimously ending debate.  In 2002 the Senate confirmed by voice vote the nomination of Richard Carmona to be Surgeon General less than 1 hour after unanimously ending debate.  The Nye nomination was the first time the Senate unanimously invoked cloture on a U.district court nominee. This was the first time there was a unanimous vote to end debate on any nomination on which the minority refused to allow a prompt confirmation vote.  Here is another chart that shows the percent confirmed by rollcall vote during the Clinton administration, the George Bush administration, and the Obama administration. Here we have the Trump administration, and, as you can see, they are not confirming his nominees even if they are qualified and the Democrats admit it. No matter how my friends across the aisle try to change the subject, these facts are facts.  While the Senate used time-consuming rollcall votes to confirm less[[Page S4101]]than 10 percent of the previous three Presidents' executive branch nominees, under President Trump, it is nearly 90 percent.  I admit the Democrats are bitter about the Trump win. I understand that. Everybody on their side expected Hillary Clinton to win. Many on our side expected her to win as well. But she didn't. President Trump is now President, and he did win, and he is doing a good job of delivering people up here to the Senate for confirmation.  This is not how the confirmation process is supposed to work.  The Constitution makes Senate confirmation a condition for Presidential appointments. This campaign of obstruction is exactly what the Senate Democrats once condemned. Further poisoning and politicizing the confirmation process only damages the Senate, distorts the separation of powers, and undermines the ability of the President to do what he was elected to do.  I hope our colleagues on the other side will wise up and realize that what they are doing is destructive to the Senate, harmful to the Senate, and it is a prelude to what can happen when they get the I don't want to see that happen on the Republican side.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, to change the subject, I would like to speak about the effort to reform our Nation's Tax Last week, I came to the floor to give what I promised would be the first in an ongoing series of statements about tax reform. Today, I would like to give the second speech on that subject in this series.  As I have said before, while there are tax reform discussions ongoing between congressional leaders and the administration, I expect there to be a robust and substantive tax reform process here in the Senate, one that will give interested Members--hopefully from both parties--an opportunity to contribute to the final product. I anticipate that, at the very least, the members of the Finance Committee will want to engage fully in this effort.  I have been working to make the case for tax reform for the last 6 years, ever since I became the lead Republican on the Senate Finance This current round of floor statements is a continuation of that effort.  Last week, I spoke on the need to reduce the U.corporate tax rate in order to grow our economy, create jobs, and make American businesses more competitive. Today's topic is closely related to that one. Today, I want to talk about the need to reform our international tax system.  Over the last couple of decades, we have enjoyed a rapid advancement in technology and communication, which has been a great benefit to everyone and has improved the quality of life for people all over the world. Unfortunately, our tax system has failed to evolve along with everything else.  For example, in the modern world, business assets have become increasingly more mobile. Assets like capital, intellectual property, and even labor can now be moved from one country to another with relative ease and simplicity. Assets that are relatively immobile--those that cannot be easily moved--are becoming increasingly rare. The Tax Code needs to change to reflect that fact.  Our current corporate tax system imposes a heavy burden on businesses' assets, which creates an overwhelming incentive for companies to move their more mobile assets offshore, where income derived from the use of the assets is taxed at lower rates.  As I noted last week, there is no shortage of lower tax alternatives in the world for companies incorporated in the United It does not take a rocket scientist to understand this concept. All other things being equal, if there are two countries that tax businesses at substantially different rates, companies in the country with higher tax rates will have a major incentive to move taxable assets to the country with lower rates. That dynamic only moves in one direction, as there are not many companies that are looking to move to higher tax countries, like the United States, from lower tax jurisdictions. This is not just a theory; this has been happening for years.  An inversion, if you will recall, is a transaction in which two companies merge, and the resulting combined entity is incorporated offshore. Let me repeat some numbers that I cited last week. In the 20 years between 1983 and 2003, there were just 29 corporate inversions out of the United In the 11 years between 2003 and 2014, there were 47 inversions--nearly double the number in half the amount of time. That number includes companies that are household names in the United This is happening in large part because of the perverse incentives embedded in our corporate tax system and the stupidity of us in the Congress to not solve this problem.  Keep in mind that I am only talking about inversions. There are also foreign takeovers of U.companies, not to mention arrangements that include earnings stripping and profit shifting. The collective result has been a massive erosion of the U.tax base and, perhaps more importantly, decreased economic activity here at home.  Make no mistake--our foreign competitors are fully aware of these incentives. They have recognized that lowering corporate tax rates can help them lure economic activity into their locations. Yet, in the face of this competition, the U.tax system has remained virtually frozen.  As I noted last week, reducing the corporate tax rate would help alleviate these problems, but more will be required, including reforms to our international tax system.  Currently, the United States uses what is generally referred to as a worldwide tax system for international tax, which means that U.multinationals pay the U.corporate tax on domestic earnings as well as on earnings acquired abroad. Taxes on those offshore earnings are generally deferred so long as the earnings are kept offshore and are only taxed upon repatriation to the United States after accounting for foreign tax credits and the like.  Put simply, this type of system is antiquated. The vast majority of our foreign counterparts have already done away with worldwide taxation and have converted to a territorial system. Generally speaking, a territorial system is one in which multinational companies pay tax only on earnings derived from domestic sources.  By clinging to its worldwide tax system and a punitively high corporate tax rate, the United States has severely diminished the ability of its multinational companies to compete in the world marketplace. Because U.S.-based companies are subject to worldwide taxation while their global competitors are subject to territorial taxation systems, U.companies all too often end up having to pay more taxes than their foreign competitors, putting them at a distinct competitive disadvantage.  Generally speaking, foreign-based companies pay taxes only once at the tax rate of the country from which they have derived the specific income. A U.multinational, on the other hand, generally pays taxes on offshore income at the rate set by the source country but then gets hit again--and at a punitively high rate--when it repatriates its earnings back to  This is stupidity in its highest sense. This needs to change. It is not only Republicans who are saying that; many Democrats have recognized this issue as well. For example, I will cite the Finance Committee's bipartisan working group on international tax, which is cochaired by Senators Portman and Schumer, our ranking minority leader, which examined these issues thoroughly and produced a report in 2015. In that report, after noting that most industrialized countries have lower corporate rates and territorial systems, this bipartisan group of Senators said: ``This means that no matter what jurisdiction a U.multinational is competing in, it is at a competitive disadvantage.''  The report by Senators Portman and Schumer and the members of their working group also referred to something called the lock-out effect. Simply put, the lock-out effect refers to the incentives U.companies have to hold foreign earnings and make investments offshore in order to avoid the punitive U.corporate tax. This is not a dodge or a tax hustle on the part of these companies; they are simply doing what the Tax Code tells them to do. The Tax Code essentially tells U.companies: You can have $100 in Ireland, say, or you can have $65 in the United States.[[Page S4102]]Well, no surprise here--companies generally opt to have $100 in  Currently, a huge amount of capital--as much as $2.5 trillion or maybe even more--that is held by U.multinational companies is effectively locked out of the United States and is unavailable for investment here at home. However, as Senators Schumer and Portman and their colleagues on the international tax working group noted, those funds can easily be used to grow the economies of those foreign countries that have kept their tax codes up to date.  These are massive problems, and if we are going to put together an effective tax reform package and be competitive, we will have to find a way to tackle these issues. The most obvious way, of course, would be with a combination of reducing our corporate tax rates, transitioning to a territorial tax system, and ensuring protection of the U.tax base from things like earnings stripping and profit shifting. That approach, as it turns out, has bipartisan support.  These matters represent a significant portion of our tax reform efforts, and we already know it is one on which Republicans and Democrats can agree, at least in concept. In other words, there is ample reason for our Democratic colleagues to join Republicans and for Republicans to join Democrats in the tax reform discussions.  These issues are not just important for faceless corporations or tax planners; they are important for American workers who are up and down the income scale. Anyone who is hoping to have a job and opportunities here in the United States and not somewhere else has an interest in reforming our international tax system. If we pass up this current opportunity to address these issues, people should expect to see more and more economic activity and the headquarters and supporting staff of more household-name companies moved outside the United  With bipartisan recognition of the need for reform and agreement on international concepts already having been displayed, we owe it to the American people to work together and fix this problem.  As I have said multiple times, I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will be willing to work with us on tax reform, but if they decline--and, sadly, we have seen some indication that they will--Republicans will need to be ready to take steps to fix these problems. I think we will be ready. Indeed, I think we are more than up to the challenge. I hope we do something about these important issues.  I yield the floor.

1582,topic-id,681,"Mr.Speaker, I am again on the floor to talk about a waste of life, a waste of money in We have been there 16 years, and nothing has changed. Many of my colleagues agree with me that it is time to debate our country's longest war.  In response, I, along with John Garamendi from California, have introduced H.1666 in hopes of forcing that discussion. I am not asking for Members or leadership to agree with the bill itself or even vote for it, but I am asking that we be able to bring to the floor of the House the bill for the purpose of a debate.  We have not debated our role in Afghanistan since 2001. Members can either vote for or against the bill; just give the House a debate after 16 years.  Afghanistan is a failed policy. I would like to share a few sentences of an email I received this week from a great American, my friend and unofficial adviser, the 31st Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, General Chuck Krulak, regarding his thoughts on Afghanistan:  ``Sixteen years we have been involved in Afghanistan . . . 16 years fighting in a country that has really never seen peace. Sixteen years with fluctuating troop strength--100,000 to 5,000--with no definition to who we are fighting--al-Qaida, Taliban or ISIS . . . you pick 'em--with no strategy, no strong reason for entering the fray, no real measure of effectiveness, no use of the five elements of national power, no support from the people themselves, a weak government, and no exit strategy, and fighting a war that is unwinnable in any real sense of the word.''  Mr.Speaker, it is disappointing when the President, the Commander in Chief, abdicates the responsibility of increasing the number of troops in Afghanistan to the Secretary of Defense, Secretary  There is more reason today than ever before to have a debate on the future of That is the reason why Speaker Ryan should instruct committees in the House to come forward with a new Authorization for Use of Military  Where is the Congress? Don't we have a congressional responsibility to debate war if we are going to send a parent's young man or woman to die for this country?  I think we do have that responsibility.  In closing, I am going to share another quote from General Krulak, the former Commandant of the Marine Corps:  ``I go back to what I have always said . . . back years ago. Afghanistan cannot be viewed through the lens of a true nation-state or as a true country. It is fragmented . . . tribal . . . controlled by war lords, economically a basket case, no real government outside of Kabul, and that is questionable, a poorly organized and led Army who will shoot at Americans as well as the `enemy,' and no sense of what the country wants to be. No one has ever conquered Afghanistan . . . and many have tried. We will join the list of nations that have tried and failed. Afghanistan is the origin of `whack a mole,' whether it is al-Qaida, ISIS, or the You can't beat them in a geographic area . . . they will just pop up someplace else.''

1375,topic-id,1093,"Mr.President, thank you and Senator We just came back, as we all know, from the Memorial Day recess. I wanted today not to only reflect on that but also to reflect on our anniversary of D-day and the day that our Allies invaded France in 1944. In doing so today, I would like to speak and pay tribute to all of those--including, but not limited to, Americans, but especially Americans--who risked their lives to defend our freedoms.  In particular, I come today to recognize a special group of dedicated soldiers. You probably have not heard of them, but they are referred to as the Ghost Army--the Ghost This is a unit that served in World War It was comprised of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133rd Signal Service The personnel of this U.Army unit were handpicked. They were handpicked for their artistic and creative characteristics, and you will see why in just a moment.  They handled top secret information, and they were among some of America's most promising artists, engineers, and signals professionals. The mission of the Ghost Army was very simple: Fool Adolph Hitler--fool Adolph Hitler by using what was called tactical deception. The Ghost Army's deceptive creation of fake battles, inflatable tanks, theatrical props, and other inventive equipment falsified troop movements, and had our enemies chasing ghosts--hence the name the Ghost  Beginning in Normandy 2 weeks after D-day and ending in the Rhine River Valley, the Ghost Army staged over 20 fake battles--fake battlefield deceptions. The German Army did not know whether they were coming or going, thanks to the Ghost These performances, of course, were illusions. They were called illusions by the soldiers. They occurred in the most dangerous spot in the war, on the frontline of battle.  Now, without the Ghost Army's dedication and fearless perseverance, Allied successes at the Battle of the Bulge and the final battles in Po Valley, Italy, would not have been possible. The 23rd unit was composed of only 1,184 men--1,200 men. They put themselves at risk every day at the forefront of danger, and they fought tirelessly. They used ingenious, innovative methods to mislead the enemy, ultimately leading the Allies to many victories in Because of their bravery, because of the bravery of the 1,200 men in the Ghost Army, up to 30,000 American soldiers and 10,000 German soldiers were able to return home alive.  So why are we waiting until today to honor these 1,184 brave Americans? Because until recently the Ghost Army's mission was classified. It was top secret. Nobody except the members of the Ghost Army knew anything about it. This has finally changed. That is one of the reasons I am here today. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Ghost Army soldier bill, a bipartisan effort led by Senators Markey, Collins, and This long overdue legislation will award a Congressional Gold Medal to the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133rd Signal Service  It is a privilege to share that, in my home State of Louisiana, the Ghost Army is being recognized at the New Orleans Museum of Soldier's art is on display depicting many watercolor portraits, as well as graphite portraits, of civilians, soldiers, and refugees during World War It is a legacy that our great State now gets to honor.  Specifically, I want to recognize six brave men from Louisiana, my State, who were members of the Ghost Hilton Howell Railey of New Orleans is a prominent journalist and the author of ``Touch'd with Madness.'' He recruited several of the handpicked 23rd. Mr.Railey trained and deployed the 3133rd Signal Service Company, which served in  There is Jim Stegg of New Orleans, a longtime faculty member at He was an artist; in fact, there is a retrospective of his work at the New Orleans Museum of Art's Ghost Army exhibit.  Also, there is Mr.Murphy Martin, of Martinville, LA; Mr.Thomas Raggio, of Lake Charles, LA; Mr.Roy Ravia, of Calcasieu Parish, in my State; Mr.Alvin Picard, of Vermilion Parish; and last but certainly not least, Mr.Anderson Wilson, of Slidell,  Unfortunately, Mr.Wilson is the only Ghost Army solder still alive in I had the rare privilege and the rare honor of speaking with Mr.Wilson this morning. In December of 1943, President Roosevelt authorized the Ghost Army unit. Only 2 weeks later, in January 1944, Mr.Wilson was on his way to Camp Mack Morris, TN, to join the Ghost Who says the Federal Government can't move quickly when it wants to?  Mr.Wilson trained there until May, when his unit was shipped out of New York to Liverpool, It was the largest convoy that at the time had ever crossed the Atlantic From there, Mr.Wilson and his team traveled more than any other unit. From England they went to They went to They went to They went to Luxembourg, and they went to  Mr.Wilson and his comrades fought fearlessly through the war's end as members of the Ghost In July 1945, Mr.Wilson finally came home. However, while he came home safely, he could not even disclose, he couldn't even talk about--even to his own family--the honorable service unit he was a part of. Now, it is humbling to me to hear a man's sacrifice, to go through what he went through and not even be able to talk about it with his family, but he kept his word out of honor to his country.  The willingness of Mr.Wilson and his fellow soldiers to risk their own lives to defend the freedom we have today--well, it, too, is humbling.  Mr.Wilson returned home in 1945. And I hope he is listening right now. He has been a little under the weather. He was in the hospital when I spoke to him today. It wasn't until the 1990s, when Mr.Wilson was married with two grown children, that he could ever talk about his service to this great country, share his stories, share his experiences, share his fight to keep the freedoms all of us take for granted every day.  Mr.Wilson's story only gives a snapshot of the sacrifices and honorable work these men of the Ghost Army gave to the Allied forces victory. And I, for one--and I know all Americans join me--thank them for their service and for the freedoms they protected.  I am proud of this Ghost Army legislation, and I hope to see it move forward and pass so that these fine Americans can receive the recognition they have long deserved.  God bless the members of the Ghost And if you are listening, Mr.Wilson, God bless you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-06-pt1-PgS3255-4.txt,2172,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,6.0,July

1413,topic-id,774,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Frankel for her leadership on the Women's The Women's Caucus is a bipartisan women's committee. I was honored when I was given the opportunity to serve on this committee because I know for a fact in America, for all of the strides and accomplishments that we have had as women, that we still have so many issues and challenges that we must address.  Whenever there is an issue that disrespects or an issue that is a barrier for a woman, it is incumbent upon us to step up and to speak out because silence or turning our head is condoning the behavior.  Now, we stand here today as women, but there will be men joining us and have joined us because the behavior that we have learned about in the Marines, one of our military branches, is unacceptable.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to address the issue of nonconsensual activities in the U.military. It has been revealed that nonconsensual nude photos of servicemembers were posted to social media, and it was even enhanced by disturbing comments that were unacceptable and really disrespectful.  This offensive behavior strikes at the very heart of the The Marines, who we trust and admire and know that they go out and serve this country in so many ways, and we have such honor and respect for them--but this behavior, Mr.Speaker, undermines the trust and the confidence that the marines have in each other. The Marines stand up and, as a team and as a body and as a military, take a code that they will protect each other, and it compromises the respect that the American people have for our military.  Our servicemembers must have the confidence that their brothers and their sisters in uniform always have each other's back. There is simply no room in the military or in our society for behavior that humiliates and degrades women servicemembers. Women who are in the Marines have earned the respect of their brothers and sisters, and they deserve the trust. Many victims, just like in the civilian workforce, are afraid to report the assault. We want to encourage them to file their complaints.  I had, at one time, served my country as an EEO investigator in the private sector. As an equal employment opportunity investigator and having cases of sexual harassment, I would sit in a private counseling session with a victim as she relived it to tell me what happened and how so often they struggle with: Should I tell someone? I am embarrassed. Maybe I should have done more. Or why did I accept it?  And then some will say: I will just quit. I just don't want to go through the humiliation of telling my story. Because when you file a complaint, for it to be processed, it becomes public.  I want to say to every woman that if you really understand how inappropriate, how much you do not deserve to be treated that way, and you want to make sure that no other woman ever is treated that way, I want you to know that we as Congress will stand with you to support your right to report it, to make sure we hold those accountable who did it.  I want to say to everybody that I stand here today as a Member of Congress and as a Member of the Women's Caucus to say that you have support.  In 2015, the latest year for which military assault data is available, more than 6,000 sexual assault cases were reported. Only 10 percent of men report their sexual assaults in the military. Only 40 percent of women do the same.  Sexual assault is wrong, whether it is for a man or a woman. According to the Human Rights Watch report released in 2015, the rate of retaliation for reporting a sexual assault in the military is 12 times higher than the rate of report resulting in a conviction for the predator. We understand the problem, and we want to be a part of the solution.  Mr.Speaker, I will close with this. We stand here today knowing that we have a problem. But I am confident in my belief and trust in our military, and I am confident that the women and men in this Congress will stand together and we will fix this problem so we can continue to have our military brothers and sisters serve together without being attacked by their own.

Instead of wasting $1.6 billion in taxpayers' dollars on an unnecessary border wall, the DHS should focus its limited resources on more important border security priorities.  This includes upgrading and hiring more personnel for ports of entry, the main path for illegal drugs. This could include better and more technology so that border security agents will have a better idea what is happening along the borders.  The border wall will be dangerous. Violence, poverty, and family ties ensure that migrants will continue attempting the risky journey through the border region's hostile zones.  The border wall will be divisive. We need to do our job, Mr.Speaker, and come together as a Congress for a comprehensive immigration plan; at the least, reform of our immigration policies.

1532,topic-id,325,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman  I rise today coming in saying I would support this bill. Many people know I served 30 years as a Federal employee working in HR, understanding labor relations, safety issues, environmental issues, diversity issues, and knowing clear well that the official time that is allotted to employees to sit down with their representative of the union to talk about if they feel like they are being sexually harassed, if they feel like they are in an environment that is not safe for them, official time is extremely necessary.  What happens in official time? It allows a lot of grievances to be processed and resolved through communication between union and management.  There have been several legislative reform proposals introduced to address the way union representatives are allowed to utilize official time.  Now, I was taken back when my colleague said ``criminal activities.'' Mr.Speaker, criminal activity is something that is in a whole different venue. If you are a Federal employee and you create an illegal activity, you do not need official time to do that. I have never known, in the time that I served in HR, in labor relations, and served in all of the different capacities, have I seen someone doing criminal activity on official time.  It would be a different thing if we were clear that this bill was about reporting the time, which I would not oppose. But when you present this scenario about official time, as it being something that is negative, something that is being used in a criminal capacity, that is totally something I would be opposed to.  Let me tell you some examples of what representatives can use it for: If there is a whistleblower accusation, an employee would go to their union steward and ask for official time.

1605,topic-id,688,"Mr.President, over the past few years, the national headlines have been dominated by stories about the high cost of pharmaceuticals. We have seen jaw-dropping examples, such as the unconscionable price increase overnight by Turing Pharmaceuticals of their drug for patients with HIV, from $13.50 to $750 per pill.  Pharmaceutical companies should be compensated for their important work developing lifesaving treatments. But when companies engage in predatory practices at the expense of consumers, we must act. That is why today I am reintroducing the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples, or CREATES, Act, bipartisan legislation to end inappropriate delay tactics that are used by some brand-name drug manufacturers to block competition from more affordable generic drugs. I am glad to be joined by Senators Grassley, Klobuchar, Lee, and Feinstein, and several other Senators of both parties in introducing this bill today.  The first delay tactic addressed by the CREATES Act involves the withholding of drug samples that generic manufacturers need to gain regulatory approval. Federal law requires generic competitors to prove that their low-cost alternative is as equally safe and effective as the brand-name drug with which they wish to compete. Unfortunately, some brand-name companies are preventing generic manufacturers from obtaining the samples they need to make the necessary comparison. This simple delay tactic uses regulatory safeguards as a weapon to block competition. The FDA has reported receiving more than 100 inquiries from generic product developers who were unable to access samples of a brand-name drug to compare their generic product.  The second delay tactic addressed by the CREATES Act involves the development of shared safety protocols. For some high-risk drugs, Federal law requires a generic drug manufacturer to join the brand-name drug manufacturer in a single, shared safety protocol for distribution of the drug. Despite this requirement, some brand-name companies are refusing to negotiate shared safety protocols with potential generic competitors, again undermining those competitors' ability to gain FDA approval for their generic versions of such drugs.  The revised version of the CREATES Act also allows the FDA more discretion to approve alternative safety protocols, rather than require parties to develop shared safety protocols. Any safety protocol approved by the FDA must meet the rigorous statutory standards already in place.  These exclusionary practices thwart competition and deny consumers the benefit of lower drug prices. I share the concerns of Vermonters and Americans across the country that many prescription drugs are simply too expensive. When brand companies can artificially raise the price of drugs by using predatory practices, patients suffer. Illnesses get worse. Families, government programs, and other payers in the healthcare system ultimately bear those added, unnecessary costs.  This legislation is not a silver bullet to address all of the complex problems driving the high costs of medications. In addition to the delayed entry of generic drugs, I am troubled by the rising cost of treatments for opioid overdoses, which remain expensive for local law enforcement agencies, even though there are generic competitors. In Vermont, many patients are grappling with the extremely high cost of a new drug for hepatitis C that will likely have years of market exclusivity before generic alternatives can be made. Last year we learned the price of EpiPen had increased by almost 500 percent since 2009, now costing roughly $600 for a two-pack. The sharp increase in price combined with the relatively short shelf life of the product--1 year to 18 months--has put this lifesaving drug out of reach for many.  Think for a moment about the impact of price hikes on the family of a patient facing a life-threatening illness. Across the country, hardworking Americans feel like the system is rigged against them by corporations that are looking to make a profit at any price. With examples like Turing and Mylan, it is no wonder they feel that way.  The CREATES Act is one piece of the puzzle, addressing anticompetitive behavior that delays the creation of affordable generic drugs. Drug affordability is a bipartisan issue that affects each and every These reforms will make a difference. I hope other Senators will join us in supporting these bipartisan reforms.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-04-27-pt1-PgS2618.txt,1383,TARGETING CHILD PREDATORS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,27.0,June
1412,topic-id,775,"Mr.Speaker, let me thank Congresswoman Frankel for being such an exemplary chair, and also our vice chair, Brenda You have put together quite a team and really are raising the issues that really don't get raised oftentimes on behalf of our women.  Also, to Congresswoman Jackie Speier, who I believe is in a hearing right now dealing with this very, very important issue, I want to thank her and all of our women in the Democratic Women's Working Group for organizing this very important Special Order to address the nonconsensual sharing of sexual images in the United States military.  I just have to say a couple of things.  First of all, as a member of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee and as a woman, I am appalled by the sharing of these private photos. It is really disgraceful. It is disgraceful that our military continues to uphold a culture of sexual harassment and disrespect toward women servicemembers.  Now, let me be clear. The attitudes towards women exposed by websites like the Facebook group Marines United are troubling and dangerous. Not only do such actions threaten our mission, they strip our brave servicemembers who are women of their dignity. No woman should have her private photos exposed on the internet, especially not by her fellow servicemembers.  I was pleased to see the recent Navy and Marine Corps decisions to make the distribution of intimate photos a criminal offense. That is a good thing. We really must do more.  Now, when questioning members of the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marines at a subcommittee hearing, it became clear to me, based on their responses, that the culture of the military must change.  Members of the Democratic Women's Working Group continue to try to help change this culture and are committed to ensuring that that type of activity is prohibited in all branches of our military. That is why I am pleased to cosponsor Congresswomen Speier's and McSally's bill, H.2052, the PRIVATE Act, which is a bipartisan bill that would make it illegal within the Uniform Code of Military Justice to distribute intimate images of a person if that person had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Now, let me be clear. The Department of Defense must expand its efforts to foster a culture of dignity and respect that the military service demands. And, Congresswoman Frankel, I just have to mention a conversation I overheard.  I was on a plane flying from point A to point B, and there were two marines sitting next to me, and they were talking very loudly to each other.                              {time}  1800  That entire time that we were on the flight, their conversation was about degrading women who were serving with them in the military. It was quite shocking. This was just their conversation in the normal course of conversation on an airplane. I was, quite frankly, shocked and disgusted.  Today's report from the Pentagon shows promising progress, though. Sexual assaults are on the decline, and servicemembers are now more likely to report attacks. But the data also reveals that two-thirds of women who do report assaults face backlash in their unit. It comes as no surprise, then, that many victims choose to suffer in silence. That should not be.  We know that tech firms like Facebook have a role to play in helping address this kind of unacceptable behavior. Facebook's recent announcement to help prevent nonconsensual pornography is a huge advancement in combatting this epidemic--and that is what it is, an epidemic--and addressing these heinous acts.  While the new feature takes down images that are reported, this depends on users being vigilant and submitting reports. Too often people do not report such behavior. We must be clear that we do not condone this type of behavior and ensure that those with the courage to speak up do not face retaliation.  I want to make it clear. Exploiting sexual images of fellow servicemembers online is unacceptable, and it should be a crime. Rest assured, as a woman, as a mother, grandmother, daughter of a veteran, and a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, I will work day and night to address the threats to our country and to our women servicemembers. Women in the military are critical to our national security. They should have a safe workplace free from sexual assault and harassment and intimidation.  Mr.Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Frankel and Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence and also Congresswoman Speier for their leadership and for keeping this issue alive and for making sure the public understands that there are Members of Congress who have said: enough is enough.

1527,topic-id,470,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding, and I join him in opposition to this bill.  While originally my remarks would have been much kinder to the bill, and I may have considered supporting it, I did not consider it favorably in committee. I know we had a voice vote on that. But in light of the unfortunate remarks that imply that there was illegal activity going on by Federal employees, and that is why we need this bill that is before us right now, I do have to agree with the ranking member, the gentleman from Virginia, that this bill is, indeed, a part of the vanguard of legislation to severely restrict and eliminate the use of official time.  Under the bipartisan Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, a Federal employees who serves as a union steward or union representative may be granted official time to perform activities that--and this is the important standard that is in the bill--the gentleman from Georgia indicated that we need this bill because there is no standard.  The standard in the Civil Service Reform Act requires a number of things: It requires both labor and management to agree on the use of official time, and that official time be ``reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest.''  That is the standard today, and every single Federal workplace--management and labor--have to agree that the use of official time is reasonable, that it is necessary, and that it is in the public interest. That is a great standard, and that is what has been going on so far.  While there are those who seek to curb or repeal the statutory right and may claim that it amounts to misuse of government resources, let me offer you another concrete example of why official time is critical to the Federal workplace and serves the interests of the American people and taxpayer.

1610,topic-id,3881,"Mr.President, today I rise to address the important urgency of addressing climate change. Across the country, we are seeing the impacts of the warmer climate, and it is having devastating consequences on our forests, on our farming, on our fishing, and on our urban populations.  Years ago, people talked about what we might see if we continued to burn fossil fuels and continued to put carbon dioxide into the air, but no longer do we have to talk about what we might see, because it is here. The facts are on the ground right now.  We can look at my home State of In Oregon, we have the challenge of forest fire seasons that are longer by several months than they were just decades ago. We have the challenge of warmer winters, resulting in pine beetles doing more damage to our trees. The fact that we have lower snowpacks in the Cascade Mountains means warmer trout streams and less water for irrigation. We have had the worst-ever droughts in the Klamath Basin in the past 15 years. Over on the coast, we have a big impact on oysters. Because we have burned so much in fossil fuels to create so much carbon dioxide that has been absorbed by the oceans and turned into carbonic acid, the oceans have acidified. They are 30 percent more acidic than they were 150 years ago, meaning our oysters are having trouble reaching out and pulling the molecules out of the water to form a shell. In fact, it takes so much energy to do so that they are dying.  That is what is happening. That is just in We can look across the United States and see impact after impact.  If we were in Minnesota, we could talk about the tick populations that are killing the moose because it is not cold enough in the winter to kill the ticks. If we are in Maine, we can talk about the fact that the lobsters are migrating to Canada because that is where the colder waters can be found. If we are in Florida, we can talk about sunny day floods, because the ocean levels have risen and the ocean water--the saltwater--is contaminating the freshwater that cities depend on. If we are up the Atlantic coast, we can talk about Hurricane Sandy and how its devastating power was enhanced by an ocean that is much warmer than it was decades ago. If we are in Texas, we can talk about the spread of mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus affecting folks. So the list goes on and on. But it is not just in the United States of It is on the entire planet.  As we are talking about oysters on the west coast of the United States, across the globe folks are talking about coral reefs. The Great Barrier Reef has virtually died over the last few years. Scientists say 80 percent of the Great Barrier Reef off Australia has died in the last 3 years. If we are looking at the mountainous regions of the world, you can trace the flow of glaciers and find that across the globe glaciers have diminished by an enormous amount. Some say that if you[[Page S2625]]want to see a glacier in Glacier National Park, you better get there soon. That is just in the United  If we turn north to the upper reaches of Canada and the permafrost, you can visit what are called the drunken forests, because the permafrost is melting and the trees are starting to lean in every which direction. If you turn to Alaska, you are finding that Native populations are having to relocate because of changing circumstances of a warmer  Go to the Arctic Ocean and what you see is a massive amount of missing ice, and, because that ice is missing, the ocean is absorbing more energy from the sun, and it is creating a feedback loop that is having further devastating consequences. And so the list goes on and on.  It is not just time to address climate change boldly. It is time to address it aggressively. It is time for 100 by 50. What that means is 100 percent clean and renewable energy to power the economy by the year 2050 and the steps to get there in between and to have 50 percent of our energy clean and renewable by the year 2030. That is not far away. That is just 13 years away, and for 2050, add another 20 years.  We have to act quickly because right now human civilization is failing the test. Our responsibility is to stop burning fossil fuels and to stop putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That is why we have to rapidly transition from an energy economy based on fossil fuels to one based on clean and renewable energy.  Why do I say we are failing the test at the moment? We are failing the test because if you look at the flow of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from human civilization, the rate of carbon dioxide pollution has not leveled out. In fact, the speed of pollution and the amount of pollution per year is increasing. So we have a tremendous challenge ahead of us. We have to take and not only reduce the amount but reduce it enormously in a short period of time.  Now some say this vision is too bold. Some say this vision is too difficult, that it is too hard. It makes me think of President Kennedy's call. He said decades ago:       We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do other      things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.      Because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept,      one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to      win.  I tell you today that we must, as a Nation, be willing to accept the challenge of transforming our energy economy. We must be unwilling to postpone tackling this challenge of transforming our energy economy, and this challenge is one where we must be committed to winning. It is not just time. It is way past time.  I came to the Senate floor last September to lay out the concept of 100 by 50--100 percent clean, renewable energy by 2050. I come today to the Senate floor to say that today a group of Senators are introducing a bill to lay out a roadmap to get there.  Just as President Kennedy laid out the vision of putting an American on the moon, NASA went to work and laid out a plan on how we would get there. They didn't know at first how it would be done. They hadn't proceeded to invent the staged rocket that would enable someone to escape the gravity of Earth in a fashion to get us to the moon. They didn't know how to create a lunar landing operation to put people safely on the planet surface. They weren't even sure of the composition of the surface of the moon, but they figured it out. They put forward a draft. They reworked that draft.  Today we are putting forth a roadmap. I thank my colleagues who are standing with me today to be the original cosponsors: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, and Senator Cory Booker of New I know other colleagues will join us as time progresses, but it is important not to wait until we have, if you will, a large population to begin the conversation--a large set of sponsors to begin the conversation of laying out a roadmap. It is important to lay it out now. It is important to lay it out now because it is a statement of values. It is important to lay it out now so that there is a vision that can be discussed--a detailed vision of how to take on different sectors of the energy economy that can be discussed and debated.  So we are focused not on whether to get to 100 by 50, but on how we are going to get to 100 by 50. I invite and encourage that debate because each of us can envision a roadmap that is slightly different. So let's have that conversation, but let's not forget the importance of getting to this destination--100 percent clean, renewable energy--and getting thereby the year 2050.  Yes, it is audacious when you think about how we use energy today, to think about how we can transform it in just a few decades, but we have many of the tools we need right now. With focused research and development, we can add the other tools that we need.  Let us not fail to accept this challenge, because our planet is crying out in anguish. In addition to the facts on the ground that I have been mentioning, we can simply take the temperature of the planet. Month after month after month, year after year, in the past 2 years we have been setting new records for having the hottest month--not the hottest month in Washington, DC, not the hottest month in the United States of America but the hottest March in the history of the planet, the hottest April since we have been measuring the temperature of the planet--May, June, and so on and so forth.  So the time for conversing about whether we have a problem is over. Now is the time to say how we will achieve this vision.  One important element of achieving this vision is greening the grid. That means that we need to phase out electricity that is generated by fossil fuels. We need to invest in clean and renewable energy that puts green electrons in the grid instead, and we need to advance and develop the deployment of technologies that contribute to this, including high-voltage transmission lines that will move energy between different parts of the United We certainly need to develop the ability to store electricity and to use automated demand management and automated supply management so we can match the supply of green energy to the demand at different times of the day or just the demand of different times of the day to make renewable energy fit to the operation of the economy.  Now, we have some specific powerful gifts in this effort. One is that we have a dramatically declining cost of solar energy. A second is that we have a dramatically declining cost in wind energy. A third is that we have a dramatically declining cost of battery storage. This isn't an accident. This has happened because of the innovation economy where these ideas were developed and promoted and researched and advanced right here in the United States of But it really helps change the conversation. There have been many who are deeply invested in the fossil fuel world who would like to say that advancing to a clean and renewable energy economy will hurt the economy. But now we are coming to the point that it is less expensive to generate renewable energy than to generate fossil fuel energy. The fact is that we can create a tremendous number of jobs as we rebuild this energy economy.  If we turn specifically to the issue of a Federal emissions vehicle standard--because that is one of the pieces of this puzzle--it means that we have to make national investments in electrical recharging stations along our roads and highways to support these vehicles. There are already half a million plug-in electric vehicles on our roads today, and these vehicles--these cars--are becoming cheaper as the numbers continue to grow.  One of the factors that is enabling the car to become cheaper is the dropping cost of lithium in the batteries that power them. They are getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper. So in the same space you can put more energy with less weight to drive cars further. Since 2008, the cost of these batteries per kilowatt hour has fallen fourfold. They will continuously grow. Having more of these cars on our roads and our highways as the costs keep falling, it is vital that we have an infrastructure in place to support them.  We need to ensure that everyone is part of this clean and renewable energy resolution, including low-income and disadvantaged communities. We addressed that in the 100 by 50 legislation. To do this, we established grants[[Page S2626]]to bring affordable clean energy and energy efficiency to individuals' homes and communities. We invest in zero emission public transportation that is affordable and accessible. We also want to ensure that no workers are left behind in this transformation, especially the workers in the fossil fuel industry. That is why we need to provide a just transition for those workers and job training programs. We need to have a strategy to ensure that there are opportunities to move from jobs in the fossil fuel world to positions in the clean and renewable energy industry. Those industries are, in fact, booming, with jobs in solar and wind growing 12 times faster than the rest of the U.economy. Already, the number of clean and renewable industry jobs has surpassed those in the fossil fuel industry by a margin of 5 to 1.  We want to enable everyone to have the skills they need to succeed in these emerging industries, but to move to this future, we must come to a point at which we stop investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure. We cannot proceed to make this pivot quickly to a cleaner, brighter, renewable future if we continue to tie ourselves and our government to a fossil fuel-powered past. To achieve this clean break, the 100 by 50 Act ends future fossil fuel investments at the Federal level. That would affect projects similar to the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline, and we would end the tax subsidies for the fossil fuel industry.  This burning of fossil fuels is destroying our planet. We must stop subsidizing the destruction of our planet. This burning of fossil fuels is destroying our forests, which our rural communities depend on. We must stop subsidizing the destruction of our forests. The burning of these fossil fuels is driving droughts, reducing irrigation water, and hurting our farmers. We must quit subsidizing the destruction of agriculture in The burning of fossil fuels is also impacting our fishing--from warmer, smaller trout streams to a fishing industry that depends on the critical ecosystem in the ocean. We must stop subsidizing the destruction of our fishing industry.  It is also important to make sure that America remains a leader in the energy economy and leads in the effort to make sure that we do not have a disadvantage with regard to manufacturing in other countries. What that means is that, with regard to countries that are not pursuing this on the same aggressive level, we need to have an effort to drive this transaction. We need to make sure that if there are additional costs, those are offset with a border tax so that we do not encourage the movement of production out of our economy here at home. We have done so with trade policy--in a massively destructive way--to the middle class of If we do not make things in America, we will not have a middle class in America, and we need to make sure that we do not do that in the transition of our energy economy.  To fund this plan, we propose a new source of revenue. When I say a ``new source of revenue,'' that is a little misleading because we are taking a cue from history, specifically World War II, and modeling bonds--climate bonds--on the war bonds that helped fund our fight against totalitarianism--to fund our fight against Germany and the Soviet Auctioning off climate bonds is a way to raise the funds to drive the grants to power this transformation--to accelerate this transformation--and make sure that we do not leave out disadvantaged communities but, rather, bring them fully into this transition. The 100 by 50 Act is ambitious, but the circumstances require no less.  Furthermore, we cannot, simply, propose a Federal Government strategy because we live in the United States of America, where important things are done at many different levels. Here in this Chamber--right now in the U.Senate--we do not have a committee chair who is going to say that we need to have committee hearings in order to take on this issue. We do not have a committee chair on the House side who is going to drive this conversation. We do not have a President who understands the damage that is being done to our forests and our fishing and our farming and to our planet and who is going to lead the battle.  We have to turn to the wisdom of the American people. We have to turn to the wisdom of the States and the wisdom of the counties and the wisdom of the cities and the wisdom of individuals across America who are willing to go to the leadership of their mosques or the leadership of their temples or the leadership of their churches, who are willing to go to the leadership of nonprofits that they are a part of, who are willing to go to their city councils or their county commissions, who are willing to go to their State legislators.  They are going to say that we need to have a 100 by 50 resolution for our nonprofits, for our religious organizations, for our cities, for our counties, for our States because we need to own this issue. We Americans at every level need to own this issue. This is an issue that depends upon citizens across the globe taking hold of this in a powerful way that cannot be blocked by the dark money of the fossil fuel industry.  In so doing, by passing that 100 by 50 resolution for the city or the nonprofit or the church or the mosque or the synagogue or the temple, we will also adopt an action plan that involves the specific steps that local organizations are going to take over the next 2 to 3 years. This year, maybe they are going to convert their hot water heaters to electrons rather than burning natural gas. Maybe they are going to sign up for green electrons from their local utilities, which is an option that is offered in many places across The following year, maybe they are going to invest in energy-saving retrofits of their buildings. The year after that, maybe they are going to say that we have to revamp our fleet of vehicles and start using rechargeable vehicles, like the Volt or the Bolt or the LEAF or a whole set of cars that has been appearing in the economy over the last few years. One can charge them up and, thereby, run them off green electrons rather than off fossil fuels.  These are things that can be owned and done. In fact, it is already happening. It is happening with local organizations across this country that are committing themselves to 100 percent clean and renewable energy. More than 25 cities across the country have already adopted this vision--from Madison, WI, to Abita Springs, LA; from San Diego, CA, to Salt Lake City, UT; from Georgetown, TX, to Greensburg, KS--cities that are working toward a 100 percent clean and renewable future. There are 88 major businesses that are getting in on the action as well--Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Nike, Coca-Cola, General Motors, and These are only a few of the major companies that have committed to powering themselves with 100 percent clean and renewable energy.  What is driving this move toward clean and renewable energy? It is that Americans everywhere are seeing the effects on the ground. They are calling for action, and community leaders and business leaders are responding. We need to respond here in the U.We should be holding hearings on how to put this plan into action. We should be taking the best ideas from the city actions and the business actions and the nonprofit actions from across the country and from the ideas generated on the right side of the aisle and the left side of the aisle because the destruction we face--the threat we face--is not a blue issue or a red issue; it is a human civilization issue.  America has been a driver of the technology that can transform our economy and also the technology that we can sell to the world. In adopting this vision and in fighting for this vision, America can be a leader with other nations around the world. It has been beyond strange to have other countries lecture us over the last few months to maintain our commitment as a Federal Government to this vision. Other countries are saying: America, you have to be part of the solution. You have benefited enormously from the burning of fossil fuels, perhaps more than any other economy in the world. You have one of the highest per capita footprints for carbon. You must be part of this effort because every country in the world is affected.  More than 40 countries have now adopted the vision of clean and renewable energy, so there is no time for America to step out and not be part of the solution, not be part of the leadership, not be part of the driving force, not benefit from being on the cutting edge of this transformation of the energy economy.[[Page S2627]]  Just as President Kennedy laid out the vision for going to the Moon, Americans from every walk are coming together to lay out the vision for a 100 percent clean and renewable energy economy. They are adopting a framework--a time, a goal--as to where we are going and when we are getting there; 100 by 50 sums it up.  After President Kennedy laid out the vision, America went to work to make it happen, and we landed American citizens on the Now it is time for all of America to get to work and implement this vision and ensure that we succeed in transforming our energy economy within the next few decades by taking important steps every single year--driving ourselves forward, understanding the urgency, applying the technology, accelerating the implementation--to achieve 100 percent clean and renewable energy by 2050.  If there were an asteroid coming toward the Earth, we would not be talking politics or political advantage. We would all be working together to take it on--destroy it before it destroyed us. We have the equivalent of an asteroid that is coming at the Earth in global warming. The time to play politics has passed. The time to play partisanship has passed. It is time for every citizen and every organization at every level--every chair representing every Senator from every State in the Union--to come together to take on this challenge together.  I call upon my fellow Senators to be part of, perhaps, the most important effort we have to solve the biggest challenge to the health of America and the health of the planet--global warming. Step forward and be part of the effort.

1481,topic-id,348,"Mr.Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Danny I rise to express support for H.2842, Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce  I do, again, want to thank my dear friend, Representative Davis, for recognizing the importance of subsidizing jobs as something that was featured in my RISE Out of Poverty bill, and I applaud this bipartisan bill as a small step in the right direction.  Now, this bill calls for a demonstration project, which would show progress toward reducing poverty in our country through a 1-year test of subsidized employment programs. But I would note, Mr.Chairman, that it certainly does not tackle the larger shortcomings of TANF, which is in desperate need of reform.  If enacted, this bill would exhibit a great start at helping TANF recipients obtain short-term employment. However, methods to retain long-term employment through higher education and childcare options for TANF recipients are still needed.  I do want to point out, Mr.Chairman, that contrary to popular notions of welfare recipients--I have been a welfare recipient myself--people on public assistance do, in fact, want to work, but they want to work at a wage that is sustainable. They want to work at a job that includes training opportunities. They want to work at jobs that provide them with a career ladder, and they, certainly, want to work at a job that will bring them out of poverty--something that will help them work in a durable, lasting fashion.  Since I have a little bit more time than I thought I was going to have, I just want to point out that it is a little-known fact that current law under TANF actually requires welfare recipients to do unwaged work. How absurd is that? Who in this body, Mr.Chairman, would work for absolutely nothing?  I want to note that the proposed funding mechanism in H.2842 does not appear in my RISE Out of Poverty bill. TANF funds are woefully inadequate already. They are pegged to a 1994 appropriations, and, certainly, this flat funding would inure to the detriment of the entire TANF program.  Mr.Chair, I urge Members to support this bill.  ",CREC-2017-06-23-pt1-PgH5114-6.txt,1676,ACCELERATING INDIVIDUALS INTO THE WORKFORCE ACT,2017.0,23.0,July
1312,topic-id,1948,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for the recognition.  Colleagues, the new CBO score is out on, I guess, version 4.5 or 5.5--it is hard to keep track of the bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act--and nothing has changed. This proposal, which is a moral and intellectual dumpster fire, is still a disaster.  Here is what the CBO says about the bill that is currently being reworked behind closed doors by my Republican colleagues. The CBO says that, immediately, 15 million people would lose coverage by next year. That is a humanitarian catastrophe. It is something this country has never witnessed before--that number of people losing coverage in that short a period of time. Our emergency rooms would be overwhelmed as they would be unable to deal with the scope of that kind of humanitarian need. Ultimately, the number would rise to 22 million at the end of the 10-year window. We know it will be far bigger than that in the second 10 years because that is when the worst of the Medicaid cuts will happen, but 22 million is a lot of folks. It is no different than in the previous version, which was 23 million, or in the House's bill, which somehow got a majority vote in that place despite 24 million people losing health insurance, according to the  Today, 90 percent of Americans are covered by health insurance. The CBO says that number will go all the way down to 82 percent. I have heard my friend Senator Cornyn complain on this floor year after year that the ACA still leaves millions of Americans uncovered. This would make it even worse.  When you get down to look at what happens to individual Americans, it gets even more frightening. Let me give an example of how this bill would dramatically increase premiums on individuals who are currently insured through the private market.  A lot of the coverage losses happen because of this assault on Medicaid, but lots of folks who have private coverage would not be able to afford it any longer. If you are a 64-year-old who is making, let's say, $55,000, that is over three times the Federal poverty level. In a lot of places, you can live on $56,000. Today, that individual is paying about a $6,700 premium. Under the Republican healthcare bill, that individual would be paying $18,000 in premiums. That is an increase of 170 percent. That is just one individual.  The bottom line is that, if you are older and you are less wealthy, you are going to be paying a whole lot more under this proposal.  Despite all of the guarantees made by Republicans and this President that under their plan, costs would go down, that deductibles would go down and premiums would go down, the CBO says the exact opposite. It says that, especially if you are sort of middle-income and are 50 or older, your premiums will go up dramatically.  This is a terrible bill. It does not solve a single problem that the Republicans said they were trying to fix. More people lose insurance, costs go up, and quality does not get better. This is a terrible piece of legislation.  We are at this very frightening time in the negotiations when changes are being made to this bill not to improve policy but to try to win individual votes. That is what is happening as we speak. Behind closed doors, small changes are being made to this bill to try to win the votes of individual Senators, giving them specific amounts of money for their State, and their State alone, in order to win their vote. That is shameful, and it is no way to reorder one-fifth of the American economy. We are talking about 20 percent of the U.economy. And changes are being made to this bill right now that have nothing to do with good healthcare, that have only to do with winning individual votes to try to get to 50, because Republicans refuse to work with Democrats--refuse to work with us. So instead of building a product that could get big bipartisan support, Republicans are now down to a handful of their Members and are trying to find ways to deliver amounts of money to those Members' States in order to win their vote.  There is a special fund in the latest version of the bill for insurance companies in Alaska that was not in the previous version of the bill. Now, all of these provisions get written in a way that if you are an average, ordinary American who decides to take a couple of hours of your time to read the bill, you would never know that it was a specific fund for Alaska because it doesn't say ``Alaska.'' It sets up a whole bunch of requirements that a State has to meet to get this special fund for insurance companies, and only one State fits that description, and it is  There is a change in this bill from previous law that addresses States that were late Medicaid expanders, States that expanded into the new Medicaid population allowed for under the Affordable Care Act but did it late in the process. The previous version didn't give those States credit when establishing the baseline for the new Medicaid reductions, but miraculously this new bill has a specific provision to allow for two States that were late Medicaid expanders to be able to get billions of additional dollars sent to their Those States are Alaska and Louisiana--two  There is a new provision in the latest version of the bill that makes a very curious change to the way in which DISH payments are sent to States--that is the Disproportionate Share Hospital Program that helps hospitals pay for the costs for people without insurance. Not coincidentally, it is a change that was advocated by one Senator from one State: The change will disproportionately benefit the State of Florida, and it is now in the new version.  These are not changes that help the American healthcare system. They are not changes that benefit my State or[[Page S4103]]the State of the majority of Members here. Some of these changes don't benefit 98 of us; they only benefit 2 of us. And they are in this version of the bill in order to win votes, not to make good policy.  We heard word this morning of a new fund that was invented in the middle of the night last evening that would supposedly help States that are Medicaid expansion States transition their citizens who are currently on Medicaid to the private market. Now there are reports that it is a $200 billion fund, and that is a lot of money. It sounds like a lot of money, and it is a lot of money, but it would represent 17 percent of the funds that are being cut to States, and it would only be a temporary bandaid on a much bigger problem. Why? Because CBO says definitively that the subsidies in this bill for people who want to buy private insurance are so meager that virtually no one who is kicked off of Medicaid will be able to afford those new premiums. That is why the numbers are so sweeping in their scale--22 million people losing healthcare insurance.  So even if you get a little bit of money to help a group of individuals in a handful of States transition, when that money runs out--and it will--they are back in the same place. All they are doing is temporarily postponing the enormity of the pain that gets delivered. And once again, this provision being delivered to only States with Medicaid expansion populations is being targeted in order to win votes, not in order to improve the entirety of the healthcare system.  Senator Corker called out his colleagues today. He said that he was willing to vote for the motion to proceed, but he was growing increasingly uncomfortable with a bill that was increasingly--I think his word was ``incoherent.'' That is what happens when you get to the point where you have a deeply unpopular bill that everybody in the country hates and you need to put amounts of money in it to get a handful of additional votes. It becomes incoherent. And this was an incoherent bill to begin with. It is hard to make this bill more incoherent, but that is what is happening when these individual funds are being set up for Alaska, Louisiana, and  We could solve all of this if Republicans decided to work with If we set aside the big tax cuts for the wealthy and the pillorying of the Medicaid Program, if we try to fix the real problems Americans face today, we could do it on a bipartisan way. And wouldn't that be great.  I get it that there is enormous political advantage for Democrats to sit on the sidelines and watch Republicans vote for a bill that has a 15-percent approval rating, just like there was political advantage for Republicans to sit on the sidelines and not do anything to help Democrats provide insurance to 20 million more Healthcare is a very thorny political issue, but it doesn't have to be that way. We could sit down together and own this problem and the solution together, and we could end healthcare being a permanent political cudgel that just gets used every 5 to 10 years by one side to beat the other side over the head.  We are Senators too. We got elected just like our Republican friends did. Why won't Republicans let Democrats into the room, especially after this bill has failed over and over again to get 50 votes from Republicans? We don't have a communicable disease. We aren't going to physically hurt you if you let us into that room. We are not lying when we say we have a desire to compromise.  Democrats aren't going to walk into a negotiating room and demand a single-payer healthcare system. We understand that we are going to have to give Republicans some of what they want; maybe that is flexibility in the benefit design that is offered on these exchanges. But Republicans are going to have to give Democrats some of what we want, which is the end to this madness--an administration that is trying to sabotage our healthcare system and destroy the healthcare our citizens get. But that could be a compromise. It is not illegal to meet with us. There are 48 of us; there are not 12 of us. My constituents in Connecticut deserve to have a voice in how one-fifth of the American economy is going to be transformed.  I know a lot of my Republican friends want to do this. I have talked with Republican Senators who say: Well, when this process falls apart, we want to work with you. It is falling apart, because the only way Republicans are going to get the 50 votes is by making these shameful changes--specific funding streams for specific States in order to get a handful of votes--and that is not how this place should work. Maybe that is how things happened here 100 years ago, but it is not how things should happen today.  So once again I will beg my Republican colleagues to stop this partisan closed-door exercise and come and work with We can do this together. We can own it together. We will have plenty of other stuff left to fight about if we find a way to agree on a path forward for America's healthcare system.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

He responded:       I am aware that, in response to the President's recent      Executive Order on the Outer Continental Shelf, Secretary      Zinke issued a Secretarial Order 3350 directing the Bureau of      Ocean Energy Management to review and develop a new five-year      plan. I support the President's and the Secretary's actions      to examine new leasing opportunities within the OCS in order      to advance the Administration's energy agenda.  Then Senator Cantwell asked him: ``Do you support extending this moratorium?''  He responded: ``I support the President's and the Secretary's actions aimed at increasing offshore production while balancing conservation objectives.''  First of all, when it comes to the eastern gulf, there is no good way to increase offshore production while balancing environmental concerns.

Since      military readiness falls under my purview, I have been asked      to respond to your letter on behalf of the Secretary of      The Department of Defense (DoD) cannot overstate the      vital importance of maintaining this moratorium.       National security and energy security are inextricably      linked and the DoD fully supports the development of our      nation's domestic energy resources in a manner that is      compatible with military testing, training, and operations.      As mentioned in your letter, the complex of eastern Gulf of      Mexico operating areas and warning areas provides critical      opportunities for advanced weapons testing and joint training      exercises. The moratorium on oil and gas ``leasing, pre-     leasing, and other related activities'' ensures that these      vital military readiness activities may be conducted without      interference and is critical to their continuation. Emerging      technologies such as hypersonics, autonomous systems, and      advanced sub-surface systems will require enlarged testing      and training footprints, and increased DoD reliance on the      Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act's moratorium beyond 2022.      The moratorium is essential for developing and sustaining our      nation's future combat capabilities.       Since signing the 1983 ``Memorandum of Agreement Between      the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior      on Mutual Concerns on the Outer Continental Shelf,'' the two      departments have worked cooperatively to ensure offshore      resource development is compatible with military readiness      activities. During recent discussions between the DoD and the      Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy      Management, a question arose concerning whether Congress      intended the moratorium to prohibit even geological and      geophysical survey activities in the eastern We would      welcome clarification from Congress concerning this matter.       On behalf of the Secretary, I appreciate your interest in      sustaining our testing and training activities in the eastern      Gulf of           Sincerely,                                                       A.Kurta,      Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for      Personnel and                                  ____                                      Department of the Air Force,                                 Office of the Chief of Staff,                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.

The Air Force fully supports the development of our      nation's domestic energy resources in a manner that is      compatible with the military testing, training, and      operations. The complex of eastern Gulf of Mexico operating      areas and warning areas provides critical opportunities for      advanced weapons testing and joint training exercises. The      moratorium on oil and gas leasing, pre-leasing, and other      related activities ensures that these vital military      readiness activities may be conducted without interference      and is critical to their continuation. Of course, we are      always willing to work with the appropriate agencies to see      if there are ways to explore for energy without hampering air      operations.       The moratorium is essential for developing and sustaining      the Air Force's future combat capabilities. Although the Gulf      of Mexico Energy Security Act's moratorium does not expire      until 2022, the Air Force needs the certainty of the proposed      extension to guarantee long-term capabilities for future      tests. Emerging technologies such as hypersonics, 5th      generation fighters, and advanced sub-surface systems will      require enlarged testing and training footprints, and      increased Air Force reliance on the moratorium far beyond      2022.[[Page S4095]]       Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any      questions.

They want to extend the moratorium for another 5 years, to 2027. That is a reasonable request by the Department of Defense and the Department of the Air  For example, a test can start way down in the South, off of Key West, and a cruise missile could go all the way, 300 miles, because of the size of this test range, and then it could have a land impact on Eglin Air Force That is part of our testing regime.  One could ask, Why couldn't the cruise missile weave around oil rig activities? Well, look at the new miniature cruise missiles that are out there. It is not one, but a swarm, which takes up a big footprint that we are testing. This is just one example of a weapons system that needs a lot of open space. This is a national asset. We don't want to give it up. That is why the top brass in the Pentagon is asking that we extend this moratorium so that those expensive investments in telemetry can be made.  We should not put someone in charge at the Department of the Interior if he has an open objection to what is obviously needed for national security and if he has demonstrated a history of siding just with special interests. It would be a bad decision when it comes to the national security of this country.  I am going to oppose the nomination, but that is just one reason, one item, on an ever-growing list of concerns that this Senator has with the Department of the Interior these days.  On June 29, Secretary Zinke announced that the Department was seeking public comment on a new 5-year plan for offshore oil and gas leasing. In case anyone has forgotten, the current 5-year plan was just finalized 6 months ago and is supposed to run through 2022. Why would the Department spend more taxpayer money to go through the whole process all over again? The only reason this Senator can see is that the oil industry wants more acreage. They are going after the eastern Gulf of Mexico, despite the fact that the Department of Defense is asking for exactly the opposite.  By the way, they ought to take from the very productive sections of the Gulf of Mexico off of There are acres and acres under lease, but of all those acres under lease, how many are actually drilled and/or in production? It is a small percentage of the acreage under lease that is actually drilled. So why don't we take advantage of the existing leases, particularly in the central gulf, which is where the oil is? That is where all the sediments over millions of years came down the Mississippi River, settled in what is today the gulf, into the Earth's crust, compacted it, and made it into oil. That is where the oil is.  Now, remember, also out there in the eastern gulf, this is the area that is off limits. This is the Eglin Gulf Test and Training The Air Force wants to extend that moratorium from 2022 by 5 years--out to 2027--in order to protect it for all of these reasons we have been discussing. It is all of that open space, and we ought not give it up.  I will give you another example of the short memories over at the Department of the  After the 2010 BP oilspill, it became clear that the relationship between regulators and the oil industry was a problem so the Minerals Management Service was divided into two separate agencies in the Department of the Interior--the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which regulates lease sales, and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which is supposed to ensure that safety standards are followed. Less than a decade later, people seem to have forgotten all of that, and they want to put the two back together again. It is another example of what is going on. Not only that, but the administration is trying to roll back the safety rules, like the well control rule that was finalized in November of last year. This long-overdue rule seeks to prevent what went so tragically wrong on the Deepwater Horizon rig from ever happening again.  Every day, it seems like the administration is coming up with a new way to put the gulf at risk and Florida's coastline and tourism-driven economy at risk. It is now putting at risk the national security of the country by messing up the largest testing and training range for the U.military and the world. It is utilized by all branches of service. As a matter of fact, when they stopped the Atlantic fleet of the Navy from doing all of its training off of Puerto Rico on the Island of Vieques, all of that training came to the gulf. The Navy squadrons come down for 2 weeks at a time to the Naval Air Station Key West, with the airport actually being on Boca Chica Key, and when they lift off on the runway, within 2 minutes, those F/A-18s are over restricted airspace so they do not have to spend a lot of time and fuel in getting to their training area.  I have heard from business owners, and I have heard from residents across the entire State of They do not want drilling in the eastern gulf. They have seen what can happen when the inevitable spill happens. We lose an entire season of tourism, and all of that revenue goes away, along with that loss.  Why do they know that?  The BP oilspill was off of Louisiana, but the winds started carrying the oil slicks to the east. It got as far east as Pensacola Beach, and the white, sugary sands of Pensacola were covered in black oil. That was the photograph that went around the world. The winds continued to push it, and tar mats came over and got onto the beach at We were desperately trying to keep the oil from going into the Choctawhatchee Bay at Destin like it had already gone into the Pensacola Bay at The winds kept pushing it to the east, and the tarballs ended up all over the tourism beaches of Panama Then the winds did us a favor--they reversed, and they started taking it back to the west.  So there was oil on some of the beaches, but what happened for an entire year of the tourist season? The tourists did not come to the gulf beaches, not only in Northwest Florida but all down the peninsula, all the way down to Marco Island, and they lost an entire tourist season. That is why people are so upset about any messing around.  This Senator brings this to us as I have spoken of what has happened and have stood up for over the last four decades in order to fight to prevent those kinds of spills from happening again off the coast of the State of  Yet now we have, right here, an issue in front of us, something that could threaten the Department of Defense's mission for being ready to protect this In that case, my recommendation to the Senate is not to vote for this nomination for Deputy Secretary of the Interior because of his history and because of how he responded to Senator Cantwell in the committee.

1518,topic-id,317,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my good friend from Virginia for yielding to me.  You haven't heard any discussion of abuse of official time because there is no record of abuse of official time. My colleagues on the other side simply want to get rid of official time, as they have wanted to do for decades.  A little background: Federal employees have no right to strike, as they do in the private sector. In return, though, the time-honored right to organize and represent employees in their official capacity on matters relating to the workplace has always been in place under Republicans and Democrats alike.  Remember, there is also no requirement to join a union in the first place; yet unions must represent all workers, regardless of their membership or not.  The bill on the House floor, H.1293, is unnecessary. Official time reports are already required. This is a redundant bill.  If my friend is worried that these reports haven't been timely, as he implied then he can do that administratively or do it in this bill. The reason he doesn't do it in this bill is this bill is a cover. It is a cover for two pending bills which are already out of committee. I expect them on the floor any minute now, although, notice the sequence.                              {time}  1415  Mr.Speaker, this seemingly vanilla bill, is going to be followed by the real bills that my colleagues are after. They are parallel bills. They essentially eliminate official time to represent workers.  Now, why is official time important? They are important for the operation of the Federal Government itself. And why is that? Because there are always going to be disputes and contention between management and labor. Official takes away time that would otherwise be wasted and allows the parties to go to the table and work matters out.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

One bill would make it virtually impossible for union members to volunteer their time unless they wanted to give up parts of their retirement benefits.  What kind of quid pro quo is that? What do you want to do next? Reduce pay if a union rep uses official time?  The next bill designates employees who cannot represent other employees. This bill looks like something you would expect from countries where there is no right to organize.  This bill reduces the amount of dues unions can collect, even though they are collecting dues on their own time and not official time. This is a brazen attempt to eliminate the fair-share fee, non-union workers pay for being represented equally with union members, and allow free riders to be served free of charge. This is the beginning of an out-and-out assault on the freedom of workers to organize.  ",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgH4528-3.txt,868,1845,2017.0,24.0,April

Mr.Speaker, we must persist because I do not recall a demonstration like this.

We have our differences with Turkey, but we are dependent on Turkey for security matters. If this had never happened before, perhaps we could say that Turkey just doesn't understand how we operate in this country. The fact that it was the third incident makes it particularly bothersome.  Now, we are aware how sensitive this matter is. You cannot deal with a foreign adversary who happens to be an ally at the same time as if he were simply the enemy or our opponent. We have to understand the sensibilities of operating in the international sphere. But it is clear that Turkey doesn't understand that.  I was particularly concerned that Mr.Erdogan was in his car the entire time. He could have gotten out of his car and called attention to his security detail.

He's been noticeably silent on the brutal beating of      peaceful protesters in Washington, D.by the Turkish      President's thuggish bodyguards, on public property, right in      front of our own police, fully caught on video.       The violence was completely unprovoked, and happened      shortly after Trump welcomed Turkish President Recep Tayyip      Erdogan to the Oval Among others, a young woman from      East Rutherford, Ceren Borazan, was put into a headlock and      choked--popping a blood vessel in her eye--by a man who      threatened to kill her.       This is common practice in Turkey--which is why Trump needs      to make it clear that it isn't acceptable here.       But perhaps the real problem is that it is increasingly      acceptable here. Not just verbal and physical attacks against      peaceful protesters, but against journalists, whom Trump has      called ``the enemy of the people.''       In the past month alone, reporters have been arrested,      slapped, pinned against a wall and choked for trying to do      their jobs; most recently by newly-elected Montana      congressman Greg Gianforte, accused of body-slamming a      journalist.       He's faced no real consequences. ``Elections are about      choices and Montanans made their choice,'' Speaker Paul Ryan      said Trump, who had lavished praise on Gianforte--``a      wonderful guy''--added: ``Great win in Montana.''       Perhaps this is why the former Breitbart News reporter      Michelle Fields, who was grabbed roughly by Corey Lewandowski      last year when she tried to ask Trump a question, said some      Republicans ``have put party over civility.''       The casualty isn't just civility. Trump's hostility toward      the press--like his attempt to use the FBI to muzzle      journalists--has led[[Page H4632]]     Reporters Without Borders to lower America's ranking on press      freedom, measured by government restrictions and threats      against the news media.       We're now ranked right below Burkina Faso, one of the      world's poorest countries.       This failure to speak up for peaceful protesters and      journalists began at Trump's rallies, where his supporters      threatened and committed actual violence against them. Since      then, the United Nations has warned that the basic principle      of peaceful protest is under attack in the United At      least 19 states have introduced measures that would      criminalize such protests.

1514,topic-id,570,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.1293, to amend title 5 of the United States Code to require the Office of Personnel Management to submit an annual report to Congress relating to the use of official time by Federal employees.  Mr.Speaker, I am here today to talk about a bill that would provide taxpayers with greater transparency of official time. ``Official time'' is that term that describes when Federal employees do union work on the taxpayers' dime.  The only standard provided by the statute authorizing official time is that the employees perform union work on official time in a manner that is ``reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest.'' Currently, Federal law does not require agencies to report, annually, on the amount of official time their employees perform.  Until March of this year, the Office of Personnel Management had not reported on official time since fiscal year 2012. When the report was released in March, the data was out of date, containing information from fiscal year 2014.  While the Office of Personnel Management may request that agencies provide data related to official time, OPM does not have any set of standards or procedures prescribing the collection of official time data. Considering the burden that official time puts on the taxpayer, more stringent reporting is necessary.  The latest data provided by OPM shows that taxpayers paid $162 million for salary and benefits related to work done in official time in fiscal year 2014, up from $157 million 2 years earlier in fiscal year 2012.  Agencies reported that bargaining unit employees spent a total of 3.5 million hours performing representational activities on official time.  The current lack of stringent reporting requirements, as well as the broad interpretation of the statute's sole requirement that official time be carried out in a way that is reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest, have clearly opened the door to abuse.  The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform identified several cases where employees on official time engaged in all sorts of inappropriate activities while on taxpayer-funded time, including everything from leisure to criminal activities. With greater transparency, employees will be less likely to abuse the system, which will result in less waste of taxpayer dollars.  It is by far time we require agencies to provide this information to Congress and to the public. Taxpayers deserve clear, reliable data on how many employees are performing union work on official time in lieu of their regularly assigned government duties.  To accomplish this, H.1293 requires agencies to provide more detailed information to OPM regarding what their employees are doing related to official time. Specifically, the bill requires agencies to report the total amount of official time granted to employees, the average amount of time each employee spends on official time, the specific types of activities for which official time was granted, and the impact official time had on agency operations.  H.1293 requires agencies to report the amount of compensation employees received in connection with the time they spent on activities in connection with official time.  Finally, the bill requires agencies to report a description of rooms and spaces agencies use to conduct official time.  H.1293 will provide taxpayers with the transparency they deserve when it comes to official time.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

This bill doesn't do anything about union dues. This bill doesn't do anything other than require the transparency of reporting official time.

I don't mean to misrepresent anything. While I might have opinions of what I believe, I can tell you factually that this bill is merely, and solely, and exclusively a reporting bill. If I were managing a company and I wanted to know where my resources were, I would want to make sure I managed those resources--including my human resources--so I would like to know where the time of my employees is spent.  There is no prohibition of time being spent. There is no restriction of time being spent. It is merely a reporting bill. It is requiring reporting. It is something the OPM has done before. It was started under President Carter's administration.  Mr.Speaker, I inquire of my good friend if there is anything that has changed to make his opposition now come to the floor?

I think just the opposite. A vast majority of our Federal employees are probably some of the best workforce that we have out there. I think that, in any workforce, you are going to have some people that don't live up to the standards of their employment. So what I merely do in my opening statement is to say that there has been a need for transparency that includes the abuse of time by some, not by all.  Again, the vast majority of Federal employees are exceptional employees, hardworking, and absolutely necessary to run this great country.

We are grateful for their service.  As in any case, there might be some bad ones, but, more importantly, all this bill requests is that we just report the transparency of their services and official time.

1539,topic-id,339,"I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I came to the floor today expecting to support H.1293, which has to do with the reporting of official time, but based on the negative commentary we are getting generally about official time and the knock against Federal employees we have heard here today, I am anxious now about supporting this bill because it appears that what is happening is our colleagues on the other side are setting the table for bringing other legislation eventually to the floor that is actually going to attack and undermine official time.  My colleague earlier referred to a wolf in sheep's clothing represented by this bill. You can look at it as the camel's nose under the tent. Whatever it is, I am worried now that the agenda here is to undermine official time.  Let's remind ourselves of the various benefits of official time. It helps to resolve workplace disputes, which is really important. It helps to improve efficiency within the workplace. It is what leads to negotiating positive agreements between labor and management. It is how official time, when it is used wisely--and there is no evidence that it is not used wisely; there is no evidence of abuse or misuse of official time--and when it is used the way it has been used, it helps our Federal agencies help the American people. It helps these agencies function well.  I hope that we can reject whatever is coming down the pipeline. I was cautiously optimistic when I came to support this bill that these other efforts that seem to be underway were maybe being put to bed, but now I am concerned that there is an agenda coming. So we will just have to see how it goes.  I want to reiterate my strong support for the use of official time the way it is used by our Federal employees, which is in a very positive fashion, and I urge my colleagues on the other side to protect official time and all of its benefits.

1427,topic-id,313,"Madam President, today is the net neutrality day of action. So I wanted to add a few words to this issue.  We depend on a free and open internet to spur innovation and job creation, and our economy works best when innovators, entrepreneurs, and businesses of all sizes compete on a level playing field. Net neutrality, very simply, says that everyone--consumers, small businesses, startups--deserve the same access to and quality of internet as big corporations.  When I was growing up in Brooklyn, my father owned a small exterminating business. If his competitor down the street had received preferred electricity service, he would have been rightly outraged, and the law would have protected him from that unfair treatment. We don't reserve certain highways for a single trucking company, and we don't limit phone service to hand-picked stores. We shouldn't reserve high-speed internet for a favored few corporations, either, and that was the basis of the FCC's decision to preserve net neutrality back in 2015.  Now, of course, conservative and industry interests see an opportunity to roll back these protections and free access to a free and open internet in order to favor powerful corporations. That seems to be what they want.  President Trump's appointee to the FCC, Chairman Ajit Pai, has already taken several actions to undercut fair internet access.

1446,topic-id,740,"Mr.President, there was the G-20 and President Trump's bilateral meeting with President While a few good things came out of this summit, overall, it was an embarrassment to our country and our ideals. Clearly, the lowest moment of all was President Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin, on several counts.  As our intelligence community has concluded, the President of Russia deliberately interfered in our elections and sought to undermine our democracy. That is not Democrats making it up. That is 17 intelligence agencies--men and women, many of whom risk their lives for us every day, people we look up to, people we admire. They are the ones who said there was interference--not Democrats, not politicians. I wish President Trump would stop saying it was Democrats who came up with this idea. It was our own intelligence community. Rather than decisively confront the Russian President on these actions--the Russian interference--the President reportedly acquiesced to Putin's denial.  To give equal credence to the findings of 17 U.intelligence agencies and an assertion by Mr.Putin is disgraceful. They are not equal. Our 17 intelligence agencies are far more important to us and far more credible to us than Vladimir Every American--every American--no matter their party affiliation, should take umbrage with the President of the United States equating our own hardworking, dedicated intelligence community with Mr.Putin, who has shown contempt for our democracy and has spent his professional and political career trying to undermine it.  This almost certainly paves the way--the President's actions almost certainly pave the way--for future Russian interference on our elections. If Russia feels there will be no punishment for interfering in our elections, no reprimand at all from the United States, surely they will try and try again.  President Trump went so far as to float the absolutely absurd possibility of a joint cyber security unit with the Then he backtracked after he was hailing it as one of the great things about the summit. When he got such reaction--particularly, from Senators McCain and Rubio, from his own party--he backtracked.  The thought of working with our adversary on cyber security should send chills down the backs of all It is clear that President Trump is not willing to be the guardian of American interests when it comes to Vladimir The House of Representatives must step in and fill the void by passing the Senate's tough, bipartisan sanctions bill to finally punish Russia for their intrusions in our 2016 elections.  The Founding Fathers established Congress as a check and balance on the executive branch when necessary. The House must be that check and balance now.  Given the President's actions at the G-20, there is now even more reason for the House to pass the Senate sanctions bill, which passed 98 to 2--overwhelmingly bipartisan.  Given President Trump's casual dismissals of the findings of our intelligence community and face-value acceptance of Mr.Putin's word, there is even greater cause to tie the hands of this administration with a tough Russia sanctions bill.  Now more than ever, it is clear that President Trump should not have the final and only authority to lift sanctions on He has shown that he is willing to turn a blind eye to the direct assault on our democracy and did so this weekend in his meeting with Mr. Congress should step up and say: President Trump, if you are not going to punish Russia for meddling with our democracy, we will.  The American people are wondering: How can the President of the United States fail to stick up for our democracy? How can the President fail to seriously challenge the man responsible for violating the sanctity of our elections?  Candidly, I am dismayed that the Republican leadership in this body and in the other has been so quiet in the wake of these events. The Republican Party's foreign policy for decades was predicated on opposition to the Soviet Union and now It was the linchpin of their foreign policy. Now, when a President of their party is soft on Russia--even after Russia blatantly interfered in our elections--we hardly hear a peep from the Republican leadership.  I certainly acknowledge, respect, and admire the words of my friends, Republican Senators McCain, Graham, Sasse, and Rubio, who have spoken out and should be recognized and applauded for it. They have been the exception, not the rule. We need to hear more from the Republican leadership because this situation is getting ever more troubling.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-10-pt1-PgS3875.txt,1036,SPACE WEATHER RESEARCH AND FORECASTING ACT,2017.0,10.0,May

We considered this bill, despite the fact we didn't have clear data on the impact of the bill on the VA's HR capability. I realize this bill we are considering on the floor today is about that data, but the spirit in which it is being moved forward is not about trying to illuminate how official time has helped our veterans.  There are 49,386 vacant positions at the Rolling back the use of official time will only increase the demands on the VA's human resources staff, making it harder to fill positions and recruit and retain quality providers.  Official time benefits our veterans. In Pittsburgh, as was mentioned before by my colleague from New Jersey, an AFGE president used official time to press the VA to address a Legionnaires' disease outbreak that killed 6 veterans and made 16 others sick. Her actions helped save veterans' lives, and she used official time to do it.  At the Phoenix VA there was a 29 percent turnover rate for licensed practical nurses. Union representatives used official time to improve working conditions and cut the turnover rate in half. Less turnover means better care for veterans.  I warn my colleagues against this bill and future misguided legislation to undermine official time and the function of our Federal agencies.

The gentlewoman is correct. While I was not blessed with a daughter, I was blessed with three sons, one who I am proud to call a veteran of the United States Air  My son Christopher was the first one to leave home, and I can't imagine, as a mother of a child who is leaving him for the first time going into basic training, receiving the types of calls that these parents must have received, completely heartbreaking.  One of the stories that my son shared with me was of a suicide that happened that involved one of his classmates, and how the parents found out about her suicide through a Facebook post because everyone was sharing a condolence note.  So these things happen; and while we cannot and may not be able to always control the actions of these young men and women, there is a basic understanding and expectation from parents like myself that when we send our boys, and our young men and our young women, daughters and sons, to the military, that they will be taken care of; and when they file a complaint, that those complaints will be taken seriously and fully investigated. They deserve nothing less.  Sexual harassment in the military certainly isn't new, but this scandal is a wake-up call that we cannot afford to ignore. The victims of Marines United don't just deserve our sympathy and our support, they deserve a commitment to doing everything that we can to finally bring an end to sexual harassment in the military in all forms.

She begins by stating her name and thanking you for the opportunity to testify at the August 8, 2011, hearing.  And she states: ``I enlisted in the United States Marine Corps knowing I could have potentially deployed to a combat zone. If presented the opportunity, I would have given my life for this country without hesitation. Never once did I think the war I'd fight would be among my very own brothers in arms.  ``During the time I spent in the Marine Corps, various clothed photos of me were taken from my personal social media accounts without my consent and shared on sites that are like Marines United with great frequency. They would post my photo and caption it, `Smash or Pass,' in other words, `Would you have sex with this woman or not?' followed by extreme vulgar, degrading, and repulsive comments, including rape talk. My so-called brothers in arms shared clothed photographs of me on Marines United, posted my contact information, and discussed all the unspeakable things they would like to do to me.  ``Comments I saw on other posts of the site included how female marines aren't `real' marines and belong in the kitchen. One post suggested friendly fire to the women who are now being integrated into the infantry units. Another male veteran described how he would rip off an Active-Duty female's eyelashes and then throw her into a tub of acid. Many veterans think because the UCMJ does not apply to them, they're immune from legal action.  ``This culture of sharing photographs has been going on long before Marines United, and even before With the use of social media and other file-sharing sites, this behavior has developed into something that has led to harassment and the degradation of men and women servicemembers. If this behavior had not come to light, I believe it would have continued as a dark secret of the military.''  Her statement goes on. I will not read the rest of it but continue by saying that these aren't faceless strangers. They are our daughters, our sisters, and our friends. They are American heroes who volunteered to serve our country.  As a mother of a veteran, I know that our military is better than this. Our men and women in uniform represent the very best of this Nation, and I am proud to stand with my colleagues this evening in support of bringing about the changes we need to put a stop to the sharing of nonconsensual pornography in the military and, ultimately, bring an end to sexual and gender-based violence and harassment in our Armed  The next letter that I write to one of the academies recommending a young lady from my district, I want the reassurance from our military that her safety, her personal safety, will be taken seriously.

This is a tradition I inherited from one of our former colleagues, Senator Ted Kaufman of Senator Kaufman, who had been a longtime staffer himself before he served as a Senator, would come to this floor on a regular basis to acknowledge and celebrate the tireless work and occasional heroics performed by many of our Federal employees. When Senator Kaufmann left this body, I gladly picked up that mantle and since then have come to the floor to draw attention to the extraordinary contributions of many of our Federal workers.  Over the past few years, this recognition has included a Social Security executive who eliminated a claims backlog to more quickly meet the urgent needs of thousands of Social Security recipients with grave terminal illnesses. We have also celebrated the work of a Department of Homeland Security official who saved taxpayers $750 million by streamlining her agency's procurement processes, and we proudly highlighted the work of a group of engineers at NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia, who, in 2010, designed a capsule that proved to be crucial in saving the lives of 33 Chilean miners who were trapped underground.  Too often, our Federal workers are disrespected and demeaned by those who would attempt to use them as scapegoats for all that is allegedly wrong here in In reality, thousands of our Nation's dedicated civil servants work tirelessly every day to make our government work for and by the people.  Today, I wish to focus for a moment on one such group of outstanding Federal employees--those who work across our Nation's intelligence agencies to keep our Nation safe. Most of these professionals work in anonymity. Many risk their lives far away from the limelight. That is how it should be, for they are sworn to secrecy, even from their families and loved ones.  Over the last decade and a half, our intelligence professionals have increasingly been deployed overseas into war zones and other high-threat environments. Regrettably, some have made the highest sacrifice--laying down their lives for their country.  For their service, the risks they take and the sacrifices they make every day and because they do not hear this nearly enough, let me say ``thank you'' to the intelligence community.  As a Senator from the Commonwealth of Virginia, I am proud to represent thousands of current and former members of the intelligence community who live, work, or retire in our great I am also proud to represent these individuals in my current capacity as vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence  My colleagues and I on the committee have again submitted a resolution that marks July 26 as ``United States Intelligence Professionals Day.''

It was earlier in my statement that we passed that resolution. In recent years, our committee has had success, as we try to protect our intelligence community, with greater intelligence sharing and interoperability and because of investments in people and systems.  Many challenges remain--from the constant barrage of leaks to the security of the supply chain, to outdated processes for security clearances. I hope that this year's intelligence authorization bill will begin to address some of these issues.  Yet today it is the people in the intelligence community whom I want to acknowledge--their professionalism, their dedication to duty and country, their silent service, their sacrifices.  The men and women of the Nation's intelligence agencies deserve our respect and our thanks. They do not deserve to be belittled, disrespected, or threatened, and certainly not from their Commander in  To the men and women of the intelligence community--these great Federal employees--I conclude with this: We, simply, do not say it enough, but thank you for your service.

By his own admission, he intends to be a big business yes-man for the Trump administration's extreme disregard for our environment and the human lives that are affected.  President Trump promised to drain the swamp of DC, but with each day of this administration, this Republican-controlled Senate approves yet another corporate insider to help out big business. The decision to nominate Mr.Bernhardt is no exception. He is another conflict-ridden, climate-dismissing Trump appointee who favors profits over people.  Let's look at his record. Mr.Bernhardt has extensive political experience in the Department of the Interior under the Bush administration, but in his tenure at the Department, including the 2 years he oversaw the ethics division, the Department was awash in ethical scandals and scientific misconduct.  And what did he do after he left government service? He scooted off to a lucrative lobbying firm to help Big Oil and other extraction companies maximize their profits by expanding offshore drilling and delaying air pollution limits on coal plants, regardless of the impact that would have on our children's future.  Even Mr.Bernhardt isn't proud of his own record. Prior to his nomination, his lobbying firm bio bragged about recently helping corporations fight against the Endangered Species Act, supporting corporate interests in offshore drilling and exploration for fossil fuels, and helping mining companies pursue public lands for development. He openly bragged about recently representing ``an entity under investigation by a Federal Agency'' and ``entities accused of violating the Department of the Interior's regulations.'' He swaggered through That is, he swaggered right up until he was under consideration for the 2 spot at Now that he is in the public spotlight, he has scrubbed all those pro-industry, pro-pollution references from his bio. Now that the public is paying attention, he is putting out a clean image of a public servant who just happens to advise big corporations from time to time.  Beyond the ties Mr.Bernhardt still has to industry, I am alarmed by his willingness to serve as the corporate rubberstamp that President Trump wants. Mr.Bernhardt is a walking conflict of interest who has taken one spin through the revolving door, and now he is coming back around again for a second pass.  The Deputy Secretary serves at the pleasure of the But a Deputy Secretary--the 2 at the Department--is, first and foremost, bound to serve the American people and the mission of the No President is properly served by a corporate yes-man, and Mr.Bernhardt's yes-man mentality was on full display during his confirmation hearing.  When my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Al Franken, questioned Mr.Bernhardt about climate change at his nomination hearing, he was all too willing to dismiss the urgency of climate change, and he pushed aside the responsibility of the Department of the Interior to act. In defiance of accepted climate science, he stated:       This President ran, he won on a particular policy      perspective. That perspective's not going to change to the      extent we have the discretion under the law to follow it.  In other words, don't bother me with the facts; we will just stick to whatever President Trump tells us to do.  But the rest of us can't ignore the facts. Our planet is getting hotter. The last 16 years were all among the hottest 17 years on record, and our seas are rising at an alarming rate. Our coasts are threatened by furious storm surges that can sweep away homes and devastate even our largest cities. Our economically disadvantaged communities, too often situated in low-lying floodplains, are one bad storm away from destruction. Our naval bases are under attack--not by enemy ships but by rising seas. Our food supplies and forests are threatened by droughts and wildfires that are becoming so common across the country that they barely even make the evening news.  The effects of manmade climate change are all around us, and things will only continue to get worse at an accelerating pace if we don't do something about it. We can act, and one important step is saying no to corporate raiders who are seeking to exploit public lands and gamble with our children's future.  President Trump thinks leadership is handing over management of our public lands to Big Oil and Big Coal executives who are looking to stuff their pockets while the getting is good. Mr.Bernhardt, a seasoned advocate for corporate interests, seems all too eager to please this President and corporate interests, no matter the cost to the American people.

1408,topic-id,4162,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate you yielding and being willing to stick around with me this afternoon. I have a great pleasure this afternoon, and that is to talk about successes that we have had together.  I was down on the floor earlier when we were debating the rule, and I was talking to my Democratic colleagues on the Rules Committee about the good work that was going on in the Rules Committee; the good work that was going on on the House floor. In fact, we brought the bill--it was a raucous debate, Mr.You will remember it. We argued for an hour about all sorts of extraneous things, then we brought the bill down, and it passed, I believe unanimously, here on the floor of the House just a few minutes ago.  I don't understand that. I just don't understand what those drivers are in politics, Mr.Speaker, that encourages us to tear folks down instead of build folks up. And that is why I want to talk about some successes today. You can't see my slides, Mr.Speaker, but I have got some numbers written down to the left in red, and those are the numbers that are worth paying attention to.  Twenty-eight. Twenty-eight is the number of bills President Trump has signed into law in his first 100 days; 28. That is more bills signed into law than any other American President since Harry  More bills. Now, I read the same newspapers you read, Mr.I listen to the same news broadcasts you listen to. I hear folks talk about inaction. I hear folks talk about confusion. I hear folks talk about division. I don't[[Page H2928]]hear folks talking about success, and success is what marks these first 100 days.  Again, there has been more legislative activity than any other President and Congress--collaboratively Congress, House, Senate, Republicans, Democrats--more legislative success than we have had in any Congress and White House combination since Harry  Mr.Speaker, we had the first Supreme Court confirmation in the first 100 days since 1881--since 1881. Now, it is with no joy that I share with you that the Supreme Court is such a powerful institution, Mr.I think too often we fail to get the job done legislatively, and the Court steps in and legislates from right across the street. That wasn't the job the Constitution envisioned. That wasn't the job assigned in Article III, but it is the job that has been taken on by default. So it has become increasingly important that we make sure the Court is staffed.  I supported the Senate having hearings on the Garland nomination last cycle. I supported the Senate having hearings on the Gorsuch nomination this cycle. Decision after decision in the last session went 4-4, which meant we could sustain the underlying Court's decision, but we couldn't decide these important questions that were still a source of confusion across this country. We now have a fully staffed Supreme Court again--the first time since 1881. We have seen a Supreme Court confirmation in the first 100 days of a new administration.  Seventeen, Mr.It has been 17 years since illegal border crossings reached this low level. I am going to come back to that. But what I am saying is that words matter. And what the President has said is: we are going to grow the most robust economy the world has ever seen, but we are going to do it with a legal visa program that makes sure folks are coming and going in accordance with U.law. And simply that change in attitude, Mr.Speaker, simply that change in attitude from ``we are going to ignore the law'' to ``the law matters'' has brought illegal crossings down to a 17-year low.  Mr.Speaker, 728; that is the number of millions of dollars saved with the President's first foray into cutting Federal budgets. His first foray into cutting Federal budgets, he started taking a look at Federal contracts. Can you imagine, Mr.Speaker, what it is like to be a new President of the United States, particularly one that doesn't come out of a legislative or government tradition? Everything is new as it comes to the content, but what is not new is so much of the process.  The President has been looking at contracts his entire life, Mr.The President has been negotiating contracts his entire life. He took a look at the beginnings of the Pentagon contracts and said, by golly, we can do better for the American people; $728 million on project number one saved for the American taxpayer.  That brings us to number 16, Mr.Speaker, and that is 16 years since consumer confidence in this country has been as high as it is today. I enjoy traveling across the district, Mr.Speaker, and I am talking to folks. We are a divided community, like every community is in the country. Some folks believe one thing; some folks believe another. Generally, we are united on issues, but sometimes we are divided on issues. And voter after voter after voter says: Rob, I am not sure what is going to happen, but I feel like we are going to have opportunity. It has been 16 years since consumer confidence has reached this high of a level.  Now, with that increase in confidence, Mr.Speaker, comes an incredible obligation on the 435 of us to deliver. This isn't confidence that is based on nothing happening. This is confidence based on something happening. We have real obligations to fulfill those promises, those commitments that we all made during the last election cycle. I think we have the men and women in this Chamber who can do it, but it has been 16 years since the American people believed that we could.  I want to put those border crossings in perspective, Mr.There has been a 61 percent decline in border crossings in President Trump's first 100 days.  Now, I come from We have got a robust agricultural economy in And I tell my constituents day in and day out, if you are not going to raise your son or daughter to pick carrots in south Georgia; if you don't aspire for your son or daughter to be the very best cabbage picker that we have in the State of Georgia; if you are not aspiring to be part of that agricultural economy and help us get crops out of the field, we are going to need somebody who is aspiring to do that hard work. And it is hard work, Mr. Well, if we can agree that these aren't jobs that American citizens are losing, these are jobs that are adding to the American economy, then we need a legal visa program to let folks come in and to let folks go out. I went on a bipartisan codel, Mr.Speaker--a bipartisan codel, Republicans and Democrats, traveling together to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras talking with families.  You remember the women and children crisis there: unaccompanied minors coming across the border? I talked to family after family, and they said: Rob, listen, I don't want to be an American citizen. I don't want to go to I don't want to be in I am happy here at home. But dad, or my husband, he generally travels to America during the growing season, during the construction season, and turns around and comes back home when that season is over.  Well, you all are getting so tough on your border security, you are not handing out legal visas to do this work, that now my husband or my dad can't come back home when the growing season is over. So now we are all picking up, and we are trying to get into America, too, so the family can stay together.  Well, it makes perfectly good sense to me if you were that family. It makes no sense if you are the American taxpayer. You recognize that you have jobs that need to be filled. You recognize you have skills that you are not training your children to fulfill, and you don't want to change the visa program to make that happen.  The President has committed to growing the economy. We know that is going to mean legal access in and out of the country. There was a 61 percent drop in illegal border crossings in the first 100 days.  I will tell you what else that means, Mr.That means, instead of our border patrol men and women working that border under very difficult conditions, instead of our law enforcement, instead of all of the instruments of homeland security that we have in this country being focused on families crossing the border, with a 61 percent decline in this human traffic crossing the border, law enforcement can now focus on the real security issues to this country: to the drugs crossing the border, to the weapons crossing the border; forbid the thought to weapons of mass destruction crossing the border.  There have been tremendously important accomplishments here in the first 100 days; so much more that we will be able to do together.  Mr.Speaker, there were 25 Iranian entities sanctioned by the Trump administration in the first 100 days. That is what we did together in this You will remember, Mr.Speaker, we passed the Iranian sanctions language in a bipartisan way to send the word to the leaders of Iran that while we have great respect for your citizenry, we cannot tolerate a nuclear We do not trust you to be a member of the league of nations with nuclear capabilities, and the answer is no as you pursue those very dangerous dreams.  Well, you will remember, President Obama negotiated a deal with the international community and with the I wish he hadn't, but he did. We had sanctions. Those sanctions are now gone. Iran is pursuing very much the same path that I would have expected them to pursue, given the deal that was negotiated. And the world continues to be a dangerous place.  Well, we have rules on the books today, laws on the books today that allow the government, in consultation with Congress, in cooperation with Congress, based on statutes passed by Congress, to get involved unilaterally as the United States of America in trying to prevent a nuclear Iran.[[Page H2929]]  There were 25 different entities identified by this administration as helping the Iranian Government to pursue those dangerous and illegal nuclear goals sanctioned and reined in. It is going to make a difference. It is going to make a difference to national security. It is going to make a difference to international security.  Mr.Speaker, $18 billion--you can't see this slide, but already in 4 months on the job, 4 months in cooperation with this Congress, we have seen $18 billion saved through the elimination of red tape. I don't mean $18 billion that is a one-time deal, Mr.I mean $18 billion annually in wasteful compliance costs erased by this administration, again, often in cooperation and consultation with  When I go back and tell you that this President has signed more bills into law than any President since Harry Truman in cooperation with this Congress, I am talking about many of the bills that did exactly this: cutting red tape, saving the American taxpayer money. Those bills, very often, were brought through the Congressional Review Act process. That is a process, as you know, Mr.Speaker, that allows the Congress to take a look at the regulations that the administration promulgates.  We pass the laws; the administration writes the regs; we get to go back and look at the regs to make sure they represent the true intent of the legislation.  Well, in many instances so far this year, Mr.Speaker--in fact, in more instances than any other time in American history, we have decided that those regulations do not reflect the intent of In fact, often they are running directly contrary to the intent of We have eliminated those $18 billion annually in savings to the American taxpayer.  Remember the Keystone pipeline, Mr.This administration approved the Dakota Access pipeline. Think back, Mr.We are going to disagree on things. I am perfectly comfortable with the disagreements that this body has. But when the application for the Keystone pipeline was delivered to the administration, it took longer for the past two administrations to approve the Keystone pipeline--and by approve it, I mean ultimately they rejected it. It took longer for them to consider and reject the Keystone pipeline than it took for Americans to build the Hoover Dam from start to finish.  I want you to think about that. When we are talking about jobs; when we are talking about the economy; when we are talking about America being that beacon of hope, and freedom, and opportunity across the country; when we are talking about the tremendous need for public works projects in this country, and the amazing things the American people can do when they put their shoulder into it, it took longer in the 21st century to get an answer to whether or not you are allowed to build a pipeline than it took to build the Hoover Dam from start to finish. That is bad for all of us.                              {time}  1615  That is bad for every Republican, every Democrat, every Every single American citizen needs economic opportunity. Every single American citizen needs a job. Every single American citizen needs the certainty of knowing if the pipeline is bad, let's cancel it and let's move on. But let's not sit and wait and delay. Let's not debate and debate. Let's get to an answer.  In the first 100 days on the job, President Trump got to an answer. President Bush and President Obama, combined, again, over 8 years of delay. President Trump, first 100 days, approved this.  What does this mean? Well, it means that the oil coming out of Canada is going to come to America to be refined. Remember, the Keystone Pipeline debate, Mr.Speaker, was never about the environment and whether or not the Canadians were going to harvest this oil. It was never about that. The Canadians were loud and clear: We are going to get this oil out of the ground. We are either going to get it out of the ground and send it to America to be processed, or we are going to get it out of the ground and send it to China to be processed. You pick.  Well, Mr.Speaker, that is an easy choice. If I get to be king of Canada, I can make different decisions about their environment. But while Canada has sovereignty and gets to make its own decisions about its natural resources, we get to decide: Are American citizens going to profit from the processing of this oil or is China going to profit from the processing of this oil?  When this oil gets processed, who do you think is doing it in the most environmentally sensitive manner, Mr.Speaker? You tell me. If there's a single colleague in this body that believes the Chinese are better stewards of the environment than the Americans are, then you needed to vote ``no'' on the Keystone pipeline. But if you believe that we care more about Mother Earth than the Chinese do, if you believe that American rules and regulations protect the environment more than Chinese rules and regulations do, then you needed to be a supporter of the Keystone pipeline.  In his first 100 days, President Trump took this source of indecision and confusion and provided certainty. That is not academic, Mr.That certainty is directly connected to jobs.  You can't see it from where you sit, Mr.Speaker, but I am talking about over 500,000 new jobs not connected to the pipeline, individually. There are going to be a lot of jobs on the pipeline. Not this number. I am talking about this approach to governing that says people deserve a ``yes'' or a ``no'' answer. People deserve certainty. People deserve fast responses. People don't need to hang in the lurch.  Every single Member of this body, Mr.Speaker, has seen it in their constituency back home where a small-business owner said: You know what? I wanted to hire a few more people, but I wasn't really sure what was about to happen and so I have been putting it off. I wanted to open a new franchise, but I wasn't entirely sure of what the economic situation was going to be so I have been putting it off.  When we talk about the economic growth over the past 100 days, when we talk about the stock markets moving, when we talk about consumer confidence rising, when we talk about new jobs being created, we are talking about a change in attitude. And I have seen it on both sides of this body.  It is a shame, Mr.Speaker, there is that underlying current that maybe voters reward fighting with each other more than they reward working together. I don't believe it, but I certainly see people posit that theory. I believe folks reward cooperation and getting things done. I don't think people pay us to agree with each other. I think people pay us to make progress together--500,000 new jobs.  I will read from The Wall Street It says: ``The Trump order is a promise in the bank for the voters who elected the President because he promised to focus on jobs and revving up the economy.''  I believe it is 12 congressional districts, Mr.Speaker, that have Democrats representing them in Congress, but those districts voted for President Trump in the Presidential election. These are not conservative men and women out across the district pursuing some sort of ideological agenda. These are hardworking American families who identify more with the Democratic Party and Democratic values but who began to lose hope in what was going on with regulation across the country and job creation across the country, and they cast their vote for President  Over 500,000 new jobs, Mr. What are we talking about? We are talking about the Keystone pipeline. We are talking about the Clean Power Plan, which, alone, threatened to put about 286,000 jobs out to pasture. We are talking about new investments in infrastructure.  I am not just talking about roads and bridges, Mr.I am talking about the FAA and air transportation. I am talking about ports like the Port of Savannah in Georgia, the fastest growing container port in the Nation, and sea transportation. I am talking about railroads. I am talking about water infrastructure to make sure every family has access to clean and healthy drinking water.  These are job-creating proposals, and they are job-creating proposals that have been kept off the books for so long because of regulatory uncertainty.[[Page H2930]]Today we have an opportunity to do that for the very first time.  Mr.Speaker, I am going to take you back to where I began, and that is that we have a choice in this country. We can focus on the things that divide us all day every day. We can do it. I still believe there is more that unites us as a nation than divides us as a nation, but if you choose to spend your time talking about those things that divide us, you can fill up a day.  If you choose to spend your time talking about those things that are broken yet proffering no solutions to fix them, you can fill up a day. If you choose to spend your day talking about why everybody else is a lazy son of a gun and only you have access to the truth, you can fill up a day, and then a week, and then a month, and then a year, and then a Presidential cycle, and then a decade, and then a generation.  But, Mr.Speaker, if you will recognize that working together we have already passed more laws in 2017 than any other Congress and President working together since Harry Truman, if you will recognize that we have taken the uncertainty out of the Supreme Court--we fully staffed the Supreme Court so that uncertainty in the legal arena will exist no longer--if you recognize that a thorny issue like illegal immigration that has been made so difficult to solve because we haven't been able to figure out how to deal with the border security aspect so that we can go on and deal with the other thorny issues, those border crossings are down, which means our opportunity has increased for dealing with these problems that have plagued our Nation for so long.  I can give you one example of that, Mr.I am going to digress.  I have got a family in my district trying to bring a relative into the country from They have been working on it for 11 years--11 years. All the talk that goes on in this body about immigration, nobody is taking about helping my constituents from Nobody is talking about passing a law to make it easier to get your family member in from Nobody is talking about those families that have been separated while trying to follow the law of the land. Nobody is talking about those families that have paid out of pocket to go through the legal process--all the time, all the money, all the delay to do it the right way. Nobody is talking about fixing it for those families.  Let's fix it for those families because we all agree there is a better way. If you want to get your adult child in from Mexico, Mr.Speaker, you needed to file your paperwork in 1993 for their number to be coming up today--1993, to do it the right way and have their number to come up today.  Who believes a 25-year process to bring a family member into this country is the right answer? Of course folks are going to do it the wrong way.  If you want to bring your adult brother or sister in from the Philippines, you had to file in 1994 for their number to be coming up legally today. Who believes that is the right system?  The system is broken. We don't have enough trust together to repair the system. By eliminating the illegal border crossing's immediate challenge, the President has created the headroom for us to work together on issues that we can absolutely solve.  728, Mr.Speaker, the number of millions of dollars saved in contract negotiations thus far--in fact, not even thus far, but contract negotiations on one single Pentagon project that the President has inserted himself in.  For all the things you may think the President knows, doesn't know, you agree with, you disagree with, you have to know that he knows how to drive a hard bargain. You have to know that he knows how to negotiate big contracts.  The American taxpayer is not satisfied with the way we have been doing it, with the way former White Houses have been doing it. We have an opportunity to come together and do it better, and the President is leading us in that way.  And that all culminates, Mr.Speaker, in 16. That is the number of years since consumer confidence in this country was at its current levels. You can do that math if you would like, Mr.It will take you back through an entire 8 years of Democratic control of the White House, and it will take you back through an entire 8 years of Republican control of the White  The American consumer does not care whether you are a Republican or a The American consumer cares whether or not they think their job is secure.  The American consumer does not care if you are a Republican or a The American consumer cares whether prices are higher tomorrow or lower tomorrow.  The American consumer does not care about our petty, silly, inside-the-beltway Washington arguments. They care about whether America is going to be stronger for their children and grandchildren a generation from now. And it has been 16 years since American consumers have the optimism that they have today.  I will say it again, Mr.We can consume every second of every day in this body fussing, griping, complaining--there are lots of things that are wrong and lots of folks to blame for it--or we can recognize the big hopes and dreams that the American people have placed on this President and this Congress and this time in our history. We can recognize that there is still more that unites us in this country than divides us in this country. We can still recognize that folks care very little about us and our families and care so very much about their community and their families.  With that as our touchstone, Mr.Speaker, call me an irrational optimist, but I think there is absolutely nothing that we can't do together, and I look forward to playing a role in that.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-27-pt1-PgH2927-2.txt,2008,UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS DAY,2017.0,27.0,July
1313,topic-id,3546,"Mr.President, before he leaves the floor, I want to commend my colleague from Connecticut for a very thoughtful speech. I think he has made the case that the challenge ahead is really a two-part drill--first, to stop something that is especially ill advised, and second, to then move to a better way that really focuses on sunlight and bipartisanship. So I thank my colleague for his very thoughtful comments.                     Thinking About Senator McCain  Mr.President, I am here to speak about healthcare, but before I turn to that subject, I want to spend a few minutes talking about our wonderful colleague John  Some of the most satisfying moments I have had in public life have been serving with John When I came to the U.Senate--Oregon's first new U.Senator in almost 30 years--I had the honor of being chosen to serve on the Senate Commerce Committee, which was chaired by John And what an exhilarating way to begin serving in the We tackled big, meaty, important issues of the future--the question of multiple and discriminatory taxes on internet commerce. We focused, for example, on Enron and what went wrong there when so many consumers were ripped off. We dug into consumer rights. John McCain was an early advocate for saying that if you rode on an airplane, it didn't mean you ought to sacrifice basic consumer rights, and some of those same issues are getting more attention today.  Then, of course, we built on this floor the Y2K measure. When everybody was so concerned about what would happen at that time, Senator McCain gave me the honor of being his Democratic partner in putting together a bill. We had the benefit of incredible work from the private sector and first responders and smarter Federal policies. We all know that some of the calamitous predictions about Y2K didn't come to pass.  John McCain did some extraordinary work at that time. As a young U.Senator, what a thrill it was to be able to be involved with a real American hero on some of those first experiences I had in the  As we begin to absorb the news of last night, what struck me is that now we are counting on John McCain's legendary strength to give cancer its toughest fight ever--toughest fight ever.  I just wanted to come to the floor today and say we are rooting for you, dear friend. We are rooting for you and Cindy and your wonderful family, and we are thinking about you this afternoon.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, it is my sense that if you thought the TrumpCare debate in the Senate had met its end on Tuesday, it is pretty obvious you ought to be thinking again. The zombie stirs once more.  The latest attempt by the majority to cobble together 50 votes, according to reports, comes down to waving a $200 billion slush fund in front of Senators from States that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care  As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, I am very pleased that the Presiding Officer joined the committee this year. We have studied this one-time slush fund, and the theory, of course, is that it is supposed to be enticing enough for a Senator to vote for a bill that still slashes Medicaid to the bone.  Let's be realistic about what the slush fund represents in the context of[[Page S4104]]the overall plan. Senate Republicans are steering tens of millions of Americans toward a cliff and are offering the world's smallest pillow to break the fall.  Before I go further on the specifics of what the majority has on offer, I want to step back and take a look at what the American people have been subjected to over the course of this debate. The reason I want to do this is that, even by Beltway standards here in Washington, this is the absolute worst of this city.  In the crusade to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the ACA, there has been the AHCA--the House TrumpCare bill. That is the one that earned the big victory ceremony with the President of the United States in the Rose Next, we had the BCRA--the Senate TrumpCare bill. Then, there was a second version of the Then, along came something called the ORRA, the bill I have called ``repeal and ruin,'' which got its start back in 2015. Then, this morning, the public got a look at a third version of the My sense is, if you are having coffee in Coos Bay, OR, or in Roseburg over lunch or something like that, your head is going to be spinning as you hear this news.  I also want to make sure folks know about the strategy that has come out of the White House over the last few days. The President first endorsed the Senate's TrumpCare bill, but then it was repeal only. Then, while the country watched the administration sabotage the Affordable Care Act, the President said that everybody ought to just sit back and watch what happens. Then it was back to calling for the Senate majority to pass  Nobody in this Chamber, with the possible exception of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, can claim to really know what is coming down the pike on American healthcare. So with the health and well-being of hundreds of millions of Americans at stake, this shadowy, garbled, and wretched process really just leaves your jaw on the floor.  Senate Republicans seem to be speeding toward a vote on something. As I mentioned, there is the prospect of this $200 billion slush fund being dangled out there to help round up votes. My sense is that this slush fund is of zero consolation to the millions of Americans who live in States that didn't expand It is of zero consolation to the tens of millions of middle-class families who are going to have their tax cuts or healthcare ripped away and see their premiums skyrocket. It will be of zero consolation to middle-class families who are panicked over whether they are going to be able to take care of elderly parents and grandparents when long-term care through Medicaid is cut.  Make no mistake about what this slush fund really does; it just delays a little bit of the pain for a short time in States that expanded But the slush fund is going to run dry. That is a fact. State budgets are going to get hit like a wrecking ball. That is the reason so many Governors are so unhappy with what is on offer.  There is no escaping the consequences of whatever the Senate passes. If you had objections to TrumpCare or a repeal-only bill yesterday, this doesn't change a thing.  A few hours ago, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office--for folks who don't follow the lingo and CBO, those are our nonpartisan umpires. They put out an analysis of the third version of the Senate Republican healthcare bill. If you were hoping that was the charm, the news doesn't exactly help your cause.  The CBO found that it is still going to send premiums through the roof. The new version is going to kick 22 million Americans off their healthcare. It is still going to make healthcare unaffordable for millions of Americans with preexisting conditions. That is especially troubling to me--and I know the Presiding Officer is very interested in the policy foundations of these big issues. Before the Presiding Officer came to this body, I worked with one of our former colleagues, and we put together what is still the only comprehensive bipartisan health reform--seven Democrats, seven Republicans--that has been introduced in this body. One of the priorities that those Senators--and some of those colleagues on the other side of the aisle are still here; they were cosponsors of this bill, and many of the Democratic sponsors are still here. There was bipartisan agreement that there should be an airtight, loophole-free commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions. As I said, seven Democrats, seven Republicans signed off on that bill. A number of them from both sides still serve in the U.Senate today.  Now what is being discussed is an approach that would make healthcare unaffordable for millions of people with preexisting conditions, really taking a big step back--and I have heard my colleague speak about this, commenting on TV shows and the like--toward the days when healthcare in America was for the healthy and the wealthy. That is what you get if you don't have airtight protections for those with preexisting conditions, if you don't have what we had in our original bill by seven Democrats, seven Republicans--airtight protections, loophole-free protections for those with preexisting conditions. If you don't have it, you are marching back to the days when healthcare was for the healthy and wealthy, where you could not move to another job if you got a great opportunity because you had a preexisting condition. You were immobilized. That is where this is going with the proposal to make healthcare unaffordable for millions of people with preexisting conditions, turning back the clock, moving away from what has strong bipartisan support in this Chamber with Senators on both sides who are still here.  For those who care about the affordability of health coverage, there is a statistic that really leaves you without words. Under the Senate Republican bill, in 2026, a middle-aged American who brings home $26,500 annually will face a deductible of $13,000--$13,000. If you are watching this, remember that figure the next time you hear that the Senate Republican bill lowers costs or puts the patient at the center of care. If this bill becomes law, that individual with a $13,000 deductible is one bad injury or diagnosis away from personal bankruptcy. How does that figure compare to the system on the books today, you might ask? Under the Affordable Care Act, that same individual's deductible is $800.  The other option being put forward by Senate Republican leaders is a repeal-only strategy, and they claim it would have a 2-year transition. But the numbers from the Congressional Budget Office make clear that the idea of a transition after a repeal bill passes is a fantasy.  ``Repeal and run'' means that 17 million Americans lose coverage in the first year; 32 million Americans lose coverage within a decade; premiums in private market plans double. It is easy to see why. My colleague in the Chair, the Presiding Officer, knows so well about the signals that are sent to the private marketplace; we are talking about the marketplace. If you are pouring gasoline on the fires of uncertainty in the private insurance sector and people can't plan and they can't calculate, what will happen during this 2-year transition? You are going to have bedlam in the marketplace. It is a prescription for trouble, and premiums and private market plans will double.  The numbers I am talking about are real lives. I was the director of the Gray Panthers senior citizens group for almost 7 years before I was elected to the This is my background. As I started to see government reports and the like, I came to realize that those reports--all those facts and figures on pieces of paper, long sheets of paper, figure after figure--are not really what this debate is all about. This is a debate about people, about their hopes and aspirations and what they want for the future. Families are worried, for example, about how they are going to pay for the care of an older parent. I think about those seniors I met as director of the Gray They did nothing wrong. They scrimped and saved, and they didn't go on the special vacation. They didn't buy the boat. They did everything right. They educated their kids and tried to sock away a little money. What we know is, growing old in America is expensive. In spite of being careful about costs all their lives, when a spouse needed extra care or they had early onset of healthcare problems, they went through all the money they saved. Then they needed  Medicaid now picks up the costs of two out of three nursing home beds in[[Page S4105]]What is not known is very often seniors need not just that care, but they need home and community-based care. They need a continuum of services so they get the right kind of care at the right time.  They are looking at this bill. They are saying this is going to make my prospects for being able to afford care--whether it is nursing homes, home and community-based services--an awful lot harder to figure out in the days ahead.  We have young people who have been through cancer scares. We have single parents who work multiple jobs to put food on the table. This is what I am hearing about at home. When I had the good fortune of being chosen Oregon's first new Senator in almost 30 years, I made a pledge that I would have an open meeting, open to everybody in every one of my State's counties. We have 36 counties in  This year, so far, I have had 54 open-to-all town meetings. Each one of them lasts 90 minutes. There are no speeches. People say what they want. They ask a question. It is the way the Founding Fathers wanted it to be. They are educating me, and I am trying to respond. I am trying to take back to Washington, DC, which often strikes them as a logic-free zone--I am trying to take their thoughts back to Washington, Frankly, my highest priority has been to find common ground with people of common sense on the Finance Committee, especially in the healthcare area, because long ago I decided if you and your loved ones don't have your health, nothing else really matters.  At those 54 town meetings--they have been in counties where Donald Trump won by large numbers or Hillary Clinton won by large numbers--each one of those meetings has been dominated by the fears of Americans of all walks of life, of all political philosophies worried about what is going to happen to their healthcare.  Frankly, their worry seems to be just as great in rural communities that President Trump won by large majorities because Medicaid expansion in my State has been enormously helpful. So many Oregon communities, under 10,000 in population, have been able to use Medicaid expansion at a hospital to maybe hire another person. It has really been a lifeline. They have an awful lot of people between 55 and 64. They are going to be charged five times as much as young people here, and they are going to get fewer tax credits to deal with it.  In all of these counties--counties won by Donald Trump, counties won by Hillary Clinton--fear about healthcare has been front and center. People are fearful and obviously would like some clarity, some sense of what is coming next.  One of our colleagues whom I do a lot of work with, Senator Thune--a member of the Finance Committee and his party's leadership--spoke to a reporter a little bit ago. He couldn't say what the Senate would take up, if the first procedural vote passes next week, whether it would be TrumpCare or a straight repeal bill.  My sense is, everybody is being asked to walk into this abyss on healthcare but particularly colleagues on the other side of the aisle. To be in the dark about what is on offer a few days before a vote that affects hundreds of millions of Americans, one-sixth of the American economy--for them to be in the dark, someone like myself, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee that has jurisdiction over Medicare and Medicaid and tax credits, strikes me as very odd, even by the standards of the beltway.  The American people are now left guessing about what comes next. The only guarantee, should the first procedural vote succeed, is that both options Senate Republican leaders put on the table are going to raise premiums, make care unaffordable for those with preexisting conditions, and leave tens of millions of Americans without health coverage.  I want to repeat a message that I and other Democratic Senators have been delivering for days. The choice between TrumpCare and straight repeal of the Affordable Care Act is false. Nobody is being forced to choose between calamity and disaster.  Democrats and Republicans absolutely can work together on the healthcare challenges facing the country. As soon as there is a willingness to drop this our-way-or-the-highway approach--this partisan approach known as reconciliation--there will be a good-faith effort on our side to find common ground.  I heard enough of the back-and-forth in this debate to know there is a bipartisan interest; for example, in flexibility for I know the President of the Senate is especially interested in this issue--flexibility for the He has given it a lot of thought. I want him to know I am always open to talking to him about this issue.  In the bill I described earlier--seven Democrats, seven Republicans--we had a special section which became law in the Affordable Care Act that in effect provided for what are called innovation waivers. The theory--and I am sure my colleague in the Chair has been thinking about these issues as well--is based on the idea we both have heard for years, conservatives have said, if those folks in Washington will just give us the freedom, we can find better ways to cover people, hold down the costs, and make what works in Louisiana work for us, and folks in Oregon can pursue what works for folks in  I said, at the time, that every single bill that I would be part of in this debate about fixing American healthcare would have a provision that would respond to this argument that the States are the laboratories of democracy. We would have a provision that would allow considerable flexibility for States to take their own approaches.  I continue to feel very strongly about it. I wrote an entire section of my comprehensive bill to give States flexibility, and fortunately it was included in the Affordable Care There ought to be room to work on these kinds of issues, State flexibility. There ought to be room to work on a bipartisan basis with respect to bringing down prescription drug costs.  I have indicated to the President of the Senate, I think the lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical market has really been a major factor in the reason that our people get hammered by escalating drug prices.  We have heard for so long that some of the middlemen--they are called pharmaceutical benefit managers. They came into being a few years ago. They said: We will negotiate for businesses or States or labor unions. We will negotiate a better deal for the consumer.  Consumers said: Hey, we will see that in our pocketbook. At home we would see that at a pharmacy, at Fred Meyer or Rite Aid or Walgreens or any of our pharmacies. These are all big pharmacies around the country. Right now, as of this afternoon, we don't know what these middlemen put in their pocket and what they put in our pocket.  There ought to be an opportunity to find common ground. I think there ought to be a chance for Democrats and Republicans to work together on approaches like my SPIKE bill, which says that when a big pharmaceutical company wants to drive up the prices, they should have to publicly justify why they are doing so.  There ought to be ways for Democrats and Republicans to work together and bring down prescription drug costs. There certainly is bipartisan interest in getting more competition and more consumers into the insurance markets. That means more predictability and certainty.  My view is, if you are serious about really helping to make the private insurance market robust, you have to stop this crusade to repeal the Insurers are making decisions right now. All eyes are on this body to bring certainty back to the marketplace.  The reality is, there is only a very short time with respect to 2018 premiums. I know there are Republican Senators who would like to tackle challenges on a bipartisan basis. The message my colleagues and I are sending on this side of the aisle is, there are a lot of open arms here. Instead of taking the partisan route and causing devastation in our healthcare system, let's work together to make healthcare better and more affordable for all  I consider that kind of bipartisan cooperation to be the premier challenge of my time in public service, to work with colleagues, common sense, looking for common ground. I have heard one after another of my colleagues on this side of the aisle state that in just the last few days.[[Page S4106]]  Let us set aside this partisan our-way-or-the-highway approach, opt for the alternative, which is more sunshine and more bipartisanship. I will pledge to you everything in my power on the Senate Finance Committee to bring that about.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1370,topic-id,427,"Mr.President, today the Senate will vote on the nomination of Courtney Elwood to be CIA general counsel. This is an important job that got even more important in the past week. As I will explain, this position may play a crucial role in determining whether history is erased or preserved for generations of Americans to come.  As Senators know, last week the current chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee demanded that several key government agencies get rid of their copies of the torture report prepared by Senator Feinstein and her colleagues. I am going to take a few minutes to describe what this has to do with Courtney  In short, it starts with the CIA's history of torture, which was carefully documented and sourced by the Intelligence Committee under Senator Feinstein's leadership. This is the issue that is being debated--the CIA's history of torture. That is why it is critically important that the CIA get back its copy of the report. If Courtney Elwood is confirmed, the decision on whether to do so may be up to her. Here is why: The CIA Director, Mr.Pompeo, who said at his confirmation hearing that he would read the report, has gotten rid of the CIA's copy. He did so despite the fact that the current chair of the Intelligence Committee had no authority to demand that of him. Mr.Pompeo got rid of the report despite a personal promise to read it, and he did this even though it may have violated the law. It certainly violated a fundamental principle important to the American people that in this country, we don't erase history.  Now, this can be fixed. The CIA can get the report back. It can do what Senator Feinstein told the government to do back in 2014, which is to distribute this report, read it, and learn from it. Will Director Pompeo get the report back on his own? There is no reason to think so. But if there is one thing Director Pompeo said again and again in his remarks during the confirmation process, it is that he told the Senate Intelligence Committee repeatedly that he is going to rely on the advice of his lawyers.  That is exactly where Courtney Elwood comes in. What will her advice be to Director Pompeo? What will she advise him about whether to allow this attempt to erase history to stand or whether it is going to get fixed and the report is going to be brought back? The Senate doesn't have any idea this morning. We do know that ",CREC-2017-06-06-pt1-PgS3255-4.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,6.0,July
1604,topic-id,1006,"Mr.Every day, Social Security provides vital benefits to millions of Americans who worked and paid into the system. To ensure workers would receive full access to these fundamental lifeline benefits, for many years, the law protected these earned benefits from attempts to recover debts. However, 20 years ago, Congress suddenly reversed course, and made a change to the law that allowed the government to cut Social Security and other hard-earned benefit payments in order to collect student loan and other federal debts, like home loans owed to the Veterans Administration, and food stamp overpayments. Now, more and more seniors are finding themselves subject to government garnishment of their already modest Social Security benefits in order to recoup student loan debts. In fact, the New York Times published an editorial recently titled, ``Haunted by Student Debt Past Age 50'' that highlighted the worsening struggle that seniors face with student debt.  Student loan debt is becoming an increasingly serious problem in Oregon and across the Nation, with students and their families burdened by crushing student loan debt. Even in the best circumstances, many families will struggle to pay off crippling loans for years to come. However, for people who rely on benefits like Social Security after retirement, disability, or the death of a family member, making payments on student loans or other Federal debts can become an insurmountable hardship.  Because of the lifeline nature of these earned benefits, for more than 40 years the law prevented all creditors from collecting hard-earned Social Security, railroad retirement, and black lung benefits to recoup debts. The only exceptions included unpaid Federal taxes, child support or alimony payments, and court-ordered victim restitution. These protections helped ensure that our social safety net programs were functioning as intended--something I think we can all agree is essential to preserving Social Security and other earned benefits.  Astonishingly, when the law changed as part of a 1996 omnibus budget bill, these changes were never fully debated in This means Members of Congress never had the chance to really explore how this policy would affect beneficiaries. The legislation ultimately included some protections for the most vulnerable, but even those protections have not been updated in 20 years.  We now realize what a profound effect the loss of these protections has had on retirees and individuals with disabilities, who often live on fixed incomes. More and more seniors and people with disabilities are having their Social Security and other lifeline benefits taken away to pay federal debts. For example, according to a GAO report, in 2004, about 8,000 seniors were living in poverty after having their benefits garnished to recover a student debt. In 2015, over 67,000 seniors were subject to garnishment for a student debt and living in poverty. Congress should restore sanity to the system, and reestablish the protections that these beneficiaries deserve.  That is why I, along with Senators Brown, Merkley, Feinstein, Hirono, Schatz, Leahy, Nelson, Whitehouse, Gillibrand, Sanders, and Warren are reintroducing the Protection of Social Security Benefits Restoration The bill would restore the strong protections in the law that prevented the government from taking away earned benefits to pay federal debts, and guarantee beneficiaries will be able to maintain a basic standard of living by receiving the benefits they have earned. The bill is supported by Social Security Works, the Arc of the United States, Latinos for a Secure Retirement, Puget Sound Advocates for Retirement Action, PSARA, AFL-CIO, the Economic Opportunity Institute, the National Organization for Women, Justice in Aging, Gray Panthers NYC, Alliance for Retired Americans, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Global Policy Solutions, AARP, the American Federation of Government Employees, and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of America,  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 959       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
