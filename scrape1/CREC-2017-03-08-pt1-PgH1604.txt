                    INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY STRIKE

  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of International 
Women's Day, A Day Without a Woman strike. Today we are here and are 
joined by many of our sisters around the Nation to declare, once and 
for all, that women's rights are human rights. We are here to stand in 
solidarity with women across the country to send a clear message: We 
will not rest until we create a society where all women--all women--
have equal rights under the law.
  We are resisting and letting President Trump and the Republicans know 
that we will not go back. We stand with the millions around the Nation 
who have walked out today, and today we are walking out for them. We 
are raising our voices for the millions of women who can't because they 
might get fired or because they can't afford to lose their meager 
wages.
  I encourage all of my Democratic colleagues to join us, along with 
Leader Pelosi, the Democratic Women's Working Group, Congresswoman 
Katherine Clark, and so many others, for a walkout following these 1 
minutes and attend the press conference on the House steps right 
outside in solidarity and in honor of all of the women in the world who 
are marching today and striking today for equal rights.
