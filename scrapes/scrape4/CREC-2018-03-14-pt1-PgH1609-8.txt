            By Mr. KING of Iowa:
        H.R. 5283.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
        Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 of the Constitution.
       Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 of the Constitution confers 
     on Congress the authority to make all laws necessary and 
     proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by the 
     Constitution in the government of the United States, or in 
     any department or officer thereof.
       This legislation makes technical amendments to update 
     statutory references to certain provisions classified to 
     titles 7, 20, and 43, United States Code, as necessary to 
     keep the title current and make technical corrections and 
     improvements. Making revisions to the United States Code is a 
     necessary role of Congress with respect to executing the 
     powers vested by the Constitution in the government of the 
     United States.
