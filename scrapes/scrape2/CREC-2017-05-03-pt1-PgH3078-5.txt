                        TERRIBLE HEALTHCARE PLAN

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Republicans in Congress and now President 
Trump are twisting arms and trying to make a deal to get their terrible 
healthcare bill through this House of Representatives.
  It is so interesting to note that they are working really hard to 
make sure they can have a vote, if they can, before Members have to go 
home and speak to the people that they work for.
  Why would that be? Why would they be so fearful of having to go back 
and explain what is happening?
  They would rather go back and say: It is too late. I already voted 
for it. Sorry.
  They do that because they know this is a bad piece of legislation. 
Don't just take it from me. Other Republican Members have said things 
like: This legislation provides health care in name only or it 
torpedoes protections for people with preexisting conditions.
  No one should be fooled by this last-minute ditch effort to put some 
money on the table as if it is enough to provide support for 
preexisting conditions.
  Let's be clear, this change eliminates the guarantee that you can get 
coverage if you have any sort of preexisting condition. We should 
reject it.
