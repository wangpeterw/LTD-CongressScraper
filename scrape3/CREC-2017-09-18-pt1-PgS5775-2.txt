                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Holy and Gracious God, let Your light shine out of darkness into our 
hearts.
  Today, fill our lawmakers with the knowledge of Your purposes, 
providing them with the insights to accomplish Your will. Inspire them 
to humble themselves under Your mighty hand so that You may exalt them 
in due time. Lord, keep them mindful of the great responsibility You 
have placed upon them, and may they trust Your power to do through them 
more than they can ask or imagine. Watch over and guard them and their 
loved ones in their going out and coming in.
  Lord, thank You for the loving care and tender mercies that You 
provide us each day.
  We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.
