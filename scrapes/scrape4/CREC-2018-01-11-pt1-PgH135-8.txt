                    WE NEED TO VOTE ON THE DREAM ACT

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share Fabiola's story and 
continue to demand a vote on the Dream Act.
  Fabiola and her family moved to Oregon when she was just 6 years old. 
When DACA was announced, it gave her the strength to come out of the 
shadows and pursue her goals. She earned a driver's license, took out a 
loan for a car, got a job, and started working towards an associate's 
degree in early childhood education.
  Fabiola currently works as a bilingual preschool teacher for Early 
Head Start and will soon earn her bachelor's degree in early childhood 
education, focused on special education, from Western Oregon 
University.
  DACA has given Fabiola the opportunity to make her dream of becoming 
a special needs teacher a reality. Because leadership in Congress 
refuses to act on DACA, however, she will lose her status, and Fabiola 
will not be allowed to maintain her teaching license.
  Every day, 122 DACA recipients lose their ability to have a job and 
go to school. We don't have until March 15. It is happening now.

  Stop delaying. It is time to get it done. Let's include a clean Dream 
Act in next week's funding package.
