                  2018 NATIONAL PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize 
Dr. Akil Ross, the principal of South Carolina's Chapin High School, as 
the 2018 National Principal of the Year. I appreciated being with Dr. 
Ross, alongside Chapin High School students, family, teachers, staff, 
board members, and community leaders last Friday as they surprised him 
with this fantastic news.
  Dr. Ross works diligently each day to create an environment that 
allows students to rise to their full potential. At Chapin High School, 
he is known for promoting the six Rs, including ready to learn, 
respectful to others, and responsible to ourselves.
  As a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I 
am both grateful and humbled to have such wonderful educators and 
students located in the Second Congressional District.
  It is inspiring to work with leaders in the Second Congressional 
District who are building a great foundation for younger generations of 
South Carolina so they can leave high school ready for fulfilling 
lives.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
