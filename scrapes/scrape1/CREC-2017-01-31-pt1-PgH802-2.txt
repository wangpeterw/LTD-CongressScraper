               STOP THE INTRUSION OF POLITICAL ROBOCALLS

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, every campaign season, like clockwork, 
families are bombarded by an endless stream of political robocalls. 
There is little voters can do to stop the annoyance, which all too 
often comes right in the middle of family dinners and bedtimes, because 
politicians made sure to exempt themselves from the power of the Do Not 
Call Registry.
  That is why I have introduced legislation, H.R. 740, to stop the 
intrusion of political robocalls in homes across America.
  The Robo Calls Off Phones Act, or Robo COP Act, directs the Federal 
Trade Commission to revise its regulations regarding the National Do 
Not Call Registry and prohibit prerecorded campaign messages from being 
sent to telephone numbers on the national registry. It gives the 
American people the opportunity to opt out of these bothersome 
interruptions.
  Removing the exemption for political robocalls is a matter of 
fairness that will help bring some peace and quiet to homes throughout 
the campaign season.
