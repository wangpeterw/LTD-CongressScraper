  (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1

minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise President Trump and 
my Republican colleagues in the House and Senate for coming together to 
develop the first major tax reform plan that our Nation has seen since 
1986.
  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we are considering is going to deliver real 
tax relief to middle class families and small businesses.
  However, there is more work to be done. Here in the U.S., we don't 
settle for good enough. Congress can make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
even better for the American people by including a repeal of 
ObamaCare's individual mandate.
  No American should ever be forced to purchase something that they 
don't want. That is not freedom. That is not the American way. For 3 
years now, Federal Government bureaucrats have forced Americans to 
purchase insurance they can't afford and don't want.
  Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to repeal ObamaCare's individual 
forced mandate.
