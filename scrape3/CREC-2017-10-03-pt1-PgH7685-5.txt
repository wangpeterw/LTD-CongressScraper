   SENDING CONDOLENCES TO NEVADAN FAMILIES AND VICTIMS OF LAS VEGAS 
                                SHOOTING

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, the resilience of Nevadans, 
brave and caring, is in sharp contrast to the murdering of innocent 
victims we just witnessed.
  Our hearts go out to the families of the victims throughout our 
country who were only interested in a peaceful and joyful evening.
  One of those was Jennifer Irvine, a young San Diego lawyer who was 
killed in the attack. Let's also recognize the heroes, like Tyler 
Winston, a San Diegan who saved dozens of victims at the concert by 
driving a makeshift ambulance and taking people to the hospital. Every 
single life lost to gun violence should elicit sorrow and action.
  Mr. Speaker, then why is it so hard for us to talk about this? Why 
can't we come together in a bipartisan, bicameral way? Where is the 
concern?
  We have had too many moments of silence in this Chamber for mass 
shootings.
  Why are we not moved when people are dying in our districts daily?
  The American people send condolences and they deserve action.
