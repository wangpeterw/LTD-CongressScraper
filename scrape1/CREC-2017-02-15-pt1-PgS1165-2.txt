                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, who is the strength of our lives, let us live to tell of Your 
wondrous work. How magnificent are Your acts, O Lord. How deep are all 
Your thoughts.
  Bless our lawmakers. Empower them to endure the challenges of these 
times. Give them a humility that will make them willing to decrease, so 
that Your Spirit may increase in their lives. Lord, renew their minds 
with truth and sharpen their skills in each important area of living. 
Bless the members of their staffs, who labor so faithfully for 
freedom's cause.
  We pray in Your sovereign Name. Amen.
