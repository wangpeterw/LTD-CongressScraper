                             WORLD AIDS DAY

  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate World AIDS Day. The 
theme this year is Increasing Impact Through Transparency, 
Accountability, and Partnerships.
  First, I would like to thank Leader Pelosi for her steadfast 
commitment to fighting HIV and AIDS and for guaranteeing strong United 
States leadership in this area.
  As the cofounder and co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional HIV/
AIDS Caucus with my good friend, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, we 
have seen significant progress that we have made in the global fight 
against HIV.
  Year after year, Congress has come together in a bipartisan way to 
stop the spread of this disease. From PEPFAR and the Global Fund to 
fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria--which I was very proud to help 
write--to the Ryan White CARE Act and the Minority AIDS Initiative, the 
United States has been a global leader in committing the critical 
resources needed to end this disease both here at home and abroad.
  Partly due to our efforts, over 20 million people around the world 
have access to lifesaving antiretroviral treatment. Twenty million 
people getting lifesaving medicine is more than the population of the 
State of New York. So in memory of those who died much too soon, let's 
recommit ourselves to ending AIDS by 2030 and realizing an AIDS-free 
generation.
