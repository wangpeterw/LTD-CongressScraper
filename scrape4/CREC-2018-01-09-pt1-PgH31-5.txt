                         CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL

  (Mr. BEYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to claim that climate change is 
real, that it is manmade, and that we have a responsibility to act 
bravely and constructively to minimize the damage it does to humanity 
and to the fauna and flora of our planet.
  The reality of our warming atmosphere, oceans, and continents has 
been established in thousands of peer-reviewed articles. This is 
scientific fact accepted by the governments of peoples of almost every 
nation in the world.
  But science is always evolving, and scientists continue to work 
diligently to discover the facts, the processes, and the implications 
for all of us. Mostly, what we learn is sad and destructive.
  Last Thursday, the peer-reviewed academic journal Science published a 
new study that concludes the frequency of coral bleaching has increased 
so much that reefs cannot recover between severe episodes.
  We need to focus on just the facts of climate change and then be wise 
enough and bold enough to act. Every Member of Congress must bear the 
burden of this responsibility.
