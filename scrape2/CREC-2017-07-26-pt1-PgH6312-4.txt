                  CONGRATULATING JACK AND MARIANNE COX

  (Mr. McCLINTOCK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Jack and Marianne 
Cox on the occasion of their upcoming golden wedding anniversary.
  Jack served for many years as chief of staff for Congressman Barry 
Goldwater, Jr. In fact, I first met him in that capacity when I was 
still in high school. I have done quite a bit of aging since then. Jack 
and Marianne have not, which I find annoying, but there it is.
  Jack was the quintessential congressional chief of staff. He was 
always one step behind Barry, whispering names in his ear as he went 
from handshake to handshake.
  Jack was also one of the moving forces behind the creation of the 
Republican Study Committee.
  Somehow he also found time to marry and raise a family in those 
years. And, even more surprisingly, Marianne put up with it.
  Jack and Marianne have sort of retired to the town of Copperopolis, 
and I extend to them heartiest congratulations on the celebration of 
this family milestone.
