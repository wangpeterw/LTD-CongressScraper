                            MINERS' PENSION

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. TheChair recognizes the gentleman from West 
Virginia (Mr. Jenkins) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. JENKINSof West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, in this new year, we must 
make things right for our miners and their widows. We must act now 
tokeep the promise. We must honor their work in the mines by protecting 
the pensions and healthcare benefits they worked theirwhole lives to 
earn.
  We must pass legislation I have cosponsored to protect these hard-
earnedbenefits for families like Rita Blankenship of McDowell County 
who wrote me asking for help. Here is what she said: ``My husbandwas 
promised healthcare coverage in 1975 when he went to work in the mines 
and joined the union. I am asking if you could doeverything possible to 
get this passed so we will have health care,'' she wrote.
  These miners and their families deserve noless than what they worked 
their entire lives to earn: the peace of mind that comes with a pension 
and secure health care.
  Iurge my colleagues to join me in supporting legislation to protect 
our miners, their widows, and their families. We owe it tothem to keep 
our word.
