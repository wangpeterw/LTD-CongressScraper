                            REJECT TRUMPCARE

  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, our first duty here is to the American 
people. I rise to call on my colleagues to fulfill that duty and reject 
TrumpCare.
  President Trump made big promises on health care during his campaign. 
TrumpCare proves those promises were empty. He promised a plan that 
would cover everyone. TrumpCare would cover even fewer people than were 
covered before the Affordable Care Act.
  He promised better coverage. TrumpCare guts basic healthcare 
standards. Many TrumpCare plans won't be worth the paper they are 
printed on.
  He promised cheaper coverage. TrumpCare breaks that promise, driving 
up premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs for everyone. It also 
hits our Nation's seniors with a devastating age tax or perhaps a 
senior tax that will literally price many seniors out of the healthcare 
market.
  Mr. Speaker, TrumpCare is a tax break for millionaires parading as a 
healthcare plan. It will do unimaginable harm to our rural hospitals 
and our economy. The bill was written in secret. It was rushed through 
this Chamber. And it represents a big-time broken promise. I urge my 
colleagues to reject TrumpCare.
