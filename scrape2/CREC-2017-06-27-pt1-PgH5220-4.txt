                 RECOGNIZING CONGREGATION MICKVE ISRAEL

  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Congregation Mickve Israel in Savannah, Georgia, as it celebrates its 
incredible 284th anniversary on July 11, 2017.

Israel has withstood the test of time. It continues to be a beacon for 
the faithful and now welcomes 380 families inside its walls.

importance to the Jewish community.
  I would also like to acknowledge the congregation's importance and 
congratulate Congregation Mickve Israel in reaching this impressive 
milestone. I know this religious community will continue to serve a 
caring, faithful, and integral role in Savannah, Georgia.
