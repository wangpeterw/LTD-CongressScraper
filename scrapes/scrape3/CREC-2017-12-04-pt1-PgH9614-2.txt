           CONGRATULATING JOE LUTHER, CTE TEACHER OF THE YEAR

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate an instructor at Central Pennsylvania Institute of Science 
and Technology for being named the national technical education teacher 
of the year.
  CPI's horticulture and landscaping instructor, Joe Luther, will be 
given the Carl J. Schaefer Memorial Award, which is presented annually 
to recognize career technical education teachers for their outstanding 
service. Mr. Luther will accept the award this Thursday at a ceremony 
in Nashville, Tennessee.
  The award is presented by NOCTI, which is the largest provider of 
industry-based credentials and partner industry certifications for 
career and technical education programs across the Nation. It was named 
for Dr. Carl J. Schaefer, who was a lifelong champion of CTE. He gained 
national recognition as a CTE educator and author and was one of 
NOCTI's founding fathers.
  This is the second time an instructor at CPI has received the award. 
In 2015, dental assistant instructor Mindi Tobias was selected as a top 
CTE teacher in the Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the House Career and Technical Education 
Caucus, I am most proud of CPI and Mr. Luther for this outstanding 
recognition.
