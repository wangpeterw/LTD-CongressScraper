                           KENTUCKY FLOODING

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the last week, heavy rains and 
strong winds caused widespread destruction-across Kentucky. Sustained 
rainfall has led to devastating flooding in many communities, 
especially along the Ohio River.
  The high waters have closed dozens of roads, and some areas are 
reporting dangerous mudslides. The extent of this flooding hasn't been 
seen in my State since the 1997 flood.
  In addition, the National Weather Service has confirmed that three 
tornadoes touched down in western Kentucky. The entire Commonwealth is 
under a state of emergency because of the damage caused by this severe 
weather.
  I was saddened to hear reports this morning that these destructive 
storms have claimed the lives of three Kentuckians. Many are still 
struggling to stay safe.
  As they always do, Kentucky's emergency personnel responded quickly 
and professionally to the storms and the aftermath. Rescuing many 
individuals from their homes or their cars, these dedicated men and 
women continue to do everything they can to protect Kentuckians in 
need. They have our sincere gratitude.
  Although the sky has cleared, there is more rain in the forecast for 
this week.
  My staff in the State and I will continue to monitor this situation 
as it develops throughout Kentucky.
