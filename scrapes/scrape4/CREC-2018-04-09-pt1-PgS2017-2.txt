  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the 
Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday, 
April 10; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning 
hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, 
the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the

leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume 
consideration of the Boom nomination under the previous order. Finally, 
I ask that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow
