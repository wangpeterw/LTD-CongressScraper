                TAMPA BAY AREA COMBATS HUMAN TRAFFICKING

  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, in light of the important anti-human 
trafficking legislation passed by the House, I want to recognize 
efforts in the Tampa Bay area to combat human trafficking.
  I am especially proud of the joint task force formed by Pasco County 
Sheriff's Office Corporal Alan Wilkett, BayCare's Liana Dean, and many 
others. Their work brings us closer to a community that is safer for 
our most vulnerable citizens.
  Human trafficking is not a distant problem for other countries. It is 
a human rights crisis happening right here at home. Last year, Florida 
reported 550 human trafficking cases. That is the third largest number 
of cases in the country. It is unacceptable.
  We passed three bipartisan bills to strengthen detection systems, 
improve education efforts, and protect victims. We have got to pass 
them in the Senate as well and have it become law.
  The fight against human trafficking is a fight for the safety and 
security of our communities.
