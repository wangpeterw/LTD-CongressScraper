                     TRIBUTE TO DR. BENJAMIN TUGGLE

  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Dr. Benjamin 
Tuggle who served as the regional director for the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service's southwest region. A skilled communicator and 
accomplished biologist, Dr. Tuggle dedicated more than 38 years of 
service to advancing the mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
  I had the opportunity to work directly with Dr. Tuggle on a number of 
issues important to Arizona, including restoring the Willow Beach 
National Fish Hatchery, which is a key economic asset for Lower 
Colorado River communities. We may not have always agreed on agency 
policies, but Dr. Tuggle maintained an open dialogue and willingness to 
engage directly with local communities.
  The challenges faced by the service and Region 2 are daunting. Our 
unique southwest landscape and wildlife are under constant threat from 
oppressive drought and catastrophic wildfire. Dr. Tuggle was rarely 
presented with easy decisions to make, but he always labored to strike 
the right balance between competing interests on complex issues. I 
thank him for his service.
