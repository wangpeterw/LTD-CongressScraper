                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS

  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:

       POM-68. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of 
     the State of Nevada urging the United States Congress not to 
     repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or its 
     most important provisions; to the Committee on Finance.

                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 9

       Whereas, In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable 
     Care Act (Public Law 111-148), commonly known as the 
     Affordable Care Act, was passed by Congress and signed into 
     law by President Barack Obama; and
       Whereas, The Affordable Care Act established a 
     comprehensive series of health insurance reforms designed to 
     make universal, affordable health insurance coverage 
     available to all Americans, while also controlling rising 
     health care costs and ending certain common industry 
     practices that limited access to health insurance coverage; 
     and
       Whereas, The Affordable Care Act expanded access to health 
     insurance coverage by creating health insurance marketplaces, 
     allowing children to stay on a parent's health insurance plan 
     until the age of 26 years, expanding Medicaid and 
     establishing a system of tax credits and penalties designed 
     to both encourage consumers to purchase individual health 
     insurance coverage and provide incentives to businesses to 
     encourage them to provide health insurance coverage to 
     employees; and
       Whereas, The Affordable Care Act prohibits an insurer from 
     denying health insurance coverage to a person on the basis of 
     a preexisting condition, prohibits an insurer from rescinding 
     coverage, eliminates lifetime and annual limits on coverage, 
     requires all marketplace plans to provide coverage for 10 
     essential health benefits, including preventative care, 
     establishes a mechanism for consumers to appeal 
     determinations regarding coverage and establishes a system to 
     assist consumers in navigating the health insurance 
     marketplace; and
       Whereas, The Affordable Care Act additionally provides 
     incentives to expand the number of primary health care 
     providers and encourages them to serve in medically 
     underserved areas, promotes alternative payment methodologies 
     designed to improve the value of care and encourages patients 
     to use community-based resources and other services intended 
     to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and inappropriate 
     emergency department use; and
       Whereas, The Affordable Care Act further mandates health 
     insurance coverage for colorectal cancer screening tests for 
     persons who are between 50 and 75 years of age, mammograms 
     annually for women who are over 40 years of age, and regular 
     screenings of women for cervical cancer and the human 
     papillomavirus vaccine to prevent cervical cancer: and
       Whereas, The Affordable Care Act mandates health insurance 
     coverage for immunization vaccines for children, including, 
     without limitation, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, 
     influenza, measles and rotavirus; and
       Whereas, The Affordable Care Act includes many other 
     benefits and protections to ensure access to health care by 
     all; and
       Whereas, A number of national leaders have proposed 
     repealing the Affordable Care Act during the 115th Congress 
     without a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act which 
     adequately protects the thousands of Nevadans who benefit 
     from or may not have access to health insurance coverage 
     without the Act; and
       Whereas, Repealing the Affordable Care Act without 
     establishing mechanisms to preserve the significant 
     improvements and protections afforded by the law, and without 
     adequately providing for those who stand to lose their health 
     insurance coverage upon repeal, will have significant 
     detrimental effects on individuals and their families, on the 
     health care industry in general and on the overall economic 
     well-being of both Nevada and the nation as a whole: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada 
     Jointly, That the members of the 79th Session of the Nevada 
     Legislature hereby urge Congress to fully preserve the 
     critical benefits afforded by the Affordable Care Act which 
     many Nevadans have come to rely upon; and be it further
       Resolved, That Congress should not repeal the Affordable 
     Care Act so that these essential programs remain available to 
     future generations of Nevadans; and be it further
       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and 
     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of 
     the United States, as the presiding officer of the United 
     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of 
     Representatives and each member of the Nevada Congressional 
     Delegation; and be it further
       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon 
     passage.
                                  ____

       POM-69. A resolution adopted by the House of 
     Representatives of the State of Michigan supporting and 
     encouraging the International Criminal Court to conduct an 
     independent investigation into the human rights violations 
     allegedly occurring in the Chechen Republic of Russia; to the 
     Committee on Foreign Relations.

                        House Resolution No. 79

       Whereas, A formal complaint has been filed with the 
     International Criminal Court alleging horrific harms 
     inflicted on gay men in the Chechen Republic of Russia. The 
     complaint cites abuses stemming from both governmental 
     actions as well as so-called ``honor killings'' by members of 
     the men's own families; and
       Whereas, The Chechen Republic of Russia has denied that any 
     abuses have occurred, and have further denied that gay men 
     exist within the Chechen Republic. Russia has begun an 
     internal investigation into the alleged abuses; and
       Whereas, Every human being has the right to life and to be 
     free from bodily integrity abuses by their government. These 
     basic human rights include the right to be free from torture 
     and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment; and
       Whereas, The International Criminal Court should not stand 
     idly by if severe violations of basic human rights have in 
     fact occurred against residents of one of its member nations. 
     The International Criminal Court has the authority to open an 
     official investigation into the alleged violations occurring 
     in the Chechen Republic of Russia: Now, therefore, be it

[[Page S4112]]

       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we support 
     and encourage the International Criminal Court io conduct an 
     independent investigation into the human rights violations 
     allegedly occurring in the Chechen Republic of Russia; and be 
     it further
       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to 
     the President of the International Criminal Court, the 
     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the 
     United States House of Representatives, and the members of 
     the Michigan congressional delegation.
                                  ____

        POM-70. A resolution adopted by the House of 
     Representatives of the State of Colorado relative to ensuring 
     access to reproductive care; to the Committee on Health, 
     Education, Labor, and Pensions.

                        House Resolution 17-1005

       Whereas, Colorado has always been committed to a quality 
     health care system and to creating policies that meet the 
     health needs of women and families, including affordable 
     reproductive health services; and
       Whereas, Colorado was the first state to allow safe, legal 
     abortion on a bipartisan basis in 1967; and
       Whereas, The American College of Obstetricians and 
     Gynecologists has stated that ``[s]afe, legal abortion is a 
     necessary component of women's health care'', and health 
     providers and associations affirm that good access to 
     reproductive health care deeply and positively impacts 
     women's lives and futures; and
       Whereas, Reproductive health care is both safe and common. 
     More than 90% of women have used contraception, about three 
     in ten women will have an abortion in her lifetime, and more 
     than half of women will have a child at some point in their 
     lives.
       Whereas, People may disagree with the decision to seek an 
     abortion, but it is a decision that each person should make 
     for themselves with the counsel of their health providers, 
     their families, and their faiths; and
       Whereas, Rates of maternal mortality are decreasing around 
     the world, but increasing in the United States for women of 
     color who face an alarming and disparate rate of pregnancy 
     complications and maternal mortality; and
       Whereas, Restrictions on the availability of reproductive 
     health care and limits on health coverage, such as policies 
     denying insurance coverage for reproductive health services, 
     have a disparate impact on low-income women and women of 
     color and their families; and
       Whereas, Obstacles to obtaining the best method of 
     contraception for each person's unique health and life 
     circumstances remain a barrier to many; and
       Whereas, Low-income women and women of color face a higher 
     rate of unintended pregnancy, so ensuring access to 
     contraception is a critical part of helping to address health 
     disparities in marginalized communities; and
       Whereas, An inability or difficulty to conceive is not only 
     emotionally difficult for people looking to start a family 
     but can be prohibitively expensive, so we must do more to 
     help people seeking to build their families, regardless of 
     sexual orientation or gender identity; and
       Whereas, There is a continued need to address inequities in 
     health care access and ensure culturally and linguistically 
     appropriate training of health providers: Now, therefore, be 
     it
       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Seventy-
     first General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
       That we, the members of the Colorado House of 
     Representatives, find that:
       (1) Colorado continues to be a state where all individuals' 
     health remains a top priority, and Coloradans resist attempts 
     to undermine the right to access reproductive health care;
       (2) Access to comprehensive and affordable reproductive 
     health care is critical to ensure that people have the 
     information and services to prevent unintended pregnancies, 
     the support to have healthy pregnancies and become parents 
     when they are ready, and the ability to raise their children 
     in a safe and healthy environment and to be able to care for 
     their families with dignity;
       (3) State, county, and city health departments shall 
     promote policies to ensure access to a full range of 
     reproductive health care, including abortion, and eliminate 
     disparities that prevent low-income women and women of color 
     from seeking safe, high-quality care;
       (4) Both public and private health insurance should cover 
     the full range of reproductive health care, including 
     abortion;
       (5) Facilities and professionals providing reproductive 
     health services shall not be subjected to regulations that do 
     not have a medical benefit and that are more burdensome than 
     those imposed on other facilities or health care 
     professionals that provide medically comparable procedures. 
     Provision of services should be based on the best medical 
     practices as developed by medical experts and supported by 
     medical evidence.
       (6) All qualified health care professionals shall be able 
     to provide the full range of reproductive health care, 
     including abortion, and have access to appropriate medical 
     training; and be it further
       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution be sent to 
     President Donald J. Trump; Vice President Mike Pence; Paul 
     Ryan, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives; 
     Orrin Hatch, President Pro Tempore of the United States 
     Senate; Governor John W. Hickenlooper; Dr. Larry Wolk, 
     Executive Director, Colorado Department of Public Health and 
     Environment; and the members of Colorado's Congressional 
     Delegation.
                                  ____

       POM-71. A resolution adopted by the House of 
     Representatives of the State of Colorado relative to 
     recognizing the importance of Colorado libraries; to the 
     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.

                        House Resolution 17-1008

       Whereas, Colorado libraries are a vital and essential 
     public resource that provide free and equal access to 
     educational and recreational material and enrich the lives of 
     all citizens; and
       Whereas, Libraries play a critical role in democracy and 
     community development by promoting civil discourse and 
     empowering citizens to learn, imagine, and succeed; and
       Whereas, Libraries across Colorado lead the way in 
     developing new and innovative ways of meeting the needs of 
     and uniting the state's increasingly diverse population; and
       Whereas, Colorado receives $2.7 million annually from the 
     federal Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) for 
     library services and technology, which is roughly two-thirds 
     of the State Library's total operational costs; and
       Whereas, The IMLS is the main funding source for more than 
     40 different Colorado library services and programs, yet 
     costs less than 49 cents per resident; and
       Whereas, One such program is the Check Out Colorado State 
     Parks program, now in its second year. The program allows 
     each library to offer two Colorado state park passes and 
     activity backpacks to library patrons. The program was used 
     almost 4,000 times total, or more than 165 times a week in 
     the first six months; and
       Whereas, Early learning programs, such as One Book 4 
     Colorado, which gives away 75,000 books each year to 4-year-
     olds statewide; Storyblocks.org, an online tool to help 
     parents learn how to reinforce early learning skills; and the 
     statewide Summer Reading Program that encourages children, 
     teens, and adults to read and learn for fun, are all funded 
     through the IMLS; and
       Whereas, The IMLS funds support professional development 
     programs like the Career Online High School, which, when 
     launched this month, will help more than 200 adults in 17 
     libraries across the state earn high school diplomas and 
     career experience, and the Highly Effective School Library 
     program, which helps schools provide tools for students to 
     develop 21st century skills and meet academic standards; and
       Whereas, Essential library programs and services, such as 
     the Colorado Talking Book Library, Colorado's historic 
     newspaper collection, the state's institutional libraries, 
     state publications, and many others all receive funding 
     support through the IMLS; and
       Whereas, This vital funding from the IMLS allows every 
     Coloradan to have access to these programs and ensures that 
     Colorado's rich diversity and culture is represented by 
     libraries across the state, including the Blair-Caldwell 
     African American Research Library in Denver's historic Five 
     Points neighborhood that is devoted to preserving and 
     showcasing the many contributions of African Americans to 
     Colorado and the West and is one of only five library 
     institutions in the nation that encompasses a circulating 
     collection, archive, and museum; and the Rodolfo ``Corky'' 
     Gonzalez Branch Library, designed specifically to celebrate 
     the diverse and culturally rich community of West Denver; and 
     be it
       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Seventy-
     first General Assembly of the State of Colorado:
       That we, the members of the Colorado House of 
     Representatives:
       (1) Declare our support and appreciation for Colorado 
     libraries and staff; and
       (2) Recognize that the invaluable public services and 
     programs provided by Colorado libraries and staff cannot be 
     sustained without the funding support of the federal 
     Institute of Museum and Library Services; and be it further
       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution be sent to Donald 
     Trump, President of the United States; Mike Pence, Vice 
     President of the United States; John Hickenlooper, Governor 
     of Colorado; the Colorado Association of Libraries; the 
     Colorado Department of Education; and the members of 
     Colorado's Congressional delegation.
                                  ____

       POM-72. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature 
     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States 
     Congress to pass the Trickett Wendler Right to Try Act of 
     2017; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and 
     Pensions.

                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 18

       Whereas, state legislatures across the United States have 
     passed measures known as ``Right to Try'' laws authorizing 
     access by terminally ill patients to investigational drugs 
     and other potentially life-saving methods of treatment; and
       Whereas, as of the date of filing of this Resolution, at 
     least thirty-three U.S. states, including Louisiana, have 
     established a Right to Try law; and
       Whereas, Louisiana's Right to Try law, enacted through 
     House Bill No. 891 (Act No. 346) of the 2014 Regular Session, 
     sets forth the following legislative findings:
       (1) The process of approval for investigational drugs, 
     biological products, and devices in the United States often 
     takes many years.

[[Page S4113]]

       (2) A terminally ill patient does not have the luxury of 
     waiting for an investigational drug, product, or device to 
     receive final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug 
     Administration (FDA); and
       Whereas, this law (R.S. 40:1169.1 et seq.) provides that, 
     subject to certain conditions, terminally ill patients in 
     Louisiana are authorized to use drugs, biological products, 
     and devices that have successfully completed phase one of an 
     FDA-approved clinical trial but which remain under 
     investigation in the clinical trial process and have not yet 
     been approved by the FDA for general use; and
       Whereas, the Trickett Wendler Right to Try Act of 2017 has 
     been introduced in the One Hundred Fifteenth United States 
     Congress as S. 204 and would codify in federal law the 
     essential provisions of the Right to Try laws of Louisiana 
     and other states; and
       Whereas, a key function of this legislation is to bar the 
     federal government from prohibiting or restricting the 
     production, manufacture, distribution, prescribing, or 
     dispensing of an experimental drug, biological product, or 
     device that is intended to treat a terminally ill patient and 
     is authorized by and in accordance with state law; and
       Whereas, the Trickett Wendler Right to Try Act of 2017 and 
     the Right to Try law of Louisiana affirm the fundamental 
     right of a patient with a terminal illness to attempt to 
     preserve his own life by accessing available investigational 
     drugs, biological products, and devices; and that the 
     decision to pursue such a course of treatment is one that 
     rightfully should be made by a terminally ill patient in 
     consultation with his physician, and not by the government: 
     Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby 
     memorialize the United States Congress to pass the Trickett 
     Wendler Right to Try Act of 2017; and be it further
       Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to 
     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of 
     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of 
     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional 
     delegation.
                                  ____

       POM-43. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly 
     of the State of Colorado designating April 2017 as ``Second 
     Chance Month''; to the Committee on the Judiciary.

                     House Joint Resolution 17-1026

       Whereas, Every person is endowed with human dignity; and
       Whereas, Redemption and second chances are American values; 
     and
       Whereas, An estimated 65 million American citizens have a 
     criminal record; and
       Whereas, Eighty-six thousand people are currently 
     incarcerated or under the supervision of the Colorado 
     Department of Corrections, and data shows that approximately 
     95 percent of those in state prison will be released to their 
     communities; and
       Whereas, Individuals with a criminal record often face a 
     ``second prison'' of significant barriers, also known as 
     collateral consequences; and
       Whereas, Many of these collateral consequences fail to 
     provide any proven public safety benefit, are mandatory, and 
     take effect automatically, regardless of the seriousness of 
     the offense, the time passed since the offense, or the 
     individual's efforts to make amends and earn back the 
     public's trust; and
       Whereas, The inability to find gainful employment and other 
     collateral consequences of conviction inhibit the economic 
     mobility of people with a criminal history, which negatively 
     impacts the well-being of their children and families for 
     generations; and
       Whereas, Collateral consequences contribute to recidivism, 
     increase victimization, decrease public safety, and result in 
     lost economic output for Colorado and the United States; and
       Whereas, BKB Limited, BornFit, Denver Scrap Metal 
     Recycling, Hallucination Sports, H.E.A.T. Inc., Lifted From 
     The Rut, the Hornbuckle Foundation, Prison Fellowship, Second 
     Chances Denver, The Shores Treatment & Recovery, TRIBE 
     Recovery Services, and Youth for Christ sponsored the annual 
     Second Chances 5k on Saturday, April 8, 2017, in Denver, 
     Colorado, in order to raise awareness of the obstacles that 
     people with a criminal record face and to provide 
     opportunities for members of the community to run or walk in 
     honor of second chances; and
       Whereas, April 21, 2012, is the anniversary of the death of 
     Charles Colson, who used his second chance following his 
     incarceration for a Watergate-related crime to found Prison 
     Fellowship, the nation's largest Christian nonprofit serving 
     prisoners and their families; and
       Whereas, The designation of April as ``Second Chance 
     Month'' can increase public awareness about the need for 
     closure for those with a criminal record and about 
     opportunities to provide second chances: Now, therefore, be 
     it
       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Seventy-
     first General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate 
     concurring herein:
       That we, the members of the Colorado General Assembly:
       (1) Designate April 2017 as ``Second Chance Month'';
       (2) Honor the work of communities, governmental 
     institutions, nonprofits, congregations, employers, and 
     individuals in removing unnecessary legal and societal 
     barriers that prevent individuals with a criminal record from 
     becoming productive members of society; and
       (3) Call upon the people of Colorado to observe ``Second 
     Chance Month'' through actions and programs that promote 
     awareness of the ``second prison'' and provide second chances 
     for those who have paid their debt; and be it further
       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Resolution be sent to 
     Donald Trump, President of the United States; Mike Pence, 
     Vice President of the United States; Jeff Sessions, Attorney 
     General of the United States; John Hickenlooper, Governor of 
     Colorado; Donna Lynne, Lieutenant Governor of Colorado; Rick 
     Raemisch, Executive Director of the Colorado Department of

       POM-74. A resolution adopted by the House of 
     Representatives of the State of Colorado concerning the 
     commemoration of the birthday of the Reverend Dr. Martin 
     Luther King, Jr.; to the Committee on the Judiciary.

                        House Resolution 17-1004

       Whereas, The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was born 
     in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929, graduated from 
     Morehouse College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1948, 
     graduated from Crozer Theological Seminary in 1951, and 
     received a Ph.D. from Boston University in 1955; and
       Whereas, Rev. Dr. King's faith, resiliency, and commitment 
     to justice became known worldwide through his speeches, 
     writings, and actions; and
       Whereas, Rev. Dr. King declared that the moral 
     responsibility to aid the oppressed did not stop at the edge 
     of his street, town, or state when he wrote, ``I cannot sit 
     idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in
