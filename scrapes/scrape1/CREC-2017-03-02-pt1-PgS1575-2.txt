                     TRIBUTE TO CHARLES EDWARD GRAY

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize 17-year-
old Charles Edward Gray for his service to his community. Charles is a 
member of the Montana Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 
214, out of Helena, MT.
  On November 16, 2016, Charles was awarded the rank of Eagle Scout at 
his Eagle board review. Charles' Eagle Scout Service Project involved 
the planning, building, and installation of three wheelchair ramps at 
the YMCA Camp Child where children and families grow, learn new skills, 
and have fun in Montana's outdoors. He made the ramps out of treated 
lumber and composite planks and installed them at the camp's main lodge 
and in the girls' and boys' respective shower houses. The installation 
of these ramps will provide access to those with disabilities for many 
years to come, making Camp Child a more inclusive place.
  Charles is a shining example of what it means to be a local servant 
leader and is using his skills to better his own community. Charles, 
thank you for rising to the challenge of serving Montana. I look 
forward to seeing what great things await your future.
