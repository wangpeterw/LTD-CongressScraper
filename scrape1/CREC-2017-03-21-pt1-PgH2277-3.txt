              TAKING THE INNOCENCE OF A CHILD IS SHAMEFUL

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a 14-year-old girl last week was 
kidnapped off the streets of Houston, Texas. After being held against 
her will for 5 days, she was taken to a motel, where she met a person 
named Denise Coronado.
  But Coronado was no friend. Instead, she threatened the girl. 
Coronado ground cigarettes into the girl's body. She threatened 
everyone that the child loved. She published photographs of the girl on 
backpage.com, selling her on the marketplace of sex slavery. In a 1-
week period, the young girl was forced to have sex with more than 20 
men. Finally she escaped.
  But, Mr. Speaker, the reality is that the victim sometimes never 
truly escapes. The horrors sometimes live with them forever. We can no 
longer be ignorant to modern day slavery. My legislation, the Shame 
Act, gives Federal judges the ability to publish the names and 
photographs of convicted buyers and sellers of humans.
  Those who sell or buy the innocence of children should be shamed for 
all to see. Put their photographs on backpage.com.

  And that is just the way it is.
