  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 2430) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and

     prescription drugs, medical devices, generic drugs, and

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 10 minutes of debate equally 
divided.
  The Senator from Tennessee.
  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank Senator Murray and the 
committee for 2 years of work to produce a bipartisan result. This bill 
funds the Food and Drug Administration and advances the 21st Century 
Cures legislation that Senator McConnell called the most important bill 
of the last Congress. Senator Murray and I have already spoken to the 
bill and have thanked everybody involved. Senators have other 
appointments they would like to keep.
  I yield back all time.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.
  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the 
question is, Shall the bill pass?
  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?
  There appears to be a sufficient second.
  The clerk will call the roll.
