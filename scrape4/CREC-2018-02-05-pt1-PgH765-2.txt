           RECOGNIZING THE LEGACY OF MT. ZION BAPTIST CHURCH

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the legacy of Mt. 
Zion Baptist Church on Evans Avenue in Fort Worth during its 123rd 
founding celebration.
  Since its founding, Mt. Zion has served as a beacon of light, pillar 
of support, and a place of refuge. In 1894, Reverend Frank Tribune, 
Katie Patterson, Laura Purvis, Josephine Wells, and Ella and Lee Brooks 
founded Mt. Zion. They planted the seed for what would become a 
ministry of solace and guidance.
  The church began on a small lot on the corner of Louisiana and 
Rosedale in the southside Fort Worth community. Soon after, the 
congregation moved to its current location on Evans Avenue. In 1919, 
the church expanded to include an auditorium. It has since grown to 
include a facility for weekly Sunday school, a daycare and educational 
services, and it also served as a meeting place when Dr. Martin Luther 
King visited Fort Worth.
  Although the church staff of leadership has changed since its 
founding, the congregation has never lost sight of its mission. The 
current pastor is Carl McElroy.
  Many great people in Fort Worth are members of the church. My good 
friend Gwen Hicks, former House Clerk Lorraine Miller, and I stand with 
them today to honor the recognition of these founders, leaders, and the 
congregation of Mt. Zion Baptist Church.
