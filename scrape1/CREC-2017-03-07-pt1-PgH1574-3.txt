                      PUBLIC TIRED OF BIASED MEDIA

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, from Investor's Business Daily: 
``The mainstream media's open hostility to President Trump may be 
starting to backfire, according to the latest IBD/TIPP poll. The poll 
found that 55 percent of the public says they have grown `weary from 
the media's persistently negative coverage of President Trump.' A 
roughly equal share, 54 percent, also believe that the news media `has 
assumed the role of the opposition party, constantly opposing the 
president and his policies at every turn.'''
  ``The results are understandable, given the unusually hostile 
relationship the press has with Trump.
  ``A study by the nonpartisan group Media Tenor found that only 3 
percent of network news stories in the first month of the Trump 
administration could be described as positive.''
  ``The poll found that 57 percent back Trump's plan to hire 10,000 
more immigration agents; 58 percent support the deportation of illegal 
immigrants charged with a crime, even if they haven't been convicted; 
and 53 percent back Trump's call to withhold federal aid to `sanctuary 
cities.'''
  ``Meanwhile, 42 percent say Trump is providing strong leadership for 
the country, which is higher than the 40 percent Obama got last 
October.''
