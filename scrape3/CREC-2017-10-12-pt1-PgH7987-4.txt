                           IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, the Iran nuclear deal is far from perfect. 
There are outstanding issues, like ballistic missiles, that are and 
should be addressed outside the nuclear agreement.
  Ultimately, the goal of this deal was to prevent Iran from attaining 
a nuclear weapon and averting all-out war. This is exactly what it has 
done.
  Now, President Trump is threatening to pull out from the deal and 
break our commitments to Iran and our allies, with no evidence to prove 
that Iran has not complied. In fact, the IAEA and our U.S. military and 
intelligence sources unanimously agree that Iran has remained compliant 
to the agreement.
  Walking away from the Iran nuclear agreement that, so far, is working 
will likely cause Iran to restart its nuclear weapons program, 
eliminate the possibility of diplomatic negotiations to denuclearize 
North Korea, kick off a nuclear arms race, and greatly increase the 
chances of nuclear war.
  If President Trump breaks our commitment to the Iran deal, the 
American people have everything to lose and nothing to gain. For the 
peace and security of the American people, we must uphold our 
commitment to this nuclear deal.
