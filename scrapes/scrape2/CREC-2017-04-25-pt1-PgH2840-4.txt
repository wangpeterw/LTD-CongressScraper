                         REJECT DANGEROUS CUTS

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, last week in Michigan, I toured the Bay Area 
Women's Center, which provides emergency shelter and counseling to 
survivors of domestic violence or sexual violence and their children. I 
toured the Women's Center to get a better understanding of their 
important work and see what they do and how they would be impacted by 
President Trump's proposed budget cuts.
  Two-thirds of the Women's Center's budget comes from Federal grants 
through the Violence Against Women Act, one of the first bills I 
cosponsored. I saw it signed into law by President Obama.
  I am concerned that the cuts that President Trump has proposed would 
effectively eliminate the important lifesaving care and rescue this 
organization provides to women, children, and others facing domestic 
violence. There are 15,000 citizens in mid-Michigan who could lose 
access to these lifesaving, important services.
  What kind of country are we if we don't provide this sort of support 
to our most vulnerable citizens at the moment of their need?
  We need to reject these dangerous cuts.
