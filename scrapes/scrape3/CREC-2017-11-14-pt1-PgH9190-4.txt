 UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF LAW'S LEGAL CLINIC CELEBRATES 70TH 
                              ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
the University of Tennessee College of Law's Legal Clinic on its 70th 
anniversary. The UT Legal Clinic is a national leader in clinical 
education.
  The clinic has been ranked one of the top 10 legal clinical programs 
among public universities and 19th among all U.S. law schools. The UT 
Legal Clinic was founded in 1947, by Professor Charles Miller, and is 
the longest, continually existing legal clinic in the country.
  The clinic provides law students many opportunities to learn by 
doing. This approach prepares students for both the practice of law and 
providing legal services to the underprivileged. The work at the clinic 
has further advanced the cause of justice by serving thousands of 
indigent clients who cannot afford legal representation.
  I want to honor and congratulate the UT College of Law's Legal Clinic 
on its 70th anniversary and thank it for its honorable service to the 
legal profession, the people of the State of Tennessee, and to the 
entire Nation. I wish only the best for the Legal Clinic in future 
years training and educating outstanding law students.
