                REPEALING DACA IS WRONG AND UN-AMERICAN

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the 800,000 DREAMers 
and in strong opposition to the administration's decision to end DACA.
  The President's decision neither reflects the values nor protects the 
interests of our Nation. Rather, termination of the DACA program will 
needlessly disrupt lives, separate families, harm communities, and hurt 
employers.
  These fine people came to this country as children with their 
families from around the world, from Mexico, South America, South 
Korea, and India. They grew up in our neighborhoods, attended our 
schools, and, with their friends, drafted extraordinary dreams and 
aspirations for their future. This is the only country they know. Their 
faces are the face of America. Their dreams are the American Dream.
  President Trump's decision to repeal DACA is wrong and un-American.
  Mr. Speaker, these young men and women want nothing more than to make 
a positive contribution to our Nation's future, and they trusted our 
government to do right by them. It is now up to Congress to do just 
that.
  It is long past time for this body to pass the DREAM Act and empower 
these DREAMers to live their lives and achieve their aspirations in 
confidence.
