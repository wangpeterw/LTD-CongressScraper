                                 PRAYER

  Pastor Jon Lands, Fellowship Baptist Church, Vienna, West Virginia, 
offered the following prayer:
  Lord God, I thank You for Your hand of providence that has guided our 
Nation and protected us over these past 241 years. We are thankful for 
those who have gone before us and paid the price for our freedom from 
tyranny.
  Recognizing Your blessing in our history, we now ask for Your 
continued favor and grace. We ask that You will protect those who even 
now place themselves in harm's way to preserve the liberty of our land.
  I especially thank You for these dedicated men and women who gather 
today to do our Nation's business. We pray for all in authority that we 
may live in peace, and we ask You to lead this Congress to follow Your 
instruction given to the prophet Micah: To do justice, to love mercy, 
and walk humbly with You.
  These things we pray in Jesus' name.
  Amen.
