             THANKING MARY BOTTINI FOR EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mary Bottini, a 
generous and dedicated constituent of the 22nd Congressional District 
of New York.
  In 2010, after a fruitful 29-year career, Mary retired and began to 
volunteer her time at the Oneida County Historical Society, where she 
was recently named Volunteer of the Year for 2017.
  Mary is an active member of our community, a grandmother of three, 
and a passionate purveyor of our history. Her commitment and civic 
engagement are the impetus for this well-deserved award.
  Oneida County has a rich history, and it is through the efforts and 
hard work of volunteers like Mary that its heritage and collective 
memory is preserved. Mary serves as a shining example of what it means 
to give back.
  Please join me today in thanking Mary for her commitment to our 
community and her years of exceptional service.

                          ____________________
