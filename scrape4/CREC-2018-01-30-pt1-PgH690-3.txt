       REMEMBERING THE ``CHALLENGER'' ANNIVERSARY 32 YEARS LATER

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, Sunday marked 32 years 
since the space shuttle Challenger disaster.
  On January 28, 1986, NASA launched the 10th flight of the space 
shuttle Challenger, and it broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, 
killing all seven crew members on board. It was devastating for those 
watching at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, for those viewing at home, 
and for our Nation as a whole.
  I rise today to remember the Challenger's dedicated crew:
  Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Christa 
McAuliffe, Gregory Jarvis, and Judith Resnick.
  As President Reagan said in a televised address 32 years ago: ``We 
will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as 
they prepared for their journey and waved good-bye and `slipped the 
surly bonds of Earth' to `touch the face of God.' ''
  Madam Speaker, these crew members had a passion for exploration. They 
inspired children around the world who dreamed of going to space. 
Through encouraging STEM study--science, technology, engineering, and 
math--we can continue to preserve their legacy and inspire another 
generation of explorers.
