                SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT MUST STOP

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, for too long, survivors of sexual 
harassment and assault have been isolated, shamed, and bullied into 
silence, while their abusers walk away scot-free with the privilege of 
anonymity and with no personal or financial accountability.
  This has been happening right here in Congress, in media, in many 
sectors in our society. No one, whether it be a Capitol Hill staffer, a 
Hollywood actor, a schoolteacher, a soldier, or anyone in any 
profession, at no time should they have to choose between their job and 
personal safety.
  Congress needs to act now to end the practice of taxpayer-funded 
sexual harassment settlements, expose perpetrators of sexual harassment 
and assault, and provide a fair and transparent path to justice for 
survivors. This behavior is absolutely unacceptable. It has no place in 
Congress or in our society. It must end.
