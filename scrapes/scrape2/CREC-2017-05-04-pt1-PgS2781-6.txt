                        REMEMBERING DON DUNWELL

  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to remember the life of a 
journalist, a husband, a father, a community leader, a guy by the name 
of Don Dunwell. Dunwell was known for his thoughtful interviewing 
style, creative storytelling, his ability to connect with the thousands 
of viewers who entrusted him to deliver the news to them.
  It was common to find Don teaching and mentoring young reporters 
about the ins and outs of journalism. He believed fiercely in the free 
press and strong ethics that were required to be a trusted source of 
information. He never took his platform for granted, and he used it to 
make Montana and this Nation a better place.
  Outside the newsroom, he was a proud father to John, working hard 
each day to ensure that his son had every opportunity possible. Don was 
immensely proud of his wife Mary Ann who charted her own path as a 
public servant.
  Today, we remember the life and the legacy of Don Dunwell and aim to 
follow in his ever-fervent footsteps. Don was 82 when he passed. He was 
bitten by a bug that made him look much younger than that, but he was a 
fine man and a good friend.
  I yield the floor.
