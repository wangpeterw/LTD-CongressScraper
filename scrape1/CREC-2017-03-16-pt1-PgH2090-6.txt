                  WELCOMING REVEREND DR. ANDREW CHANEY

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. Long) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LONG. Mr. Speaker, today I have the honor of introducing my 
friend Reverend Dr. Andrew Chaney.
  Reverend Chaney is a third-generation minister. He serves as the 
senior minister at the historic First and Calvary Presbyterian Church 
in Springfield, Missouri, a church that is a special place to my 
family. Reverend Chaney serves as an important spiritual voice for me 
and the Springfield community.
  Congress has a longstanding tradition of beginning each session with 
a prayer. I am privileged and honored to have the opportunity today to 
welcome Reverend Dr. Andrew Chaney to the people's House as he opened 
today's session with a prayer.
