           By Mr. PITTENGER:
       H.R. 4452.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       The explicit power of Congress to regulate commerce in and 
     among the states, as enumerated in Article 1, Section 8, 
     Clause 3, the Commerce Clause, of the United States 
     Constitution.
       Additionally, Article 1, Section 7, Clause 2 of the 
     Constitution allows for every bill passed by the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate and signed by the President to 
     be codified in to law; and therefore implicitly allows 
     Congress to repeal any bill that has been passed by both 
     cambers and signed in to law by the President.
