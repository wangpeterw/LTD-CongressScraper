                           SAVE AMERICAN JOBS

  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today regarding an issue that 
Congress

[[Page H5771]]

often decries but neglects: too many Americans are out of work because 
companies ship their jobs overseas without a thought for the workers 
and communities they leave behind. According to the group Public 
Citizen, the offshoring of American jobs has contributed to the loss of 
4.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs.
  But we have an opportunity to change that. I am proud to introduce 
the Stop Outsourcing and Create American Jobs Act and the Outsourcing 
Accountability Act. These two bills are designed to save American jobs 
by curbing outsourcing. By cracking down on tax loopholes that give 
corporations a break on the backs of American taxpayers, we can grow 
our economy and increase economic opportunities for the middle class.
  I hope my colleagues will join me in a serious discussion about how 
we can help our economy grow and help American workers. I welcome their 
support for these bills.
