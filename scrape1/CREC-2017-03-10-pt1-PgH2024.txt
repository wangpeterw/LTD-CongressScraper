             WORKING FAMILIES DESERVE BETTER THAN TRUMPCARE

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, right now Republicans are racing to pass 
TrumpCare, legislation that repeals and replaces the Affordable Care 
Act.
  They are racing to pass it to because they know when the American 
people find out what is in this bill, they won't support it.
  But let me tell you what TrumpCare does, Mr. Speaker.
  It gives huge tax cuts to insurance companies and the top 1 percent.
  It allows insurance companies to raise premiums by 25 percent for 
older Americans.
  It eliminates funding for Planned Parenthood, denying millions of 
women critical care.
  It cuts lifesaving support for the most vulnerable: children, 
Americans with disabilities, the frail elderly, and nursing home 
residents.
  And it slashes funding for Medicaid.
  TrumpCare is a great deal for the wealthy. TrumpCare is a great deal 
for insurance companies and drug companies. It is a raw deal for 
everyone else.
  Millions will lose healthcare coverage. And let's be clear, people 
are going to die when this happens. Millions more will end up paying 
for more lower quality care, and Republicans don't even have a plan to 
pay for their proposal.
  After 7 years, this is it. This is the best they have got: tax cuts 
for the rich and bad health care for everyone else.
  Working families deserve better.
