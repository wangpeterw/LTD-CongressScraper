                            SUPPORTING SNAP

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, today is the Anti-Hunger Day of Action, 
and I rise to support the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or 
SNAP, which helps feed 40 million Americans.
  We live in the richest country in the world, yet many Americans 
struggle to get nutritious food to feed their families, including 1 out 
of 5 American children. President Trump's budget would worsen the 
problem by cutting SNAP by $213 billion over 10 years. The President's 
proposal would also replace families' flexible monthly SNAP benefits 
with food boxes that contain no fresh produce. It basically puts people 
on rations.
  So I ask my Republican colleagues: Did you really come to Congress to 
take food out of the mouths of hungry people, hungry children? Who are 
you?
  Ending hunger in America is not a matter of resources; it is a matter 
of political will. We must invest in our nutrition programs to make 
sure that no one's plate goes empty in America.
