                                TAX BILL

  (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I rise again in strong opposition to H.R. 1, 
the so-called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This bill is an example of what 
happens when the wealthy exert their rule over hardworking Americans. 
Their bill should be called the ``Job-Killing Tax Cut Act.''

[[Page H9722]]

  A leading organization fighting to combat hunger, Feeding America, 
has said that H.R. 1 would undermine efforts to assist those struggling 
with adequate food access.
  In addition, the GOP leadership has yet to take up the CHIP bill.
  This is wrong. Let's stop the games and get something done. We 
shouldn't have to sacrifice the health and wellness of one population 
for another, and that is exactly what this divisive GOP bill does. It 
puts the healthcare of our children, our families, and our seniors at 
risk by pitting their needs against one another.
  Healthcare is not a choice, it is a right. The kids in the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, who rely on CHIP for their basic 
healthcare needs, deserve more than this foolish game of politics. We 
need to come together, roll up our sleeves, do the right thing for our 
kids, and not engage in the sham version of this tax scam.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to 
engage in truth in advertising, calling the bill a true tax scam.
  I oppose this bill because it is unnecessary, grows the national 
debt, is a giveaway to big corporations and the wealthy, and takes our 
attention away from the real problems facing the American people--like 
jobs.
