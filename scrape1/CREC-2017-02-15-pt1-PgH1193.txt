 CONGRESS NEEDS TO SCRUTINIZE THE NEW ADMINISTRATION'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the growing 
number of executive orders issued by President Trump and the silence 
from our House majority.
  President Trump has signed 12 executive orders in the first 5 weeks 
in office. Many, like the border wall, the Muslim ban, and the ACA 
sabotage order, are highly misguided and exceed the intent of the law.
  Congress has a constitutional duty to oversee and investigate the 
actions of the Executive. To date the House majority has said little 
and taken no action to oversee the Trump administration's abuse of 
power through executive orders.
  When President Obama sat in the White House, the House majority 
called his administration every name under the sun. Agencies were 
closely scrutinized. Federal officials were regularly subject to 
hostile questioning.
  Where is the oversight, Mr. Speaker? Where is the criticism? What 
happened to limiting executive power?
  I hope my colleagues in the majority will uphold Congress' 
constitutional duties and vigorously scrutinize President Trump's 
actions and mounting abuse of power.
