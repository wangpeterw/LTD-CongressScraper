                      NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK

  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in 
celebrating the fifth annual National Infrastructure Week and to 
highlight the urgent need for Congress to pass a comprehensive 
transportation and infrastructure bill.
  Mr. Speaker, in the summer of 2003, a power outage swamped the 
Eastern United States and Canada, including Detroit, which I represent, 
and left 50 million people without power for several days.
  In 2007, a bridge on I-35 West in Minneapolis collapsed into the 
Mississippi River. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, these are not isolated 
incidents.
  In my home State of Michigan, our cities are home to some of the 
worst roads in the country. A recent study by a nonprofit ranked 
Detroit's roads the fourth worst in the country.
  Mr. Speaker, Michigan deserves better, and Americans across the 
country deserve and demand more. I, as an excited member of the 
Congressional Infrastructure Committee, stand ready to work on future 
infrastructure bills and to work for the needs of the people.
