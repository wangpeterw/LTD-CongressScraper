       MOURNING THE LOSS OF BORDER PATROL AGENT ROGELIO MARTINEZ

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as most of us were sitting down for 
our Thanksgiving meal with our turkey and dressing, there was an empty 
chair at the Martinez home because, just a few days before 
Thanksgiving, 36-year-old Texas Border Patrol Agent Rogelio Martinez 
was killed manning Texas' often violent southern border.
  Initial reports indicate Martinez and his partner were ambushed by a 
group of illegal immigrants attempting to cross into the United States. 
The illegals began throwing rocks, hitting the two officers over and 
over again. Both agents suffered broken bones and major head trauma. 
Martinez's partner is still in the hospital in critical condition.
  Agent Martinez was killed by those seeking to enter the United States 
illegally by whatever means possible, ultimately, by killing him. The 
FBI is still investigating the homicide and seeks to bring those 
responsible to justice.
  Rock throwers are not that uncommon on the Texas-Mexico border. Since 
2003, 39--39--border patrol agents have been killed while on patrol.
  Our agents are outmanned, outgunned, and sometimes outfinanced by the 
drug cartels trying to enter the United States. Our border protectors 
deserve our total admiration and support.
  We mourn the loss of Border Agent Martinez. May God bless his family.
  And that is just the way it is.
