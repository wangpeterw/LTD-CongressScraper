                      NATIONAL STOP THE BLEED DAY

  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I would like to take the time to 
recognize March 31, 2018, as National Stop the Bleed Day. Stop the 
Bleed is a program offered by the American College of Surgeons to help 
educate the general public on techniques to assist victims suffering 
from uncontrolled bleeding using direct pressure, gauze and bandages, 
and tourniquets. As someone who has personally been trained to ``Stop 
the Bleed,'' I can attest to its importance and value.
  Each year, more than 180,000 people die from traumatic injuries 
sustained as a result of events including vehicle crashes, falls, 
industrial and farm accidents, shootings, and natural disasters. The 
most common preventable cause of these deaths is losing too much blood 
in the minutes before trained responders arrive. Just like CPR 
training, a civilian familiar with basic bleeding control techniques is 
better equipped to save a life. The effort to make this training 
available to the public is driven by the goal to reduce or eliminate 
preventable death from bleeding.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing National Stop the 
Bleed Day so that we may raise awareness and work to end the loss of 
life from uncontrolled bleeding by getting trained to ``Stop the 
Bleed.''
