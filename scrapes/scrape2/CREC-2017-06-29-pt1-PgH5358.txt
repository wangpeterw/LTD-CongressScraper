              OPPOSE DANGEROUS SENATE VERSION OF TRUMPCARE

  (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the 
dangerous and shameful Senate version of TrumpCare.
  According to the new Congressional Budget Office estimate, this bill 
will leave 22 million Americans without insurance by 2026. In my 
district, that amounts to over 91,000 of my constituents, and over 2 
million Floridians in total.
  TrumpCare would allow insurers to charge seniors up to five times 
more than younger people.
  In addition, we have more than 1.3 million Americans who are in 
nursing homes, and 62 percent of those pay for their stay and their 
care with Medicaid dollars, including three in five Floridians who are 
in a nursing home.
  The majority promised Americans that they would fix TrumpCare in the 
Senate. Instead, 13 men made a backroom deal and they left seniors out 
of it. Make no mistake, while billionaires reap huge tax breaks in this 
bill, older middle class Americans will suffer.
  I urge my Republican colleagues to find their backbone--and look for 
their hearts while they are at it--and stand up for our seniors.


                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind all persons in the 
gallery that they are not to applaud.
