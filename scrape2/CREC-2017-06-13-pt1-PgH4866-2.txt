                  RED SQUARE PROTEST BY YOUNG RUSSIANS

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, thousands of 
Russians took to the streets of Moscow's Red Square to protest 
President Putin's party of crooks and thieves. The protesters chanted 
that they want to make Russia free and that they want to live in a 
modern democratic state. They want democracy.
  Today, in America, here in the Nation's Capitol, another Trump 
official is testifying before Congress on Russia's interference with 
U.S. elections for the fourth time in as many weeks. There is no doubt 
that Russia interfered. This we know. Did Russia interfere in 
coordination with Trump officials? With whom and to what extent? This 
is what the American people deserve to know.
  Today, in America, the talk is how Putin tried to dishonor American 
democracy to do one thing, to keep his people from wanting it, the very 
democracy that is uniquely America's.
  And yesterday, in Moscow, was about what Putin couldn't do. He 
couldn't keep young Russia from taking to the streets of his capital 
city denouncing him as a crook and a coward and demanding American 
democracy.
