                      MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise andextend his remarks.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today, we have 
more questions than answers about profoundly disturbingties between the 
President-elect and shadowy Russian influences.
  The American people deserve full disclosure about any financial or 
personal interests held over this incoming administrationby foreign 
entities and potential collusion to undermine our democracy.
  Why has Mr. Trump failed to oppose Russia's forceful annexation of 
Crimea?
  Why did he pressure his party to officially withdraw a plank calling 
for assistance to Ukraine?
  Why did Mr. Trump reflexively attack our own intelligence officials 
when they warned of Russian interference in theelection?
  Why is he avoiding regular intelligence briefings?
  Now that our intelligence community has concretely confirmed that 
Russia meddled in our democracy, we must demand to know ifthere has 
been any undue influence on Mr. Trump since he began his campaign. 
These new allegations finally shed light on hispotential motives.
  Mr. Speaker, Congress, as a coequal branch of government, must 
conduct a bipartisan investigation and do it immediately.
