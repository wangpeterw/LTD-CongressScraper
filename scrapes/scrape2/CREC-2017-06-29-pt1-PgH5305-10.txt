                          ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

  (Mr. DesJARLAIS asked and was given permission to address the House

[[Page H5306]]

for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DesJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, today I want to address illegal 
immigration and what House Republicans are doing to ensure Americans' 
safety. This week, we voted to defund sanctuary cities that harbor 
criminals like the man who murdered Kate Steinle in San Francisco.
  My heart goes out to her parents and families around the country who 
have lost loved ones to foreign nationals who should have never been in 
this country in the first place.
  We passed Kate's Law to increase penalties on previously deported 
illegal immigrants. Also, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act would 
defund sanctuary cities and prevent lawsuits against local governments 
that follow Federal law.
  Shockingly, Nashville, in my home State of Tennessee, has been 
considering a sanctuary bill, even though murders this year already 
outnumber last year's total.
  Some on the city council want Nashville to become a magnet for 
violent gangs that transport drugs and human beings. Sanctuary policies 
endanger not only San Francisco or Nashville but the entire U.S.
  President Trump is cracking down on immigration crime. Illegal border 
crossings are down, and arrests and deportations of criminal aliens are 
up, just as Americans demanded last November.
  Here in the House, we are keeping our promises and our country safe.
