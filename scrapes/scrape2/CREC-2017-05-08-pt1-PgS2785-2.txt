                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, from the rising of the Sun to the coming of the 
evening, we lift Your Name in grateful praise.
  Surround our lawmakers with the power of Your presence, sustaining 
them in their challenging world. Lord, strengthen them to do what is 
right so that our Nation will be exalted by Your love. Empower them to 
treat one another with respect and honor. Teach them to hate what is 
evil and to cling to what is good. Remind them of how fleeting are the 
days of their lives as You give them the wisdom to prepare for 
eternity.
  Eternal Father, we exalt You and praise Your Name, for in perfect 
faithfulness You continue to expose us to the unfolding of Your loving 
providence.
  We pray in Your marvelous Name. Amen.
