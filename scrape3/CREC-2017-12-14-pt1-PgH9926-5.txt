             HONORING THE LIFE OF TIMOTHY ``TIM'' BRADFORD

  (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, my good friend Timothy 
``Tim'' Bradford passed away last week.
  Tim was a commissioner of the Cook County Metropolitan Water 
Reclamation District, but he was much more than that. Tim grew up on 
the west side of the city of Chicago, moved to the south suburbs, and 
became known as the godfather of politics in south suburban Cook 
County.
  He was in love with everybody he met, involved in everything that 
existed, and I simply express condolences to his wife and family on his 
passing.
