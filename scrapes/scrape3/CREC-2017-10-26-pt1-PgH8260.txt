  HERKIMER CENTRAL SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT ROBERT MILLER TURNS 
                        AROUND GRADUATION RATES

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Robert Miller, 
superintendent of the Herkimer Central School District.
  When Robert Miller became superintendent of the Herkimer Central 
School District in 2013, he was facing a problem that many 
superintendents across this country are facing: a low and decreasing 
graduation rate.
  However, in the 4 years since Mr. Miller began in his new role, 
Herkimer has seen a drastic turnaround. The graduation rate has 
increased 11 percent, from 69 to 80 percent.
  However, in 2006, Herkimer's graduation rates were at 87 percent. Mr. 
Miller has made it his mission to ensure that Herkimer Central School 
District reaches that number again.
  Mr. Miller noted that it was the dedication of both teachers and 
administrators that led to the significant increase. Their ability and 
willingness to intervene with students at risk has helped these 
students successfully move to the next stage of their lives with the 
skills they need to contribute positively to our community.
  Thank you to Superintendent Miller and the dedicated staff at 
Herkimer Central School District for your tremendous work and 
commitment to our next generation of leaders. I know your effort will 
continue inspiring our students for years to come.
