                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, our hearts rise up to meet You as the day rises to meet 
the Sun. Humble our lawmakers in Your presence that they may delight in 
the power You provide. Help them to remember that before honor comes 
humility. Give them also the wisdom to know that their sufficiency 
comes from You.
  Lord, teach them Your wisdom as You infuse them with the spirit of 
reverence for You. May they make the commitment to faithfully serve You 
and country with their whole hearts.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
