              REPUBLICANS NEED TO OFFER MEDICAL EXTENDERS

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to not speak about Alabama winning the 
national championship.
  Mr. Speaker, the reason we are here is because Republicans care more 
about the extremely wealthy than they do about average American 
citizens. They got together and passed a tax scam bill that gave 86 
percent of the moneys to the top 1 percent in our society.
  They gave crumbs to the middle class that will expire, unlike the 
corporate cuts they gave that will not expire. And then they come up 
with a children's healthcare plan as a bargaining chip to get what is 
not a clean CR through, but a CR where they took funds that will help 
the ACA continue and take those down for 2 years so the ACA is further 
crippled.
  To hear the Republicans talk about their care for healthcare is 
laughable. They were never for Medicaid or Medicare or the Affordable 
Care Act. They are not for a permanent children's healthcare plan. They 
are not for community health centers, where 40 percent of those 
CHIP children get their healthcare.

  If they wanted to bring the government back and get us open, they 
would offer us the medical extenders like Mr. Pallone talked about. 
This is unfortunate. We should get past this and we should stop our 
mantra that the Republicans have learned.
