   STUDENTS ARE UNITED IN THEIR FIGHT TO GET WEAPONS OF WAR OFF OUR 
                                STREETS

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, 8 weeks ago, a lone gunman 
entered the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, 
and in just 6 minutes, killed 17 students and staff and injured 17 
others: 1 shooter, 6 minutes, 17 dead, and 17 injured.
  In the weeks since, I have stood alongside students at the March for 
Our Lives in Buffalo, New York, sat down and listened to students from 
schools across western New York, and participated in a town hall panel 
discussion by Students for Action.
  These students are respectful of the Second Amendment and of those 
good, law-abiding citizens of gun ownership.
  Congress can learn from the thoughtful, reasoned, respectful, and 
passionate approach demonstrated by each of the students I have 
encountered. They have come from diverse cultural and socioeconomic 
backgrounds and different communities, rural, suburban and urban, but 
they are unified in their fight to get weapons of war off our streets 
and to end mass school shootings.

  Mr. Speaker, we can come together to save lives.
