                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, we praise You with all our heart. Through the power of 
Your love and mercy, we live and move and breathe and have our being. 
Lord, You are our High Power, our refuge in life's stormy seasons. 
Inspire our lawmakers to place their trust in You. Lord, lift them 
above divisions and cynicism as they depend upon the unfolding of Your 
powerful providence. May they find peace because of Your redemptive 
love. Remind them that You are faithful to help those who ask You for 
guidance and strength.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
