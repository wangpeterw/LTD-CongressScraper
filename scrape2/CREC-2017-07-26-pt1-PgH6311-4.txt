        RECOGNITION OF LIEUTENANT COMMANDER MIGUEL SANTIESTEBAN

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Lieutenant 
Commander Miguel Santiesteban, who is receiving the U.S. Navy's 
nomination to be commander. Having fled Castro's regime at a young age, 
Miguel moved with his family to south Florida.
  Driven by his desire to serve our great country, Miguel joined the 
Navy in 1989. While stationed in Japan as a deck seaman, Miguel was one 
of the few selected to attend the Hospital Corpsman ``A'' School.
  He earned a master's degree in healthcare service administration at 
my alma mater, Florida International University.
  Miguel was commissioned in 2001 and completed his first duty 
assignment at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He is 
currently an administrative officer for research and development at the 
U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.
  Miguel has earned many accolades, including the Defense Meritorious 
Service Medal, the NATO Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal 
several times. Miguel lives the Navy's core values of honor, courage, 
commitment.
  I join Lieutenant Commander Miguel Santiesteban's family and friends 
in congratulating him on this well-deserved nomination. We are so proud 
of you, Miguel.
