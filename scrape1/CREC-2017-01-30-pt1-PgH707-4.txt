                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  Bless the Members of this assembly as they set upon the important 
work that faces them. Help them to make wise decisions in a good manner 
and to carry their responsibilities steadily with high hopes for a 
better future for our great Nation.
  May the desire to act speedily to implement promises made while 
campaigning not prevent the careful consideration of all possible 
outcomes in the governing process. Send Your spirit of wisdom and 
discernment upon them in their work.
  May Your blessing, O God, be with all of our leaders this day and 
every day to come, and may all we do be done for Your greater honor and 
glory.
  Amen.
