                        THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. McEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, it has been my observation that often in 
this body there are people who would suggest to us that their actions 
are motivated and guided by an adherence to the Judeo-Christian ethic.
  Mr. Speaker, in Jesus' first sermon, He said, among other things, 
``The spirit of the Lord is upon me to bring good news to the poor.'' 
We have done that with the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.
  Mr. Speaker, the notion of taking away the Affordable Care Act by 
repealing it, I would suggest to this body, is antithetical to those 
Judeo-Christian values. More than 20 million Americans of all 
socioeconomic backgrounds have benefited from this act.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that reason will prevail and that while we 
may tweak the Affordable Care Act, it will not be repealed.
