   RELATING TO THE EXERCISE OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE RANKING MINORITY 
                MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY

  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I 
offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.
  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:

                              H. Res. 636

       Resolved, That until otherwise provided by the House, the 
     authority of the ranking minority member of the Committee on 
     the Judiciary shall be exercised by the minority member of 
     the Committee who, prior to the adoption of this resolution, 
     ranked immediately below the ranking minority member.

  The resolution was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
