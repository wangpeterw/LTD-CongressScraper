                        RECOGNIZING CRITZ FARMS

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Critz Farms in 
Cazenovia, New York.
  This month the New York State Agricultural Society honored Critz 
Farms with the 2018 Business of the Year Award. The award recognizes 
the quality, leadership, and innovation demonstrated by State farms and 
particularly agribusinesses.
  Critz Farms was established in 1985 by Matthew and Juanita Critz. The 
family-run farm offers various educational tours for visitors such as 
apple cider production, pumpkin patch browsing, and maple sugaring 
tours. Their mission is to educate people about farming and the origins 
of food, all while providing fun for the whole family.
  Critz Farms grows a variety of crops, including apples, strawberries, 
blueberries, and conifer trees for Christmas. The family-run farm also 
produces apple cider, award-winning hard cider, craft beer, and pure 
maple syrup.
  Congratulations again to Critz Farms for being honored as the New 
York State Agricultural Society's Business of the Year. I am looking 
forward to visiting Critz Farms, as I do each year, for maple syrup 
season this March. Many of you may be surprised to know that the best 
maple syrup in the world is produced in New York State.
