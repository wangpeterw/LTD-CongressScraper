             TAX REFORM FOR HARDWORKING MICHIGAN RESIDENTS

  (Mr. MOOLENAAR asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, tax reform is a key concern for small-
business owners and hardworking residents in my district.
  My predecessor, former Ways and Means chairman, Dave Camp, worked 
diligently on this issue in hopes of reforming our Nation's burdensome 
Tax Code.
  Today, the Ways and Means Committee took up this work again because 
our Tax Code needs to be simpler, fairer, and flatter for Michigan 
families.
  Tax reform done right will benefit Michigan residents of all income 
levels by making it easier for them to calculate and file their tax 
returns while lowering their tax burden.
  The first bill I introduced as Michigan's Fourth District 
Representative was legislation that would make it easier for Michigan 
families to pay for child care. It is my hope that this will become 
part of this tax reform package.
  Our Tax Code was last updated in 1986. It is time for a change. I 
hope this Congress will pass tax reform for the 21st century.
