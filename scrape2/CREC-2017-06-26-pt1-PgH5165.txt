     according to the preliminary results of the Special Election 
     held June 20, 2017, the Honorable Karen Handel was elected

     District of Georgia.
       With best wishes, I am,

                                                 State of Georgia,


                                       Office of the Governor,

                                       Atlanta, GA, June 21, 2017.
     Hon. Karen L. Haas,
     Clerk, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Ms. Haas: This is to advise you that the unofficial 
     results of the Special Election held on Tuesday, June 20, 
     2017, for Representative in Congress from the Sixth 
     Congressional District of Georgia, show that Karen Handel 
     received 134,595 or 51.87% of the total number of votes cast 
     for that office.
       It would appear from these unofficial results that Karen 
     Handel was elected as Representative in Congress from the 
     Sixth Congressional District of Georgia.
       To the best of our knowledge and belief at this time, there 
     is no contest to this election.
       As soon as the official results are certified to this 
     office by all counties/precincts involved, an official 
     Certificate of Election will be prepared for transmittal as 
     required by law.
           Sincerely,
                                                      Nathan Deal,
     Governor.
