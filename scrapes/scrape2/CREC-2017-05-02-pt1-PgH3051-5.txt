       WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, NOT TEAR IT DOWN

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, the Lord works in mysterious ways.
  Any person today can go online and look at the speech that Jimmy 
Kimmel made live on television. He talks about his newborn little boy. 
He talks about how, within a few minutes, they had to whisk him over to 
another hospital to give him an emergency operation on his heart. He 
was very emotional.
  But he didn't just talk about him and his wife and his little 
daughter and his newborn son. He talked about how no person, no family, 
or no child should ever have to be denied that opportunity for that 
lifesaving operation, especially right here in the United States of 
America.
  Mr. Speaker, the Lord works in mysterious ways because this is the 
perfect time for every American to go online and look at the Jimmy 
Kimmel speech. It is not politics, ladies and gentlemen, it is love. It 
is respect not only for his little boy, but for this great country and 
how we can be greater. That is why we need to improve our healthcare 
system, not tear it down.
