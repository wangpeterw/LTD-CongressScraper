             SALUTING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE ACTION NETWORK

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the Universal Health 
Care Action Network, also known as UHCAN, for their energy and advocacy 
to protect the Affordable Care Act.
  I was honored to join UHCAN in a town hall where we presented our 
message to men, women, families, and children from across central Ohio 
who were eager to organize. Do you know why? To save the health care 
for more than 22 million newly insured Americans, including nearly 1 
million Ohioans, who gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
  We heard personal stories, stories from Laura, Mindy, Rachel, and 
Kevin Rhodes--who was my guest at the joint session of Congress right 
here--on how the Affordable Care Act was saving their lives.
  Mr. Speaker, yet, here we are tomorrow, on the seventh anniversary of 
the Affordable Care Act, preparing to repeal and replace it with 
Republican care; legislation which would push 24 million Americans off 
their healthcare coverage, and give massive tax breaks to 400 
superwealthy families, while the rest of us, we pay more for less.
  Mr. Speaker, I join my constituents and Americans across the country 
who oppose Republican care. Join me tomorrow and say ``no.''
