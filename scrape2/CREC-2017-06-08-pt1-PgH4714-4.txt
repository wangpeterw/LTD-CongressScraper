                          HONORING STEVE HARDY

  (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the memory of 
Mayor Steve Hardy of Vacaville, California, a man who dedicated his 
life to service, first in the U.S. Navy for 5 years, then as a 
policeman, and later in the California State Senate, where I had the 
privilege of working with him when he was the staff director of the 
Governmental Organization Committee.
  During his tenure as mayor, he led the city through a very difficult 
period--the Great Recession--revising the city's finances, bringing it 
back to vitality, and also continuing the role of Vacaville as one of 
the major cities in my district. It was a great pleasure working with 
him during those years.
  His marriage of 46 years to his wife, Jerri, is a testament not only 
to his service to the community, but also to his family. He is survived 
by his children. I look forward to his memory and to the future of 
Vacaville.
