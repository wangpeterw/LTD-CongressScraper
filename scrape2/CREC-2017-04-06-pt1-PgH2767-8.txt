CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SOMALIA--MESSAGE 
      FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115-28)

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message 
from the President of the United States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and ordered to be printed:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the

enclosed notice stating that the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13536 of April 12, 2010, with respect to Somalia is to 
continue in effect beyond April 12, 2017.
  The United States is strongly committed to Somalia's stabilization, 
and it is important to maintain sanctions against persons undermining 
its stability. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary 
to continue the national emergency with respect to Somalia and to 
maintain in force the sanctions to respond to this threat.
                                                     Donald J. Trump.  
The White House, April 6, 2017.
