          DISMANTLING THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Financial 
Services Committee in strong opposition to the Financial CHOICE Act, 
or, more appropriately titled, the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act.
  The proponents of this bill claim it is about regulatory relief for 
our Nation's community banks, but it is not. This bill guts the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an organization that was 
developed to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, abusive 
practices.
  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today because the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau has done amazing things. This bill would dismantle 
it, dismantle a Bureau that just in 6 years has recovered almost $12 
billion for over 29 million Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, this is the wrong choice. This bill returns the American 
economy to the deregulatory state that led us to the great financial 
crisis and the deepest recession since the Great Depression.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill, 
because the fundamental question is, it does not provide choice or hope 
or opportunity for investors or for entrepreneurs.
