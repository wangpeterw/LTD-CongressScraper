  HOUSE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, REGARDING THE HOUSE AMENDMENT TO 
                     SENATE AMENDMENT ON H.R. 1625

       The following is an explanation of the Consolidated 
     Appropriations Act, 2018.
       This Act includes 12 regular appropriations bills for 
     fiscal year 2018. The divisions contained in the Act are as

        Division V--CLOUD Act
       Section 1 of the Act is the short title of the bill.
       Section 2 of the Act displays a table of contents.
       Section 3 of the Act states that, unless expressly provided 
     otherwise, any reference to ``this Act'' contained in any 
     division shall be treated as referring only to the provisions 
     of that division.
       Section 4 of the Act states that this explanatory statement 
     shall have the same effect with respect to the allocation of 
     funds and implementation of this legislation as if it were a 
     joint explanatory statement of a committee of conference.
       Section 5 of the Act provides a statement of 
     appropriations.
       Section 6 of the Act states that each amount designated by 
     Congress as being for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global 
     War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) is contingent on the President so 
     designating all such OCO/GWOT amounts and transmitting such 
     designations to Congress. The provision is consistent with 
     the requirements in the Budget Control Act of 2011.
       Section 7 of the Act addresses salaries and compensation 
     rates and provides for a death gratuity.
       The Act does not contain any congressional earmarks, 
     limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined 
     by clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of 
     Representatives.

       DIVISION A--AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG 
     ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018

                        CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTIVES

       The explanatory statement is silent on provisions that were 
     in both the House Report (H. Rpt. 115-232) and Senate Report 
     (S. Rpt. 115-131) that remain unchanged by this agreement, 
     except as noted in this explanatory statement.
       The agreement restates that executive branch wishes cannot 
     substitute for Congress's own statements as to the best 
     evidence of congressional intentions, which are the official 
     reports of the Congress. The agreement further points out 
     that funds in this Act must be used for the purposes for 
     which appropriated, as required by section 1301 of title 31 
     of the United States Code, which provides: ``Appropriations 
     shall be applied only to the objects for which the 
     appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by 
     law.''
       The House and Senate report language that is not changed by 
     the explanatory statement is approved and indicates 
     congressional intentions. The explanatory statement, while 
     repeating some report language for emphasis, does not intend 
     to negate the language referred to above unless expressly 
     provided herein.
       In cases in which the House or the Senate have directed the 
     submission of a report, such report is to be submitted to 
     both the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations no 
     later than 60 days after enactment of this Act, unless 
     otherwise directed.
       Hereafter, in division A of this statement, the term the 
     Committees' refers to the Committees on Appropriations of the 
     House of Representatives and the Senate.
       For the appropriations provided by this Act and previous 
     Acts, the departments and agencies funded by this agreement 
     are reminded that the Committees use the definitions for 
     transfer, reprogramming, and program, project, and activity 
     as defined by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 
     GAO-04-261SP Appropriations Law--Vol. I and GAO-05-734SP 
     Budget Glossary.
       A transfer is the shifting of funds between appropriations. 
     It applies to (1) transfers from one agency to another, (2) 
     transfers from one account to another within the same agency, 
     and (3) transfers to an interagency or intra-agency working 
     fund. In each instance, statutory authority is required.
       Reprogramming is the utilization of funds in an 
     appropriation account for purposes other than those 
     contemplated at the time of appropriation. It is the shifting 
     of funds from one object to another within an appropriation.
       A program, project, or activity (PPA) is an element within 
     a budget account. PPAs are identified by reference to include 
     the most specific level of budget items identified in the 
     Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, 
     and Related Agencies Act, 2018, accompanying Committee 
     reports, explanatory statements, the Statement of Managers, 
     and budget justifications. Program activity structures are 
     intended to provide a meaningful representation of the 
     operations financed by a specific budget account by project, 
     activity, or organization.
       For fiscal year 2018, the Committees continue to include 
     bill language requiring advanced notification of certain 
     agency actions. Notification will be required at least

[[Page H2046]]

     30 days in advance of any action if (1) a major capital 
     investment is modified; (2) an office is realigned or 
     reorganized; and (3) activities are carried out that were not 
     described in the budget request.
       The agreement directs the Office of Budget and Program 
     Analysis (OBPA) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
     to provide an organizational chart for each agency funded by 
     this Act to the division and subdivision level, as 
     appropriate, by May 1, 2018. The agreement also directs the 
     Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Commodity Futures 
     Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Farm Credit Administration 
     (FCA) to provide an organizational chart of each agency 
     respectively to the division and subdivision level, as 
     appropriate, by May 1, 2018.
       Further, USDA, CFTC, and FDA should be mindful of 
     Congressional authority to determine and set final funding 
     levels for fiscal year 2019. Therefore, the agencies should 
     not presuppose program funding outcomes and prematurely 
     initiate action to redirect staffing prior to knowing final 
     outcomes on fiscal year 2019 program funding. The agreement 
     directs OBPA to provide the Committees with the number of 
     staff years and employees on board for each agency funded by 
     this Act on a quarterly basis.

                                TITLE I

                         AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS

                   Processing, Research and Marketing

                        Office of the Secretary


                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

       The agreement provides $46,532,000 for the Office of the 
     Secretary.
       The agreement directs the Secretary to provide the report 
     on the Commodity Credit Corporation in H. Rpt. 115-232 under 
     this heading on May 16, 2018 and November 15, 2018.
       The agreement recognizes the Department has statutory 
     authorities and programs designed to help break the multi-
     generational trap of poverty in rural counties and supports 
     USDA's utilization of existing programs and funding within 
     Rural Development (RD) and the Food and Nutrition Service 
     (FNS) in order to assist families, create jobs, and develop a 
     path towards self-sufficiency. Other existing resources such 
     as the extension service and public universities can be used 
     for coordination and outreach activities. The Committees 
     still await the detailed plan required to be submitted by the 
     Secretary detailing all funding resources and bundled 
     services to combat rural poverty.
       The agreement includes $600,000,000 for a rural broadband 
     pilot program to assist in further closing the digital 
     divide. Lack of adequate broadband is an impediment to rural 
     economic development, and deployment of broadband service 
     yields a multitude of socio-economic benefits including: 
     economic growth, improved educational opportunities, and 
     increased access to healthcare options. The agreement 
     reiterates that funding should be prioritized to areas 
     currently lacking access to broadband service, and 
     investments in broadband shall consider any technology that 
     best serves the goals of broadband expansion. Lastly, the 
     agreement restates the importance of coordination among 
     federal agencies in expanding broadband deployment and 
     adoption and expects the Department to take caution to 
     maximize these limited resources and not overbuild or 
     duplicate existing broadband capable infrastructure.
       The agreement acknowledges that the United States 
     Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will continue to be 
     responsible for the construction of the National Bio and 
     Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). The agreement provides an 
     additional $4,000,000 to USDA to support operational 
     activities of the NBAF.
       In addition to $10,000,000 in mandatory funding available 
     to assist socially disadvantaged and veteran farmers and 
     ranchers, the agreement includes an additional $3,000,000 in 
     discretionary funding for these activities.
       It was the intent of Congress that the Secretary consider 
     the views of all producers who suffered losses related to the 
     consequences of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and other 
     hurricanes and wildfires occurring in calendar year 2017 in 
     determining eligibility for assistance provided in Title I of 
     Public Law No: 115-123.
       The agreement provides an additional $500,000,000 for Water 
     and Waste grants and loans to address infrastructure needs in 
     Rural America, and directs the Secretary to prioritize 
     communities that have the greatest infrastructure needs.
       On February 3, 2017, USDA restricted the public's access to 
     the search tool for the Animal Care Inspection System, saying 
     it needed to conduct a comprehensive review of the 
     information on its website. USDA is now posting heavily 
     redacted inspection reports that make it difficult in certain 
     cases for the public to understand the subject of the 
     inspection, assess USDA's subsequent actions, and to evaluate 
     the effectiveness of its enforcement. USDA's actions to date 
     do not meet the requirements in H. Rpt. 115-232 that the 
     online searchable database should allow analysis and 
     comparison of data and include all inspection reports, annual 
     reports, and other documents related to enforcement of animal 
     welfare laws. USDA is directed to comply with these 
     requirements and is reminded that as part of its oversight 
     responsibilities, Congress has the right to make any inquiry 
     it wishes into litigation in which USDA is involved. USDA is 
     directed to respond to any such inquiries fully.
       The following table reflects the agreement:

               Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

       The agreement provides $981,893,000 for the Animal and 
     Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Salaries and 
     Expenses.
       The agreement includes a net increase of $35,681,000 for 
     high priority initiatives in order to protect the plant and 
     animal resources of the Nation from pests and diseases. The 
     agreement provides increases within the total funding level 
     of: $7,500,000 for Avian Health to help pay for losses due to 
     low pathogenic avian influenza; $5,000,000 for Cattle Health 
     in support of the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program; 
     $2,000,000 for Agricultural Quarantine Inspection; $500,000 
     for Field Crop and Rangeland Ecosystems Pests in order to 
     control or eradicate pests destroying Roseau cane in wetlands 
     near the Mississippi River Delta; $11,670,000 for Specialty 
     Crop Pests, including $5,000,000 for the control or 
     eradication of the spotted lanternfly and $2,500,000 for 
     oriental fruit fly port detection; $2,000,000 for Tree and 
     Wood Pests; $2,000,000 for Animal Welfare; and, $5,000,000 
     for the Wildlife Damage Management program.
       The agreement provides $30,810,000 for the Animal Welfare 
     program. The agreement directs that APHIS continue its 
     inspections of registered ARS research facilities to ensure 
     their adherence to the Animal Welfare Act.
       To address the cattle fever tick infestation in South 
     Texas, the agreement provides an additional $5,000,000 for 
     all activities under the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication 
     Program (CFTEP) for research and scientific tools 
     concentrating on the following: new systematic cattle fever 
     tick treatment products with longer treatment intervals for 
     cattle; new cattle fever tick treatment products for 
     wildlife, especially nilgai antelope; and new or improved 
     cattle fever tick preventative therapies, such as vaccines, 
     for both cattle and wildlife hosts. APHIS and ARS are urged 
     to collaborate with Mexican National Animal Health Officials, 
     Mexican State Animal Health Officials from the Mexican states 
     that border Texas, and Mexican livestock and wildlife 
     industry representatives to develop and implement a fever 
     tick control or eradication program that will reduce or 
     eliminate the fever tick population along the Mexican side of 
     the Rio Grande River, and thus the threat of fever tick 
     incursion presented by wildlife and livestock populations 
     across the Rio Grande from the permanent quarantine zone in 
     Texas.
       The agreement includes no less than $3,500,000 for cervid 
     health activities. Within the funds provided, APHIS should 
     give consideration to indemnity payments if warranted.
       The agreement directs APHIS to complete the requirements 
     under the Foreign Market Access Requests heading in H.Rpt. 
     115-232 by July 15, 2018.
       The agreement includes a $6,170,000 increase to help states 
     and producers address the damaging effects of citrus greening 
     disease within the Specialty Crop Pests program as well as a 
     one-time increase of $7,500,000 for the Huanglongbing Multi-
     Agency Coordination (HLB-MAC) group.
       The agreement includes $28,000,000 under Wildlife Damage 
     Management for national rabies management, surveillance, and 
     eradication efforts and $2,000,000 for Wildlife Services 
     education and training. The agreement also provides 
     $1,600,000 for combatting wildlife depredation to production 
     aquaculture and an additional $5,000,000 for increased feral 
     swine surveillance. Additionally, no less than $250,000 
     should be available for the agency to reduce blackbird 
     depredation in the Northern Great Plains.
       The agreement notes that assessing AQI treatment monitoring 
     fees on a per-enclosure basis imposes disproportionate 
     impacts on industry and user groups at certain key ports of 
     entry, including ports along the southeast United States. The 
     agreement encourages USDA to conduct a new study that 
     specifically outlines the actual costs of treatments, 
     examines the disproportionate impact the fee has on airports 
     and seaports in different regions of the U.S., and evaluates 
     alternative and equitable funding mechanisms. Such report 
     should also incorporate due consideration of the 
     recommendations of the Treatment Fee Working Group's 
     September 27, 2016 ``Report to APHIS''. USDA shall brief the 
     Committees on the status of such study and other efforts to 
     ensure equitable collection of revenues for vital AQI 
     treatment monitoring efforts no later than 120 days after 
     enactment of this Act.

                                TITLE IV

                         DOMESTIC FOOD PROGRAMS

    Office of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer 
                                Services

       The agreement provides $800,000 for the Office of the Under 
     Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services.
       Some state contracted electronic benefit transfer (EBT) 
     processors are charging switching or routing fees in 
     connection with the routing of SNAP benefits. These fees 
     require retailers and/or those routing transactions on behalf 
     of retailers (often referred to as third party processors) to 
     pay for EBT transaction switching and routing to the State 
     EBT processor that handles the client EBT account. In 
     addition, these fees may seek to offset artificially low 
     cost-per-case-month fees that are bid as part of State 
     contracts, and therefore adversely affect competition among 
     existing or new EBT Processors. Therefore, in the interest of 
     maintaining competitiveness for EBT transaction routing, 
     Section 750 extends existing statutory prohibitions against 
     the charging of fees by State contracted EBT processors in 
     connection with the redemption of USDA domestic food 
     assistance benefits to include the charging of gateway 
     switching or routing fees to SNAP authorized retailers or 
     their third party processors.

     support initiatives; $14,000,000 for infrastructure; and an 
     increase of $25,000,000 for the contingency reserve.
       The work of the National Academies of Science (NAS) to 
     review and make recommendations for updating the WIC food 
     packages to reflect current science and cultural factors is 
     recognized. The agreement notes, however, that while all 
     revised packages now allow some fish, the amounts remain low 
     compared to the recommendations of other authoritative health 
     agencies. The agreement strongly encourages the Department to 
     consider the health and cultural benefits of fish consumption 
     as the NAS recommendations are reviewed and used to inform 
     the Department's next course of action. The agreement also 
     strongly encourages the Department to continue to allow 
     states to submit cultural food package proposals to respond 
     to the cultural preferences of WIC participants in states 
     like Alaska.

       The agreement provides $2,800,078,000 in new discretionary 
     budget authority and $2,337,963,000 in definite user fees for 
     a total of $5,138,041,000 for Food and Drug Administration, 
     Salaries and Expenses. This total does not include permanent, 
     indefinite user fees for the Mammography Quality Standards 
     Act; Color Certification; Export Certification; Priority 
     Review Vouchers Pediatric Disease; Food and Feed Recall; Food 
     Reinspection; Voluntary Qualified Importer Program; the Third 
     Party Auditor Program; Outsourcing Facility; and Medical 
     Countermeasure Priority Review Vouchers. The agreement 
     expects the FDA to continue all projects, activities, 
     laboratories, and programs as included in fiscal year 2017 
     unless otherwise specified.
       The agreement includes increases of $1,000,000 to review 
     botanical drug and dietary supplement interactions; $400,000 
     to support the Critical Path Initiative; $2,800,000 to

     necessary to begin developing the appropriate lab methods to 
     detect evidence of seafood decomposition; $300,000 to help

     critically important medical products; $15,000,000 for the 
     Oncology Center of Excellence; $10,500,000 to support produce 
     safety cooperative agreements with states; and $9,700,000 for 
     the animal drugs and feeds program to manage increased 
     workloads. The agreement also includes $1,500,000 for the HHS 
     Office of Inspector General specifically for oversight of FDA 
     activities, and $1,500,000 for consumer education and 
     outreach regarding biotechnology.
       The agreement includes a one-time increase of $2,500,000 to 
     assist the agency in obtaining information from medical 
     specialists and medical specialty groups concerning clinical 
     use of each of the substances nominated for the list 
     developed by the FDA of bulk drug substances for which there 
     is a clinical need (``503B Bulks List''). Additionally, the 
     agreement directs the FDA to follow congressional intent as 
     it relates to human drug compounded medicines and the 
     standards set forth under current Good Manufacturing 
     Practices (CGMP). Given the need for high quality control and 
     patient safety, the agency is instructed to prohibit 
     outsourcing facilities from compounding drug products from 
     bulk ingredients when outsourcing facilities could otherwise 
     be compounding from an FDA approved drug product.
       The agreement also includes a general provision providing 
     $94,000,000 for the FDA to expand its efforts related to 
     addressing the opioid crisis. According to the FDA, there is 
     an increasing trend in the number of deaths involving 
     fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, being used in combination with 
     other drugs, including cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. 
     A significant amount of illicit fentanyl is entering the 
     country as part of the hundreds of millions of parcels that 
     come through International Mail Facilities (IMF) annually. 
     This funding will allow the FDA to strategically strengthen 
     the agency's presence at IMFs to increase its overall 
     operational capacity to inspect more incoming packages. 
     Specifically, this funding is for the FDA to purchase 
     equipment and information

[[Page H2052]]

     technology to identify unapproved and counterfeit 
     pharmaceuticals, and to upgrade laboratory facilities used in 
     this effort. Additionally, funding is provided to better 
     identify and target firms and organizations importing into 
     the United States; increase the staff inspecting packages and 
     to increase the number of packages they are inspecting; 
     increase criminal investigation resources; and increase staff 
     and equipment to efficiently screen imported products.
       Additionally, the agreement encourages the FDA to continue 
     implementing the Opioid Action Plan to determine how changes 
     in opioid packaging, distribution, and medication disposal 
     procedures can help mitigate the national opioid crisis, 
     including working to support ongoing efforts at the state and 
     regional level.
       The agreement notes that the FDA has not finalized the rule 
     to extend the compliance date for manufacturers for the 
     Nutrition Facts Label Final Rule and the Serving Size Final 
     Rule, which is causing significant confusion and market 
     disruptions, and directs the agency to finalize the rule 
     before July 26, 2018. Further, the agreement directs the 
     agency to issue its conclusions on the status of pending 
     dietary fiber ingredients expeditiously.
       The agreement directs the FDA to make the report on Tobacco 
     Product User Fees described in H. Rpt. 115-232 publicly 
     available on its website within 60 days of enactment of the 
     Act.
       The agreement notes that the FDA initiated studies 
     concerning glass products for injectable products and directs 
     the FDA to evaluate the agency's study data and any other 
     appropriate available data and report back to the Committees 
     within 45 days on whether it plans to update the 2011 
     Advisory to reflect recent science.
       Concerns remain about the FDA's ability to meet its legal 
     obligation to protect trade secrets and confidential 
     commercial information the agency obtains from its regulated 
     industries. FDA is overdue in providing a detailed 
     description of its systems to ensure protection of such 
     information and is directed to provide this plan within 60 
     days of enactment of this Act.
       The agreement fully supports the requirement for all 
     covered facilities to have food defense plans but concerns 
     have been raised that the final rule entitled ``Mitigation 
     Strategies to Protect Food Against Intentional 
     Adulteration,'' dated May 27, 2016 (81 Fed. Reg. 34165) is 
     overly prescriptive, costly, and inconsistent with current 
     successful practices that have been used to protect the 
     nation's food supply. In order to address the fundamental 
     concerns with the final rule, the agreement urges the Agency 
     to consider providing more time for further collaborative 
     dialogue with stakeholders.


                        BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

       The agreement provides $11,788,000 for the Food and Drug 
     Administration Buildings and Facilities.

                   FDA Innovation Account, Cures Act

       The agreement provides $60,000,000 for the FDA as 
     authorized in the 21st Century Cures Act.

                          INDEPENDENT AGENCIES

                  Commodity Futures Trading Commission

       The agreement provides $249,000,000 for the CFTC, of which 
     $48,000,000 is for the purchase of information technology and 
     of which $2,700,000 is for the Office of Inspector General 
     (OIG). Of this amount for OIG, not less than $350,000 should 
     be for overhead expenses.
       The agreement directs the CFTC to submit, within 30 days of 
     enactment, a detailed spending plan for the allocation of the 
     funds made available, displayed by discrete program, project, 
     and activity, including staffing projections, specifying both 
     FTEs and contractors, and planned investments in information 
     technology.
       The agreement hereby restates the language under the

     DIVISION B--COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES 
                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018

       Report language included in House Report 115-231 (``the 
     House report'') or Senate Report 115-139 (``the Senate 
     report'') that is not changed by this explanatory statement 
     or this Act is approved. The explanatory statement, while 
     repeating some language for emphasis, is not intended to 
     negate the language referred to above unless expressly 
     provided herein. In cases where both the House report and the 
     Senate report address a particular issue not specifically 
     addressed in the explanatory statement, the House report and 
     the Senate report should be read as consistent and are to be 
     interpreted accordingly. In cases where the House report or 
     the Senate report directs the submission of a report, such 
     report is to be submitted to both the House and Senate 
     Committees on Appropriations (``the Committees'').
       Each department and agency funded in this Act shall follow 
     the directions set forth in this Act and the accompanying 
     explanatory statement, and shall not reallocate resources or 
     reorganize activities except as provided herein. 
     Reprogramming procedures shall apply to: funds provided in 
     this Act; unobligated balances from previous appropriations 
     Acts that are available for obligation or expenditure in 
     fiscal year 2018; and non-appropriated resources such as fee 
     collections that are used to meet program requirements in 
     fiscal year 2018. These procedures are specified in section 
     505 of this Act.
       Any reprogramming request shall include any out-year 
     budgetary impacts and a separate accounting of program or 
     mission impacts on estimated carryover funds. Any program, 
     project or activity cited in this statement, or in the House 
     report or the Senate report and not changed by this Act or 
     statement, shall be construed as the position of the Congress 
     and shall not be subject to reductions or reprogramming 
     without prior approval of the Committees. Further, any 
     department or agency funded in this Act that plans a 
     reduction-in-force shall notify the Committees by letter no 
     later than 30 days in advance of the date of any such planned 
     personnel action.
       When a department or agency submits a reprogramming or 
     transfer request to the Committees and does not receive 
     identical responses, it shall be the responsibility of the 
     department or agency seeking the reprogramming to reconcile 
     the differences between the two bodies before proceeding. If 
     reconciliation is not possible, the items in disagreement in 
     the reprogramming or transfer request shall be considered 
     unapproved. Departments and agencies shall not submit 
     reprogramming notifications after July 1, 2018, except in 
     extraordinary circumstances. Any such notification shall 
     include a description of the extraordinary circumstances.
       In compliance with section 532 of this Act, each department 
     and agency funded in this Act shall submit spending plans, 
     signed by the respective department or agency head, for the 
     Committees' review not later than 45 days after enactment of 
     this Act.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Job Losses from Nuclear Power Plant Closures.--As noted in 
     Senate Report 114-239, recent closures of nuclear power 
     plants throughout the United States have had a negative 
     impact on the economic foundations of surrounding 
     communities, and there is potential for additional plant 
     closures in the coming years. EDA can serve an integral role 
     in assisting communities as nuclear plant closures affect the 
     economic landscape of surrounding areas. To that end, EDA is 
     directed to report to the Committees within 90 days of 
     enactment of this Act on its work to help identify and 
     develop best practices to assist communities affected by loss 
     of tax revenue and job loss due to nuclear power plant 
     closures.
       Broadband projects.--EDA funding provided under Public 
     Works, Economic Adjustment Assistance, and other programs may 
     be used to support broadband infrastructure projects. High 
     speed broadband is critical to help communities attract new 
     industries and strengthen and grow local economies. EDA is 
     encouraged to prioritize unserved areas. EDA shall submit a 
     report to the Committees within 30 days of the end of fiscal 
     year 2018 describing the number and value of broadband 
     projects supported with fiscal year 2018 funds.


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       This Act includes $39,000,000 for EDA salaries and 
     expenses.

                  Minority Business Development Agency


                     MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

       This Act includes $39,000,000 for the Minority Business 
     Development Agency (MBDA). In lieu of House language 
     regarding external funding, the agreement directs that not 
     less than 50 percent of funds provided to MBDA shall be 
     awarded through competitive agreements, external awards, and 
     grants.

                   Economic and Statistical Analysis


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       This Act includes $99,000,000 for Economic and Statistical 
     Analysis. The agreement does not adopt the proposed 
     reorganization of the Economics and Statistics Administration 
     (ESA). Senate report language is adopted by reference.

                          Bureau of the Census

       This Act includes $2,814,000,000 for the Bureau of the 
     Census.


                      CURRENT SURVEYS AND PROGRAMS

       This Act includes $270,000,000 for the Current Surveys and 
     Programs account of the Bureau of the Census.


                     PERIODIC CENSUSES AND PROGRAMS

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

       This Act includes $2,544,000,000 for the Periodic Censuses 
     and Programs account of the Bureau of the Census.
       In October 2017, the Secretary of Commerce delivered a new 
     life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Decennial Census 
     totaling $15,625,000,000. In addition to reliance on a new, 
     independent cost estimate (ICE), the Secretary's estimate 
     includes additional assumptions to enhance the robustness and 
     reliability of the program. For example, the new estimate 
     assumes the need for additional in-person follow-up visits 
     due to fewer households initially responding to the Census. 
     The Secretary also requested a funding contingency to address 
     any problems not anticipated by the ICE.
       Approximately 70 percent of the costs of the 2020 Census 
     will be incurred in fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020. In 
     order to ensure Census has the necessary resources to 
     immediately address any issues discovered during the 2018 
     End-To-End Test, and to provide a smoother transition between 
     fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019, this agreement 
     provides half of the amount needed for the 2020 Census for 
     those fiscal years and includes the 2018 contingency amount 
     of $50,000,000 requested by the Secretary. These resources 
     will also allow the Bureau of the Census to move forward with 
     the timely execution of its 2020 Decennial Census 
     communications and partnerships program to improve response 
     rates and enhance trust in the Census. The Census Bureau is 
     directed to ensure that its fiscal year 2018 partnership and 
     communications activities in support of the 2020 Census are 
     conducted at a level of effort and staffing no less than that 
     conducted during fiscal year 2008 in preparation for the 2010 
     Decennial Census. The Census Bureau is further directed to 
     provide the Committees with notification 15 days before any 
     spending it intends to incur in fiscal year 2018 that is 
     above the amounts included in the October 2017 life-cycle 
     cost estimate for fiscal year 2018.
       The agreement modifies House and Senate language requiring 
     the Census Bureau to furnish certain information to the 
     Committees and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
     The Census Bureau shall provide this information no later 
     than 60 days after enactment of this Act. Additionally, the 
     Census Bureau shall include information on the number of open 
     information technology (IT) security plans of actions and 
     milestones for all 2020 Census systems and infrastructure, 
     categorized by whether the underlying weakness or 
     vulnerability is considered critical, high, moderate, or low 
     risk, including a list of those plans of actions and 
     milestones that are not scheduled to be closed within six 
     months.

       National Telecommunications and Information Administration


                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

       This Act includes $39,500,000 for the salaries and expenses 
     of the National Telecommunications and Information 
     Administration (NTIA).

       Broadband.--The agreement provides $7,500,000 to update the 
     national broadband availability map in coordination with the 
     Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which updated its 
     map in February 2018 using Form 477 filing data. The funding 
     provided does not constitute a new program to fund the 
     primary data collection of broadband availability or 
     subscription data, nor is it for funding specific data 
     collection activities by States or third parties. Instead, 
     NTIA should use this funding to acquire and display available 
     third-party data sets to the extent it is able to negotiate 
     its inclusion in existing efforts to augment data from the 
     FCC, other Federal government agencies, State government, and 
     the private sector. NTIA shall not duplicate FCC's efforts. 
     The updated map will help identify regions with insufficient 
     service, especially in rural areas.
       First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet).--NTIA is 
     encouraged to place equal priority on the rural deployment of 
     the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network to that of 
     urban communities.

     requiring agencies to provide at least 15 days advance notice 
     of the disposal of any capital asset not specifically 
     provided for in this Act or other law appropriating funds for 
     the Department of Commerce. As this Act provides for no 
     disposals, the Patent and Trademark Office shall inform the 
     Committees of any capital asset disposal that meets the 
     definition established in section 103.

             National Institute of Standards and Technology

       This Act includes $1,198,500,000 for the National Institute

       This Act provides $724,500,000 for NIST's Scientific and 
     Technical Research and Services (STRS) account. The agreement 
     rejects the proposed terminations and reductions for all STRS 
     programs and provides not less than fiscal year 2017 funding 
     for: Advanced Networks, Connected Systems, and Data Science; 
     Advanced Materials Manufacturing; Biological Science and 
     Health Measurements; Corporate Services; Environmental 
     Measurements; the Office of Special Programs; Quantum

     Excellence (NCCoE) is adopted by reference and NCCoE is 
     provided not less than $33,000,000. Additionally, the 
     agreement adopts Senate report language regarding forensic 
     sciences.
       Disaster Resilient Buildings.--Senate language regarding 
     disaster resilient buildings is not adopted. Instead, within 
     funding provided for Disaster Resilient Buildings, NIST is 
     directed to provide no less than $5,000,000 for competitive 
     external awards. NIST shall be responsive to all grant 
     applicants, including acknowledging receipt of applications, 
     providing feedback to any unsuccessful applicants who request 
     further information, and giving adequate notice of the 
     timeline for announcing awards.

       Manufacturing USA Coordination.--The agreement provides no 
     more than $5,000,000 for NIST's coordination role for all 
     Manufacturing USA institutes across the Federal government. 
     This amount equals NIST's fiscal year 2018 request for this 
     activity. Not later than 60 days after enactment of this Act, 
     NIST shall provide the Committees a report detailing the 
     funding breakout for coordination activities for 
     Manufacturing USA for the last three fiscal years. The report 
     shall address how coordination funding is separate from 
     direct funding provided for Manufacturing USA institutes, or 
     whether there is any overlap.

                  OPERATIONS, RESEARCH, AND FACILITIES

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

       This Act includes a total program level of $3,697,831,000 
     under this account for the coastal, fisheries, marine, 
     weather, satellite and other programs of the National Oceanic 
     and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This total funding 
     level includes $3,536,331,000 in direct appropriations; a 
     transfer of $144,000,000 from balances in the ``Promote and 
     Develop Fishery Products and Research Pertaining to American 
     Fisheries'' fund; and $17,500,000 derived from recoveries of 
     prior year obligations.
       The agreement does not include section 553 of the House 
     bill regarding the National Ocean Policy. No funding was 
     provided in fiscal year 2017, and none was requested by any 
     agencies funded in this Act in fiscal year 2018, to implement 
     the National Ocean Policy. Consequently, no funds for 
     National Ocean Policy activities are included for any agency 
     funded in this Act.

       Northeast Multispecies Fishery.--The Senate language 
     pertaining to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery is adopted. 
     In lieu of Section 537 of the Senate bill, the agreement 
     provides an additional $10,300,000 within Observers and 
     Training to fully fund the cost of At-Sea Monitors in the New 
     England groundfish fishery, including sea and shore side 
     infrastructure costs. NOAA's current assessment is that 
     $20,000,000 covers Standardized Bycatch Reporting Methodology 
     requirements, and NOAA believes that up to $2,500,000 is 
     needed to fully fund the At-Sea Monitoring costs, for a total 
     of $22,500,000, which is provided. NOAA is directed to fully 
     fund the At-Sea Monitoring costs. It is noted that NOAA has 
     estimated the additional costs of fully funding these 
     activities to be anywhere from $850,000 to $10,300,000. That 
     variation in range is unacceptable. The spending plan 
     submitted under section 505 of this Act shall include a final 
     amount needed to fully fund At-Sea Monitoring.
       Fishery Science Centers.--The agreement does not include 
     section 548 of the House bill regarding the relocation of 
     NOAA fishery science centers. No funding was requested, and 
     no funding is provided in this Act to permanently relocate 
     any such centers during fiscal year 2018.
       Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper.--House and Senate language 
     regarding red snapper assessments in the Gulf of Mexico is 
     adopted, and up to $10,000,000 within Fisheries Data 
     Collections, Surveys and Assessments shall be available for 
     carrying out such purposes.
       Pacific Salmon Treaty.--The agreement adopts the Senate 
     recommended funding level to continue negotiations and 
     implement necessary Pacific Salmon Treaty agreements.
       Fishery Management Council Fund Report.--The agreement 
     expands the reporting requirement in the Senate report to 
     include all Fishery Management Councils. NOAA shall work with 
     the Committees and the Councils to establish the appropriate 
     scope and format for this report.
       Atlantic Striped Bass.--The Atlantic States Marine Fishery 
     Commission is completing a new stock assessment of Atlantic 
     Striped Bass in 2018. After this assessment is complete, the 
     Secretary of Commerce is directed to use this assessment to 
     review the Federal moratorium on Atlantic Striped Bass.
       Block Island Transit Zone.--NOAA, in consultation with the 
     Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, is directed to 
     consider lifting the ban on striped bass fishing in the 
     Federal Block Island Transit Zone.
       Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported (IUU) Fishing.--The 
     agreement adopts Senate language regarding IUU fishing, and 
     provides an additional $1,200,000 under Fisheries Management 
     Programs and Services to implement the program described in 
     section 539 of this Act.

       Quarterly Briefings.--Continuous reports of management and 
     staffing challenges across the NWS are unacceptable. NOAA and 
     the Department of Commerce are directed to ensure that the 
     NWS fulfills its critical mission to protect the lives and 
     property of our nation's citizens. The agreement adopts 
     Senate language regarding NWS vacancies and the fiscal year 
     2018 spend plan, but clarifies that this plan should 
     distinguish between funded and unfunded vacancies. 
     Additionally, NOAA shall provide quarterly briefings to the 
     Committees on all NWS management and budget issues, to 
     include: a list of funded vacancies, by type and location, 
     including the length of time the positions have been vacant; 
     the Program, Project, or Activity (PPA) from which each 
     vacancy is funded, and the plan for addressing each vacancy; 
     an update on the implementation of the Operations and 
     Workforce Analysis; budget execution by PPA; major 
     procurements; and other topics as appropriate. Additionally, 
     in the fiscal year 2020 President's Budget submission for 
     NWS, the Department of Commerce shall document the funded 
     position vacancy rate and lapse assumptions built into the 
     budget request by PPA.
       Hydrology and Water Resource Programs.--In addition to 
     Senate language regarding the National Water Center, and in 
     lieu of Senate language under OAR, the agreement provides an 
     additional $6,000,000 for NWS, in coordination with OAR, to 
     collaborate with external academic partners to improve fine 
     and large-scale measurements of snow depth and soil moisture 
     data that can be used to expand and improve the National 
     Water Model and contribute directly to the mission of NOAA's 
     National Water Center. The agreement reiterates Senate 
     language recognizing the success of research-to-operations 
     efforts and external partnerships.
       Facilities Maintenance.--The agreement provides $16,000,000 
     for the National Weather Service's highest priority 
     facilities repair and deferred maintenance requirements at 
     Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs). NWS has nearly completed its 
     nationwide facilities condition assessment, and has a 
     comprehensive analysis of conditions, itemized deferred 
     maintenance list, and projected lifecycle costs for NOAA's 
     network of WFOs. There is concern that current conditions and 
     deferred maintenance items include issues that may 
     significantly affect operational readiness, service delivery, 
     or occupant safety. Thirty days prior to obligating any of 
     these additional facilities repair and deferred maintenance 
     funds, NWS shall submit a report providing the following 
     information: (1) a prioritized list of NWS deferred 
     facilities maintenance needs, based on the facilities 
     condition assessment, including an explanation of how such 
     list was prioritized; (2) an estimate of the total amount and 
     composition of deferred facilities maintenance, including an 
     explanation of how such estimate was developed; and (3) an 
     explanation of how NWS maintains information on, and manages, 
     its deferred maintenance needs and activities.

       This Act includes $1,311,492,000 for the salaries and 
     expenses of the United States Marshals Service (USMS). Within 
     funding provided, the Act supports the USMS's request of 
     $12,000,000 for life and safety equipment and training. Also 
     within this appropriation, the Act provides additional 
     funding for deputy U.S. marshals to meet the growing workload 
     associated with: increasing law enforcement initiatives; 
     enhancing enforcement of laws relating to international 
     travel of sex offenders; and expanding the regional fugitive 
     task force program.


                              construction

       This Act includes $53,400,000 for construction and related 
     expenses in space controlled, occupied or utilized by the 
     USMS for prisoner holding and related support. The USMS is 
     expected to apply this funding to its top ten priority 
     projects.

     Drug Enforcement Task Forces, of which $375,000,000 is for 
     investigations and $167,850,000 is for prosecutions. The 
     increase in resources is provided to enhance investigations 
     and prosecutions of major drug trafficking organizations with 
     a focus on reducing the availability of opioids.

                    Federal Bureau of Investigation


                         salaries and expenses

       This Act includes $9,030,202,000 for the salaries and 
     expenses of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), 
     including $1,740,000,000 for Intelligence, $3,660,200,000 for 
     Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence, $3,090,000,000 for 
     Criminal Enterprises and Federal Crimes, and $540,000,000 for 
     Criminal Justice Services.
       Within funding provided, the FBI is expected to enhance its 
     investigative and intelligence efforts related to terrorism, 
     national security, and cyber threats, to include 
     strengthening the Cyber Division. Also within the level of 
     funding provided, the FBI shall ensure that the National 
     Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) operations 
     more adequately address background check demand and improve 
     NICS performance, including enhancing system availability, 
     determination rates, and E-Check services. DOJ is also 
     directed to consult with and provide technical guidance to 
     help other Federal departments and agencies fulfill their 
     obligation to submit all relevant records into the NICS 
     database.
       Communication and information sharing.--The FBI is directed 
     to review protocols associated with communication and 
     information sharing between the Public Access Line and FBI 
     field offices, and to report to the Committees within 60 days 
     of enactment of this Act on potential improvements.
       Law enforcement medical demonstration.--Within 60 days of 
     enactment of this Act, the FBI shall update the Committees on 
     efforts to formalize its existing external partnership with a 
     civilian academic medical center, including the FBI's use of 
     medical communications systems and Level I trauma centers to 
     support contingency planning and improve the delivery of 
     medical care for high risk law enforcement missions.
       Canine Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate (WMDD) 
     research.--The agreement adopts Senate report language 
     regarding the Hazardous Devices School, which supports the 
     Bureau's WMDD detector canine program. The Act clarifies that 
     funding direction for these canine activities shall be at a 
     level above fiscal year 2017 that adequately supports the 
     operations and ongoing development of this program.
       Countering election-related threats.--Within the increased 
     funding provided, the FBI is directed to make the 
     counterintelligence and cyber-related investments necessary 
     to help respond to foreign actors, including those seeking to 
     compromise democratic institutions and processes. It is 
     expected that the FBI will invest in initiatives that will 
     assist in enhanced source development, deployment of 
     additional surveillance assets, implementation of other 
     sophisticated targeting techniques, or other investigative 
     activities deemed necessary to thwart foreign actors. These 
     investments will also aid the FBI in carrying out its roles 
     and responsibilities pursuant to the January 2017 designation 
     of election infrastructure as part of the nation's critical 
     infrastructure, thereby facilitating enhanced information 
     sharing between the Federal government and State and local 
     election officials responsible for running Federal elections 
     in this country. The FBI shall brief the Committees not later 
     than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act on its 
     plans to carry out these initiatives.
       Human trafficking.--Within the funds provided, the FBI is 
     expected to increase resources devoted to human trafficking 
     investigations.


                              construction

       This Act includes $370,000,000 for FBI construction, which 
     supports the Senate's language on 21st Century Facilities and 
     provides additional funding above the requested level for the 
     FBI to address its highest priorities outside of the 
     immediate national capital area.
       FBI Headquarters.--The Act does not include funding for the 
     revised Headquarters consolidation plan released on February 
     12, 2018, because many questions regarding the new plan 
     remain unanswered, including the revision of longstanding 
     security requirements and changes to headquarters capacity in 
     the national capital region. Until these concerns are 
     addressed and the appropriate authorizing Committees approve 
     a prospectus, the Committees are reluctant to appropriate 
     additional funds for this activity.

                    Drug Enforcement Administration


                         salaries and expenses

       This Act includes a direct appropriation of $2,190,326,000 
     for the salaries and expenses of the Drug Enforcement 
     Administration (DEA). In addition, DEA expects to derive 
     $419,574,000 from fees deposited in the Diversion Control 
     Fund to carry out the Diversion Control Program, resulting in 
     $2,609,900,000 in total spending authority for DEA. To meet 
     the rising threats from heroin, fentanyl, and other opioids, 
     additional funding is included to: expand opioid and heroin 
     enforcement efforts, including supporting existing heroin 
     enforcement teams and establishing new ones; invest in the 
     Fentanyl Signature Profiling Program and law enforcement 
     safety; and accelerate efforts to dismantle transnational 
     criminal organizations and cartels. Senate report language 
     regarding Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys is adopted, and 
     additional resources for prosecutors are included under U.S. 
     Attorneys. DEA shall provide a briefing on heroin and opioid 
     investigations and prosecutions not later than 90 days after 
     the date of enactment of this Act. The agreement also 
     provides not less than $10,000,000 for DEA to perform 
     methamphetamine lab cleanup.

          Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives


                         salaries and expenses

       This Act includes $1,293,776,000 for the salaries and 
     expenses of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
     Explosives (ATF). Within the amount provided, resources are 
     allocated to fully fund the requested program increases, as 
     well as for an increase of not less than $10,000,000 for 
     activities, as specified in the House report, for the 
     National Firearms Act Division, Federal Firearms and 
     Explosives Licensing Centers, the Import Branch, and the 
     eForms system.
       Canine Training Center.--The agreement does not include 
     section 539 of the House bill regarding the relocation of 
     ATF's Canine Training Center. The agreement modifies Senate 
     language regarding National Center for Explosives Training 
     and Research only as it pertains to canine operations to 
     clarify that no relocations are anticipated during fiscal 
     year 2018.

                         Federal Prison System


                         salaries and expenses

                     (including transfer of funds)

       This Act includes $7,114,000,000 for the salaries and 
     expenses of the Federal Prison System. House and Senate 
     report language on treatment programming is adopted.


                        buildings and facilities

       This Act includes $161,571,000 for the construction, 
     acquisition, modernization, maintenance, and repair of prison 
     and detention facilities housing Federal inmates. Additional 
     funding above the request is included for the highest 
     priority deferred maintenance and repair (M&R) projects. The 
     Bureau of Prisons shall provide a list of planned M&R 
     projects to be carried out, with estimated costs and 
     completion dates, with the fiscal year 2018 spending plan 
     provided to the Committees, as well as an updated listing of 
     remaining unfunded M&R projects.

                              incorporated

     of $2,700,000 for Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated.

               State and Local Law Enforcement Activities

       In total, this Act includes $2,934,300,000 for State and 
     local law enforcement and crime prevention programs. This 
     amount includes $2,842,300,000 in discretionary budget 
     authority, of which $492,000,000 is derived by transfer from 
     the Crime Victims Fund. This amount also includes $92,000,000 
     scored as mandatory for Public Safety Officer Benefits.
       House and Senate report language regarding management and 
     administration expenses is adopted by reference, and it is 
     clarified that the Department's methodology for assessing 
     these costs should be both fair and equitable across all 
     grant programs.
       The agreement includes a limitation on obligations from the 
     Crime Victims Fund of $4,436,000,000 as stipulated in section 
     510 of this Act.
       Compliance with Federal laws.--The agreement does not 
     include section 554 of the House bill regarding funding for 
     the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). The 
     agreement adopts Senate language directing the Department to 
     ensure

[[Page H2092]]

     Assistance Grants (Byrne-JAG), Community Oriented Policing 
     Services (COPS) grants, and SCAAP funds are in compliance 
     with all applicable Federal laws.

  TOTAL, State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance...      $1,677,500
------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) programs.--
     The agreement provides a total of $330,000,000 for DOJ's CARA 
     programs, an increase of $227,000,000 above the fiscal year 
     2017 level, including $132,000,000 above the fiscal year 2017 
     level for the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Program (COAP). It 
     is expected that the Bureau of Justice Assistance will not 
     only be able to make additional site-based program awards 
     under the existing COAP structure, but will be able to expand 
     COAP offerings to include prevention and education programs 
     for youth, community engagement by law enforcement, response 
     teams to assist children dealing with the aftermath of opioid 
     addiction, and family court programming relating to treatment 
     for opioids. Senate report language on the Law Enforcement 
     Assisted Diversion (LEAD) model is adopted.
       NICS Initiative grants.--While the agreement includes a 
     $2,000,000 increase for the NICS Initiative grant program, 
     the Committees remain deeply concerned over problematic 
     applications from States for the National Criminal History 
     Improvement Program (NCHIP) and NICS Act Record Improvement 
     Program (NARIP) grants, which result in fewer grants being 
     awarded than were funded by appropriations. Over the past 
     several fiscal years, far too many proposals from States have 
     been out-of-scope, of poor quality, or requested excessive 
     funding to replace an entire criminal justice records system, 
     leading DOJ to exclude them. The Office of Justice Programs 
     (OJP) is directed to consult with State and tribal 
     governments to provide training and technical assistance in 
     completing a successful application for both of these grant 
     programs, including expressly outlining what is in scope for 
     project needs, information technology, and cost.
       Victims of Trafficking grants.--The agreement provides 
     $77,000,000 for the Victims of Trafficking Grant program, as 
     authorized by Public Law 106-386 and amended by Public Law 
     113-4, of which no less than $22,000,000 is for the Enhanced 
     Collaborative Model to Combat Human Trafficking Task Force 
     Program. This funding level also includes $10,000,000 for the 
     Minor Victims of Trafficking Grant program, of which 
     $8,000,000 is for victim services grants for sex-trafficked 
     minors as authorized by Public Law 113-4, with the remaining 
     $2,000,000 for victim services grants for labor-trafficked 
     minors. The Committees encourage DOJ to work in close 
     coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services 
     to facilitate collaboration and reduce duplication of 
     efforts.
       Capital Litigation Improvement and Wrongful Conviction 
     Review Grant programs.--The Committees direct that at least 
     50 percent of the $3,000,000 appropriated to the Capital 
     Litigation Improvement and Wrongful Conviction Review grant 
     programs be used to support entities that represent 
     individuals with post-conviction claims of innocence and 
     provide legal representation; case review, evaluation, and 
     management; experts; and investigation services related to 
     these innocence claims.
       Paul Coverdell Forensic Science.--The alarming 
     proliferation of heroin and synthetic drugs like fentanyl 
     have had a crushing effect on State crime labs, resulting in 
     a significant increase in the backlog. Synthetics in 
     particular take much longer to analyze than traditional drugs 
     and chemicals. Medical examiners and pathologists have also 
     been overwhelmed with the volume of autopsies as a result of 
     heroin and synthetic drug-related overdose deaths. The 
     recommendation provides an additional $17,000,000 for the 
     Coverdell program to specifically target the challenges the 
     opioid epidemic has brought to the forensics community.


                       JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAMS

       This Act includes $282,500,000 for Juvenile Justice 
     programs. These funds are distributed as follows:

     prime mission in 2014, has a prime mission lifetime of 20 
     years.
       Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST).--In lieu of 
     House and Senate language regarding WFIRST, the agreement 
     includes $150,000,000 for WFIRST, which is the highest 
     priority of the 2010 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. In October 
     2017, NASA received the findings from the WFIRST Independent 
     External Technical/Management/Cost Review (WIETR), which 
     found in part that the current science management strategy is 
     appropriate and that the Class B risk classification for the 
     WFIRST mission is not consistent with NASA policy for 
     strategically important missions with comparable levels of 
     investment and risk, most if not all of which are class A 
     missions. Accordingly, NASA shall provide to the Committees 
     within 60 days of enactment of this Act a preliminary life

       DIVISION C--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018

       The following is an explanation of the effects of this Act, 
     which makes appropriations for the Department of Defense for 
     fiscal year 2018. The joint explanatory statement 
     accompanying this division is approved and indicates 
     congressional intent. Unless otherwise noted, the language 
     set forth in House Report 115-219 warrants full compliance 
     and carries the same weight as language included in this 
     joint explanatory statement unless specifically addressed to 
     the contrary in the bill or this joint explanatory statement. 
     While some language is repeated for emphasis, this 
     explanatory statement does not intend to negate the language 
     referred to above unless expressly provided herein.


              definition of program, project, and activity

       For the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
     Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-177), as amended 
     by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
     Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-119), and by the 
     Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508), the 
     terms ``program, project, and activity'' for appropriations 
     contained in this Act shall be defined as the most specific 
     level of budget items identified in the Department of Defense 
     Appropriations Act, 2018, the related classified annexes and 
     explanatory statements, and the P-1 and R-1 budget 
     justification documents as subsequently modified by 
     congressional action.
       The following exception to the above definition shall 
     apply: the military personnel and the operation and 
     maintenance accounts, for which the term ``program, project, 
     and activity'' is defined as the appropriations accounts 
     contained in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act.
       At the time the President submits the budget request for 
     fiscal year 2019, the Secretary of Defense is directed to 
     transmit to the congressional defense committees budget 
     justification documents to be known as the ``M-1'' and the 
     ``O-1'' which shall identify, at the budget activity, 
     activity group, and sub-activity group level, the amounts 
     requested by the President to be appropriated to the 
     Department of Defense for military personnel and operation 
     and maintenance in any budget request, or amended budget 
     request, for fiscal year 2019.


                         reprogramming guidance

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow 
     the reprogramming guidance for acquisition accounts as 
     specified in the report accompanying the House version of the 
     Department of Defense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 
     2008 (House Report 110-279). The dollar threshold for 
     reprogramming funds shall be $10,000,000 for military 
     personnel; $20,000,000 for operation and maintenance; 
     $20,000,000 for procurement; and $10,000,000 for research, 
     development, test and evaluation.
       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is 
     directed to continue to provide the congressional defense 
     committees annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and II 
     and quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for 
     Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of 
     this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with 
     guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying 
     the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The 
     Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior 
     approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified 
     dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or 
     research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is 
     less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for 
     reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. 
     Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of 
     a military personnel (M-1), an operation and maintenance (O-
     1), a procurement (P-1), or a research, development, test and 
     evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the 
     Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval 
     reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In 
     addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval 
     reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest 
     items are established elsewhere in this statement.


                           funding increases

       The funding increases outlined in the tables for each 
     appropriation account shall be provided only for the specific 
     purposes indicated in the tables.


                  congressional special interest items

       Items for which additional funds have been provided or 
     items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in 
     the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase 
     ``only for'' or ``only to'' are congressional special 
     interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming 
     (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD 
     Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically addressed in 
     the explanatory statement.


                            CLASSIFIED ANNEX

       Adjustments to classified programs are addressed in the 
     accompanying classified annex.


                  SERVICE UNFUNDED REQUIREMENTS LISTS

       The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees 
     recognize that each military Service submits an annual 
     unfunded requirements list to the congressional defense 
     committees that provides insight into requirements that may 
     have been excluded from the budget request due to budgetary 
     constraints. However, the lists are often divided into 
     various categories of items, thereby obscuring the true 
     prioritization of the requests. The Chiefs of Staff of the 
     Army and the Air Force, the Chief of Naval Operations, and 
     the Commandant of the Marine Corps are directed to provide 
     their individual Service unfunded requirements in 
     consolidated priority lists for future budget submissions.


                      RAPID ACQUISITION AUTHORITY

       The Secretary of Defense or his designee, in conjunction 
     with the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), is 
     directed to provide to the congressional defense committees, 
     not later than 5 days following notification of the 
     Secretary's intent to execute or previous application of 
     Rapid Acquisition Authority (RAA), the following: the 
     documented requirement intended to be addressed by use of 
     RAA; the Service or defense agency charged with implementing 
     the material solution identified; the identification of funds 
     affected by the use of RAA by appropriations account, line, 
     and/or program element, to include outyear funding 
     requirements by fiscal year; an explanation as to why source 
     funds are available to fund this higher priority item; and 
     details of, and justification for, the contract type or other 
     transaction authority being utilized.
       In addition, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) 
     is directed to provide to the congressional defense 
     committees a complete accounting of the use of RAA by fiscal 
     year not later than 30 days after the end of each fiscal 
     year. The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is further 
     directed to provide guidance to the Services and defense 
     agencies to appropriately identify previously received RAA 
     funds and items funded in budget exhibits and briefings 
     provided to the congressional defense committees in support 
     of Department of Defense budget requests and, where 
     appropriate, to update the Financial Management Regulation to 
     that effect. Finally, it is noted that funds for RAA 
     initiatives often are executed in place within the program 
     identified as the funding source regardless of the original 
     purpose for which funds were appropriated or the urgent 
     requirement being addressed, and without any apportionment 
     documents being generated. The Under Secretary of Defense 
     (Comptroller) is directed to provide a briefing on the impact 
     of RAA funding mechanisms on Financial Improvement and Audit 
     Readiness efforts to the congressional defense committees not 
     later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act.


     BUDGETING FOR THE JOINT IMPROVISED-THREAT DEFEAT ORGANIZATION

       The fiscal year 2018 budget request includes $14,442,000 in 
     base appropriations and $483,058,000 in overseas contingency 
     operations appropriations for the Joint Improvised-Threat 
     Defeat Organization (JIDO) in the Joint Improvised-Threat 
     Defeat Fund (JITDF). In addition, the fiscal year 2018 budget 
     request includes $97,788,000 in the Operation and 
     Maintenance, Defense-Wide base appropriation for the JIDO, 
     reflecting the transition of the activities, functions, and 
     resources of the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Agency (JIDA) 
     to the JIDO under the authority, direction, and control of 
     the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, as directed by Congress 
     and implemented as of September 30, 2016.
       The agreement includes no funds in base or overseas 
     contingency operations appropriations in the JITDF. Instead, 
     funding for the JIDO is recommended in the Operation and 
     Maintenance, Defense-Wide; Procurement, Defense-Wide; and 
     Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Defense-Wide 
     overseas contingency operations appropriations accounts only 
     for the purpose of allowing the Director of JIDO to 
     investigate, develop, and provide equipment, supplies, 
     services, training, facilities, personnel, and funds to 
     assist United States forces in the defeat of improvised 
     explosive devices in accordance with JIDO's fiscal year 2018 
     budget execution plans, as subsequently adjusted.
       The Director, Office of Management and Budget, Under 
     Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), and Director, Cost 
     Assessment and Program Evaluation are directed to assist the 
     Director, Defense Threat Reduction Agency and Director, JIDO 
     to ensure a seamless transition of funding for JIDO from the 
     JITDF to regular appropriation accounts in fiscal year 2018 
     without negatively impacting the mission of JIDO. Funds still 
     available in the JITDF and its predecessor account, the Joint 
     Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF) remain 
     available for execution consistent with prior year guidance. 
     It is expected that the JITDF and JIEDDF will be terminated 
     once those balances liquidate or expire, whichever comes 
     first.


                         CYBERSPACE ACTIVITIES

       The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), the 
     Department of Defense Chief Information Officer, and the 
     Service Secretaries are directed, with the fiscal year 2020 
     budget submission, to initiate the establishment of 
     individual cyberspace activity projects for research, 
     development, test and evaluation accounts; individual 
     cyberspace activity sub-activity groups for operation and 
     maintenance accounts; and individual budget line items for 
     procurement accounts. Funds that cross capability lines and 
     are more appropriately documented within non-cyberspace 
     activity projects, sub-activity groups, and line items may 
     continue to be reported as such, but should include specific

[[Page H2117]]

     cyber language and resource amounts within the appropriate 
     non-cyberspace operation and maintenance; procurement; and 
     research, development, test and evaluation budget 
     justification material and shall be referenced in any 
     cyberspace justification materials. Such inclusion of cyber 
     activities in non-cyber projects, sub-activity groups, and 
     line items shall be carried out in the most limited manner as 
     possible to meet congressional intent.
       Funding appropriated for cyberspace activities as defined 
     by the classified cyberspace activities information 
     technology investment budget request for fiscal year 2018 may 
     only be used for such activities. The Secretary of Defense is 
     directed to use normal prior approval reprogramming 
     procedures to obligate funding appropriated to the operation 
     and maintenance; procurement; or research, development, test 
     and evaluation accounts for cyberspace activities for any 
     other purpose. The Chief Information Officer is directed to 
     submit to the House and Senate Defense Appropriations 
     Subcommittees two reports not later than May 30, 2018, and 
     November 30, 2018, that provide the mid-year and end of 
     fiscal year financial obligation and execution data for 
     cyberspace activities for the previous and current fiscal 
     years.

                      TITLE I--MILITARY PERSONNEL

     REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE ACCOUNTS

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for 
     Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2018 
     appropriation accounts not later than 60 days after the 
     enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited 
     from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any 
     purpose other than originally appropriated until the 
     aforementioned report is submitted to the House and Senate 
     Defense Appropriations Subcommittees.
       The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal 
     prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in 
     the Services' operation and maintenance accounts between O-1 
     budget activities, or between sub-activity groups in the case 
     of Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide, in excess of 
     $20,000,000.
       The agreement establishes new reprogramming rules for 
     transferring funding out of readiness sub-activity groups, 
     which are defined as follows:
       Army:
       Maneuver units
       Modular support brigades
       Aviation assets
       Land forces operations support
       Force readiness operations support

       During fiscal year 2018, the Service Secretaries are 
     directed to submit written notification to the congressional 
     defense committees not later than 30 days prior to 
     implementing transfers in excess of $20,000,000 out of any 
     readiness sub-activity if the funds will be transferred into 
     another readiness sub-activity. However, if funding is 
     transferred out of any readiness sub-activity into a non-
     readiness sub-activity, the Secretary of Defense is directed 
     to use normal prior approval reprogramming procedures.
       The Service Secretaries are further directed to include an 
     enclosure with each written notification that includes 
     increases and decreases by sub-activity group, a detailed 
     justification explaining why the sources of funding are 
     available and why the increases are necessary, and an 
     explanation of the impact on resources included in the fiscal 
     year 2019 budget request for each increase and decrease. All 
     transfers may be implemented 30 days after congressional 
     notification unless an objection is received from one of the 
     congressional defense committees.
       Additionally, the Secretary of Defense is directed to use 
     normal prior approval reprogramming procedures when 
     implementing transfers in excess of $20,000,000 into the 
     following budget sub-activities:
       Operation and Maintenance, Army:
       Other personnel support/recruiting and advertising
       Operation and Maintenance, Army National Guard:
       Other personnel support/recruiting and advertising
       This language replaces the language included under the 
     heading ``Reprogramming Guidance for Operation and 
     Maintenance Accounts'' in House Report 115-219.


            OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

       Items for which additional funds have been provided or have 
     been specifically reduced as shown in the project level 
     tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ``only for'' or 
     ``only to'' in the explanatory statement are congressional 
     special interest items for the purpose of the Base for 
     Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be 
     carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as 
     specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below 
     Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or 
     reduce funding from congressional special interest items as 
     identified on the DD Form 1414.


                          RESTORING READINESS

       The agreement provides additional readiness funds for the 
     Services within the operation and maintenance accounts. This 
     funding shall be used only to improve military readiness, 
     including increased training, depot maintenance, and base 
     operations support. None of the funding provided may be used 
     for recruiting, marketing, or advertising programs. The 
     readiness funding provided is a congressional special 
     interest item. The Secretary of Defense and the Service 
     Secretaries are directed to submit a detailed spend plan by 
     sub-activity group to the House and Senate Defense 
     Appropriations Subcommittees not less than 30 days prior to 
     the obligation of these funds. These transfers may be 
     implemented 30 days after congressional notification unless 
     an objection is received from either the House or Senate 
     Defense Appropriations Subcommittees.


                 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FLEXIBILITY

       The agreement includes two adjustments for fiscal year 2018 
     to provide more flexibility of funding within the operation 
     and maintenance accounts of this bill. The changes apply to 
     fiscal year 2018 only and address the concerns expressed by 
     senior leadership of the Department of Defense to be able to 
     expend readiness funding within the confines of existing 
     controls, while still ensuring accountability of the 
     disbursement of taxpayer funds. These adjustments are 
     necessary due to the delay of the final passage of this 
     year's appropriation bill, combined with the large funding 
     increase made possible by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, 
     which provides a stable top-line level of funding for fiscal 
     years 2018 and 2019.
       The first adjustment for flexibility is to Section 8004, 
     which restricts obligations in the last two months of the 
     fiscal year to 20 percent. This restriction is also known as 
     the ``80/20 rule.'' The agreement allows for the alleviation 
     of the limitation by increasing the amount from 20 percent to 
     25 percent. This will allow the Services and the Department 
     more flexibility to obligate annual funds within fiscal year 
     2018.
       The second adjustment is to reprogramming guidelines for 
     readiness funding. The readiness accounts identified in this 
     agreement under ``Reprogramming Guidance for Operation and 
     Maintenance Accounts'' will not require prior approval, only 
     notification, for realignments between identified readiness 
     budget lines. It is understood that realignments are required 
     for unforeseen operational requirements or changes due to 
     program cost increases or schedule delays. Commensurate with 
     the lifting of the realignment restrictions, for fiscal year 
     2018, the funding amount for the below threshold limitation 
     has been increased from $15,000,000 to $20,000,000.


       ADDITIONAL READINESS FUNDING FOR OPERATIONS IN THE PACIFIC

       The agreement includes funding for the Army and the Air 
     Force to begin the replenishment process in order to 
     accelerate readiness in the Pacific region. The increased 
     funding will yield greater operational readiness to forces 
     serving in the Pacific area of responsibility, specifically 
     in the Republic of Korea, by investing in additional 
     training, equipment, and supplies. This funding is a 
     congressional special interest item. The Secretary of the 
     Army and the Secretary of the Air Force are directed to 
     submit a detailed spend plan by sub-activity group to the 
     House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees not 
     less than 30 days prior to the obligation of these funds.


                      MAINTENANCE OF REAL PROPERTY

       The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and 
     Sustainment), in conjunction with the Service Secretaries, is 
     directed to submit a report to the congressional defense 
     committees not later than 180 days after the enactment of 
     this Act that outlines the total real property with a zero 
     percent utilization rate of five years or more currently 
     accounted for in the Department of Defense real property 
     inventory database and assesses the feasibility of conveying 
     or selling this property.


                      DRINKING WATER CONTAMINATION

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide quarterly 
     reports to the congressional defense committees on the extent 
     of the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances contamination in 
     drinking water problem, plans for community notification, and 
     procedures for timely remediation.


               BOARDS FOR CORRECTION OF MILITARY RECORDS

       The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Service 
     Secretaries, is directed to submit a complete needs 
     assessment of each Board for Correction of Military Records 
     to the congressional defense committees not later than 180 
     days after the enactment of this Act.


      REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, 
                      ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit a report to 
     the congressional defense committees, not later than two 
     years after the enactment of this Act, that describes and 
     assesses current Department of Defense programs to improve 
     opportunities for Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
     Mathematics (STEM) education for military children and 
     efforts to increase opportunities and achievement in STEM 
     education for military children.


          ARMS SALES IMPACT ON INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW

       The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the 
     Secretary of State, is directed to conduct an assessment on 
     whether United States-supplied defense articles and services 
     have contributed to violations of human rights by recipient 
     countries in the past three years. A report detailing the 
     assessment shall be provided to the congressional defense 
     committees not later than 180 days after the enactment of 
     this Act.

                    investing in squadron innovation

       Fostering a culture of innovation at the squadron command 
     level to outpace the efforts of competitors in a more complex 
     and dangerous international security environment is a top 
     priority of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The vision 
     is to designate specific resources to spur original, creative 
     thinking by airmen to solve unit, wing, and day-to-day issues 
     and readiness challenges. In support of these efforts, the 
     Secretary of the Air Force may spend up to $64,100,000 of 
     fiscal year 2018 operation and maintenance funding to 
     encourage this type of innovation across the active, guard, 
     and reserve components. In order to assess this investment, 
     the Secretary of the Air Force is directed to provide a 
     briefing to the House and Senate Defense Appropriations 
     Subcommittees not later than September 30, 2018, that shall 
     include, but not be limited to, squadron innovation funding 
     execution details; examples of successful innovative ideas; 
     lessons learned; and a determination of whether or not 
     funding beyond fiscal year 2018 will be pursued.

              SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND BUDGET EXECUTION

       The consistent realignment of the Special Operations 
     Command's operation and maintenance funding during the year 
     of execution is concerning. The agreement directs the 
     Secretary of Defense to submit a baseline report that shows 
     the Special Operations Command's operation and maintenance 
     funding by sub-activity group for the fiscal year 2018 
     appropriation not later than 60 days after the enactment of 
     this Act. The Secretary of Defense is further directed to 
     submit quarterly execution reports to the congressional 
     defense committees not later than 45 days after the end of 
     each fiscal quarter that addresses the rationale for the 
     realignment of any funds within and between budget sub-
     activities and the movement of any base funds used to support 
     Overseas Contingency Operations. Finally, the Secretary of 
     Defense is directed to notify the congressional defense 
     committees 30 days prior to the realignment of funds in 
     excess of $20,000,000 between sub-activity groups. This 
     language replaces the language included under the heading 
     ``Special Operations Command Budget Execution'' in House 
     Report 115-219.


      SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE BUDGET 
                             JUSTIFICATION

       The agreement directs the Commander of the Special 
     Operations Command (SOCOM), in coordination with the Under 
     Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Assistant 
     Secretary of Defense (Special Operations/Low-Intensity 
     Conflict), to submit a report that provides a detailed 
     proposal on how to restructure and formalize the budget 
     formulation and execution of the SOCOM budget by sub-activity 
     group. This report shall also address how the proposed 
     restructure will improve visibility of the SOCOM budget and 
     execution and shall be submitted to the House and Senate 
     Defense Appropriations Subcommittees not later than 90 days 
     after the enactment of this Act.


             WOMEN'S MILITARY SERVICE MEMORIALS AND MUSEUMS

       The agreement fully funds Women's Military Service 
     Memorials and Museums at $5,000,000, as requested in fiscal

                         PROHIBITED INGREDIENTS

       The Department's focus on ensuring that servicemembers are 
     provided healthy, nutritious food is an important part of 
     military readiness. The Defense Logistics Agency's (DLA) 
     recent notice regarding certain prohibited ingredients lacked 
     stakeholder input and was rightfully rescinded. Efforts by 
     DLA to work with industry to assess the impact of reducing or 
     eliminating certain ingredients is an important first step. 
     However, concerns remain about the lack of transparency and 
     scientific justification for restricting certain ingredients. 
     Prior to obligating funding to enact guidance on prohibited 
     ingredients, the Director of DLA is directed to publish 
     scientific justification for DLA's August 2017 notice titled 
     ``Request for Disclosure Regarding Prohibited Ingredients''; 
     establish a plan to provide transparent scientific 
     justification; and seek input from a broad group of 
     stakeholders including the Department of Agriculture and the 
     Department of Health and Human Services in accordance with 
     the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act of 
     1990 (PL 101-445; 7 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.) on all future 
     nutrition, food or ingredient changes. The Director of DLA is 
     also directed to provide notification to the congressional 
     defense subcommittees of the agency's plans to implement the 
     above requirements.

     BUDGETING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ACQUISITION WORKFORCE

       To restore program and funding stability for the Department 
     of Defense acquisition workforce, while retaining its unique 
     authorities to ensure the Department of Defense has the 
     capacity in both personnel and skills needed to perform its 
     acquisition mission, the agreement provides a direct 
     appropriation of $500,000,000 for the Department of Defense 
     Acquisition Workforce Development Fund (DAWDF). As with the 
     President's budget request for fiscal year 2019, the Under 
     Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is expected to follow this 
     budgeting approach in future budget submissions.
       The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and 
     Sustainment) is directed to submit a report to the 
     congressional defense committees not later than 90 days after 
     the enactment of this Act that identifies all budgeted costs 
     for the Department of Defense acquisition workforce by fiscal 
     year and funding category across the future years defense 
     program in the DAWDF, as well as in regular operation and 
     maintenance and research, development, test and evaluation 
     accounts. In addition, the Under Secretary of Defense 
     (Acquisition and Sustainment) is directed to identify to the 
     congressional defense committees the costs budgeted to pay 
     the salaries of personnel to manage the DAWDF, per Section 
     843 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
     2018; to provide a cost estimate for the proposed Program 
     Manager Development Program, per Section 841 of the National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018; and to 
     identify any unfunded fiscal year 2019 requirements for the 
     Department of Defense acquisition workforce.


      REPORTING REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE ACQUISITION WORKFORCE

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide the 
     comprehensive plan required in accordance with Section 841 of 
     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 
     to the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees 
     as well as the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and 
     the House of Representatives. In addition, the report to be 
     submitted by the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and 
     Sustainment) to the Committees on Armed Services of the 
     Senate and the House of Representatives in accordance with 
     Section 843(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
     Fiscal Year 2018 shall also be provided to the House and 
     Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees.

                         TITLE III--PROCUREMENT

       The agreement provides $133,868,632,000 in Title III, 
     Procurement, as follows:

            REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow 
     the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report 
     accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense 
     Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110-
     279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming 
     funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and 
     $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.
       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is 
     directed to continue to provide the congressional defense 
     committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports 
     for Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of 
     this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the 
     guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying 
     the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The 
     Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior 
     approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified 
     dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or 
     research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is 
     less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for 
     reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. 
     Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of 
     a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test and 
     evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the 
     Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval 
     reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In 
     addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval 
     reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest 
     items are established elsewhere in this statement.


                           FUNDING INCREASES

       The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be 
     provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the 
     tables.


                   PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

       Items for which additional funds have been provided as 
     shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the 
     phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in the explanatory 
     statement are congressional special interest items for the 
     purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of 
     these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated 
     amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory 
     statement.


                     ARSENAL SUSTAINMENT INITIATIVE

       The agreement supports ongoing efforts of the Department of 
     the Army to develop the Army Organic Industrial Base 
     Strategy. This process is identifying manufacturing 
     capabilities at each organic industrial facility that are 
     critical for the country to sustain in wartime and peacetime 
     if the military is called to action. However, there are 
     concerns that while the Army Organic Industrial Base Strategy 
     is identifying capabilities, they have not been prioritized 
     in annual budget requests to Congress. In particular, the 
     Nation's arsenals are at risk of not having the capacity to 
     respond rapidly to meet the Department's needs. Addressing 
     this concern, in comments the Army provided to the Government 
     Accountability Office (GAO) in advance of its December 2015 
     report, ``Actions Needed to Identify and Sustain Critical 
     Capabilities,'' the Army concurred with the GAO's 
     recommendation that it must issue ``clear and detailed 
     implementation guidance, such as an instruction or guidebook, 
     on the process for conducting make-or-buy analysis in a 
     consistent manner.'' The Secretary of the Army is directed to 
     issue such guidance as soon as possible. Further, the 
     Secretary of the Army is directed to assign the arsenals 
     sufficient workload to maintain the critical capabilities 
     identified in the Army Organic Industrial Base Strategy 
     Report and ensure cost efficiency and technical competence in 
     peacetime, while preserving the ability to provide an 
     effective and timely response to mobilizations, national 
     defense contingency situations, and other emergency 
     requirements. Additionally, it is noted that the 
     congressional defense committees have not received detailed 
     recommendations from the Secretary of Defense on how the Air 
     Force, Navy, and Marine Corps can better use the arsenals for 
     their manufacturing needs, or what opportunities may exist 
     for the arsenals to assist the Services and the Defense 
     Logistics Agency to procure spare parts, as required by 
     Senate Report 114-63.


                      ARMY ORGANIC INDUSTRIAL BASE

       The Secretary of the Army is directed to provide written 
     notification to the congressional defense committees not 
     fewer than 45 days prior to the Secretary approving civilian 
     reductions in force that will result in an employment loss of 
     50 or more full-time employees at any Army organic industrial 
     base facility.

                        GROUND MOBILITY VEHICLE

       The Army plan to procure a limited quantity of ground 
     mobility vehicles (GMV) for use by airborne brigades raises 
     concerns due to the high unit cost of the existing vehicles. 
     However, due to the urgent requirement and the advanced stage 
     of the Special Operations Command GMV program, the agreement 
     includes full funding for this program and supports the 
     interim acquisition strategy for 295 A-GMV 1.1 vehicles for 
     fielding to conventional Army airborne brigades and 317 GMV 
     1.1 vehicles for fielding to the United States Army Special 
     Operations Command. However, it is noted that a comparison of 
     GMV unit cost targets proposed by the Army against actual 
     unit costs contained in other Department of Defense contracts 
     indicates that a developmental vehicle may cost more per unit 
     than available non-development vehicles.-- Therefore, the 
     Secretary of the Army is directed to conduct a full and open 
     competition for procurement of the remaining vehicles that 
     satisfy the airborne brigade requirement.


        HIGH MOBILITY MULTIPURPOSE WHEELED VEHICLE MODERNIZATION

       Important safety technologies like Antilock Brake Systems 
     (ABS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) play a critical 
     role on the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle 
     (HMMWV) fleet. The agreement supports the incorporation of 
     ABS/ESC into the HMMWV new production process and the HMMWV 
     modernization process for active, reserve, and National Guard 
     components. To ensure proper quality control during the ABS/
     ESC installation process for new and enduring active, 
     reserve, and National Guard HMMWVs, the Secretary of the Army 
     is directed to ensure that installation of ABS on all HMMWVs 
     shall be performed during the HMMWV new production process or 
     the HMMWV modernization process, when the HMMWV produced is 
     new, or returned to a zero-hour, zero-mile, like-new 
     condition.


                       AIRCRAFT PROCUREMENT, NAVY

                       SPACE ACQUISITION STRATEGY

       In early 2017, the Office of Cost Assessment and Program 
     Evaluation (CAPE) provided an analysis of national security 
     space acquisition that found a troubling pattern of near-
     simultaneous recapitalization of almost every Department of 
     Defense satellite system. The analysis showed a dramatic 
     decrease in spending on space research and development 
     following recapitalization that resulted in a reduction of 
     scientists and engineers at major satellite contractors in 
     the following decade. This industrial base decline, in turn, 
     resulted in even higher costs during the next 
     recapitalization phase as contractors and the government had 
     to rebuild a skilled workforce for several satellite 
     architectures concurrently.
       There is a concern that the Air Force is about to embark on 
     another near-simultaneous recapitalization of its space 
     architecture as it plans for new development in space 
     situation awareness; positioning, navigation, and timing; 
     weather; missile warning; wideband communications; and 
     protected communications. In light of the CAPE analysis and 
     future budget constraints, the Secretary of the Air Force is 
     directed to provide a report to the congressional defense 
     committees not later than 60 days after the enactment of this 
     Act, that examines the recapitalization plans for the major 
     systems noted above, certifies that decisions to recapitalize 
     versus continue production of current designs pose acceptable 
     risks to constellation sustainment and the acquisition 
     workforce, and considers budgetary constraints.


                      SPACE BASED INFRARED SYSTEM

       Following submission of the fiscal year 2018 budget 
     request, the Air Force changed its acquisition strategy for 
     overhead persistent infrared (OPIR) missile warning systems. 
     The fiscal year 2018 budget request included $132,400,000 for 
     advance procurement for the next block of Space Based 
     Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites. The agreement reduces 
     this amount by $50,000,000 and transfers the remaining 
     $82,400,000 to a new program, Next Generation OPIR, in 
     Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Air Force, so 
     that the Air Force can begin development of a new system that 
     will provide resiliency upgrades, payload modernization, and 
     other enhancements.
       The agreement also transfers $173,584,000 from SBIRS High 
     and $71,018,000 from Evolved SBIRS, both in Research, 
     Development, Test and Evaluation, Air Force, to fund the Next 
     Generation OPIR program. However, there is a concern that the 
     OPIR acquisition strategy was still undefined well into 
     fiscal year 2018 and that the new acquisition strategy, 
     including a spend plan, has yet to be formally briefed to the 
     congressional defense committees. Therefore, OPIR is 
     designated as a congressional special interest item and the 
     Secretary of the Air Force is directed to submit an 
     acquisition plan, to include cost and schedule estimates, to 
     the congressional defense committees not later than 30 days 
     after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of the Air 
     Force is also directed to provide quarterly briefings to the 
     congressional defense committees detailing progress against 
     cost and schedule milestones.

                  PROCUREMENT OF AMMUNITION, AIR FORCE

            REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS

       The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow 
     the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report 
     accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense 
     Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110-
     279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming 
     funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and 
     $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.
       Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is 
     directed to continue to provide the congressional defense 
     committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports 
     for Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of 
     this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the 
     guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying 
     the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The 
     Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior 
     approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified 
     dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or 
     research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is 
     less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for 
     reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. 
     Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of 
     a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test and 
     evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the 
     Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval 
     reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In 
     addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval 
     reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest 
     items are established elsewhere in this statement.


                           FUNDING INCREASES

       The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be 
     provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the 
     tables.


   RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

       Items for which additional funds have been provided as 
     shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the 
     phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in the explanatory 
     statement are congressional special interest items for the 
     purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of 
     these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated 
     amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory 
     statement.

            RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION, ARMY

       To ensure that Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles are 
     operationally effective before deploying to theater, the 
     Secretary of the Army is encouraged to accelerate testing. 
     The Secretary of the Army is directed to provide a report to 
     the congressional defense committees not later than 90 days 
     after the enactment of this Act on the results of vehicle 
     testing to date and an explanation of why vehicles are being 
     procured in significant quantities prior to initial 
     operational test and evaluation, currently scheduled for the 
     second quarter of fiscal year 2021.

          RAPID PROTOTYPING, EXPERIMENTATION AND DEMONSTRATION

       The fiscal year 2018 President's budget request contains 
     $162,000,000 in Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, 
     Navy lines 29, 36, and 78 for several Rapid Prototyping, 
     Experimentation and Demonstration (RPED) projects designated 
     as ``Accelerated Acquisitions for the Rapid Development, 
     Demonstration and Fielding of Capability'' by the Chief of 
     Naval Operations and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy 
     (Research, Development and Acquisition). Subsequent to the 
     budget submission, the Navy identified additional funding 
     requirements of $121,000,000 for these projects that have 
     been addressed via below threshold reprogramming authority, 
     above threshold reprogramming authority, and additional funds 
     recommended in this Act.
       The Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations 
     are directed to provide timely and complete communication to 
     the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees 
     regarding RPED projects, to include cost, schedule, progress 
     against previously identified objectives, and transition 
     plans. Several factors will be considered when reviewing each 
     project: requirements, technology and manufacturing 
     readiness, cost, schedule, performance, test results, and 
     transition plans. Funding recommendations will then be 
     adjusted accordingly. Further, there are concerns that 
     projects are being selected without a full understanding of 
     the technological complexity to achieve desired capabilities. 
     Therefore, the Chief of Naval Operations and the Assistant 
     Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) 
     are directed to consult with the Director, Operational Test 
     and Evaluation regarding accelerated modeling, simulation, 
     and testing required to achieve and demonstrate defined 
     capabilities prior to the selection of an RPED project, to 
     establish an agreed-upon test plan and to identify full 
     funding requirements.


       COSTS OF ENGINEERING CHANGE PROPOSALS FOR MISSILE PROGRAMS

       The fiscal year 2018 President's budget request includes no 
     less than $101,000,000 for five development efforts the Navy 
     plans to incorporate into Tomahawk missiles through a series 
     of engineering change proposals during the missiles' 
     recertification process. The development of these 
     modernization initiatives is budgeted at close to 
     $900,000,000 over the next five years, and incorporating 
     these efforts into production will significantly increase the 
     unit cost of the Tomahawk missile.
       While recognizing the need to modernize weapons systems 
     through incremental upgrades, there is concern that the Navy 
     historically has failed to recognize and budget for the full 
     cost of developing and procuring missile upgrades through 
     engineering change proposals upfront. As a result, when 
     previously funded engineering change proposals transitioned 
     from development to production, the Navy has had to reduce 
     planned procurement quantities due to higher than budgeted 
     cost. This has resulted in reduced capacity in at least two 
     other families of missiles. The Assistant Secretary of the 
     Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) is directed to 
     provide a report to the congressional defense committees not 
     later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act after 
     conducting a review of the Navy's acquisition practices for 
     engineering change proposals in all its missile programs, to 
     include cost estimating, and to explore measures on how to 
     inject competition into modernization efforts in sole source 
     acquisitions.

         RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION, AIR FORCE

                           CIVILIAN PERSONNEL

       The agreement supports the Air Force proposal to transfer 
     civilian personnel costs of the acquisition workforce from 
     the Operation and Maintenance, Air Force account to the 
     Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Air Force 
     account. To ensure visibility and appropriate execution, the 
     Secretary of the Air Force is directed to submit an annual 
     report on all civilian personnel (not limited to the 
     acquisition workforce) related funding in the Research, 
     Development, Test and Evaluation, Air Force account by 
     program element. The report shall include the budgeted number 
     of civilian full time equivalents (FTEs) and the related 
     funding programmed in the current fiscal year and annually 
     for the next five fiscal years; the number of actual civilian 
     FTEs and the related funding executed in current and previous 
     fiscal years; an explanation of all below and above threshold 
     reprogrammings involving civilian personnel funding; and the 
     impact on staffing and effectiveness of the acquisition 
     programs. The report shall be submitted to the congressional 
     defense committees not later than 90 days after the end of 
     each fiscal year.


                   DISTRIBUTED COMMON GROUND SYSTEMS

       Several deficiencies exist within the Air Force's globally 
     networked intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance 
     enterprise, referred to as Distributed Common Ground Systems 
     (DCGS). First, the enterprise is excessively stove-piped 
     which makes it difficult for the warfighter to provide 
     integrated products that incorporate different types of 
     intelligence from weapon systems across different levels of 
     classification. Second, the enterprise is not survivable 
     against cyber threats. Third, the enterprise comprises eight 
     separate acquisition programs, all of which are in the 
     sustainment phase despite new capabilities being regularly 
     tested and fielded. The Secretary of the Air Force is 
     directed to submit a report to the congressional defense 
     committees not later than 90 days after the enactment of this 
     Act on a DCGS modernization roadmap, to include a plan to 
     accelerate the transition of the eight acquisition programs 
     and all planned capabilities to an open architecture; a plan 
     to achieve cyber security for the DCGS enterprise; a summary 
     by appropriation of funding to sustain, develop, test, and 
     field capabilities; and opportunities to use agile software 
     development practices.


     JOINT SURVEILLANCE TARGET ATTACK RADAR SYSTEM RECAPITALIZATION

       In February 2018, the Air Force detailed its new position 
     to Congress to terminate the Joint Surveillance Target Attack 
     Radar System (JSTARS) recapitalization program and pursue 
     alternatives. Despite years of affirmations to Congress on 
     the need to pursue JSTARS recapitalization and an ongoing 
     source selection process, the Air Force asserts that the 
     program will not be viable in future contested environments 
     and lacks compelling improvements over legacy capabilities.
       The proposal to cancel JSTARS recapitalization, pursue 
     alternatives, and ensure no duplication between efforts 
     requires careful consideration by Congress through the fiscal 
     year 2019 budget process. Therefore, the agreement provides 
     $405,451,000 for JSTARS recapitalization and designates this 
     funding as a congressional special interest item. The 
     Secretary of the Air Force is directed to neither transfer 
     the funding from JSTARS recapitalization, nor utilize these 
     funds for any purpose other than the JSTARS recapitalization 
     program of record as presented with the fiscal year 2018 
     budget request, unless the congressional defense committees

             MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY--SEA-BASED X-BAND RADAR

       Pursuant to section 1684 of the National Defense 
     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, the Director, Missile 
     Defense Agency (MDA), is reviewing possible basing locations 
     for a Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX) in the Atlantic.-- The 
     Director, MDA is encouraged to consult with the Secretary of 
     the Navy to avoid homeport sites that negatively impact 
     national defense infrastructure and priorities, including 
     United States naval operations such as ship and submarine 
     maintenance activities at public shipyards. Further, the 
     Director, MDA and the Secretary of the Navy are directed to 
     include in the forthcoming report an evaluation of potential 
     impacts to public shipyards, as well as mitigation strategies 
     and associated joint costs, for each Atlantic SBX radar 
     location under consideration.


                        TRUSTED MICROELECTRONICS

       The Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) 
     and the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and 
     Sustainment) are directed to provide a joint report to the 
     congressional defense committees not later than 90 days after 
     the enactment of this Act which defines the scope of the 
     microelectronics challenges the Department of Defense faces; 
     confirms that the United States has adequate infrastructure 
     to provide legacy and future chip needs for weapons systems 
     and what resources are required to provide for that 
     infrastructure; and lists the testing protocols that the 
     Department is utilizing to ensure current microelectronics 
     have achieved security assurance.-- The report shall also 
     identify policy concerns to ensure the Department of Defense 
     complies sufficiently in conducting the national security 
     mission.


                     STRATEGIC CAPABILITIES OFFICE

       The agreement provides $1,183,506,000 for the Strategic 
     Capabilities Office (SCO). The Under Secretary of Defense 
     (Research and Engineering) is directed to provide a report to 
     the congressional defense committees not later than 90 days 
     after the enactment of this Act on the Department's plan to 
     preserve the ability of SCO to respond to combatant 
     commanders' critical needs and to augment efforts across the 
     Department with respect to strategic capabilities development 
     with new layers of oversight between the Director of SCO and 
     the Secretary of Defense.


                             PROJECT MAVEN

       The agreement provides $100,000,000 to enhance the efforts 
     of the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team on Project 
     Maven and designates Project Maven and its activities to date 
     as a congressional special interest item. The Under Secretary 
     of Defense (Intelligence) is directed to provide a spend plan 
     for Project Maven not later than 30 days after the enactment 
     of this Act to the congressional defense committees. Further, 
     the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence), the Under 
     Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering), and the 
     Department of Defense Chief Information Officer are directed 
     to provide an artificial intelligence and machine learning 
     framework for the Department of Defense, and specifically 
     cite the activities of the Services, the Defense Advanced 
     Research Projects Agency, combat support agencies, and 
     laboratories funded in this Act, to the congressional defense 
     committees not later than 90 days after the enactment of this 
     Act. The framework should include an overview of all formal 
     artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data 
     activities; the amounts enacted in the fiscal year 2018 
     budget; the amounts included in the fiscal year 2019 budget 
     request; and the costs to complete the initial phases of 
     these activities. The framework should prioritize these 
     efforts based on cost and impact to the enterprise and 
     clearly identify how each works together to advance the 
     Department's ability to leverage artificial intelligence and 
     machine learning technologies. Finally, the framework should 
     delineate which activities align with one or more of the 
     following focus areas at a minimum: vision, text, speech, 
     cybersecurity, situational awareness including social media, 
     and enterprise.


                            CLOUD COMPUTING

       The Department of Defense seeks to accelerate and 
     streamline the acquisition of cloud computing services at 
     multiple security levels across the Department in an effort 
     to provide the benefits of cloud computing while reducing 
     management and administrative burdens. The Department, under 
     the direction of the Deputy Secretary of Defense, created the 
     Cloud Executive Steering Group to oversee this effort, 
     referred to as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure 
     (JEDI). This effort would be a tailored acquisition for 
     commercial cloud services that could be a single award 
     indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for a period 
     of up to ten years. There are concerns about the proposed 
     duration of a single contract, questions about the best value 
     for the taxpayer, and how to ensure the highest security is 
     maintained.
       Therefore, the Secretary of Defense is directed to provide 
     a report to the congressional defense committees not later 
     than 60 days after the enactment of this Act detailing a 
     framework for all Department entities, to include combat 
     support agencies, to acquire cloud computing services 
     including standards, best practices, contract types, and exit 
     strategies to ensure government flexibility as requirements 
     evolve. The report should also include justification, to 
     include cost considerations, for executing a single award 
     contract rather than creating an infrastructure capable of 
     storing and sharing data across multiple cloud computing 
     service providers concurrently, to include data migration and 
     middleware costs.
       In addition, not later than 45 days after the enactment of 
     this Act, the Deputy Secretary of Defense is directed to 
     provide a report on the JEDI cloud computing services 
     contract request for proposals (RFP) to the congressional 
     defense committees. The report shall include the following: 
     the amounts requested in the fiscal year 2018 and 2019 budget 
     for this and all other cloud computing services acquisitions 
     by appropriation; the fiscal year 2019 future years defense 
     program levels for cloud computing services; identification 
     and justification for acquisitions where ``other 
     transactional authorities'' will be utilized; certification 
     from the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer that 
     each of the military Services, the combatant commands, 
     Defense Information Systems Agency, and the Chief Information 
     Officers of each of the Services have been consulted during 
     the drafting of the RFP; provisions within the contract to 
     ensure security is maintained over the period of the 
     contract; and provisions for mitigation actions if the 
     commercial entity were to provide services to or be acquired 
     by a foreign entity or government.

         REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR THE DEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAM

       Concerns remain regarding the transfer of funds from the 
     In-House Care budget sub-activity to pay for contractor-
     provided medical care. To limit such transfers and improve 
     oversight within the Defense Health Program operation and 
     maintenance account, the agreement includes a provision which 
     caps the funds available for Private Sector Care under the 
     TRICARE program subject to prior approval reprogramming 
     procedures. The provision and accompanying explanatory 
     statement language should not be interpreted as limiting the 
     amount of funds that may be transferred to the In-House Care 
     budget sub-activity from other budget sub-activities within 
     the Defense Health Program. In addition, funding for the In-
     House Care and Private Sector Care budget sub-activities are 
     designated as congressional special interest items. Any 
     transfer of funds in excess of $15,000,000 into or out of 
     these sub-activities requires the Secretary of Defense to 
     follow prior approval reprogramming procedures.
       The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a report to 
     the congressional defense committees not later than 30 days 
     after the enactment of this Act that delineates transfers of 
     funds in excess of $10,000,000, and the dates any transfers 
     occurred, from the Private Sector Care budget sub-activity to 
     any other budget sub-activity groups for fiscal year 2017.
       The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) is 
     directed to provide quarterly reports to the congressional 
     defense committees on budget execution data for all of the 
     Defense Health Program budget activities and to adequately 
     reflect changes to the budget activities requested by the 
     Services in future budget submissions.


                               CARRYOVER

       For fiscal year 2018, one percent carryover authority for 
     the operation and maintenance account of the Defense Health 
     Program is recommended. The Assistant Secretary of Defense 
     (Health Affairs) is directed to submit a detailed spending 
     plan for any fiscal year 2017 designated carryover funds to 
     the congressional defense committees not less than 30 days 
     prior to executing the carryover funds.
       The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) is 
     further directed to prioritize the payment of arrears to 
     state vaccine programs, as authorized by section 719 of the 
     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, in 
     expenditure of these carryover funds.


                 PEER-REVIEWED CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM

       The agreement provides $80,000,000 for the peer-reviewed 
     cancer research program to research cancers not addressed in 
     the breast, prostate, ovarian, kidney, and lung cancer 
     research programs.
       The funds provided in the peer-reviewed cancer research 
     program are directed to be used to conduct research in the

     cancers, brain cancer, colorectal cancer, immunotherapy, 
     listeria-based regimens for cancer, liver cancer, lymphoma, 
     melanoma and other skin cancers, mesothelioma, myeloma, 
     neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer, pediatric brain tumors, 
     stomach cancer, and cancer in children, adolescents, and 
     young adults.
       The reports directed under this heading in House Report 
     115-219 and the Senate Chairman's Explanatory Statement of 
     November 21, 2017 are still required.


                 PEER-REVIEWED MEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM

       The agreement provides $330,000,000 for a peer-reviewed 
     medical research program. The Secretary of Defense, in 
     conjunction with the Service Surgeons General, is directed to 
     select medical research projects of clear scientific merit

     muscular atrophy, sustained-release drug delivery, tinnitus, 
     tissue regeneration, tuberculosis, vaccine development for 
     infectious diseases, vascular malformations, and women's 
     heart disease. The additional funding provided under the 
     peer-reviewed medical research program shall be devoted only 
     to the purposes listed above.


                        ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD

       The Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Defense Healthcare 
     Management Systems (DHMS), in conjunction with the Director 
     of the Interagency Program Office (IPO), is directed to 
     provide quarterly reports to the congressional defense 
     committees on the cost and schedule of the electronic health 
     record program, to include milestones, knowledge points, and 
     acquisition timelines, as well as quarterly obligation 
     reports. These reports should also include any changes to the 
     deployment timeline, including benchmarks, for full operating 
     capability; any refinements to the cost estimate for full 
     operating capability and the total lifecycle cost of the 
     project; and the progress toward developing, implementing, 
     and fielding the interoperable electronic health record 
     throughout the medical facilities of the Department of 
     Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The PEO DHMS 
     is further directed to continue briefing the House and Senate 
     Defense Appropriations Subcommittees on a quarterly basis, 
     coinciding with the report submission.
       Finally, the Director of the IPO is directed to continue to 
     provide quarterly reports to the House and Senate 
     Appropriations Committees, Subcommittees on Defense and

                       PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES

       The Secretary of Defense is commended for the Department's 
     assistance in developing principles, standards, and a code of 
     conduct based on international law, to ensure that private 
     security companies respect human rights and the rule of law 
     in the provision of security assistance services. The 
     Secretary of Defense is directed to submit a report to the 
     congressional defense committees not later than 90 days after 
     enactment of this Act, on the Department's standards and 
     oversight and accountability mechanisms that apply to private 
     security companies contracted by the Department of Defense 
     compared to the standards and mechanisms that apply to 
     private security companies contracted by the Department of 
     State.


            AFGHANISTAN SECURITY FORCES FUND CONTRACT COSTS

       There remain concerns about the excessive costs of training 
     contracts awarded using the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund 
     (ASFF). Therefore, the Comptroller General is directed to 
     examine all ASFF training contracts and provide a report 
     detailing his findings to the congressional defense 
     committees not later than 180 days after the enactment of 
     this Act. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense is directed 
     to provide an accounting of all contracts funded with ASFF, 
     the annual value of each contract, and the ASFF line item 
     that funds each contract, to the congressional defense 
     committees not later than 180 days after the enactment of 
     this Act.


         AFGHANISTAN SECURITY FORCES FUND BUDGET JUSTIFICATION

       The Secretary of Defense is commended for efforts to 
     improve the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) budget 
     justification materials and Financial Activity Plans (FAPs). 
     To further inform budget reviews, the Secretary of Defense is 
     directed to provide budget justification materials that 
     include the budget request amount, the appropriated amount, 
     and the actual obligation amount by line item, for the prior 
     two fiscal years. In addition, concurrent with the submission 
     of each FAP, the Secretary of Defense shall provide the 
     congressional defense committees with line item detail of 
     planned funding movements within ASFF using line item titles 
     from the appropriate year's budget justification submission. 
     Any line item that did not appear in the budget justification 
     submission shall be delineated as a new line item.


                     AFGHAN NATIONAL ARMY UNIFORMS

       The House-passed bill included a provision, Section 10004, 
     banning the use of funds provided for the Afghanistan 
     Security Forces Fund to procure uniforms for the Afghan 
     National Army (ANA). The Special Inspector General for 
     Afghanistan Reconstruction reported in June 2017 that the 
     Department of Defense acquired uniforms for the ANA that were 
     not appropriate for use in Afghanistan. The agreement removes 
     the legislative provision; however, due to underlying 
     concerns of mismanagement by the Department of Defense and 
     the ANA, the Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a 
     report to the congressional defense committees, not later 
     than 90 days after the enactment of this Act, that determines 
     whether current contracting practices for ANA and Afghan 
     National Police uniforms conform to all Federal Acquisition 
     Regulation requirements.


                     COUNTER-LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY

       The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the 
     Secretary of State, is directed to provide a report on the 
     lessons learned from Operation Observant Compass, including 
     in the area of civil-military coordination, and an assessment 
     of how these lessons are being institutionalized and applied 
     to other complex crises. The report shall be provided to the 
     congressional defense and foreign relations committees not 
     later than 270 days after the enactment of this Act.


             SECURITY SECTOR ASSISTANCE STEERING COMMITTEE

       The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the 
     Secretary of State, is directed to provide a report on the 
     activities and progress of the Defense Security Sector 
     Assistance Steering Committee to the congressional defense 
     and foreign relations committees not later than 180 days 
     after the enactment of this Act.

                              PROCUREMENT

       The agreement provides $10,424,319,000 for Procurement, as

     where this explanatory statement states that the ``agreement 
     only includes''' or ``the following is the only'' direction, 
     any direction included in the House or Senate report on that 
     matter shall be considered as replaced with the direction 
     provided within this explanatory statement. In cases where 
     the House or the Senate has directed the submission of a 
     report, such report is to be submitted to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of both Houses of Congress. House or Senate 
     reporting requirements with deadlines prior to or within 15

       In fiscal year 2018, for purposes of the Balanced Budget 
     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-

     the term ``program, project, or activity'' for departments 
     and agencies under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Water 
     Development Appropriations Act. The term ``program, project, 
     or activity'' shall include the most specific level of budget 
     items identified in the Energy and Water Development 
     Appropriations Act, 2018 and the explanatory statement 
     accompanying the Act.
       National Ocean Policy.--No specific funding was provided in 
     fiscal year 2017 and none was requested by any agencies 
     funded in this Act in fiscal year 2018 to implement the 
     National Ocean Policy. Consequently, no specific funds for 
     National Ocean Policy activities are included for any agency 
     funded in this Act.
       Dam Removal.--No specific funding was provided in fiscal 
     year 2017 and none was requested by any agencies funded in 
     this Act in fiscal year 2018 for the purpose of removing a 
     federally owned or operated dam without prior authorization 
     by Congress. Consequently, no specific funds for unauthorized 
     federal dam removal are included for any agency funded in 
     this Act.

                   TITLE I--CORPS OF ENGINEERS--CIVIL

                         DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY

                       Corps of Engineers--Civil

       The summary tables included in this title set forth the 
     dispositions with respect to the individual appropriations, 
     projects, and activities of the Corps of Engineers. 
     Additional items of the Act are discussed below.
       Recent statutory changes regarding the Inland Waterways 
     Trust Fund (IWTF) have resulted in an increase to the size of 
     the capital improvement program that can be supported by the 
     IWTF. The agreement reflects congressional interest in 
     supporting this larger program. The Corps is directed to take 
     the preparatory steps necessary to ensure that new 
     construction projects can be initiated as soon as can be 
     supported under the larger capital program (i.e., as ongoing 
     projects approach completion).
       Concerns persist that the effort to update the Water 
     Resources Principles and Guidelines did not proceed 
     consistent with the language or intent of section 2031 of the 
     Water Resources Development Act of 2007. No funds provided to 
     the Corps of Engineers shall be used to develop or implement 
     rules or guidance to support implementation of the final 
     Principles and Requirements for Federal Investments in Water 
     Resources released in March 2013 or the final Interagency 
     Guidelines released in December 2014. The Corps shall 
     continue to use the document dated March 10, 1983, and 
     entitled ``Economic and Environmental Principles and 
     Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources 
     Implementation Studies''' during the fiscal year period 
     covered by the Energy and Water Development Appropriations 
     Act for 2018.
       Asian Carp.--In lieu of House and Senate direction, the 
     Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, 
     shall make every effort to submit to Congress the Report of 
     the Chief of Engineers for the Brandon Road feasibility study 
     according to the original published schedule of February 
     2019. The Corps is directed to provide quarterly updates to 
     the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress 
     on the progress and status of efforts to prevent the further 
     spread of Asian carp as well as the location and density of 
     carp populations, including the use of emergency procedures. 
     The Corps shall continue to collaborate with the U.S. Coast 
     Guard, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the State of 
     Illinois, and members of the Asian Carp Regional Coordinating 
     Committee to identify and evaluate whether navigation 
     protocols would be beneficial or effective in reducing the 
     risk of vessels inadvertently carrying aquatic invasive 
     species, including Asian carp, through the Brandon Road Lock 
     and Dam in Joliet, Illinois. Any findings of such an 
     evaluation shall be included in the quarterly briefings to 
     the Committees. The Corps is further directed to implement 
     protocols shown to be effective at reducing the risk of 
     entrainment without jeopardizing the safety of vessels and 
     crews. The Corps and other federal and state agencies are 
     conducting ongoing research on potential solutions.
       Economic Reevaluation.--None of the funds provided in this 
     title may be used to require an economic reevaluation of any 
     project authorized under title VIII of the Water Resources 
     Development Act of 2007.

                           Additional Funding

       The agreement includes funding in addition to the budget 
     request to ensure continued improvements to our national 
     economy, public safety, and environmental health that result 
     from water resources projects. This funding is for additional 
     work that either was not included in the budget request or 
     was inadequately budgeted. The bill contains a provision 
     requiring the Corps to allocate funds in accordance with only 
     the direction in this agreement. In lieu of all House and 
     Senate report direction--under any heading--regarding 
     additional funding, new starts, and the fiscal year 2018 work 
     plan, the Corps shall follow the direction included in this 
     explanatory statement.
       The Corps again is directed to develop rating systems for 
     use in evaluating studies and projects for allocation of the 
     additional funding provided in this title. These evaluation 
     systems may be, but are not required to be, individualized 
     for each account, category, or subcategory. Voluntary funding 
     in excess of legally required cost shares for studies and 
     projects is acceptable, but shall not be used as a criterion 
     for allocating the additional funding provided or for the 
     selection of new starts. Each study and project eligible for 
     funding shall be evaluated under the applicable ratings 
     system. A study or project may not be excluded from 
     evaluation for being ``inconsistent with Administration 
     policy.'' The Corps retains complete control over the 
     methodology of these rating systems. The executive branch 
     retains complete discretion over project-specific allocation 
     decisions within the additional funds provided, subject to 
     only the direction here and under the heading ``Additional 
     Funding'' or ``Additional Funding for Ongoing Work'' within 
     each of the Investigations, Construction, Mississippi River 
     and Tributaries, and Operation and Maintenance accounts.
       The Administration is reminded that these funds are in 
     addition to the budget request, and Administration budget 
     metrics shall not be a reason to disqualify a study or 
     project from being funded. It is expected that all of the 
     additional funding provided will be allocated to specific 
     programs, projects, or activities. The focus of the 
     allocation process shall favor the obligation, rather than 
     expenditure, of funds. With the significant backlog of work 
     in the Corps' inventory, there is no reason for funds 
     provided above the budget request to remain unallocated.
       A project or study shall be eligible for additional funding 
     within the Investigations, Construction, and Mississippi 
     River and Tributaries accounts if: (1) it has received 
     funding, other than through a reprogramming, in at least one 
     of the previous three fiscal years; (2) it was previously 
     funded and could reach a significant milestone, complete a 
     discrete element of work, or produce significant outputs in 
     calendar year 2018; or (3) as appropriate, it is selected as 
     one of the new starts allowed in accordance with this Act and 
     the additional direction provided below. Projects with 
     executed Advanced Project Partnership Agreements, or similar 
     agreements, shall be eligible for additional funding provided 
     in this bill. None of the additional funding in any account 
     may be used for any item where funding was specifically 
     denied or for projects in the Continuing Authorities Program. 
     Funds shall be allocated consistent with statutory cost share 
     requirements.
       Funding associated with each category may be allocated to 
     any eligible study or project, as appropriate, within that 
     category; funding associated with each subcategory may be 
     allocated only to eligible studies or projects, as 
     appropriate, within that subcategory. The list of 
     subcategories is not meant to be exhaustive. There is concern 
     that the fiscal year 2017 work plan allocated Operation and 
     Maintenance funding to some activities historically funded in 
     the Construction account. Any shift in funding between 
     accounts should be proposed in a budget request and addressed 
     through the appropriations process. Funding levels for 
     accounts and additional funding categories are developed 
     based on assessment of the scope of activities that can be 
     advanced within each account and category. Shifting 
     activities between accounts or categories after these funding 
     level decisions are made is a gross misuse of the flexibility 
     inherent in the work plan process. Since the extent of 
     changes proposed in the fiscal year 2018 budget request is 
     not clear, the Corps shall evaluate all studies and projects 
     only within accounts and categories consistent with previous 
     congressional funding.
       Work Plan.--Not later than 60 days after the enactment of 
     this Act, the Corps shall provide to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a work plan 
     including the following information: (1) a detailed 
     description of the ratings system(s)

[[Page H2436]]

     developed and used to evaluate studies and projects; (2) 
     delineation of how these funds are to be allocated; (3) a 
     summary of the work to be accomplished with each allocation, 
     including phase of work; and (4) a list of all studies and 
     projects that were considered eligible for funding but did 
     not receive funding, including an explanation of whether the 
     study or project could have used funds in calendar year 2018 
     and the specific reasons each study or project was considered 
     as being less competitive for an allocation of funds.
       New Starts.--The agreement includes six new starts in the 
     Investigations account and five new starts in the 
     Construction account to be distributed across the three main 
     mission areas of the Corps. The agreement also includes one 
     new study start in the Mississippi River and Tributaries 
     account to evaluate the need for improvements for flood 
     control, ecosystem restoration, water quality and related 
     purposes associated with storm water runoff and management.
       Of the new starts in Investigations, two shall be for 
     navigation studies, one shall be for a flood and storm damage 
     reduction study, two shall be for additional navigation or 
     flood and storm damage reduction studies, and one shall be 
     for an environmental restoration study. Of the new 
     construction starts, one shall be for a navigation project; 
     one shall be for a flood and storm damage reduction project; 
     two shall be for additional navigation or flood and storm 
     damage reduction projects, of which one shall be a coastal 
     storm damage reduction project; and one shall be for an 
     environmental restoration project. Other than the one new 
     study start directed above, no funding shall be used to 
     initiate new programs, projects, or activities in the 
     Mississippi River and Tributaries or Operation and 
     Maintenance accounts.
       The Corps is directed to propose a single group of new 
     starts as a part of the work plan. None of the funds may be 
     used for any item for which the agreement has specifically 
     denied funding. The Corps may not change or substitute the 
     new starts selected once the work plan has been provided to 
     the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress. 
     Each new start shall be funded from the appropriate 
     additional funding line item. Any project for which the new 
     start requirements are not met by the end of fiscal year 2018 
     shall be treated as if the project had not been selected as a 
     new start; such a project shall be required to compete again 
     for new start funding in future years. As all new starts are 
     to be chosen by the Corps, all shall be considered of equal 
     importance, and the expectation is that future budget 
     submissions will include appropriate funding for all new 
     starts selected.
       There continues to be confusion regarding the executive 
     branch's policies and guidelines regarding which studies and 
     projects require new start designations. Therefore, the Corps 
     is directed to notify the Committees on Appropriations of 
     both Houses of Congress at least 7 days prior to execution of 
     an agreement for construction of any project except 
     environmental infrastructure projects and projects under the 
     Continuing Authorities Program. Additionally, the agreement 
     reiterates and clarifies previous congressional direction as 
     follows. Neither study nor construction activities related to 
     individual projects authorized under section 1037 of the 
     Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014 
     shall require a new start or new investment decision; these 
     activities shall be considered ongoing work. No new start or 
     new investment decision shall be required when moving from 
     feasibility to preconstruction engineering and design (PED). 
     A new start designation shall be required to initiate 
     construction of individually-authorized projects funded 
     within programmatic line items. No new start or new 
     investment decision shall be required to initiate work on a 
     separable element of a project when construction of one or 
     more separable elements of that project was initiated 
     previously; it shall be considered ongoing work. A new 
     construction start shall not be required for work undertaken 
     to correct a design deficiency on an existing federal 
     project; it shall be considered ongoing work.
       In addition to the priority factors used to allocate all 
     additional funding provided in the Investigations account, 
     the Corps should give careful consideration to the out-year 
     budget impacts of the studies selected and to whether there 
     appears to be an identifiable local sponsor that will be 
     ready and able to provide, in a timely manner, the necessary 
     cost share for the feasibility and PED phases. The Corps is 
     reminded that the flood and storm damage reduction mission 
     area can include instances where non-federal sponsors are 
     seeking assistance with flood control and unauthorized 
     discharges from permitted wastewater treatment facilities and 
     that the navigation mission area includes work in remote and 
     subsistence harbor areas.
       In addition to the priority factors used to allocate all 
     additional funding provided in the Construction account, the 
     Corps also shall consider the out-year budget impacts of the 
     selected new starts; and the cost sharing sponsor's ability 
     and willingness to promptly provide the cash contribution (if 
     any), as well as required lands, easements, rights-of-way, 
     relocations, and disposal areas. When considering new 
     construction starts, only those that can execute a project 
     cost sharing agreement not later than September 30, 2018, 
     shall be chosen.
       To ensure that the new construction starts are affordable 
     and will not unduly delay completion of any ongoing projects, 
     the Secretary is required to submit to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a realistic out-
     year budget scenario prior to issuing a work allowance for a 
     new start. It is understood that specific budget decisions 
     are made on an annual basis and that this scenario is neither 
     a request for nor a guarantee of future funding for any 
     project. Nonetheless, this scenario shall include an estimate 
     of annual funding for each new start utilizing a realistic 
     funding scenario through completion of the project, as well 
     as the specific impacts of that estimated funding on the 
     ability of the Corps to make continued progress on each 
     previously funded construction project (including impacts to 
     the optimum timeline and funding requirements of the ongoing 
     projects) and on the ability to consider initiating new 
     projects in the future. The scenario shall assume a 
     Construction account funding level at the average of the past 
     three budget requests.


                             INVESTIGATIONS

       The agreement includes $123,000,000 for Investigations. The 
     agreement includes legislative language regarding parameters 
     for new study starts.
       The allocation for projects and activities within the 
     Investigations account is shown in the following table:

       Updated Capability.--The agreement adjusts some project-
     specific allocations downward from the budget request based 
     on updated information regarding the amount of work that 
     could be accomplished in fiscal year 2018.
       Passaic River Basin Mainstem, New Jersey.--Flooding has 
     long been a problem in the Passaic River Basin. The Corps is 
     encouraged to continue to work in coordination with the non-
     federal sponsor on plans to reduce flooding in the basin, 
     including the reevaluation of the Passaic River Basin 
     Mainstem project. The Corps is directed to brief the 
     Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress not 
     later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act on the 
     current status of this project.
       Peckman River, New Jersey.--There have been repeated delays 
     with the Peckman River Feasibility Study. The Corps is 
     directed to provide to the Committees on Appropriations of 
     both Houses of Congress quarterly briefings on the current 
     schedule to bring this study to completion, with the first 
     briefing to occur not later than 30 days after the enactment 
     of this Act.
       Rahway River Basin (Upper Basin), New Jersey.--There have 
     been extended delays with the Rahway River Basin Flood Risk 
     Management Feasibility Study where flooding is of acute 
     concern to the affected communities. The Corps is encouraged 
     to continue to work with the non-federal sponsor on plans to 
     reduce flooding caused by the Rahway River in affected areas. 
     The Corps is directed to provide to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of both Houses of Congress quarterly briefings 
     on the current schedule to bring this study to completion, 
     with the first briefing to occur not later than 30 days after 
     the enactment of this Act.
       Columbia River Treaty 2024 Implementation, Oregon and 
     Washington.--The agreement includes funding for this activity 
     in the Operation and Maintenance account, as in previous 
     years.
       Additional Funding.--The Corps is expected to allocate the 
     additional funding provided in this account primarily to 
     specific feasibility and PED phases, rather than to Remaining 
     Items line items as has been the case in previous work plans. 
     Of the additional funds provided in this account for 
     navigation and coastal and deep draft navigation, the Corps 
     shall allocate not less than $2,200,000 for the continuation 
     of ongoing General Reevaluation Reports. When allocating the 
     additional funding provided in this account, the Corps shall 
     consider giving priority to completing or accelerating 
     ongoing studies or to initiating new studies that will 
     enhance the nation's economic development, job growth, and 
     international competitiveness; are for projects located in 
     areas that have suffered recent natural disasters; are for 
     projects that protect life and property; or are for projects 
     to address legal requirements. The Corps shall use these 
     funds for additional work in both the feasibility and PED 
     phases. The agreement includes sufficient additional funding 
     to undertake a significant amount of feasibility and PED 
     work. The Administration is reminded that a project study is 
     not complete until the PED phase is complete.
       The Corps is reminded that the following activities are 
     eligible to compete for additional funding: development of a 
     hydraulic model that will assist no fewer than five States 
     along a major navigable waterway with making regional 
     strategic flood risk management decisions, the updating of 
     economic analyses, and the updating of economic impact 
     studies.
       Water Resources Priorities Study.--No funding shall be used 
     for this study.
       Research and Development.--Within available funds, the 
     Corps shall advance work on activities included in the House 
     and Senate reports.
       SMART Planning.--The agreement includes the House 
     direction. Additionally, the Corps is reminded of the fiscal 
     year 2016 direction to evaluate each North Atlantic Coast 
     Comprehensive Study focus area to determine the appropriate 
     scope, schedule, and cost, without the initial time and cost 
     limits of the 3x3x3 process. Particularly for comprehensive 
     or regional studies that have significantly larger study 
     areas than typical feasibility studies, it may not be 
     advisable to identify a tentatively selected plan prior to 
     determining whether an exemption from the 3x3x3 process is 
     prudent. Common sense determinations early in the feasibility 
     process can avoid the wasted time and funding inherent in 
     changing course late in the process.
       Section 1143 Study.--The Corps is encouraged to include in 
     future budget submissions the study of sediment sources 
     authorized in section 1143 of Public Law 114-322.
       Puget Sound.--In addition to Senate direction, the Corps is 
     reminded that no new start, new investment decision, or new 
     phase decision shall be required to move the Puget Sound 
     Nearshore Ecosystem Restoration Project from feasibility to 
     PED.


                              CONSTRUCTION

       The agreement includes $2,085,000,000 for Construction. The 
     agreement includes legislative language regarding parameters 
     for new construction starts.
       The allocation for projects and activities within the 
     Construction account is shown in the following table:

       Updated Capability.--The agreement adjusts some project-
     specific allocations downward from the budget request based 
     on updated information regarding the amount of work that 
     could be accomplished in fiscal year 2018.
       Additional Funding.--The agreement includes additional 
     funds for projects and activities to enhance the nation's 
     economic growth and international competitiveness. Of the 
     additional funds provided in this account, the Corps shall 
     allocate not less than $2,850,000 to projects with riverfront 
     development components. Of the additional funding provided in 
     this account for flood and storm damage reduction and flood 
     control, the Corps shall allocate not less than $5,400,000 to 
     additional nonstructural flood control projects. Of the 
     additional funds provided in this account for flood and storm 
     damage reduction, navigation, and other authorized project 
     purposes, the Corps shall allocate not less than $15,000,000 
     to authorized reimbursements for projects with executed 
     project cooperation agreements and that have completed 
     construction or where nonfederal sponsors intend to use the 
     funds for additional water resources development activities. 
     Of the additional funding provided in this account for flood 
     and storm damage reduction and flood control, the Corps shall 
     allocate not less than $7,000,000 to continue construction of 
     projects that principally include improvements to rainfall 
     drainage systems that address flood damages. Of the 
     additional funding provided for flood and storm damage 
     reduction, flood control, and environmental restoration or 
     compliance, the Corps shall allocate not less than $1,000,000 
     for projects for hurricane and storm damage risk reduction 
     and environmental restoration with both structural and 
     nonstructural project elements.
       The Corps is reminded that dam safety projects authorized 
     under section 5003 of the Water Resources Development Act of 
     2007 are eligible to compete for the additional funding 
     provided in this account.
       When allocating the additional funding provided in this 
     account, the Corps shall consider eligibility and 
     implementation decisions under Public Law 115-123 so as to 
     maximize the reduction of risk to public safety and 
     infrastructure and the reduction of future damages from 
     floods and storms nationwide. Public Law 115-123 included 
     funding within the Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies 
     account to restore authorized shore protection projects to 
     full project profile. That funding is expected to address 
     most of the current year capability. Therefore, to ensure 
     funding is not directed to where it cannot be used, the 
     agreement includes $50,000,000 for construction of shore 
     protection projects. The Corps is reminded that if additional 
     work can be done, these projects are also eligible to compete 
     for additional funding for flood and storm damage reduction.
       When allocating the additional funding provided in this 
     account, the Corps is encouraged to evaluate authorized 
     reimbursements in the same manner as if the projects were 
     being evaluated for new or ongoing construction and shall 
     consider giving priority to the following:
       1. benefits of the funded work to the national economy;
       2. extent to which the work will enhance national, 
     regional, or local economic development;
       3. number of jobs created directly by the funded activity;
       4. ability to obligate the funds allocated within the 
     calendar year, including consideration of the ability of the 
     non-federal sponsor to provide any required cost share;
       5. ability to complete the project, separable element, or 
     project phase with the funds allocated;
       6. legal requirements, including responsibilities to 
     Tribes;
       7. for flood and storm damage reduction projects (including 
     authorized nonstructural measures and periodic beach 
     renourishments),
       a. population, economic activity, or public infrastructure 
     at risk, as appropriate; and
       b. the severity of risk of flooding or the frequency with 
     which an area has experienced flooding;
       8. for shore protection projects, projects in areas that 
     have suffered severe beach erosion requiring additional sand

     projects while also considering and addressing longstanding 
     equity concerns that federal funding decisions not be biased 
     by non-federal decisions to construct projects in advance of 
     federal funding or to provide funding in excess of legally 
     required cost shares. Until such policy is issued, the Corps 
     shall discontinue all work on project specific public-private 
     partnerships beyond the P3 project selected as a new start in 
     fiscal year 2016.
       Implementation guidance.--The Corps is directed to issue 
     expeditiously implementation guidance for section 1043 of the 
     Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (non-
     federal implementation pilot program).

     Considering the high risk associated with Scoggins Dam, 
     Reclamation is encouraged to work with local stakeholders and 
     repayment contractors on this joint project including 
     feasibility and environmental review of the preferred 
     alternative. A replacement structure downstream could 
     significantly reduce project costs for both the federal 
     government and local stakeholders. Reclamation may accept 
     contributed funds from non-federal contractors to expedite 
     completion of any level of review.

     Conservation and Delivery'', $134,000,000 shall be for water 
     storage projects as authorized in section 4007 of Public Law 
     114-322. Of the additional funding provided under the heading 
     ``Environmental Restoration or Compliance'', not less than 
     $30,000,000 shall be for activities authorized under sections 
     4001 and 4010 of Public Law 114-322 or as set forth in 
     federal-state plans for restoring threatened and endangered 
     fish species affected by the operation of the Bureau of 
     Reclamation's water projects.
       Not later than 45 days after the enactment of this Act, 
     Reclamation shall provide to the Committees on Appropriations 
     of both Houses of Congress a report delineating how these 
     funds are to be distributed, in which phase the work is to be 
     accomplished, and an explanation of the criteria and rankings 
     used to justify each allocation.
       Reclamation is reminded that activities authorized under 
     Indian Water Rights Settlements and under section 206 of

     exemption from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) on the basis 
     that the refinery experiences a disproportionate economic 
     hardship under the RFS. When evaluating a petition, the 
     Administrator consults with the Secretary of Energy to 
     determine whether disproportionate economic hardship exists. 
     According to the Department's March 2011 Small Refinery 
     Exemption Study, disproportionate economic hardship must 
     encompass two broad components: a high cost of compliance 
     relative to the industry average disproportionate impacts, 
     and an effect sufficient to cause a significant impairment of 
     the refinery operations' viability. If the Secretary finds 
     that either of these two components exists, the Secretary is 
     directed to recommend to the EPA Administrator at least a 50 
     percent waiver of RFS requirements for the petitioner. The 
     Secretary also is directed to score all of the metrics in the 
     study and to score the metrics according to the 2011 study 
     scoring criteria and not any later addendum to the study. The 
     Secretary is directed to seek small refinery comment before 
     making changes to its scoring metrics for small refinery 
     petitions for RFS waivers and to notify the Committees on 
     Appropriations of both Houses of Congress prior to making any 
     final changes to scoring metrics. Only the impact on the 
     small refinery's transportation fuel margins is pertinent to 
     measuring RFS impacts on relative refining margins. The 
     conference report accompanying the Energy and Water 
     Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010, 
     addressed similar issues and directed the Secretary to redo 
     an earlier study done to evaluate whether the RFS program 
     imposes a disproportionate economic hardship on small 
     refineries. In calling for the Secretary to redo the study, 
     the conference report cited the lack of small refinery input 
     into the earlier study, concerns about regional RFS 
     compliance cost disparities, small refinery dependence on the 
     purchase of renewable fuel credits (RINs), and increasing RIN 
     costs. Since then, the dramatic rise in RIN prices has 
     amplified RFS compliance and competitive disparities, 
     especially where unique regional factors exist, including 
     high diesel demand production, no export access, and limited 
     biodiesel infrastructure and production. In response to 
     petitions in prior years, the Secretary determined that the 
     RFS program would impose a disproportionate economic and 
     structural impact on several small refineries. Despite this 
     determination, the Secretary did not recommend, and EPA did 
     not provide, any RFS relief because it determined the 
     refineries were profitable enough to afford the cost of RFS 
     compliance without substantially impacting their viability. 
     The Secretary is reminded that the RFS program may impose a 
     disproportionate economic hardship on a small refinery even 
     if the refinery makes enough profit to cover the cost of 
     complying with the program. Small refinery profitability does 
     not justify a disproportionate regulatory burden where 
     Congress has explicitly given EPA authority, in consultation 
     with the Secretary, to reduce or eliminate this burden.
       In lieu of Senate direction, the Department is directed to 
     provide to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of 
     Congress a

     activities in Southern Appalachia. The funds shall be 
     distributed according to ARC's Distressed Counties Formula, 
     which is comprised of land area, population estimates, and a 
     proportion of the number of distressed counties.
       In addition, the agreement provides $6,000,000 for a 
     program of basic infrastructure improvements in distressed 
     counties in Central Appalachia. Funds shall be distributed

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

                    (INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)

       The Commission's mission is to ensure the safety and 
     security of the nation's use of nuclear power and nuclear 
     materials and protect the workers and public who use and 
     benefit from these materials and facilities. The agreement 
     provides $909,137,000 for Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
     (Commission) salaries and expenses. This amount is offset by 
     estimated revenues of $779,768,032, resulting in a net 
     appropriation of $129,300,892. The agreement rescinds 
     $68,076.04 provided to the Commission from the United States 
     Agency for International Development in 1994 pursuant to 
     section 632(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, for 
     which there is no currently authorized use. The agreement 
     includes $10,000,000 for activities related to the 
     development of regulatory infrastructure for advanced nuclear 
     reactor technologies and $16,200,000 for international 
     activities, which are not subject to the Commission's general 
     fee recovery collection requirements. The agreement directs 
     the use of $15,000,000 in prior-year unobligated balances.
       The agreement includes the following direction in lieu of 
     all direction included in the House and Senate reports:
       Nuclear Reactor Safety.--The agreement includes 
     $466,655,000 for Nuclear Reactor Safety. This control point 
     includes the Commission's Operating Reactors and New Reactors 
     business lines.
       Integrated University Program.--The agreement includes 
     $15,000,000 for the Integrated University Program. Of this 
     amount, $5,000,000 is to be used for grants to support 
     projects that do not align with programmatic missions but are 
     critical to maintaining the discipline of nuclear science and 
     engineering.
       Nuclear Materials and Waste Safety.--The agreement includes 
     $113,145,000 for Nuclear Materials and Waste Safety. Included 
     within this control point are the Fuel Facilities, Nuclear 
     Material Users, and Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation 
     business lines.
       Decommissioning and Low-Level Waste.--The agreement 
     includes $27,980,000 for Decommissioning and Low-Level Waste.
       Corporate Support.--The agreement includes $301,357,000 for 
     Corporate Support. The agreement provides, within available 
     funds, not more than $9,500,000 for the salaries, travel, and 
     other support costs for the Office of the Commission. These 
     salaries and expenses shall include only salaries and benefit 
     and travel costs, and are not to include general, 
     administrative, or infrastructure costs. The use and 
     expenditure of these funds shall be jointly managed through 
     majority vote of the Commission. The Commission shall 
     continue to include a breakout and explanation of the 
     Commission salaries and expenses in its annual budget 
     requests. If the Commission wishes to change the composition 
     of the funds in future years, it must do so in an annual 
     budget request or through a reprogramming.
       Budget Execution Plan.--The Commission shall provide a 
     specific budget execution plan to the Committees on 
     Appropriations of both Houses of Congress not later than 30 
     days after the enactment of this Act. The plan shall include 
     details at the product line level within each of the control 
     points.
       Unobligated Balances from Prior Appropriations.--The 
     Commission carries unobligated balances from appropriations 
     received prior to fiscal year 2017. The agreement requires 
     the use of $15,000,000 of these balances, derived from fee-
     based activities. The Commission is directed to apply these 
     savings in a manner that continues to ensure the protection 
     of public health and safety and maintains the effectiveness 
     of the current inspection program. Because the Commission has 
     already collected fees corresponding to these activities in 
     prior years, the agreement does not include these funds 
     within the fee base calculation for determining authorized 
     revenues and does not provide authority to collect additional 
     offsetting receipts for their use. Any remaining unobligated 
     balances carried forward from prior years are subject to the 
     reprogramming guidelines in section 402 of the Act, and shall 
     only be used to supplement appropriations consistent with 
     those guidelines.
       Rulemaking.--The Commission shall submit a list of all 
     rulemaking activities planned, to include their priority, 
     schedule, and actions taken to adhere to the backfit rule, in 
     the annual budget request and the semi-annual report to 
     Congress on licensing and regulatory activities.
       Reporting Requirements.--The agreement directs the 
     Commission to submit the following reports:
       1. not later than 120 days after the enactment of this Act, 
     a report on the actions taken to improve the fidelity of 
     agency estimates of necessary FTE levels and to optimize the 
     structure of the agency over the next five years, including a 
     review of the size, function, and number of program offices 
     and regional offices; and
       2. quarterly reports on licensing goals and right-sizing 
     commitments, as described in the explanatory statement for 
     P.L. 114-113.
       Modeling and Simulation Tools.--The Commission is directed 
     to report to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses 
     of Congress not later than 180 days after the enactment of 
     this Act the Commission's potential uses of the Consortium 
     for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors' tools in its 
     licensing process and safety reviews.

     budget authority in one account to another. In addition to 
     transfers provided in this Act or other appropriations Acts, 
     and existing authorities, such as the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 
     1535), by which one part of the United States Government may 
     provide goods or services to another part, the Act allows 
     transfers using Section 4705 of the Atomic Energy Defense Act

 DIVISION E--FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS 
                               ACT, 2018

       The joint explanatory statement accompanying this division 
     is approved and indicates congressional intent. Unless 
     otherwise noted, the language set forth in House Report 115-
     234 carries the same weight as language included in this 
     joint explanatory statement and should be complied with 
     unless specifically addressed to the contrary in this joint 
     explanatory statement. While some language is repeated for 
     emphasis, it is not intended to negate the language referred 
     to above unless expressly provided herein.
       Reports.--Where the House or Senate has directed submission 
     of a report, that report is to be submitted to the Committees 
     on Appropriations of the House and Senate. Agencies funded by 
     this Act that currently provide separate copies of periodic 
     reports and correspondence to the chairs and ranking members 
     of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees and 
     Subcommittees on Financial Services and General Government 
     are directed to use a single cover letter jointly addressed 
     to the chairs and ranking members of the Committees and 
     Subcommittees of both the House and the Senate. To the 
     greatest extent feasible, agencies should include in the 
     cover letter a reference or hyperlink to facilitate 
     electronic access to the report and provide the documents by 
     electronic mail delivery. These measures will help reduce 
     costs, conserve paper, expedite agency processing, and ensure 
     that consistent information is conveyed concurrently to the 
     majority and minority committee offices of both chambers of 
     Congress.

     steps taken to carry out the Eliminate, Neutralize, and 
     Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016 during this fiscal 
     year.
       Management of Capital Investments.--The Department is 
     directed to include in its annual Capital Investment Plan,

     undertaken by Treasury employees in the provision of 
     technical assistance; timeframes within which the activities 
     have occurred; number of full-time-equivalent hours devoted 
     to provision of the activities; and documentation that the 
     activities have occurred.

     destruction, terrorism, transnational organized crime, the 
     Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Russia, Belarus, North 
     Korea, Iran, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and

     from the CEA.
       Spend Plans.--The CIO of each Treasury office and bureau 
     must submit a spend plan for each prospective investment 
     under this heading to the Treasury Department CIO for review.

     submitted under the CEA heading to improve oversight of these 
     funds across the Department; none of the funds under this 
     heading will be available to fund such an investment without 
     the approval of the Treasury CIO. The spend plans should 
     include how the investment will: enhance Department-wide 
     coordination of cybersecurity efforts and improve the 
     Department's responsiveness to cybersecurity threats; provide 
     bureau and agency leadership with greater visibility into 
     cybersecurity efforts and further encourage information 
     sharing across bureaus; improve identification of cyber 
     threats and better protect information systems from attack; 
     provide a platform to enhance efficient communication, 
     collaboration, and transparency around the common goal of 
     improving not only the cybersecurity of the Treasury 
     Department, but also the Nation's financial sector. The spend 
     plans should detail the type of cybersecurity enhancement the 
     investment represents, and the cost, scope, schedule of the 
     investment, and explain how it complements existing cyber 
     efforts.

     the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
       Opioid Crisis.--The Office of National Drug Control Policy 
     (ONDCP) is a key participant in efforts to combat the opioid 
     epidemic. As ONDCP carries out its mission, it is critically 
     important to ensure that rural and underserved areas that are

     addiction, including those with the highest opioid overdoses 
     and death rates, and those participating in the Heroin 
     Response Strategy.
       Opioid Addiction.--As prescription drug monitoring programs 
     successfully control the supply of prescription drugs

     opioid addiction and the resultant increase in trafficking 
     of, and addiction to, heroin and other opioids is a threat to 
     communities across the nation. The HIDTA Program through 
     ONDCP, is encouraged, to the extent practicable, to 
     prioritize discretionary funds to aid states where heroin and 
     opioid addiction is a threat. HIDTAs enable necessary 
     coordination of law enforcement efforts and support for state 
     and local law enforcement and must continue to play a 
     significant role in the eradication of heroin and 
     prescription drug diversion.

     listed products, and a process for customers to report 
     misleading or inaccurate listings.
       Buy American.--The creation of a government-wide website, 
     called BuyAmerican.gov, would provide a comprehensive 
     government-wide repository for information about waivers to 
     the Buy American Act, Berry Amendment and other domestic 
     content statutes; assist small- and medium-sized 
     manufacturers; and achieve some of the goals of President 
     Trump's Executive Order on Buy American. GSA is encouraged, 
     in conjunction with OMB, to examine the feasibility of 
     establishing such a website, and to report to the House and 
     Senate Committees on Appropriations within 120 days after

     effect of this development plan on the security of the Court 
     and other federal agencies in the courthouse. GSA is directed 
     to review the current development plan to ensure that it does 
     not pose security problems independent of existing security 
     issues at the courthouse and report back to the House and

     properties.

     and equip DHS frontline forces protecting the homeland.
       The language set forth in House Report 115-239 carries the

     the Department of Homeland Security; ``component'' should be 
     interpreted to mean an agency, administration, or directorate 
     within the Department of Homeland Security; and ``budget

                         operations and support

       A total of $139,602,000 is provided for Operations and 
     Support, including not more than $30,000 for official 
     reception and representation (ORR) expenses.
       DHS is directed to continue to submit quarterly obligation 
     reports to the Committees for all ORR expenses and shall 
     refrain from using such funds for unnecessary collectibles or 
     memorabilia. A decrease of $10,000 is assessed to the 
     Secretary's ORR funds due to the assumption of $657,000,000 
     in unauthorized fee revenue in the fiscal year 2018 budget 
     request. The Department is directed to work with the Office 
     of Management and Budget (OMB) to ensure that future budget 
     requests do not assume savings from fee proposals that have 
     not been authorized. Bill language has been included to 
     require the Department to submit a budget amendment to reduce 
     spending commensurate with any fee increase that has not been 
     authorized within 60 days of a proposal. Based on technical 
     assistance provided by the Department, a reduction of 
     $1,647,000 has been distributed within the account to reflect 
     more realistic hiring projections for the remainder of the 
     fiscal year.
       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
     follows:

       The Department is directed to provide complete 
     justification materials in future budget requests and to 
     provide details for each office and program, clearly 
     describing the funds necessary to continue current services 
     at the previous fiscal year level, all transfers, any 
     adjustments that have been made to base funding, and all 
     proposed program changes.
       The REAL ID program improves the security of state 
     identification materials. The Secretary has the discretion to 
     grant a state additional time to meet the required minimum 
     standards if the state provides adequate justification for 
     delayed compliance. States should have the opportunity to 
     consider methods of compliance consistent with individual 
     state values and traditions.
       DHS is engaged in a number of commendable efforts to end 
     human trafficking and child exploitation. Within 60 days of 
     the date of enactment of this Act, DHS shall brief the 
     Committees on component efforts to combat human trafficking 
     and child exploitation and include the following information 
     by component and PPA: a comprehensive list of DHS activities 
     to identify, locate, and protect children against 
     exploitation; the metrics used by DHS to track and evaluate 
     these activities; funding levels associated with these 
     activities; a comprehensive list of state, local, 
     international, and non-government agency partners for these 
     activities; the authorities by which DHS is carrying out 
     these activities; additional authorities that would improve 
     DHS's ability to carry out these activities domestically or 
     internationally; and DHS's progress toward meeting 
     requirements under Public Law 115-125.
       The Department is expected to work in partnership with the 
     U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to improve cooperative efforts 
     to better address wildlife trafficking, and to expeditiously 
     provide overdue reports on wildlife trafficking to the 
     Committees. In addition, an updated report on wildlife 
     trafficking, as outlined in the explanatory statement 
     accompanying Public Law 115-31, shall be provided to the 
     Committees not later than November 15, 2018.
       The recently completed northern border threat analysis 
     required by Public Law 114-267 provides the Department with 
     specific information on how best to target and deploy 
     resources along the northern border. The Department is 
     directed to implement the report's key recommendations as 
     part of an operationally focused strategy along the northern 
     border. Future budget requests should detail specific 
     northern border staffing requirements and request funding for 
     implementation of planned northern border enforcement 
     initiatives by field office.
       Should the currently productive relationship between DHS 
     and GAO change, the Committees shall be notified immediately.


                        office of the secretary

       A total of $18,846,000 is provided for the Office of the 
     Secretary.
       The Department shall continue to submit quarterly Border 
     Security Status reports and data on the deportation of 
     parents of U.S.-born children semiannually, as in prior 
     years.
       Airports, airlines, and industry have demonstrated a strong 
     willingness to engage with U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
     (CBP) to develop concepts of operations and technologies 
     necessary to facilitate legitimate travel while enhancing 
     security. CBP's facial recognition technology pilot 
     deployments at several airports, including Hartsfield-Jackson 
     Atlanta International Airport and Washington Dulles 
     International Airport, and the ongoing expansion to airports 
     around the United States, have shown great promise. In the 
     near term, CBP is expected to obligate funding to build a 
     back-end communications portal to connect with airlines; 
     develop new software capabilities that leverage one-to-many 
     facial biometric searching and matching; test and maintain 
     biometric equipment; and perform demonstrations with airline 
     participants for entry in the air environment, and for entry 
     and exit in the land and vehicle pedestrian environments. The 
     Department is directed to brief the Committees semiannually 
     on efforts to deploy entry and exit data collection 
     technologies in both the air and land border environments, 
     with the first such briefing due not later than 90 days after 
     the date of enactment of this Act.
       U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) continues to 
     find success through its Biometric Identification 
     Transnational Migration Alert Program, which involves 
     biometric data collection from special interest aliens, 
     violent criminals, fugitives, and confirmed or suspected 
     terrorists encountered

[[Page H2545]]

     by foreign law enforcement and military personnel. The 
     Department, in conjunction with appropriate partner agencies, 
     shall brief the Committees not later than 90 days after the 
     date of enactment of this Act on these important efforts.
       The rate of illegal border crossing slowed significantly 
     during 2017, but the efforts of the Government of Mexico to 
     secure its southern border must remain an important focus. 
     Both the United States and Mexico must continue working with 
     the Governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to 
     improve their civil law enforcement capabilities, including 
     by sharing criminal history information, prior orders of 
     removal, and immigration enforcement actions. ICE's Criminal 
     History Information Sharing agreements with the Bahamas, the 
     Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and 
     Jamaica continue to be productive, in addition to ICE's work 
     with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Criminal Justice 
     Information System Advocacy Board to increase the number of 
     conviction codes that are shared between nations. Not later 
     than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
     Department, in conjunction with the appropriate components 
     and partner agencies, shall brief the Committees on these 
     efforts, including details on where any law enforcement, 
     coordination, or information sharing gaps exist.
       The Department's Entry/Exit Overstay Report for fiscal year 
     2016 revealed that, at the end of that year, there were 
     628,799 individuals who remained in the United States beyond 
     their authorized period of stay and for whom departure from 
     the United States could not be verified. The Department is 
     directed to develop and report within 180 days of the date of 
     enactment of this Act on a statistically sound metric for 
     measuring the total nonimmigrant air and sea overstay 
     population in the United States at a given time. The report 
     should also describe the characteristics of suspected in-
     county overstays and detail how the Department will improve 
     its collection and use of data sets necessary to develop a 
     more comprehensive in-country alien overstay estimate. GAO 
     shall review the metric developed in this report and provide 
     a preliminary briefing to the Committees on its review not 
     later than 90 days after the report is provided to the 
     Committees.
       The Department is further directed to develop and publish a 
     comprehensive in-country alien overstay enforcement and 
     deterrence strategy not later than 240 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act. This strategy shall, at a minimum, 
     establish a target and range of options for reducing the 
     overstay population and detail the resources and assets that 
     would be required to implement the strategy.
       The Department shall also report within 180 days of the 
     date of enactment of this Act on how to improve its 
     collection and use of data sets necessary to develop an 
     estimate for the entire population of those illegally present 
     in the United States. GAO shall review this report and 
     provide a preliminary briefing to the Committees on its 
     review not later than 90 days after the report is provided to 
     the Committees.
       The Department's reliance on sourcing personal protective 
     equipment, organizational clothing, and individual equipment 
     from foreign manufacturers misses an opportunity to support 
     the U.S. manufacturing economy while also enhancing security 
     by using products made in America. The Secretary is directed 
     to take immediate steps to increase the share of American-
     made products in its procurements and to provide a report to 
     the Committees, not later than 180 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, on any obstacles to the Department's 
     ability to transition to procuring 100 percent American-
     manufactured goods. The report should also propose solutions 
     to any such obstacles and detail progress the Department is 
     making toward increasing its utilization of American goods. 
     Additionally, the Department shall provide a report not later 
     than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act on DHS's 
     compliance with the Buy American Act and Kissell Amendment, 
     as detailed in the House report.
       The agreement includes $5,765,000, which is $900,000 above 
     the amount in the budget request, to enhance the Joint 
     Requirements Council's (JRC) capacity for cross-component 
     requirements analysis and development. DHS is directed to 
     continue to provide quarterly briefings on the JRC to the 
     Committees. DHS should consider the importance of maintaining 
     independence between the requirements development and 
     acquisition processes as part of this review. DHS is directed 
     to continue to provide quarterly briefings on the JRC and 
     shall brief the Committees on any reorganization of 
     headquarters organizational units not later than 60 days 
     before any such reorganization takes place.
       The Department is directed to provide a briefing to the 
     Committees, not later than 180 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, on the extent of persecution and 
     violence against religious minorities in Indonesia. The 
     briefing shall include the manner in which the Department 
     coordinates with the Departments of Justice and State to 
     comply with sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and 
     Nationality Act of 1952 and the regulations promulgated 
     pursuant to section 2242(b) of the Foreign Affairs Reform and 
     Restructuring Act of 1998.
       The Department is encouraged to continue its efforts toward 
     full implementation of the Plan to Support Increased Public 
     Access to the Results of Research Funded published on 
     December 27, 2016. The Department is directed to provide an 
     update on progress made in future budget requests.
       Coordination among DHS agencies and state, local, tribal, 
     territorial, and foreign law enforcement agencies, to include 
     state police crime labs, ensures the efficient use of 
     resources and improves public safety outcomes. The Department 
     should continue to provide assistance, as appropriate, to 
     state police crime labs to ensure that federal requirements 
     do not burden state resources or cause a backlog that slows 
     investigations. The Department shall report annually on its 
     use of and partnerships with state crime labs, including 
     funding associated with such uses and partnerships, and 
     should fully reimburse state crime labs for all provided 
     services.


                            office of policy

       A total of $40,524,000 is provided for the Office of 
     Policy.
       The agreement includes $4,787,400 to accelerate the build-
     out of the Immigration Data Integration Initiative. This 
     initiative continues departmental efforts directed by the 
     Committees on Appropriations in prior years based on 
     bipartisan, bicameral concerns about the inability of the 
     Department to provide timely reporting of border security and 
     immigration enforcement data.


                  office of partnership and engagement

       A total of $13,373,000 is provided for the Office of 
     Partnership and Engagement.
       The Blue Campaign, a department-wide initiative to combat 
     human trafficking, has historically been operated by 
     personnel detailed from components and funded through end-of-
     year contributions from components, an approach that is not 
     appropriate for the program's long-term sustainment. The 
     Fiscal Year 2017 DHS Appropriations Act included direct 
     funding of $819,000 for the Blue Campaign to support 
     dedicated personnel, as requested, and to begin transitioning 
     the program away from reliance on component contributions. 
     Unfortunately, the fiscal year 2018 request proposed no 
     direct funding for the program. The fiscal year 2018 bill 
     again includes $819,000, the full level authorized under 
     Public Law 115-125, in continued direct funding for 
     personnel. DHS is directed to sustain the program at not less 
     than its total fiscal year 2016 level of $5,150,000 in fiscal 
     year 2018 using component contributions to cover non-
     personnel program costs. DHS shall account for and propose 
     full, direct funding for the program in the justification 
     materials that accompany all future budget submissions, as 
     directed in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 
     115-31.
       A directive is included under the heading for the Office of 
     the Secretary for DHS to brief the Committees on the status 
     of the ongoing DHS effort to review roles, responsibilities, 
     and the potential reorganization of headquarters elements, 
     which should include an assessment of the appropriate 
     organizational placement for the Blue Campaign.
       The Department is directed to assess ways it can better 
     understand rural issues as they relate to the homeland 
     security mission and how rural communities are impacted by 
     the Department's decisions. Not later than 180 days after the 
     date of enactment of this Act, the Department shall brief the 
     Committees on this assessment, component best practices, and 
     the potential advantages of establishing a rural advocate 
     position at the department level.


              office for civil rights and civil liberties

       A total of $23,571,000 is provided for the Office for Civil 
     Rights and Civil Liberties (OCRCL). Funding provided above 
     the request is to accommodate the increased workload expected 
     in fiscal year 2018 resulting from new executive orders. 
     OCRCL shall maintain its independence as it continues to help 
     departmental components ensure their compliance with civil 
     rights and civil liberties laws and policies.


                             privacy office

       A total of $8,464,000 is provided for the Privacy Office. 
     Funding above the request is to accommodate an increased 
     workload in fiscal year 2018 resulting from new immigration-
     related executive orders, policies, and programs. Further, 
     the additional funds are available to ensure information and 
     data released by the Department does not reveal the identity 
     or personally identifiable information of non-citizens who 
     may be survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, 
     stalking, human trafficking, or other crimes. The Privacy 
     Office must ensure the Department's actions do not violate 
     the Privacy Act, the Violence Against Women Act, or other 
     laws. The Privacy Office is directed to provide a briefing to 
     the Committees within 60 days of the date of enactment of 
     this Act on the measures the Department will take to ensure 
     all record systems properly restrict information related to 
     survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, 
     human trafficking, and other crimes.

                         operations and support

       A total of $710,297,000 is provided for Operations and 
     Support. Within the total, $227,516,000 is available until 
     September 30, 2019, to include $36,368,000 for the Chief 
     Readiness Support Officer, $188,217,000 for the Chief 
     Information Officer (CIO), and $2,931,000 for headquarters 
     operations at the Nebraska Avenue Complex. Based on technical

         Immediate Office of the Under Secretary for Management

       A total of $6,770,000 is provided for the Immediate Office 
     of the Under Secretary for Management.
       The Secretary is reminded that the explanatory statement 
     accompanying the Fiscal Year 2017 Homeland Security 
     Appropriations Act directed the Department to establish a 
     Public Complaint and Feedback System Working Group comprised 
     of representatives of DHS components with public-facing 
     operations. The purpose of the group should be to support the 
     sharing of best practices and, as appropriate, the 
     standardization of feedback mechanisms, processes, customer 
     service metrics, and reporting across the Department. The 
     working group was directed to:
       1. Develop a DHS-wide ``as-is'' assessment of the various 
     public complaint and feedback intake and resolution processes 
     and systems currently in place, to include an evaluation of 
     the public's awareness of how to successfully provide 
     feedback to DHS, along with component-level policies, 
     practices, and capabilities for providing timely responses, 
     reporting results, and incorporating feedback into policy 
     development and training;
       2. Research best practices for public feedback intake, 
     processing, resolution, and reporting, as well as for 
     improving public awareness of the process;
       3. Identify gaps and redundancies within each component's 
     processes and systems;
       4. Develop and disseminate guidance that communicates 
     requirements for component-level public complaint and 
     feedback intake and resolution systems, processes, and 
     reporting capabilities;
       5. Establish processes for centrally compiling and 
     reporting component-level public complaint and feedback data 
     at the department level; and
       6. Determine whether aspects of the overall DHS public 
     complaint and feedback process should be supported with 
     headquarters resources.
       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this 
     Act, the Department shall brief the Committees on the working 
     group's findings and progress, including a plan and schedule 
     for carrying out all of the activities described above. In 
     addition, the Department shall continue to report to the 
     Committees semiannually on the working group's progress until 
     each of the assigned tasks are complete.
       Within the amount recommended for the Office of the Chief 
     Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) is $4,200,000 to continue the 
     Cybersecurity Internship Program. OCHCO is directed to ensure 
     that these funds are fully used for the intended purpose and 
     to update the Committees on the status of the program by 
     September 30, 2018. This update should include the number of 
     internship applications for the fiscal year 2018 cohort; the 
     number of internships offered and accepted; the rate of 
     acceptance; a description of the Department's efforts to 
     publicize the availability of these internship opportunities, 
     with a particular focus on outreach to underrepresented 
     populations; and options for improving such outreach.
       The Under Secretary for Management (USM) is directed to 
     conduct a study on the feasibility of establishing an 
     initiative to employ Native American veterans within the 
     ranks of CBP, including the potential creation of a tribal-
     specific branch of the Border Patrol. Specifically, the study 
     should evaluate how the hiring of Native American veterans 
     could leverage tribal authorities to complement CBP 
     authorities in support of the Border Patrol mission. In 
     conducting this study, the USM should solicit input from 
     tribes located along both the southern and northern borders. 
     The results of this study shall be submitted to the 
     Committees not later than 180 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act.


             office of the chief readiness support officer

       A total of $71,105,000 is provided for the Office of the 
     Chief Readiness Support Officer.
       Effectively tracking, managing, and maintaining tactical 
     communications assets requires appropriate governance 
     programs and infrastructure. In lieu of related House report 
     language, the Department shall brief the Committees not later 
     than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act on plans 
     to modernize tactical communications and vehicles across the 
     Department, including those directly affecting the missions 
     of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and 
     Customs Enforcement, and the United States Secret Service.
       Within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act, DHS 
     is directed to conduct a review of component fleet 
     utilization and to provide OIG with supporting documentation 
     on methods used for determining optimal fleet inventories and 
     justification for any deviation from GSA's Federal Property 
     Management Regulations.


               office of the chief human capital officer

       A total of $71,052,000 is provided for the Office of the 
     Chief Human Capital Officer, which includes an additional 
     $10,000,000 for the Cyber Statutory Authority Program.


                  office of the chief security officer

       A total of $74,963,000 is provided for the Office of the 
     Chief Security Officer, to include an increase of $1,764,000 
     for Office of Personnel Management security clearance 
     investigations.


                office of the chief procurement officer

       A total of $102,615,000 is provided for the Office of the 
     Chief Procurement Officer including $2,493,000 for the DHS 
     Data Framework.
       Based on required congressional notifications, it is 
     evident that departmental components enter into contracts 
     near the end of the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal 
     year at a much higher rate than at other times throughout the 
     year. The Department's continued practice of awarding a large 
     number of contracts late in the fiscal year remains 
     concerning, particularly for contracts related to OMB object 
     classes 25.1, 25.2, 25.3, and 26.
       The Department has indicated that planned obligations by 
     object class described in the annual Budget Appendix may not 
     accurately predict actual spending during the budget year due 
     to variances between the budget request and enacted 
     appropriations. Planned and actual spending appear to vary 
     more than would be expected, however, if it were due only to 
     changes between requested and appropriated amounts, when 
     appropriations are enacted, or changes in planning 
     assumptions that emerge during execution.
       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this 
     Act, the Department shall provide to the Committees revised 
     spending plans for all Operations and Support accounts and 
     the Coast Guard Operating Expenses account for each of these 
     object classes, including planned contract obligations by 
     fiscal quarter, as part of the quarterly obligation plans. 
     For contracts in excess of $1,000,000, the plan should also 
     detail planned contract amounts, provide brief contract 
     requirement descriptions, describe whether the contract is 
     for a new requirement, and explain whether the contract will 
     meet bona fide requirements for the current or next fiscal 
     year. The Department will ensure the final obligation plan 
     report for fiscal year 2018 includes data on actual contract 
     awards and describes the factors behind any significant 
     variances between the revised spending plan and actual 
     contract awards.


                 Office of the Chief Financial Officer

       A total of $63,734,000 is provided for the Office of the 
     Chief Financial Officer (OCFO).
       In keeping with past practice, annual budget justifications 
     shall include the text and citation of all Department 
     appropriations provisions enacted to date that are permanent 
     law.
       While the new Common Appropriations Structure provides 
     additional financial flexibility, DHS shall continue to 
     aggressively institute financial management policies and 
     procedures, particularly as they relate to budget 
     formulation.
       In lieu of related House report guidance, the OCFO shall 
     provide a briefing to the Committees on recommended periods 
     of availability and PPA structures for DHS and component 
     appropriations accounts within 45 days of the date of 
     enactment of this Act.


                Office of the Chief Information Officer

       A total of $320,058,000 is provided for the Office of the 
     Chief Information Officer (OCIO).
       The OCIO is to be commended for its leadership in data 
     center consolidation, which is enhancing the effectiveness, 
     efficiency, and security of the DHS IT enterprise. The OCIO 
     is further commended for its efforts to collaborate with the 
     National Aeronautics and Space Administration to gain 
     efficiencies by establishing IT operations centers at Data 
     Center 1 and by encouraging other federal partners to co-
     locate at DHS data centers. The OCIO shall provide semiannual 
     briefings on the execution of its major initiatives and 
     investment areas, with the first such briefing to occur not 
     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act. 
     These briefings shall include details regarding cost, 
     schedule, and the transfer of systems to or from DHS data 
     centers or external hosts.

     is available until September 30, 2019.
       The Department should continue increasing deployed field 
     personnel at State and Major Urban Area Fusion Centers that 
     provide outreach to critical infrastructure owners and 
     operators in addition to leveraging relationships with state, 
     local, tribal, and territorial stakeholders, state National 
     Guard units, and other federal partners in support of the 
     production of finished intelligence and raw intelligence 
     reports. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) shall 
     continue to provide semiannual briefings to the Committees on 
     the State and Local Fusion Centers program.
       I&A shall include in future year budget requests for the 
     classified budget the same level of detail required of other 
     appropriations and PPAs.
       The Department's Chief Intelligence Officer is directed to 
     brief the Committees on the I&A expenditure plan for fiscal 
     year 2018 within 60 days after the date of enactment of this 
     Act. The plan shall include the following:
         Details on actual and planned fiscal year 2018 
     expenditures and staffing allocations for each program as 
     compared to fiscal years 2016 and 2017;
         Data on all funded versus on-board positions, 
     including federal FTE, contractors, and reimbursable and non-
     reimbursable detailees;
         A plan for all programs and investments, 
     including dates or timeframes for achieving key milestones;
         The actual and planned allocation of funding 
     within each PPA for individual programs and a description of 
     the desired outcomes for fiscal year 2018; and
         Similar information on items outlined in the 
     classified annex accompanying this report.

                      Office of Inspector General


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $168,000,000 is provided for the OIG. When 
     combined with funding provided by recent disaster 
     supplemental appropriations bills, a total of $203,000,000 
     will have been provided during fiscal year 2018 for the OIG. 
     The agreement includes $1,289,000, as requested, for advanced 
     analytical capabilities required to carry out complex 
     investigations into increasingly sophisticated acquisition 
     fraud.
       Of the amounts provided as emergency supplemental 
     appropriations in Public Law 115-123, the OIG is expected to 
     obligate not less than $7,000,000 during fiscal year 2018 for 
     disaster-related investigations and audits. Of the amounts 
     provided by this Act, the OIG is directed to allocate not 
     less than $17,000,000 for disaster-related investigations and 
     audits. The OIG is expected to include in future budget 
     requests information that breaks down proposed expenditures 
     by focus area and activity type.
       The OIG shall continue its program of unannounced 
     inspections of immigration detention facilities and publish 
     the results of the inspections and other reports related to 
     custody operations activities on its public website.
       The OIG is responsible for conducting annual audits of DHS 
     fleet management practices and shall make the results for 
     non-law enforcement sensitive components publicly available.

                   U.S. Customs and Border Protection


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $11,485,164,000 is provided for Operations and 
     Support, of which $681,441,500 is made available until 
     September 30, 2019, to provide flexibility in the year of 
     execution. This amount includes increases above the request 
     for the following: $10,000,000 for recruitment and retention

       Within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act, CBP is 
     directed to brief the Committees on a comprehensive, multi-
     year recruitment and retention strategy that includes: an 
     analysis of the screening process for prospective staff, 
     including polygraph examinations; current and planned hiring 
     and retention initiatives executed by both federal and 
     contract staff; options to address pay parity relative to 
     other components and other federal law enforcement agencies; 
     the potential use of special pays to improve retention; the 
     use of incentives available through the Office of Personnel 
     Management to recruit, relocate, and retain employees 
     assigned to remote locations; and potential new career path 
     enhancements for personnel who choose such locations. CBP is 
     encouraged to work with community, local, and tribal colleges 
     to assist with recruitment efforts. In addition, CBP should 
     continue collaborating with the Department of Defense, as 
     required by the Border Jobs for Veterans Act (Public Law 114-
     68), to facilitate the recruitment of personnel exiting the 
     military.
       While the staffing requirement for Office of Field 
     Operations (OFO) CBP officers is well understood, CBP has not 
     yet finalized a staffing model to inform the hiring of either 
     Border Patrol agents or Air and Marine Operations (AMO) 
     personnel. The budget request for new Border Patrol agents, 
     in particular, was not supported by any analysis of workload 
     and capability gaps across CBP that would be necessary to 
     evaluate the benefits of the proposal as compared to other 
     investments at CBP, such as hiring additional CBP officers at 
     the ports of entry (POEs). CBP is directed to brief the 
     Committees quarterly on its progress toward developing a 
     comprehensive assessment of CBP-wide capability gaps, with 
     the first briefing due not later than 60 days after the date 
     of enactment of this Act.
       Not later than 30 days after the end of each month, CBP 
     shall post on its website a combined table of currency and 
     major categories of drugs, including fentanyl, interdicted by 
     OFO and the Border Patrol, including a separate accounting of 
     Border Patrol drug interdictions at checkpoints. Reported 
     quantities should be expressed using the same unit of 
     measurement.
       Prior to the completion of a Border Patrol staffing model 
     that can allocate agents based on risk, the Border Patrol is 
     directed to maintain not less than its previously determined 
     minimal staffing presence of 2,212 agents along the northern 
     border. CBP shall also take into special consideration 
     directing a significant proportion of any overall increase in 
     CBP officer positions funded in this Act to understaffed POEs 
     in remote and rural locations.
       As part of its personnel recruitment and retention efforts 
     for hard-to-fill locations, CBP is directed to conduct a 
     feasibility study on opportunities to help make high-speed 
     Internet service options available at CBP-owned residential 
     properties where they are currently limited or lacking. CBP 
     shall prioritize particularly remote locations along the 
     northern and southern borders for this effort and include in 
     its analysis locations where high-speed Internet options are 
     currently available, could potentially be made available 
     through partnerships with nearby service providers, and where 
     there are currently no nearby high-speed Internet providers. 
     CBP shall consult with residents and their families 
     throughout the course of the study and update the Committees 
     on options for increasing the availability of services. Up to 
     $500,000 is made available in this Act to carry out the 
     study.
       CBP is directed to evaluate the charters, reporting 
     structures, and standard operating procedures for the Border 
     Patrol, OFO, and AMO and institute any changes necessary to 
     ensure that CBP components are efficiently coordinating and 
     that personnel and assets are deployed as efficiently and 
     effectively as possible to combat cross-border threats. CBP 
     shall brief the Committees on the results of this evaluation 
     within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act and 
     quarterly thereafter.
       In line with GAO's recommendations included in GAO-17-765T, 
     CBP is directed to develop robust performance metrics for all 
     deployed border security technologies; begin the collection 
     of performance data to evaluate the individual and collective 
     contributions of specific technologies; assess progress in 
     fully deploying planned technologies; and determine when 
     mission benefits from such deployments have been fully 
     realized.
       CBP is directed to work with counties along the U.S.-Mexico 
     border to identify unimproved county roads that are 
     predominately used by the Border Patrol and that provide 
     critical access to the border region for the purpose of 
     maintaining security. CBP is urged to incorporate the 
     maintenance and repair of the identified high-priority access 
     roads into its Tactical Infrastructure Maintenance and Repair 
     program.
       In lieu of direction in the House report, CBP shall provide 
     a briefing on border security operations and technology 
     operations and procurement, including but not limited to the 
     following:
       1.  The results of the ongoing demonstration efforts and 
     planned procurements for small unmanned aerial systems (UAS);
       2.  A review of fiber-optic technologies, to include the 
     feasibility and potential benefits of incorporating them into 
     border security systems;
       3.  An update on carrizo cane control efforts, as described 
     in the House report;
       4.  Details of search and rescue efforts during fiscal year 
     2017, as described in the House report; and
       5.  The status of the field test and recapitalization plan 
     for the Tethered Aerostat Radar System.


                       Border Security Operations

       The total includes $4,395,843,000 for Border Security 
     Operations. This amount includes increases above the request 
     for the following: $20,000,000 for vehicles; $3,000,000 for 
     the electronic geospatial information system, as detailed in 
     the House report; and $10,000,000 above the request for small 
     UAS. Despite significant investments in hiring, retention and 
     recruitment strategies, CBP estimates that the Border Patrol 
     will lose more agents than will be gained in fiscal year 
     2018, and these reduced payroll costs are reflected in the 
     bill.


                      Trade and Travel Operations

       The total includes $4,314,242,000 for Trade and Travel 
     Operations. This amount includes $7,655,000 for 328 new CBP 
     officers, reflecting the partial year costs of anticipated 
     new CBP officers, $23,000,000 for POE technology and 
     facilities, and $30,500,000 for opioid detection equipment 
     and labs. The recommendation does not include the proposal to 
     redirect fee revenue that currently supports the Brand USA 
     program to CBP for its trade and travel activities; this 
     proposal requires legal authorization that is not under the 
     jurisdiction of the Committees.
       Recent public dialogue on border security has focused on 
     the flow of undocumented aliens and illicit drugs across the 
     southern border of the United States between the POEs. As 
     borne out by DHS data on the illicit movement of people and 
     goods, however, border security investments must also be made 
     at the POEs, where between 80 and 90 percent of hard drugs 
     are interdicted. As compared to fiscal year 2016, seizures of 
     hard narcotics in fiscal year 2017--including cocaine, 
     methamphetamine, and fentanyl--have risen over 10 percent, 
     with the seizure of fentanyl more than doubling at the 
     POEs.--In addition, the growth of illegal online 
     marketplaces, notably those on the ``dark web,'' make higher 
     potency narcotics increasingly accessible to American 
     consumers.
       CBP is working to address this growing threat at its 
     International Mail Facilities through the use of canines 
     trained to detect opioids, the deployment of new non-
     intrusive inspection technologies, improved information 
     sharing, and additional personnel, but--more work and 
     investments are needed. In addition, the Department must 
     better articulate the role and plans for expansion of the 
     National Targeting Center (NTC), including how it will 
     coordinate with and complement the work of the recently-
     announced National Vetting Center.
       It is the role of the Committees to ensure that DHS 
     comprehensively evaluates vulnerabilities at POEs; formulates 
     strategic, risk-based goals to address those vulnerabilities; 
     and makes investments accordingly. Within 180 days of the 
     date of enactment of this Act, CBP is directed to produce a 
     multi-year strategic plan for mitigating vulnerabilities and 
     filling capability gaps at POEs while improving the flow of 
     commerce. The plan shall include clear goals and metrics, an 
     implementation schedule, and cost estimates. More 
     specifically, the plan shall address the following:
       (1) Measuring Border Security at the Ports of Entry:--
     Headquarters-driven definitions and metrics to measure 
     success at POEs developed through a capability gap analysis 
     process approved by the Executive Assistant Commissioner of 
     OFO and informed by the Field Operations Directors.
       (2) Focus Areas: A scope reflecting the full breadth of 
     agency authorities and responsibilities at the POEs, 
     including at a minimum the programs identified in the Fiscal 
     Year 2017 Border Security Improvement Plan, along with the 
     following:
       a.  A counternarcotics strategy, to include e-commerce 
     threats;
       b.  A counter-network strategy;
       c.  The biometric entry-exit system;
       d.  Trade and travel facilitative programs, including the 
     Automated Commercial Environment;
       e.  Agricultural inspection programs; and
       f.  Trusted traveler programs at air, sea, and land POEs.
       (3) Associated Requirements: Accompanying requirements 
     through fiscal year 2022, including:
       a. Life cycle cost estimates for all technology equipment 
     categories, including procurement quantities and costs, and 
     operations and maintenance costs; and
       b. Any new legal authorities necessary for implementing the 
     plan.
       Any analysis to assess and improve hiring practices and 
     procedures should reflect and meet the needs of large U.S. 
     international airports with high numbers of international 
     tourist enplanements that do not share a contiguous land 
     border with Mexico or Canada. Any resulting staffing 
     decisions must be transparent and impartial.
       CBP shall brief the Committees within 120 days of the date 
     of enactment of this Act on how it allocates personnel 
     between passenger and cargo inspection functions at maritime 
     ports and on proposed solutions for addressing persistent 
     staff shortages that lead to increased annual costs for such 
     ports and affiliated local governments.
       CBP's fee-for-service regime was originally meant to 
     facilitate international passengers who depart or arrive from 
     small airports.--In some instances, however, fee-for-service 
     has

[[Page H2549]]

     been used for many years by some medium-sized airports that 
     have a consistently large volume of international passengers, 
     despite failed attempts to receive POE designation.--This 
     situation is of particular concern because these airports' 
     passengers are essentially charged twice for the same 
     service--once through federal fees paid when their airline 
     tickets are purchased, and again through the CBP fee-for-
     service costs that are charged directly to airports and 
     inevitably passed on to passengers. To determine whether a 
     fee-for-service airport can be designated as a POE, CBP 
     relies on a series of Treasury Directives promulgated decades 
     ago when the then-U.S. Customs Service was part of the 
     Treasury Department.--CBP is urged to address this issue by 
     giving priority consideration to an application for POE 
     status submitted by any commercial airport if such airport 
     served at least 90,000 international passengers, not 
     including those arriving through a preclearance location, 
     during the previous calendar year.
       The agreement directs CBP to consider modifying relevant 
     policies and operations regarding small airport inspection 
     services at general aviation facilities currently used by CBP 
     for intermittent international clearance operations, and to 
     work creatively with airports, including Green Bay-Austin 
     Straubel International Airport, to facilitate international 
     service in a manner consistent with CBP security and resource 
     requirements and informed by these airports' fiscal 
     constraints and existing facilities.
       The fiscal year 2013 CBP Resource Optimization Report 
     estimated that the deployment of automated scheduling and 
     timekeeping solutions by OFO could return 158 CBP Officers 
     and Agricultural Specialists to their frontline inspection 
     and law enforcement duties. CBP shall evaluate commercially-
     available automated scheduling tools, brief the Committees on 
     the results of the evaluation within 90 days of the date of 
     enactment of this Act, and deploy such solutions if it is 
     determined that their benefits outweigh their costs.
       CBP is directed to consult with affected community members, 
     industry representatives, and elected officials at all levels 
     prior to making permanent changes to hours of service at POEs 
     and to notify the Committees at least 30 days in advance of 
     such changes.
       CBP and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continue to 
     collaborate through the Commercial Targeting and Analysis 
     Center to enhance shrimp-related targeting and inspection 
     processes to ensure that shrimp imported to the United States 
     are safe. Senate Report 114-264 directed CBP to carry out a 
     shrimp safety pilot project, which is expected to suggest 
     additional opportunities for enhanced CBP and FDA 
     coordination to improve imported shrimp safety. CBP is 
     directed to brief the Committees semiannually on these 
     activities.
       CBP shall continue timely tracking and reporting on Jones 
     Act waivers and violations, notifying the Committees within 
     two days of waiver requests and on the disposition of each 
     waiver request and making this information available to the 
     public on a quarterly basis.
       Firearms and illicit monetary instruments continue to be 
     smuggled from the U.S. into Mexico, fueling transnational 
     criminal organization activities, including drug trafficking 
     and violent crime. CBP shall continue to collaborate with 
     domestic and international partners to identify and apprehend 
     smugglers of firearms and undeclared monetary instruments 
     greater than $10,000, and shall report to Congress on any 
     additional authorities or resources needed to stymie the 
     flow.
       CBP is directed to continue working with Great Lakes 
     seaports, cruise vessel operators, and other Great Lakes 
     Cruise Program stakeholders to develop a cruise passenger 
     clearance plan for 2018 and thereafter. CBP shall continue 
     using mobile onboard passenger clearance technology until 
     such time as that plan has been implemented, and shall 
     provide the Committees with a briefing, not later than 90 
     days after the date of enactment of this Act, detailing its 
     stakeholder engagement efforts and outlining its plan and 
     schedule for resolving this issue.
       CBP is directed to develop a succession plan to ensure that 
     at least one person of appropriate rank is located in each 
     state at all times to enforce customs, immigration, and 
     agricultural laws and regulations at U.S. POEs. If CBP 
     determines that it is not practicable to meet this 
     requirement, CBP shall notify the Committees in writing not 
     later than 60 days before any staffing decision is finalized. 
     Such notifications shall include a fulsome explanation of why 
     the change is needed, an estimate of the number of passengers 
     and amount of goods that would be diverted elsewhere during a 
     lapse, and the resultant economic impact on the state.
       The total includes $10,000,000 for the Commercial 
     Technology Innovation Program, through which new commercial 
     technologies that may significantly improve POE operations 
     are deployed along southwest border POEs. CBP is directed to 
     brief the Committees on the performance of this program and 
     any related pilots or initiatives not later than 90 days 
     after the date of enactment of this Act.
       CBP is encouraged to continue to work with the General 
     Services Administration and OMB on the annual five-year land 
     border POE construction plan, which should include plans to 
     complete modernization of POEs along the northern border 
     built prior to 1980, and provide the plan to the Committees 
     upon its completion. In developing this plan, specific 
     attention shall be paid to the health, safety, and welfare 
     needs of CBP officers. CBP is also encouraged to increase 
     awareness and use of the NEXUS program along the Canadian 
     border, including through special enrollment events and the 
     use of collaborative signage in cooperation with state 
     transportation agencies. The five-year construction plan 
     should also anticipate and reflect increased traffic that 
     will result from higher rates of NEXUS participation.
       The bill authorizes the obligation of funds for 
     preclearance activities, including obligations in advance of 
     reimbursement, as authorized by the Trade Facilitation and 
     Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA). With Canada's adoption 
     of companion legislation, CBP is expected to begin 
     negotiation with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) on 
     expanding preclearance activities in Canada.
       The Department is directed to prioritize implementation of 
     expanded preclearance operations between the U.S. and Canada 
     for land, marine, rail, and air entries, as outlined in the 
     ``Beyond the Border Action Plan.'' CBP shall collaborate 
     closely with CBSA to ensure that plans for preclearance 
     operations at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, Quebec City 
     Jean Lesage International Airport, Montreal rail, and Rocky 
     Mountaineer rail proceed with an understanding that 
     operations must meet all terms and conditions of the 
     agreement. CBP should continue to routinely reassess the 
     security benefits of both existing and prospective 
     preclearance agreements.
       CBP is encouraged to continue prioritizing efforts to 
     improve the accuracy and effectiveness of automated cargo 
     processing for tractor trailers, including the proof-of-
     concept pilot at the World Trade Bridge Port of Entry in 
     Laredo, Texas. Not later than 120 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, CBP is directed to provide a report to 
     the Committees on these efforts, including activities planned 
     for fiscal year 2018 and the subsequent four fiscal years.
       As license plate reader technology used to analyze 
     vehicular traffic crossing land borders nears the end of its 
     useful life, CBP should continue to improve land border 
     integration by deploying the latest, most effective vehicle 
     monitoring technologies.
       A total of $211,797,000 is provided for Targeting 
     Operations. CBP's pre-arrival targeting capabilities have 
     expanded rapidly, with base resources dedicated to these 
     activities growing from $51,950,000 in fiscal year 2013 to 
     more than $128,000,000 in fiscal year 2017. While the 
     expansion of analytical capabilities at the NTC has been 
     swift, the proliferation of new tools and corresponding 
     contracts has shifted focus away from traditional trade, 
     customs, and immigration law enforcement targeting 
     activities. CBP should analyze and measure the benefits of 
     current activities and enhancements to improve targeting 
     against investments elsewhere within the agency and the 
     Department. CBP shall brief the Committees within 90 days of 
     the date of enactment of this Act on current and proposed 
     targeting metrics and milestones, impacts on frontline 
     staffing requirements, and the proposed end state for these 
     activities.
       The total includes $234,201,000 for the Office of Trade. 
     This amount includes $8,943,000 for additional staff and core 
     trade mission enhancements, including improved data analysis 
     and visualization capabilities to improve CBP's effectiveness 
     within the global supply chain while also addressing mandates 
     of TFTEA in a timely manner. CBP shall continue reporting on 
     its trade enforcement activities, as detailed in Senate 
     Report 114-264, shall post as much detail from the report as 
     is reasonable on its public website, and shall include 
     details on the implementation of Executive Order 13785, 
     Establishing Enhanced Collection and Enforcement of 
     Antidumping and Countervailing Duties and Violations of Trade 
     and Customs Laws.
       TFTEA made changes to the treatment of drawbacks, through 
     which duties, taxes, and fees on certain imported merchandise 
     can be refunded when the merchandise is subsequently exported 
     or destroyed, or when substitute merchandise is exported in 
     its place. Among those changes, certain U.S.-produced 
     alcoholic beverages and paper products, as described in 
     Senate Report 114-264, became eligible for substitution as 
     exports for unused merchandise drawback claims. CBP is 
     directed to consult with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and 
     Trade Bureau (TTB) and to clarify the requirements for 
     recovering duties, taxes, and fees imposed under federal law 
     (with emphasis on federal excise taxes) on imported alcohol 
     products when alcohol produced in the United States and 
     classified under the same eight or ten digit subheading of 
     the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States is 
     exported as a substitute. This clarification should describe 
     how CBP treats alcoholic beverages used as substitute 
     merchandise for the drawback of federal excise taxes on 
     unused merchandise when exported from TTB bonded facilities, 
     where federal excise taxes have not been collected.


                         Integrated Operations

       The total includes $1,065,979,000 for Integrated 
     Operations, to include increases above the request of 
     $15,000,000 for UAS upgrades and $3,000,000 for special pays 
     for recruitment and retention of AMO personnel.
       Due to the consolidated requirements and extended 
     deployment and implementation schedule associated with the 
     Spectrum Efficient National Surveillance Radar (SENSR)

[[Page H2550]]

     Program, low-flying aircraft detection coverage gaps along 
     the northern border remain a national security threat. Within 
     180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, AMO is 
     directed to provide the Committees with short-term deployment 
     plans for low-flying aircraft detection along the northern 
     border. These plans shall incorporate the anticipated 
     implementation schedule for the SENSR program and acquisition 
     and deployment schedules for interim technology or asset use.
       CBP shall continue to evaluate the potential for using 
     commercial service providers to provide pilots for UAS. In 
     addition, CBP is directed to work with the Federal Aviation 
     Administration to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of 
     cross-certifying pilots to fly both manned aircraft and UAS.
       In order to upgrade CBP's UAS fleet to a single 
     configuration, $15,000,000 is included above the request that 
     shall be used only to perform configuration upgrades. Within 
     60 days of the date of enactment of this Act, CBP is directed 
     to brief the Committees on the results of its evaluation of 
     whether additional UAS flight hours are necessary to support 
     border security operations.


                            Mission Support

       The total includes $1,709,100,000 for Mission Support. This 
     amount includes $10,000,000 above the request for recruitment 
     and retention efforts.


              PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS

       A total of $2,281,357,000 is provided for Procurement, 
     Construction, and Improvements. This amount includes the 
     following: $445,000,000 for 25 miles of primary pedestrian 
     levee fencing in Rio Grande Valley Sector, Texas; 
     $196,000,000 for primary pedestrian fencing in Rio Grande 
     Valley Sector, Texas; $251,000,000 for approximately 14 miles 
     of secondary replacement barrier in San Diego Sector, 
     California; $445,000,000 for replacement of existing primary 
     pedestrian fencing; $38,000,000 for border barrier planning 
     and design; $10,000,000 for innovative towers; $39,238,000 
     for Integrated Fixed Towers; $41,955,000 for cross border 
     tunnel threat; $3,000,000 for nationwide situational 
     awareness on handheld devices; $87,193,000 for Remote Video 
     Surveillance Systems; $16,000,000 for agent portable 
     surveillance systems; $16,000,000 for linear ground detection 
     systems; $10,000,000 for small UAS; $46,838,000 for Mobile 
     Video Surveillance Systems; $7,000,000 for Northern Border 
     RVSS; $9,000,000 for maritime detection projects on the 
     Northern Border; $49,738,000 for road construction, 
     $20,000,000 for unattended ground sensors; $2,739,000 for 
     tactical aerostats; $8,000,000 for Mobile Surveillance 
     Capability; $34,000,000 for the Automated Commercial

       CBP is directed to work with federal and industry partners 
     to evaluate the potential use of commercially developed, 
     space-based technologies to provide persistent, real-time 
     border surveillance and to brief the Committees on its 
     findings within 120 days of the date of enactment of this 
     Act.

                U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $6,993,975,000 is provided for Operations and 
     Support, of which $20,000,000 is made available until 
     September 30, 2019, in support of activities authorized under 
     18 U.S.C. 2510-2522, and of which $13,700,000 is made 
     available until September 30, 2019, in support of the Visa 
     Security Program and investigations abroad. The total 
     includes $10,596,000 to support the hiring of 65 additional 
     investigative agents. Additionally, $4,959,000 is provided 
     for attorneys and associated staff to support the Homeland

       Funding is provided within this account to continue 
     digitizing paper-based fingerprint records related to ICE's 
     immigration fraud investigation mission. Within 90 days of 
     the date of enactment of this Act, ICE shall brief the 
     Committees on plans for this work, as well as the status of 
     efforts to identify and refer to DOJ the individuals 
     identified in Office of Inspector General Report OIG-16-130 
     titled ``Potentially Ineligible Individuals Have Been Granted

       ICE shall clearly articulate the total funding levels 
     requested for vehicles and tactical communications equipment 
     in future budget requests and shall brief the Committees 
     within 60 days of the date of enactment of this Act on its 
     recapitalization plans for these items. The briefing shall 
     include an evaluation of a software solution to increase 
     operational accountability and efficiency of communication 
     systems and shall address recommendations in Office of 
     Inspector General Report OIG-13-113 titled ``DHS Needs to 
     Manage its Communications Program Better.''
       ICE shall continue to reflect service-wide costs (SWC) in 
     existing Mission Support sub-PPAs or through one or more new 
     SWC sub-PPAs within the Mission Support PPA in all future 
     budget requests, and shall provide separate budget estimates 
     and detailed justifications for all SWC.

                    Homeland Security Investigations

       Domestic Investigations. A total of $1,898,542,000 is 
     provided for Domestic Investigations. ICE is directed to 
     sustain enhancements provided in the fiscal year 2017 
     appropriations Act for programs and activities of 
     congressional interest as directed in the explanatory 
     statement accompanying Public Law 115-31.
       Funding is provided within the total to sustain fiscal year 
     2017 enhancements to the Child Exploitation Investigations 
     Unit at the Cyber Crimes Center, along with an additional 
     enhancement of not less than $5,000,000. Funding is also 
     provided to sustain fiscal year 2017 enhancements to the 
     Angel Watch Center and continued implementation of 
     International Megan's Law, along with an additional 
     enhancement of not less than $5,000,000. ICE is directed to 
     brief the Committees on a plan for the expenditure of these 
     funds not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of 
     this Act.
       The total includes $2,000,000 for Homeland Security 
     Investigations (HSI) to establish a pilot program to hire and 
     train up to 10 Computer Forensics Analysts (CFAs) to support 
     the Human Exploitation Rescue Operative

[[Page H2551]]

     (HERO) Corps' work on the above investigations. ICE is 
     directed to report to the Committees not later than 180 days 
     after the date of enactment of this Act on the development, 
     implementation, planned milestones, funding, and staffing 
     requirements for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 for this pilot. 
     The report shall also address this pilot's potential for 
     expansion to principal HSI domestic offices to support 
     investigations related to child exploitation, opioid and 
     fentanyl smuggling, and other cybercrimes.
       ICE is directed to provide a briefing on options for 
     establishing paid HERO apprenticeships not later than 30 days 
     after the date of enactment of this Act. ICE should continue 
     to train at least two classes of HEROs annually and should 
     employ HERO graduates at ICE or help place them with other 
     agencies or organizations with related missions, as 
     appropriate.
       The total includes not less than $305,000 for promoting 
     public awareness of the child pornography tip line and not 
     less than $15,770,000 for investigations of forced labor law 
     violations, to include forced child labor. ICE is directed to 
     continue to submit an annual report on expenditures and 
     performance metrics associated with forced labor law 
     enforcement activities.
       ICE is directed to continue prioritizing efforts to 
     investigate, remove, and prosecute individuals who have 
     committed human rights abuses, including persecution, 
     genocide, severe violations of religious freedom, torture, 
     extrajudicial killing, use or recruitment of child soldiers, 
     crimes against humanity, or war crimes.
       ICE's Tactical Intelligence Center (TIC) plays an important 
     role in combating the illicit movement of people and goods 
     into the United States through the Gulf of Mexico and has a 
     particular focus on maritime drug smuggling and transnational 
     criminal networks. The Department is directed to evaluate 
     whether it could better leverage the activities of other DHS 
     components and other federal and non-federal entities in the 
     region with related missions through the establishment of a 
     Regional Intelligence Integration Center more broadly focused 
     on the collection, analysis, and coordination of intelligence 
     related to ICE's Gulf Coast enforcement mission.
       International Investigations. The total includes 
     $169,178,000 for International Investigations, including 
     $1,286,000 for five HSI agents. This amount includes an 
     increase above the request of $18,000,000 to annualize the 
     costs of prior-year expansions to the Visa Security Program 
     (VSP) and to expand the program to new high priority 
     locations. ICE shall continue to expand the VSP where 
     operationally feasible at high-threat posts abroad and shall 
     ensure that support for this sustained level of operations 
     and growth is included in annual budget requests.
       ICE shall allocate not less than $5,300,000 for war crime 
     investigations, including but not limited to training, 
     transportation, and hiring of additional personnel at the 
     Office of the Principal Legal Advisor Human Rights Law 
     Section and the HSI Human Rights Violators and War Crimes 
     Unit.
       The report on the use of International Mobile Subscriber 
     Identity (IMSI) catchers mandated in Senate Report 114-264 
     was received December 28, 2017. While it addressed the use of 
     IMSI catchers and similar technologies in general terms, it 
     lacked the specificity directed in the reporting requirement. 
     ICE is directed to provide specific details for each of the 
     cases referenced in the report in which IMSI catchers and 
     related technologies were used by ICE to apprehend an 
     individual, and providing brief descriptions for each of the 
     times IMSI catchers and related technologies were used to 
     gather evidence relevant to a case against an apprehended 
     individual. These details and descriptions should only 
     provide information about the purpose or cause of the 
     individuals' apprehension and how IMSI catchers were used. In 
     no case should these descriptions contain personally 
     identifiable information.


                   Enforcement and Removal Operations

       The total includes $4,110,337,000 for Enforcement and 
     Removal Operations (ERO).
       Between October 1, 2017, and the date of enactment of this 
     Act, when the Department was operating under the terms of a 
     continuing resolution (CR), ICE exceeded its annualized rate 
     of funding for Custody Operations. During the period of any 
     future CR, including any CR for fiscal year 2019, ICE is 
     directed to manage its resources in a way that ensures it 
     will not exceed the annualized rate of funding for the fiscal 
     year. ICE is directed to update the Committees weekly on its 
     rate of operations for Custody Operations to demonstrate how 
     the agency is living within its means.
       ICE officials have stated publicly that enforcement actions 
     at sensitive locations--identified as schools, healthcare 
     facilities, places of worship, religious or civil ceremonies 
     or observances, and public demonstrations--should generally 
     be avoided, and its policy requires either prior approval 
     from an appropriate supervisory official or exigent 
     circumstances necessitating immediate action. ICE is expected 
     to continue to follow this policy and to work with state and 
     local law enforcement officials to ensure that ICE 
     administrative law enforcement activities do not affect the 
     willingness of victims to report crimes, and to otherwise 
     minimize any other interference with the investigation or 
     prosecution of crimes at the state and local levels.
       Within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act, and 
     monthly thereafter, the Director of ICE shall submit to the 
     Committees a Secure Communities report, as described in House 
     Report 115-239, and make the information publicly available 
     on its website.
       The agreement provides not less than $34,500,000, as 
     requested, to support the authorized level of 257 full-time 
     law enforcement specialists and officers at the Law 
     Enforcement Support Center (LESC). ICE is directed to take 
     steps to ensure that current LESC operations remain 
     centralized at the current facility and are not unnecessarily 
     duplicated in other parts of the country. ICE shall provide 
     the Committees with a detailed spending plan for the use of 
     LESC funds, including operations and staffing, not later than 
     60 days after the date of enactment of this Act. The 
     Department is also directed to notify the Committees prior to 
     the reallocation of any resources currently intended for LESC 
     operations in Vermont; it is expected that no such 
     reallocation will be made without Committee concurrence.
       ICE is directed to ensure that the LESC has the resources 
     and approvals necessary to fully utilize its recruitment 
     incentives program and to include details about this program 
     in the annual spending plan required in the above paragraph. 
     The LESC is encouraged to utilize hiring campaigns and other 
     outreach activities, including coordination with nearby 
     community, technical, and state colleges and universities, as 
     well as its available direct hiring authorities, to 
     accelerate the hiring of qualified applicants.
       Custody Operations. The total includes $3,075,686,000 for 
     Custody Operations.
       Improvements to throughput in the immigration enforcement 
     and adjudication continuum could reduce the average length of 
     stay for detainees, ultimately requiring less detention 
     funding and lowering the requirement for available detention 
     space. ICE shall continue working with federal partners, 
     including the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), 
     to ensure that aliens are treated fairly while moving through 
     the immigration adjudication process and shall provide 
     quarterly briefings to the Committees. These briefings shall 
     be provided by ICE and those partners and shall address the 
     implementation of strategies to improve the efficiency and 
     effectiveness of that process, including efforts to reduce 
     detainees' average length of stay. The first such briefing 
     shall be provided not later than 90 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act.
       ICE is directed to comply with the requirements of House 
     Report 115-239 related to detention facility inspections; 
     death-in-custody reporting; access to facilities; detainee 
     locator information; changes to the current detention 
     facility category and inspection framework; and compliance 
     with the 2011 Performance Based National Detention Standards 
     (PBNDS 2011) and Prison Rape Elimination Act requirements.
       ICE shall provide a report not later than 90 days after the 
     date of enactment of this Act detailing the number and type 
     of detention contracts and Intergovernmental Service 
     Agreements currently in effect and all costs associated with 
     them. In addition, the Director of ICE shall continue to 
     report to the Committees at least 30 days in advance of 
     entering into any new or significantly modified detention 
     contract or other detention agreement that does not meet or 
     exceed PBNDS 2011, as revised in 2016, and which was in 
     effect as of the date of enactment of this Act. Each report 
     shall include a justification for why such contract or 
     agreement requires different standards.
       ICE is expected to comply with the direction provided in 
     the Explanatory Statement accompanying Public Law 115-31 
     related to detention contracts and is directed to develop a 
     timeline detailing the steps the agency will take to recruit 
     additional personnel required for negotiating detention 
     contracts. ICE shall provide a briefing on this timeline not 
     later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act.
       The Lyon v. ICE, et al. Settlement Agreement required ICE 
     to improve detainee telephone access in four detention 
     facilities in Northern California. ICE is directed to ensure 
     appropriate telephone access for detainees at all of its 
     facilities, including contracted facilities, and to brief the 
     Committees on the feasibility, benefits, and costs of 
     adhering to some or all of the telephone access parameters of 
     the settlement agreement at all facilities within 90 days of 
     the date of enactment of this Act.
       ICE shall adhere to the guidance specified in House Report 
     115-239 regarding reporting of family separation incidents; 
     verifying the location, status, and disposition of separated 
     family members; and complying with its Parental Interests 
     Directive.
       ICE shall notify the Committees prior to releasing for 
     budgetary reasons any individual who is in removal 
     proceedings or who has a final order of removal. Any such 
     notification will include an explanation of how ICE assessed 
     the potential risk to the community by the release, the risk 
     of absconding associated with the release, and all efforts 
     taken by ICE or the Department to identify other funding 
     sources for transfer to this account to avoid such release.
       The Fugitive Operations Program and the Criminal Alien 
     Program shall continue to prioritize the apprehension and 
     removal of criminal aliens and individuals who pose a risk to 
     national security or public safety, as described in Executive 
     Order 13768.
       Fugitive Operations. ICE is directed to continue funding 
     for at least ten Mobile Criminal Alien Teams to supplement 
     immigration enforcement efforts that target at-

[[Page H2552]]

     large aliens with serious criminal records, to include sex 
     offenders, drug traffickers, gang members, and other violent 
     felons. Furthermore, ICE shall continue to allocate not less 
     than $10,000,000 to investigative and support activities 
     required to identify and remove aliens who have overstayed 
     their visas and shall brief the Committees semiannually on 
     the results of these efforts.
       Criminal Alien Program. The bill funds the 287(g) program 
     at the requested level of $24,321,000. As ICE expands the 
     number of jurisdictions participating in this program, it 
     must maintain rigorous processes to provide oversight of 
     287(g)-designated officers, make program transparency a high 
     priority, and proactively address stakeholder concerns. The 
     Office of State, Local, and Tribal Cooperation shall continue 
     outreach and communications to public stakeholders, and ICE 
     shall continue to require the establishment and regular use 
     of steering committees for each jurisdiction, as specified in 
     House Report 115-239. ICE shall notify the Committees prior 
     to implementing any significant changes to the 287(g) 
     program, including any changes to authorized activities, 
     training requirements, data collection, or selection 
     criteria. Furthermore, ICE is directed to provide an annual 
     report on the 287(g) program, as specified in House Report 
     115-239. In addition, the OIG and the OCRCL shall continue to 
     provide careful oversight of the program.
       Within the total, $2,000,000 is for continuing to provide 
     information to jurisdictions on ICE detainees with sex 
     offender or violent crime records who will reside in such 
     jurisdictions after being released from ICE custody. ICE 
     shall provide regular progress reports on this effort.
       Alternatives to Detention. The total includes $187,205,000 
     for the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program to support a 
     daily average of 79,000 participants, as requested. ICE is 
     directed to explore with its ATD contractor the potential for 
     applying some of the promising elements of the Family Case 
     Management Program into the larger ATD program, such as 
     introducing a Know Your Rights (KYR) program for new 
     participants, and to brief the Committees on this and other 
     feasible program improvements. With regard to introducing a 
     KYR element, the briefing shall indicate at what stage of the 
     enrollment process it would be most effective.
       ICE shall continuously explore the use of innovative ATD 
     models, and prioritize the use of detention alternatives, 
     including ATD and release on parole or bond, for individuals 
     and families who receive positive credible fear 
     determinations and do not present a public safety or flight 
     risk.
       Within the total, $3,000,000 is included for a pilot 
     program to enable certain aliens on the non-detained docket 
     to check in with ICE via self-service kiosks at ERO field 
     offices. The pilot should reduce the time and resources that 
     deportation officers devote to managing encounters and check-
     ins with applicable aliens, and allowing those officer 
     resources to devote more time and effort to improving 
     attendance at immigration hearings and compliance with 
     removal orders.
       ICE shall continue to provide performance reports to the 
     Committees on the ATD program, as described in House Report 
     114-668.


                            Mission Support

       A total of $458,558,000 is provided for Mission Support, 
     $108,167,000 above the request. Included in the funding is 
     $84,000,000 for replacement vehicles and $9,000,000 to 
     address the facility maintenance backlog. Additionally, 
     $6,000,000 is included to continue Immigration Data 
     Improvement activities in support of enhancing operational 
     transparency and strengthening resource allocation decisions.


              PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS

       A total of $81,899,000 is provided for Procurement, 
     Construction, and Improvements (PC&I). Included in the total 
     is $29,000,000 to address the facility backlog. Because 
     funding requested for financial systems modernization and 
     other programs could execute more slowly than anticipated, 
     ICE shall provide a briefing on an updated PC&I spending plan 
     not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this 
     Act. ICE is also directed to continue providing semiannual 
     briefings on TECS modernization efforts.
       The amount provided for this appropriation by PPA is as 
     follows:

                 Transportation Security Administration


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $7,207,851,000 is provided for Operations and 
     Support (O&S). This amount is partially offset by 
     $2,470,000,000 in estimated aviation security fee collections 
     that are credited to this appropriation, as authorized, 
     resulting in a net appropriation of $4,737,851,000. The bill 
     provides funding availability through September 30, 2019, for 
     O&S, consistent with the period of availability in prior 
     years. However, the Transportation Security Administration 
     (TSA) should plan for a single year of availability for O&S 
     funds in fiscal year 2019.
       TSA is directed to cease the practice of submitting budget 
     requests that assume revenues that have not been authorized 
     by law.

                     Aviation Screening Operations

       A total of $4,949,502,000 is provided for Aviation 
     Screening Operations.
       The total includes $77,000,000 above the request to 
     maintain existing TSA staffing at airport exit lanes, as 
     required by law. The total also includes $151,764,000, as 
     requested, for Canines. Combined with $8,200,000 in carryover 
     funding from fiscal year 2017, a total of $159,964,000 is 
     available for Canines in fiscal year 2018. TSA is expected to 
     use carryover funds to continue its efforts to establish a 
     third party canine certification program for air cargo 
     services.
       TSA is directed to brief the Committees within 90 days of 
     the date of enactment of this Act on a multi-year plan to 
     analyze and test perimeter intrusion detection and deterrence 
     technologies in partnership with airports. The plan should 
     include a sampling of airports and technologies to maximize 
     the applicability of testing results for airports of varying 
     sizes and risk profiles, with a particular focus on high-risk 
     airports that currently have limited capabilities. The 
     testing results should be made widely available to assist 
     airports in meeting their Airport Security Plan requirements. 
     Up to $10,000,000 is made available within the total for 
     Screening Technology Maintenance to begin implementing this 
     plan.

[[Page H2553]]

       With regard to remodeling and modernization efforts 
     undertaken by an airport on an existing exit lane that TSA 
     was responsible for monitoring on December 1, 2013, TSA shall 
     continue to be responsible for monitoring the exit lane after 
     the remodeling or modernization effort is completed.
       As TSA continues to evolve its screening procedures from a 
     one-size-fits all approach to an intelligence-driven, risk-
     based approach, it is expected to continue working with OIG 
     to address vulnerabilities in risk-based security 
     initiatives, including the PreCheck program.
       TSA shall provide a notification within 10 days of any 
     change to a private screening contract, including any new 
     award under the Screening Partnership Program or a transition 
     from privatized screening into federal screening.
       TSA is encouraged to continue exploring collateral officer 
     duties associated with behavioral detection and resolution 
     procedures.
       TSA's passenger screening canines play an important role in 
     the effective and efficient screening of passengers through 
     airport checkpoints. There is concern with the current 
     availability of explosives detection canine teams at airport 
     checkpoints and the unmet demand for additional canine teams 
     throughout the U.S. transportation system. While the TSA 
     canine training center at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland is 
     effective, it currently lacks the throughput needed to meet 
     the demand for trained and deployed canines. TSA shall submit 
     a report to the Committees, not later than 90 days after the 
     date of enactment of this Act, on its canine requirements and 
     a plan for expanding the program. The plan should propose 
     ways to increase the throughput of canines, including 
     passenger and cargo screening canines, at the Lackland 
     location. The plan shall also detail funding and facilities 
     requirements, new policies, and other resources necessary to 
     execute this expansion.
       To meet the increasing demand for explosives detection 
     canines, TSA is directed to examine the feasibility of 
     developing a dedicated breeding program. This assessment 
     should consider cost, the length of time required to start a 
     program, and a comparison between the quality of dogs that 
     might come from such a breeding program and the current 
     practice of acquiring dogs from international and domestic 
     vendors. TSA shall also collaborate with other components to 
     determine if any benefits could be derived from a department-
     wide breeding program. TSA shall brief the Committees on its 
     findings not later than 180 days after the date of enactment 
     of this Act.


                    Other Operations and Enforcement

       A total of $1,389,091,000 is provided for Other Operations 
     and Enforcement.
       Given current threats to the aviation sector, the total 
     includes $45,000,000 above the request to sustain the Law 
     Enforcement Officer Reimbursement Program. The total includes 
     $19,514,000 for the Federal Flight Deck Officer and Crew 
     Training Program. Combined with $4,367,000 in carryover 
     funding from fiscal year 2017, a total of $23,881,000 is 
     available for this program in fiscal year 2018. The total 
     also includes $43,000,000 above the request to maintain 31 
     Visible Intermodal Prevention Response teams.
       TSA is directed to continue efforts with its airport 
     partners to strengthen programs to counter insider threats, 
     such as more rigorous screening of employees prior to their 
     accessing secure areas. TSA shall provide a briefing not 
     later than 45 days after the date of enactment of this Act on 
     these efforts and whether additional resources could enhance 
     them. The briefing should specifically assess the feasibility 
     of integrating additional qualified screening technology into 
     the employee screening process.
       The funding level for the Federal Air Marshals Service 
     (FAMS) reflects TSA's inability to hire and backfill 
     positions at the rate projected in the request. TSA shall 
     continue to submit quarterly reports on FAMS mission 
     coverage, staffing levels, and hiring rates as directed in 
     prior years. FAMS is directed to brief the Committees not 
     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act on 
     efforts to better incorporate risk into its deployment 
     decisions, in accordance with the recommendations outlined in 
     GAO-16-582.
       TSA shall provide quarterly briefings on its air cargo 
     security investments, to include the metrics derived from 
     recent tests and the mitigation strategies employed in 
     response to covert test findings.

     Infrastructure. Within this amount is an increase of 
     $64,000,000 to accelerate the procurement and testing of 
     computed tomography equipment as a part of TSA's broader 
     effort to recapitalize the aging screening equipment fleet, 
     enhance detection capabilities and performance, and more 
     effectively counter emerging threats to aviation security. 
     Combined with $12,148,000 in carryover funding from fiscal 
     year 2017, a total of $76,148,000 is available for these 
     efforts in fiscal year 2018.
       The total also includes an increase of $50,000,000 for TSA 
     to begin to reimburse airports that incurred costs associated 
     with the development of a partial or completed in-line 
     baggage system prior to August 3, 2007. As directed in the 
     explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 114-113, TSA 
     has validated project cost information submitted by airports 
     to determine allowable and allocable expenses. TSA is 
     directed to brief the Committees on its timeline and 
     methodology for allocating the funds provided and next steps 
     not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this 
     Act. The brief shall include a plan for how TSA will address 
     the remaining balance of reimbursement claims in future 
     budget requests.
       TSA is directed to submit a detailed report on passenger 
     and baggage screening, consistent with the reporting 
     requirement in Public Law 114-113, not later than 90 days 
     after the date of enactment of this Act. The report shall 
     include a useful description of existing and emerging 
     technologies capable of detecting threats concealed on 
     passengers and in baggage, as well as projected funding 
     levels for the next five fiscal years for each technology 
     identified in the report.

                              Coast Guard


                           OPERATING EXPENSES

       A total of $7,373,313,000 is provided for Operating 
     Expenses, including a transfer of $24,500,000 from the Oil 
     Spill Liability Trust Fund. The total amount includes 
     $503,000,000 for Coast Guard defense related activities, of 
     which $163,000,000 is for overseas contingency operations 
     (OCO) and the global war on terrorism (GWOT) and may be 
     allocated without regard to section 503 in title V of this 
     Act. Within the amount provided, not less than $25,000 shall 
     be utilized for performance upgrades to the moribund Coast 
     Guard website.
       The Coast Guard has yet to complete a Manpower Requirements 
     Analysis (MRA), as directed by section 2904 of the Coast 
     Guard Authorization Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-120), to 
     determine the size of the force needed. The Coast Guard is 
     directed to complete the MRA not later than 120 days after 
     the date of enactment of this Act.
       Access to child care is critical to supporting Coast Guard 
     families, particularly those assigned to remote Coast Guard 
     stations. Of the amount recommended for Operating Expenses, 
     $1,000,000 is to increase the child care subsidy for Coast 
     Guard families residing in areas with high costs of living. 
     Within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
     Coast Guard shall brief the Committees on its plan to 
     implement the increased subsidy. In addition, the Coast Guard 
     is to conduct and report to the Committees the results of a 
     survey of its personnel regarding the cost and availability 
     of child care, as well as the effect of access to child care 
     on retention.
       The Coast Guard is urged to expand its participation in 
     Partnership in Education programs to museums and schools with 
     a focus on limnology and oceanographic programs that support 
     science, technology, engineering, and math education.
       Funding is provided to meet the air facility operation 
     obligations laid out in section 208 of the Coast Guard 
     Authorization Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-120).
       The Coast Guard is directed to provide a business case 
     analysis to the Committees, within 60 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, for adopting the approach employed by 
     the Department of Veterans Affairs to acquire the next-
     generation Electronic Health Records system.
       In fiscal year 2017, $6,000,000 was provided for the 
     Fishing Safety Training Grants and Fishing Safety Research 
     Grants programs, as authorized by section 309 of the Coast 
     Guard Reauthorization Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-

[[Page H2554]]

     281). The Coast Guard is directed to brief the Committees on 
     the programs not later than 60 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act and to request funding for the programs 
     in future budget requests. The Coast Guard should continue to 
     collaborate with the National Institute of Occupational 
     Safety and Health on fishing safety research, and shall 
     submit the report required by Senate Report 114-264 without 
     delay. That report shall include a notice of funding 
     availability, a schedule for grant awards, and metrics to 
     measure impact and effectiveness.
       Based on recent reporting pursuant to Public Law 94-254, 
     the Coast Guard is experiencing an increase in costs that 
     will result in diminished resources for other statutory 
     missions. The Coast Guard shall appropriately account for 
     these needs in future budget requests.
       The Coast Guard is directed to appropriately budget to 
     support the Arctic Program Office in order to adequately 
     address the challenges inherent to the growing mission in 
     that region.
       The Coast Guard is not procuring enough small boats 
     annually to meet its acquisition objective. Not later than 30 
     days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Coast Guard 
     shall provide a report detailing small boat purchases, 
     leases, repairs, and service life replacements planned for 
     fiscal year 2018.
       Minor construction projects funded from the Operating 
     Expenses appropriation can be combined with depot level 
     maintenance projects for the sake of administrative and 
     economic efficiency. The Coast Guard is directed to provide a 
     report to the Committees not later than 45 days after the 
     date of enactment of this Act detailing such projects along 
     with any fiscal year 2018 sustainment, repair, replacement, 
     or maintenance projects that will cost more than $2,000,000. 
     This report shall be updated and included in future 
     congressional budget justification materials.
       The Coast Guard is urged to expedite planning for facility 
     and equipment upgrades necessary for service life extensions 
     of Fast Response Cutters (FRC) and other vessels at the Coast 
     Guard Yard at Curtis Bay in Baltimore, Maryland. The nearest 
     travel lift of sufficient size and capacity to service the 
     FRC is in Hampton Roads, Virginia. Transporting the travel 
     lift between Hampton Roads and Baltimore is a costly and time 
     consuming procedure that removes the lift from service during 
     transport. The Coast Guard is to develop a plan for acquiring 
     necessary equipment and making physical modifications to 
     wharves or other parts of the Coast Guard Yard facility to 
     accommodate FRCs and other vessels there and is to request 
     sufficient resources for these improvements.
       The Coast Guard shall notify the Committees prior to making 
     any changes to the type or number of its command and control 
     aircraft, or making changes to the flight hours of such 
     aircraft.
       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this 
     Act, the Coast Guard shall provide a report to the Committees 
     detailing the feasibility, costs, and benefits of 
     transitioning to the use of bromine-free systems aboard 
     National Security Cutters (NSC), FRCs, or Offshore Patrol 
     Cutters (OPC).
       In establishing homeports for new vessels in the northeast 
     United States, the Coast Guard is directed to partner with 
     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the 
     Navy, as appropriate, to leverage existing assets and new 
     investments at Naval Station Newport.

                                Vessels

       To the maximum extent practicable, the Coast Guard is 
     directed to utilize components that are manufactured in the 
     United States when contracting for new vessels. Such 
     components include: auxiliary equipment, such as pumps for 
     shipboard services; propulsion equipment including engines, 
     reduction gears, and propellers; shipboard cranes; and 
     spreaders for shipboard cranes.
       The Coast Guard shall be exempted from the administration's 
     current acquisition policy that requires the Coast Guard to 
     attain the total acquisition cost for a vessel, including 
     long lead time materials (LLTM), production costs, and 
     postproduction costs, before a production contract can be 
     awarded.
       Survey and Design--Vessels and Boats. The total includes 
     $4,500,000 to support survey and design. To enhance 
     icebreaking capacity on the Great Lakes, $3,000,000 is 
     included for survey and design work to support the 
     acquisition of an icebreaker that is at least as capable as 
     the USCGC MACKINAW (WLBB-30).
       National Security Cutter. The total includes $1,241,000,000 
     for the NSC program. This amount includes $540,000,000 for 
     the construction of a tenth NSC, $95,000,000 to be made 
     immediately available to contract for LLTM for an eleventh 
     NSC, and $540,000,000 for the construction of the eleventh 
     NSC. Crewing concepts initiated by the Coast Guard that 
     underpinned the assumption that 12 High Endurance Cutters 
     could be replaced with 8 NSCs have proven unworkable.
       Offshore Patrol Cutter. The recommendation includes 
     $500,000,000 for the OPC, consistent with the budget request. 
     These funds will provide for production of OPC1, LLTM for 
     OPC2, program activities, test and evaluation, government 
     furnished equipment, and training aids.
       Fast Response Cutter. The Coast Guard program of record 
     calls for 58 FRCs, of which 44 have been ordered and 26 have 
     been delivered and are in service today. The recommendation 
     provides $340,000,000 for six FRCs, four of which are for the 
     current program of record and two of which are to initiate 
     replacement of the 110-foot Island Class Cutters supporting 
     U.S. Central Command in Southwest Asia.
       Polar Ice Breaking Vessel. The recommendation includes 
     $19,000,000, consistent with the budget request, to maintain 
     the accelerated acquisition schedule established in fiscal 
     year 2017 for a new class of Polar Icebreakers. These funds 
     will be used to request proposals and award contracts for 
     detailed design and options for future vessel construction.
       The Coast Guard is directed to initiate a service life 
     extension project to rehabilitate and restore the critical 
     systems onboard the heavy icebreaker POLAR STAR. Increased 
     efforts shall be made during maintenance availability periods 
     to rehabilitate major systems and accelerate contracting for 
     this work to the greatest extent possible. In carrying out 
     such efforts, the Coast Guard is encouraged to address the 
     rehabilitation and replacement of old and obsolete systems 
     that are in poor material condition and may impair crew 
     readiness or safety.
       Inland Waterways and Western Rivers Cutters. The Coast 
     Guard's fleet of inland river tenders range in size from 65 
     to 160 feet and were commissioned between 1944 and 1990. This 
     fleet, which has an average age of 52 years, helps ensure the 
     integrity of the structures, beacons, and buoys that support 
     the vital U.S. Marine Transportation System. In addition to 
     age concerns and equipment obsolescence issues, the fleet 
     presents other challenges, including the presence of asbestos 
     and lead paint, which raise concerns about crew health. The 
     recommendation provides $25,000,000 above the request to 
     accelerate the acquisition of a new Waterways Commerce 
     Cutter.


                                Aircraft

       HC-130J Conversion/Sustainment. The total includes 
     $100,600,000 for the HC-130J aircraft program. This amount is 
     $95,000,000 above the request for the procurement of one HC-
     130J aircraft.
       MH-60T Conversion/Sustainment. The bill supports efforts to 
     recapitalize MH-60T aircraft. The Coast Guard is directed to 
     brief the Committees, not later than 90 days after the date 
     of enactment of this Act, on options for extending the 
     lifespan of its MH-60T aircraft, including associated costs 
     and timelines for each option.
       HC-27J Conversion/Sustainment. The total includes 
     $18,000,000 above the request for the procurement of an HC-
     27J training simulator to be located at the Coast Guard 
     Aviation Training Center.


                            Shore Facilities

       The total includes $134,500,000 for Shore Facilities and 
     Aids to Navigation. The Commandant is directed to provide to 
     the Committees, at the time of each budget submission, a list 
     of approved but unfunded Coast Guard priorities and the funds 
     needed for each.
       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this 
     Act, the Coast Guard shall submit to the Committees a report 
     on a plan to provide communications throughout the entire 
     Coastal Western Alaska Captain of the Port zone to improve 
     waterway safety and to mitigate close calls, collisions, and 
     other dangerous interactions between large ships and 
     subsistence hunter vessels. The report should also include: 
     any shore infrastructure improvements necessary to fulfill 
     such a plan; an explanation of the feasibility of 
     establishing a vessel traffic service that covers the region 
     using existing resources or public-private partnerships; and 
     a timeline of when funding is needed to implement these 
     improvements.
       The Coast Guard has considered establishing anchorages in 
     the Hudson River and has completed an Advanced Notice of 
     Proposed Rulemaking. After receiving comments, the Coast 
     Guard is conducting a full Ports and Waterways Safety 
     Assessment to best determine whether and how to proceed. 
     Prior to any proposal to establish these anchorages, the 
     Coast Guard shall brief the Committees on the results of the 
     assessment and its plans regarding the anchorages.
       Major Construction; Housing; ATON; and Survey & Design. The 
     total includes $32,400,000 above the request to address the 
     top housing priority on the Coast Guard's Unfunded Priority 
     List.
       Major Acquisition System Infrastructure. The total includes 
     $8,000,000 for infrastructure associated with the procurement 
     of an HC-27J training simulator and $19,100,000 to address 
     the top Major Acquisition System Infrastructure priorities on 
     the Coast Guard's Unfunded Priority List.


              RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST, AND EVALUATION

       A total of $29,141,000 is provided for Research, 
     Development, Test, and Evaluation.
       Disruptions to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals can 
     cause severe problems for ship navigation, port security, and 
     situational awareness. In recent years, incidents of GPS 
     tampering have disrupted the flow of commerce within ports by 
     blocking the signals needed for crane operators to locate and 
     move goods. When these signals are blocked, the delays 
     associated with the manual location of containers can all but 
     shut down port operations. Therefore, $500,000 is provided 
     for the Coast Guard to conduct digital forensics research and 
     testing on devices meant to jam or otherwise interfere with 
     GPS signals.
       The Coast Guard continues to face challenges with respect 
     to conducting maritime surveillance necessary to support its 
     statutory missions related to marine safety, security, and 
     protection in the Pacific Ocean. To address this concern, up 
     to $5,000,000 is made available within the total amount to 
     conduct a full maritime domain awareness pilot study and 
     assessment to determine the efficacy of using low-cost, 
     commercially available technology solutions, in combination 
     with or on existing fleet platforms, to enhance maritime 
     domain awareness. This effort should test technology 
     solutions across the fleet, including with the Coast Guard 
     Auxiliary if applicable. The Coast Guard is encouraged to 
     consider systems that have been used by small, remote Pacific 
     Island states and other technologies with little or no 
     logistics funding tail. The Coast Guard shall brief the 
     Committees not later than 60 days after the date of enactment 
     of this Act on its approach to carrying out this study. The 
     briefing shall include a timeline for the development of a 
     concept of operations and business case analysis, as well as 
     a plan for industry engagement and technology demonstration.
       As the Coast Guard's only functional heavy icebreaker, the 
     POLAR STAR, reaches the end of its service life, a potential 
     gap may emerge with respect to the Coast Guard's polar 
     icebreaker capability before new heavy icebreaking vessels 
     can be acquired. To help address that potential gap, up to 
     $5,000,000 is made available within the total to examine 
     whether the Coast Guard's statutory requirements could be met 
     by existing vessels using short-term procurement strategies.
       In fiscal year 2017, Congress provided $18,000,000 for the 
     Coast Guard to test and evaluate the use of long range/ultra-
     long endurance UAS in support of the Department's needs, 
     particularly intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance 
     in source and transit zones. The Coast Guard is directed to 
     fulfill the related briefing requirement in the explanatory 
     statement accompanying Public Law 115-31 and directs the 
     Coast Guard to allocate such fiscal year 2018 sums as may be 
     necessary to continue this long range/ultra-long endurance 
     UAS effort.

     capability of NCPS to detect potentially malicious activity 
     entering or exiting computer systems on the ``.gov'' network. 
     The total includes $3,000,000 for pilot programs to help 
     address the GAO report's related recommendation and to comply 
     with the mandate in the Cybersecurity Act of 2015

[[Page H2558]]

     to conduct regular assessments of advanced protective 
     technologies through pilots. The pilots should be conducted 
     in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and 
     Technology and other appropriate entities.
       Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this 
     Act, NPPD and FEMA shall brief the Committees on the types of 
     grant assistance, technical assistance, and formal ongoing 
     engagement available to SLTT government entities, including 
     law enforcement agencies, for the purpose of protecting their 
     cyber networks. Within 240 days of the date of enactment of 
     this Act, NPPD shall provide an assessment to the Committees 
     of the overall effectiveness of this assistance and outreach 
     in improving cybersecurity capacity and performance at non-
     federal levels of government. The Department may provide 
     technical assistance and support to SLTT entities related to 
     the purchase of commercial software capable of protecting the 
     integrity of government information and networks against 
     intrusions.
       The fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act 
     (Public Law 114-328) required DHS to provide Congress with a 
     departmental cybersecurity strategy. In light of recent cyber 
     events, DHS is expected to accelerate the completion of this 
     strategy and to continue to engage with relevant public and 
     private stakeholders to help prevent and mitigate future 
     cyber intrusions.


                       Infrastructure Protection

       A total of $194,216,000 is provided for Infrastructure 
     Protection.
       Infrastructure Capacity Building. The total includes 
     $16,199,000 for the Office of Bombing Prevention (OBP). This 
     funding will sustain needed training, information sharing, 
     and awareness programs for SLTT and private sector entities 
     related to trends in terrorist utilization of explosives. The 
     funding will also provide for analysis of current counter-
     explosives capabilities and identification of capability 
     gaps. NPPD should explore how coordination with the National 
     Guard on training could be further enhanced.

       NPPD is directed to include in the next Biennial Report to 
     Congress on Emergency Communications the status of 
     interoperability planning for public safety communications 
     systems. Because achieving interoperability among these 
     systems is challenged by separate planning efforts for 
     different kinds of systems (such as alert and warning, next 
     generation 911, and broadband), the report should 
     specifically identify what gaps exist among such systems. 
     Furthermore, NPPD is directed to share information with FEMA 
     on critical interoperable communications gaps in order to 
     better inform grant award decision making.


                         Integrated Operations

     appropriate identity information between DHS and other 
     departments and agencies, including through the 
     implementation of Unique Identity and the information systems 
     discussed below. The information sharing briefs should 
     specifically address capability gaps and strategies to close 
     them.
       As development of the Homeland Advanced Recognition 
     Technology (HART) system continues, OBIM is expected to 
     closely coordinate with TSA, CBP, the Department of Defense 
     (DOD), the Department of Justice, the Department of State, 
     the intelligence community, and other relevant agencies to 
     standardize and appropriately share biometric information. In 
     particular, OBIM shall continue to work with DOD to implement 
     interim solutions to expand interagency biometric data-
     sharing and ingest legally shareable data from DOD's 
     Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) into IDENT/
     HART for appropriate use by components. Additionally, as 
     directed in prior Committee reports, OBIM shall continue to 
     coordinate with TSA to ensure that TSA's Technology 
     Infrastructure Modernization systems are appropriately 
     integrated with HART.
       OBIM shall incorporate the latest proven biometric 
     technologies, including advanced facial recognition, in its 
     ongoing enhancements to the IDENT/HART system and ensure the 
     needs of stakeholders are addressed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

       On October 6, 2017, the Department notified the Committees 
     that it intended to use its authority under section 872 of 
     the Homeland Security Act to consolidate the Domestic Nuclear 
     Detection Office (DNDO), the Office of Health Affairs (OHA), 
     and a number of activities and personnel from other 
     components into a new Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction 
     (CWMD) Office, effective December 5, 2017. Because of the 
     challenges associated with transitioning to new Treasury 
     accounts in the middle of a fiscal year, however, DHS did not 
     propose the transfer of OHA and DNDO funding into new CWMD 
     Office accounts. As a consequence, OHA and DNDO will continue 
     to operate and be funded as separate components during fiscal 
     year 2018.
       An administrative provision is included in title V of this 
     Act to permit DHS to begin executing funds through new CWMD 
     appropriations accounts beginning on October 1, 2018, but 
     only subsequent to the enactment of legislation explicitly 
     authorizing the establishment of such an Office.
       In January 2018, the Assistant Secretary for CWMD briefed 
     the Committees on a procurement action made to resource a 
     pilot program in support of state and local law enforcement 
     and first responders. However, neither OHA nor DNDO requested 
     funding in any budget for this activity, nor had the offices 
     developed any goals, objectives, or criteria for success 
     prior to embarking on this new pilot. In the future, the 
     Department is expected to follow the acquisition management 
     process, as defined in DHS Management Directive 102-01, and 
     to include such programs in its budget justification 
     materials to Congress. While emerging requirements may 
     necessitate agencies to shift funds in the year of execution, 
     all components of DHS must adhere to section 503 
     reprogramming and transfer conditions. If a new requirement 
     is addressed through a reprogramming that falls below the 
     section 503 notification threshold, all components must still 
     adhere to program management principals and an acquisition 
     management process that yields transparency and efficiency.
       Language is included in this explanatory statement under 
     FEMA--Federal Assistance directing the submission of a report 
     on the types of assistance across DHS components available to 
     SLTT governments.


                   Chemical and Biological Readiness

       The total includes $79,130,000 for the Chemical and 
     Biological Readiness PPA. This amount includes: $1,250,000 to 
     continue investments in biodetection technology enhancements; 
     $800,000 to continue the development of a comprehensive 
     exercise, workshop, and technical assistance program for 
     food, agriculture, and veterinary preparedness; and $500,000 
     to continue implementing the voluntary anthrax vaccine 
     program for emergency responders.


                         Integrated Operations

       The total includes $9,400,000 for Integrated Operations. 
     This amount includes an increase above the request of 
     $8,000,000 to continue support for the National 
     Biosurveillance Integration Center, as authorized by Public 
     Law 110-53. Not later than 90 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, the Department shall submit a five-
     year strategic plan that outlines NBIC's proposed 
     capabilities, objectives, a roadmap to achieving those 
     objectives, and performance metrics by which to measure 
     success. NBIC is encouraged to continue its engagement in 
     support of a visualization tool that incorporates data from 
     state and local entities that can serve as a bio-preparedness 
     tool for emergency response, emergency management, and law 
     enforcement at all levels of government.

                                 Grants

       The total includes $3,018,731,000 for Grants. FEMA grantees 
     shall continue to provide reports on their use of funds, as 
     determined necessary by the Secretary.
       Within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
     FEMA is directed to consult with SLTT stakeholders regarding 
     the factors and data included in the current risk formula, 
     methods for including known evolving threats, and specific 
     processes for adjudicating formula concerns expressed by 
     applicants. Such concerns include, but are not limited to: 
     proximity to non-contiguous high-risk states and territories; 
     occurrences of soft targets; sinkhole subsidence before 
     infrastructure damage; potential impacts caused by 
     electromagnetic pulses; ballistic missile threats; amounts of 
     critical infrastructure; and command and control 
     capabilities. FEMA shall brief the Committees on the results 
     of this outreach.
       FEMA, in cooperation with NPPD, DNDO, OHA, I&A, and other 
     components as appropriate, is directed to provide a report, 
     not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this 
     Act, detailing the types of grant funding, technical 
     assistance, resources, program support, and any other types 
     of assistance that are currently available to SLTT 
     governments. The report shall include the purpose of each 
     type of assistance, a list of all agencies or components that 
     serve as subject matter experts in awarding assistance, and 
     what capability gap the assistance is trying to fill. Not 
     later than 30 days after the report is delivered to the 
     Committees, FEMA in conjunction with NPPD, DNDO, OHA, I&A, 
     and other components as appropriate, shall brief the 
     Committees on how assistance is coordinated among the 
     components, how it applies to national-level capability gaps, 
     and future plans for strategic coordination of assistance. In 
     determining strategic coordination, FEMA and the components 
     should seek assistance from stakeholders, such as the 
     National Homeland Security Consortium, which represents 
     multiple disciplines, and the International City/County 
     Management Association, which has subject matter expertise in 
     performance metrics for government programs.
       FEMA and NPPD are directed to brief the Committees, not 
     later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
     on the potential benefits and costs of establishing a joint 
     program office.
       FEMA is directed to submit a report to the Committees, not 
     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act,

     $630,000,000 for the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), 
     of which $50,000,000 is for nonprofit organizations. 
     Consistent with the 9/11 Act, FEMA shall conduct risk 
     assessments for the 100 most populous metropolitan 
     statistical areas prior to making UASI grant awards. It is 
     expected that UASI funding will be limited to urban areas 
     representing up to 85 percent of the cumulative national 
     terrorism risk to urban areas and that resources will 
     continue to be allocated in proportion to risk.
       National Predisaster Mitigation Fund. The total includes 
     $249,200,000 for Predisaster Mitigation. Predisaster 
     Mitigation prevents loss of life and leads to significant 
     savings by mitigating risks, reducing damage from future 
     disasters, and lowering flood insurance premiums. This 
     funding level is an opportunity to advance capital projects 
     ready for investment that will reduce risks.
       Flood Hazard Mapping and Risk Analysis Program. The total 
     includes $262,531,000 for the Flood Hazard Mapping and Risk 
     Analysis Program. This funding level will allow FEMA to

     (EFSP). Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment 
     of this Act, FEMA shall submit to the Committees a plan to 
     ensure EFSP aligns with overarching federal strategies to 
     meet the needs of hungry and homeless people. In order to 
     provide the Committees and the public with the data necessary 
     to ensure financial responsibility, the plan shall outline 
     the oversight procedures and metrics used to ensure effective 
     implementation.


                   Education, Training, and Exercises

       The total includes $275,201,000 for Education, Training, 
     and Exercises. This amount includes $8,000,000 for Continuing 
     Training Grants, of which $3,000,000 is for rural first 
     responder training. The total also includes $42,900,000 for 
     the United States Fire Administration and full funding for 
     the State Fire Training Grants program.
       FEMA is encouraged to continue to work with institutions 
     offering graduate level programs to address cybersecurity 
     needs of rural communities and their intersection.


                          DISASTER RELIEF FUND

       A total of $7,900,720,000 is provided for the Disaster 
     Relief Fund (DRF), of which $7,366,000,000 is designated as 
     being for disaster relief for major disasters pursuant to 
     section 251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
     Deficit Control Act of 1985.
       FEMA shall brief the Committees on recommendations for 
     modifying the disaster declaration process to better focus 
     federal assistance on events during which SLTT capabilities 
     are truly overwhelmed or lives and property are at risk. The 
     briefing shall include an assessment of the suitability of 
     the per capita indicator, consideration of severe local 
     impacts of disasters, FEMA's ongoing analysis of the disaster 
     deductible model, and any other policy changes FEMA is 
     considering.
       Disaster mitigation structures such as seawalls are deemed 
     public infrastructure if they are owned by a SLTT government, 
     unless clear ownership by a SLTT government cannot be 
     established. FEMA is encouraged to consider making Public 
     Assistance and Individual Assistance grant funding available 
     for repairs to disaster mitigation structures to the fullest 
     extent allowed by the Stafford Act.


                     NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE FUND

       A total of $203,500,000 is provided for the National Flood 
     Insurance Fund.
       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this 
     Act, FEMA shall brief the Committees on efforts underway to 
     implement the Consumer Option for an Alternative System to 
     Allocate Losses Act (Public Law 112-141), related to flood 
     insurance reform and modernization, and shall detail all 
     ongoing collaboration with the National Oceanic and 
     Atmospheric Administration.
       FEMA is encouraged to consider how to better leverage 
     partnerships with public-private, higher education, not-for-
     profit, and other institutions with expertise in the 
     Community Rating System program through competitive grant 
     programs or other incentives.
       FEMA is encouraged to maximize public awareness and 
     interaction when mapping or remapping an area to ensure maps 
     most accurately reflect real-time, local conditions.
       FEMA is urged to implement the recommendations of the 
     Technical Mapping Assistance Council's 2015 and 2016 Annual 
     Reports, which recommended transitioning to structure-
     specific flood risk analysis, incorporating high-resolution 
     topographic data into flood risk maps, and better 
     communicating current and future flood risk to property 
     owners. FEMA should coordinate with state agencies and other 
     experts that have developed mapping expertise and models that 
     can be useful in FEMA's efforts to understand future 
     conditions.

     total also fully funds National Bio and Agro-defense Facility 
     (NBAF) operations, in accordance with the Department's life 
     cycle cost estimate.
       DHS retains responsibility for completing construction of 
     NBAF. DHS is directed to maintain the ability to readily 
     execute the Management, Operations, and Research Support 
     contract through the end of fiscal year 2018 if DHS or USDA 
     determine that its utilization would expedite or enhance 
     NBAF's ability to be fully operational by December 31, 2022.
       The fiscal year 2019 budget request proposes the continued 
     funding of NBACC operations and includes a change in the 
     business funding model to maintain and operate the 
     laboratory, under which S&T and the Federal Bureau of 
     Investigation would share budgetary responsibility of NBACC's 
     National Bioforensic Analysis Center (NBFAC). This cost-
     sharing arrangement would result in a more efficient 
     operational model and ensure this national capability remains 
     available to help defend the United States against 
     bioterrorism threats. Further details on the long-term 
     strategy for NBACC, including NBFAC, should be included in 
     the report required by Public Law 115-91.


                  Acquisition and Operations Analysis

       The total includes $46,245,000 for Acquisition and 
     Operations Analysis. This amount includes $3,000,000 for the 
     Office of Standards; $3,773,000 for Joint Requirements 
     Council (JRC) Support; $2,396,000 for Operational Test and 
     Evaluation; and $5,364,000 for Systems Engineering and 
     Research.
       S&T is encouraged to continue to make its department-wide 
     perspective and technical expertise available to the JRC and 
     USM to support efforts to determine component capability 
     gaps, the maturity of technologies that could fill such gaps, 
     and the feasibility of cross-component solutions.
       S&T is encouraged to explore a systems engineering research 
     partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that could 
     streamline acquisition through modeling and simulation.


                            Mission Support

       The total includes $134,752,000 for Mission Support. This 
     amount includes realignments from other S&T PPAs for the 
     Compliance Assurance Program Office, which provides support 
     and oversight to ensure DHS-funded activities are compliant 
     with relevant international agreements, federal regulations, 
     DHS policies, and related standards and guidance.


                        RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

       A total of $509,830,000 is provided for Research and 
     Development (R&D). S&T is directed to continue to prioritize 
     applied research activities that provide innovative solutions 
     to DHS, its components, and their primary stakeholders. To 
     promote unity of effort and cross-component commonality, S&T 
     should remain the central component for DHS research, 
     including research for other components. The Secretary is 
     directed to notify the Committees not less than 60 days in 
     advance of any reduction, discontinuation, or transfer of any 
     R&D activity currently being performed by S&T.

       S&T is directed to brief the Committees not later than 60 
     days after the date of enactment of this Act on the proposed 
     allocation of RD&I funds. The briefing shall address the 
     planned use of funding provided above the request, including 
     plans related to S&T laboratories and for new or continued 
     collaboration with other relevant federal partners, academia, 
     and the private sector.
       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this 
     Act, S&T shall submit a plan for establishing the pilot 
     program for foreign animal disease research directed above.
       S&T is encouraged to leverage cyber-event gaming tools that 
     have proven successful for the financial sector in improving 
     cybersecurity among key operators and decision makers.
       Funding for Opioids/Fentanyl is made available by providing 
     the amount requested for Real-time BioThreat Awareness.
       It is expected that the technologies developed in 
     collaboration with DOE on Cybersecurity of Energy Delivery 
     Systems will ultimately be transitioned to industry for 
     commercialization and deployment of more resilient electric 
     grid components and systems. S&T is encouraged to utilize 
     large scale electric power transmission test facilities and 
     to actively collaborate with operational utility providers.
       In carrying out Modeling and Simulation Apex Engine and 
     Explosive Threat Assessment research activities, S&T is 
     encouraged to collaborate with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
     laboratories and to utilize high performance computing.
       To the greatest extent practicable, funds for Enabling UAS 
     Technologies should be used to harness the resources and 
     expertise at the S&T Small UAS demonstration site, the 
     Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) UAS Center of 
     Excellence, and the FAA UAS test sites.
       S&T is encouraged to coordinate its Biofutures activities 
     with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 
     Emerging Toxins Program.
       S&T is directed to prioritize collaborations with qualified 
     research universities in support of developing new approaches 
     on critical border security research topics to enhance the 
     security of the U.S. land and maritime borders.
       S&T, in collaboration with NPPD and FEMA, is directed to 
     test and evaluate technologies that utilize high bandwidth, 
     portable, high frequency radio, antennas, and communication 
     systems within a small footprint to provide reliable and 
     interoperable communications capabilities for critical 
     facilities and infrastructure during emergencies. S&T shall 
     report its findings to the Committees not later than 120 days 
     after the date of enactment of this Act.
       S&T is directed to place an increased focus on technology 
     transfer, which can lower the cost of new security-related 
     technology development and ensure that investments in

[[Page H2563]]

     research and development benefit the economy and the 
     manufacturing base. Expanding the availability of highly-
     qualified manufacturers can save money for the taxpayer and 
     the Department and more quickly deliver solutions and 
     equipment to end users.
       Funding is provided for S&T to engage a Partnership 
     Intermediary or Intermediaries, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 3715, 
     to support the Department's ability to seek out, assess, and 
     engage non-traditional small business vendors as part of the 
     Department's development and acquisition efforts. 
     Intermediaries should have a successful history of leveraging 
     external networks and using innovative means to identify and 
     recruit small businesses and manufacturers to partner with 
     the Department on innovative solutions and technologies. This 
     effort should include, but should not be limited to, 
     providing technology assessments and design reviews for the 
     Department's development efforts. The Office of the Chief 
     Procurement Officer is directed to issue policy guidance 
     allowing contracting officers to obligate funding for such 
     partnerships.


                          University Programs

       A total of $40,500,000 is provided for University Programs. 
     Due to funding constraints, the fiscal year 2018 budget 
     proposed to eliminate one Center of Excellence (COE) and to 
     not re-compete two other COEs. The total provided for 
     University Programs enables S&T to fund 10 COEs and continue 
     its current COE program. S&T shall notify the Committees 
     prior to eliminating any COEs. S&T is encouraged to 
     prioritize collaborations with qualified research 
     universities to support critical research topics in priority 
     areas, including maritime security, cross-border threat 
     screening, unmanned systems, counterterrorism, emerging 
     analytics, cybersecurity, first responder safety, and 
     critical infrastructure.

                   Domestic Nuclear Detection Office


                         OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT

       A total of $54,664,000 is provided for Operations and 
     Support.
       On October 6, 2017, the Department notified the Committees 
     that it intended to use its authority under section 872 of 
     the Homeland Security Act to consolidate DNDO, OHA, and a 
     number of activities and personnel from other components into 
     a new CWMD Office, effective December 5, 2017. Because of the 
     challenges associated with transitioning to new Treasury 
     accounts in the middle of a fiscal year, however, DHS did not 
     propose the transfer of OHA and DNDO funding into new CWMD 
     Office accounts. As a consequence, OHA and DNDO will continue 
     to operate and be funded as separate components during fiscal 
     year 2018.
       An administrative provision is included in title V of this 
     Act to permit DHS to begin executing funds through new CWMD 
     appropriations accounts beginning on October 1, 2018, but 
     only subsequent to the enactment of legislation explicitly 
     authorizing the establishment of such an Office.
       Language is included in this explanatory statement under 
     OHA--Operations and Support directing OHA and DNDO to adhere 
     to the DHS acquisition management process.
       Language is included in this explanatory statement under 
     FEMA--Federal Assistance directing the submission of a report 
     on the types of assistance across DHS components available to 
     SLTT governments.

                      TITLE V--GENERAL PROVISIONS


             (including rescissions and transfer of funds)

       Section 501. The bill continues a provision directing that 
     no part of any appropriation shall remain available for 
     obligation beyond the current year unless expressly provided.
       Section 502. The bill continues a provision providing 
     authority to merge unexpended balances of prior 
     appropriations with new appropriation accounts, to be used 
     for the same purpose, subject to reprogramming guidelines.
       Section 503. The bill continues a provision limiting 
     reprogramming authority for funds within an appropriation and 
     providing limited authority for transfers between 
     appropriations. All components funded by the Department of 
     Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018, must comply with 
     these transfer and reprogramming requirements.
       The Department must notify the Committees on Appropriations 
     prior to each reprogramming of funds that would reduce 
     programs, projects, activities, or personnel by ten percent 
     or more. Notifications are also required for each 
     reprogramming of funds that would increase a program, 
     project, or activity by more than $5,000,000 or ten percent, 
     whichever is less. The Department must submit these 
     notifications to the Committees on Appropriations at least 15 
     days in advance of any such reprogramming.
       For purposes of reprogramming notifications, ``program, 
     project, or activity'' is defined as an amount identified in 
     the detailed funding table located at the end of this 
     statement or an amount directed for a specific purpose in 
     this statement. Also for purposes of reprogramming 
     notifications, the creation of a new program, project, or 
     activity is defined as any significant new activity that has 
     not been explicitly justified to the

[[Page H2564]]

     Congress in budget justification material and for which funds 
     have not been appropriated by the Congress. For further 
     guidance when determining which movements of funds are 
     subject to section 503, the Department is reminded to follow 
     GAO's definition of ``program, project, or activity'' as 
     detailed in the GAO's A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal 
     Budget Process. Within 30 days of the date of enactment of 
     this Act, the Department shall submit to the Committees a 
     table delineating PPAs subject to section 503 notification 
     requirements, as defined in this paragraph.
       Limited transfer authority is provided to give the 
     Department flexibility in responding to emerging requirements 
     and significant changes in circumstances, but is not 
     primarily intended to facilitate the implementation of new 
     programs, projects, or activities that were not proposed in a 
     formal budget submission. Transfers may not reduce accounts 
     by more than five percent or increase accounts by more than 
     ten percent. The Committees on Appropriations must be 
     notified 30 days in advance of any transfer.
       To avoid violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act, the 
     Secretary shall ensure that any transfer of funds is carried 
     out in compliance with the limitations and requirements of 
     section 503(b). In particular, the Secretary should ensure 
     that any such transfers adhere to the opinion of the 
     Comptroller General's decision in the Matter of: John D. 
     Webster, Director, Financial Services, Library of Congress, 
     dated November 7, 1997, with regard to the definition of an 
     appropriation subject to transfer limitations.
       The Department shall submit notifications on a timely basis 
     and provide complete explanations of the proposed 
     reallocations, including detailed justifications for the 
     increases and offsets, and any specific impact the proposed 
     changes would have on the budget request for the following 
     fiscal year and future-year appropriations requirements. Each 
     notification submitted to the Committees should include a 
     detailed table showing the proposed revisions to funding and 
     FTE--at the account, program, project, and activity level--
     for the current fiscal year, along with any funding and FTE 
     impacts on the budget year.
       The Department shall manage its programs, projects, and 
     activities within the levels appropriated, and should only 
     submit reprogramming or transfer notifications in cases of 
     unforeseeable and compelling circumstances that could not 
     have been predicted when formulating the budget request for 
     the current fiscal year. When the Department submits a 
     reprogramming or transfer notification and does not receive 
     identical responses from the House and Senate Committees, it 
     is expected to reconcile the differences before proceeding.
       The Department is not to submit a reprogramming or transfer 
     notification after June 30 except in extraordinary 
     circumstances that imminently threaten the safety of human 
     life or the protection of property. If an above-threshold 
     reprogramming or a transfer is needed after June 30, the 
     notification should contain sufficient documentation as to 
     why it meets this statutory exception.
       Deobligated funds are also subject to the reprogramming and 
     transfer limitations and requirements set forth in section 
     503.
       Section 503(f) authorizes the Secretary to transfer up to 
     $20,000,000 to address immigration emergencies after 
     notifying the Committees of such transfer at least five days 
     in advance.
       Section 504. The bill continues a provision by reference, 
     prohibiting funds appropriated or otherwise made available to 
     the Department to make payment to the Working Capital Fund 
     (WCF), except for activities and amounts allowed in the 
     President's fiscal year 2018 budget request. Funds provided 
     to the WCF are available until expended. The Department can 
     only charge components for direct usage of the WCF and these 
     funds may be used only for the purposes consistent with the 
     contributing component. Any funds paid in advance or for 
     reimbursement must reflect the full cost of each service. The 
     Department shall submit a notification prior to adding a new 
     activity to the fund or eliminating an existing activity from 
     the fund. For activities added to the fund, such 
     notifications shall detail the source of funds by PPA. In 
     addition, the Department shall submit quarterly WCF execution 
     reports to the Committees that include activity level detail.
       Section 505. The bill continues a provision providing that 
     not to exceed 50 percent of unobligated balances from prior-
     year appropriations for each Operations and Support 
     appropriation, the Coast Guard's Operating Expenses 
     appropriation, and amounts for salaries and expenses in the 
     Coast Guard's Reserve Training and Acquisition, Construction, 
     and Improvements accounts, shall remain available through 
     fiscal year 2018, subject to section 503 reprogramming 
     requirements.
       Section 506. The bill continues a provision that deems 
     intelligence activities to be specifically authorized during 
     fiscal year 2018 until the enactment of an Act authorizing 
     intelligence activities for fiscal year 2018.
       Section 507. The bill continues a provision requiring 
     notification to the Committees at least three days before DHS 
     executes or announces grant allocations; grant awards; 
     contract awards, including contracts covered by the Federal 
     Acquisition Regulation; other transaction agreements; letters 
     of intent; task or delivery orders on multiple contract 
     awards totaling $1,000,000 or more; a task or delivery orders 
     greater than $10,000,000 from multi-year funds; or sole-
     source grant awards. Notifications shall include a 
     description of the project or projects or activities to be 
     funded and the location, including city, county, and state. 
     If the Secretary determines that compliance would pose 
     substantial risk to health, human life, or safety, an award 
     may be made without prior notification but the Committees 
     shall be notified within 5 full business days after such 
     award or letter is issued.
       Section 508. The bill continues a provision prohibiting all 
     agencies from purchasing, constructing, or leasing additional 
     facilities for federal law enforcement training without 
     advance notification to the Committees.
       Section 509. The bill continues a provision prohibiting the 
     use of funds for any construction, repair, alteration, or 
     acquisition project for which a prospectus, if required under 
     chapter 33 of title 40, United States Code, has not been 
     approved.
       Section 510. The bill continues a provision that includes 
     and consolidates by reference prior-year statutory provisions 
     related to a contracting officer's technical representative 
     training; sensitive security information; and the use of 
     funds in conformance with section 303 of the Energy Policy 
     Act of 1992.
       Section 511. The bill continues a provision prohibiting the 
     use of funds in contravention of the Buy American Act.
       Section 512. The bill continues a provision regarding the 
     oath of allegiance required by section 337 of the Immigration 
     and Nationality Act.
       Section 513. The bill continues a provision prohibiting 
     funds for the Principal Federal Official during a Stafford 
     Act declared disaster or emergency, with certain exceptions.
       Section 514. The bill continues a provision that precludes 
     DHS from using funds in this Act to carry out reorganization 
     authority. This prohibition is not intended to prevent the 
     Department from carrying out routine or small reallocations 
     of personnel or functions within components, subject to 
     section 503 of this Act. This section prevents large-scale 
     reorganization of the Department, which should be acted on

   DIVISION G--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED 
                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018

       The following statement is an explanation of the effects of 
     Division G, which makes appropriations for the Department of 
     the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the 
     Forest Service, the Indian Health Service, and related 
     agencies for fiscal year 2018.
       The joint explanatory statement accompanying this division 
     is approved and indicates congressional intent. Unless 
     otherwise noted, the language set forth in House Report 115-
     238 carries the same weight as language included in this 
     joint explanatory statement and should be complied with 
     unless specifically addressed to the contrary in this joint 
     explanatory statement. While some language is repeated for 
     emphasis, it is not intended to negate the language referred 
     to above unless expressly provided herein.
       In instances where the House report speaks more broadly to 
     policy issues or offers views that are subject to 
     interpretation, such views remain those of the House and are 
     not affirmed by this explanatory statement unless repeated 
     herein. In cases where the House report or this explanatory 
     statement directs the submission of a report, such report is 
     to be submitted to both the House and Senate Committees on 
     Appropriations. Where this explanatory statement refers to 
     the Committees or the Committees on Appropriations, unless 
     otherwise noted, this reference is to the House Subcommittee 
     on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies and the Senate 
     Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.
       The Committees direct each department and agency funded in 
     this Act to follow the directions set forth in this Act and 
     the accompanying statement, and not reallocate resources or 
     reorganize activities except as provided herein or otherwise 
     approved by the Committees through the reprogramming process 
     as referenced in this explanatory statement. This explanatory 
     statement addresses only those agencies and accounts for 
     which there is a need for greater explanation than provided 
     in the Act itself. Funding levels for appropriations by 
     account, program, and activity, with comparisons to the 
     fiscal year 2017 enacted level and the fiscal year 2018 
     budget request, can be found in the table at the end of this 
     division.
       Unless expressly stated otherwise, any reference to ``this 
     Act'' or ``at the end of this statement'' shall be treated as 
     referring only to the provisions of this division.
       Committee Directives.--The Department of the Interior and 
     Forest Service are directed to continue the directions 
     included in the Explanatory Statement accompanying the 
     Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) relating 
     to Vacant Grazing Allotments; State Wildlife Data; Bighorn 
     Sheep; Land Grants, Acequias, and Community Ditches; and 
     Public Access.
       Recreation Fee Authority.--The one-year extension of 
     recreation fee authority for the Department of the Interior 
     and U.S. Forest Service contained in the budget request and 
     included in both fiscal year 2018 House and Senate Interior, 
     Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bills was 
     included in the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and 
     Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements 
     Act, 2017 (Public Law 115-56).
       Making Litigation Costs Transparent.--The Department of the 
     Interior, EPA, and the Forest Service are directed to provide 
     to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, and to 
     make publicly available no later than 60 days after enactment 
     of this Act, detailed Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) fee 
     information as specified in the explanatory statement 
     accompanying Division G of the Consolidated Appropriations 
     Act, 2017 (Public Law 115-31).
       White-Nose Syndrome.--The four Federal land management 
     agencies and the U.S. Geological Survey are expected to 
     continue to prioritize research on, and efforts to address, 
     white-nose syndrome in bats and to work with other Federal, 
     State, and non-governmental partners to implement the North 
     American Bat Monitoring Program.
       Multi-Agency Transparency.--The Committees support 
     increasing transparency within all agencies of the Department 
     of the Interior, the Forest Service and the Environmental 
     Protection Agency. These agencies are encouraged to disclose 
     costs associated with analyses required by the National 
     Environmental Policy Act.
       Paper Reduction Efforts.--The Committees urge the 
     Department of the Interior, EPA, Forest Service, and Indian 
     Health Service to work with the Office of Management and 
     Budget to reduce printing and reproduction costs and direct 
     each agency to report to the Committees within 90 days of 
     enactment of this Act on steps being undertaken to achieve 
     this goal and how much each agency expects to save by 
     implementing these measures.
       Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) 
     Training.--The Department of the Interior and the Forest 
     Service shall follow the directive in Senate Report 114-281 
     regarding ANILCA training for agency employees.
       Transparency of Information.--The Committees expect that 
     Federal agencies funded under this Act shall, to the extent 
     practicable, clearly state within materials used for 
     advertising or educational purposes that the communication is 
     funded by taxpayer dollars.
       Fleet Management Practices.--Agencies shall provide 
     supporting documentation on their methods for determining 
     their optimal fleet inventories and justification for any 
     deviation from the General Services Administration's Federal 
     Property Management Regulations upon request of the 
     Committees. Agency inspectors general shall provide results 
     from audits of fleet management practices and make them 
     publicly available.
       Invasive Species.--The Department of the Interior is 
     directed to provide a written report to the Committees within 
     180 days of enactment of this Act, detailing the funds 
     appropriated and expended, actions taken, and outputs 
     achieved for the early detection of and rapid response to 
     invasive species, as prescribed in the National Invasive 
     Species Council Management Plan, 2016-2018.
       Delivery of Reports and Correspondence.--All reports, 
     correspondence, and reprogramming requests from the agencies 
     to the Committees shall be provided in both physical and 
     electronic formats.
       Youth Partnership Programs.--The Secretary of the Interior 
     and the Secretary of Agriculture are encouraged to utilize, 
     where practicable, youth partnership programs like the Public 
     Lands Corps, Youth Conservation Corps, Student Conservation 
     Association, Job Corps and other related partnerships with 
     Federal, State, local, tribal or non-profit groups that serve 
     young adults.
       Land and Water Conservation Fund.--The agreement includes 
     $425,000,000 derived from the Land and Water Conservation 
     Fund (LWCF) for programs consistent with chapter 2003 of

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       There is bipartisan support for the Land and Water 
     Conservation Fund and this agreement includes funding for 
     State assistance and new land acquisition projects. The 
     Committees expect the agencies to move forward with all 
     projects specifically identified and funded through this 
     agreement and those funded in previous fiscal years; to 
     utilize funding in a timely manner; and to seek Congressional 
     approval for reprogramming unobligated balances if 
     applicable. Agencies are directed to continue their 
     longstanding process of identifying and prioritizing 
     potential Federal land acquisition projects in anticipation 
     of program appropriations as consistent with previous years. 
     Within 30 days of enactment of this Act, each agency is 
     directed to submit to the Committees a prioritized list of 
     projects for fiscal year 2019 consideration. In future years, 
     the agencies are directed to submit their lists within 30 
     days of the President's budget submission to Congress.
       The Committees believe increasing access to our public 
     lands for hunting, fishing, and other recreational activities 
     is important and again include funding for these projects. 
     The Committees expect recreational access projects to be 
     selected based on their role in meeting key recreation needs 
     and the agencies should work with their respective regions, 
     State offices, and/or management units to identify potential 
     projects. The Committees are to be informed about the 
     selection process and how the agencies are meeting the 
     outlined objectives prior to proceeding with projects. 
     Further, the agencies are again directed to include in future 
     budget justifications an explanation of the process used for 
     allocating funds for recreational access in the previous 
     year.
       National Ocean Policy.--The Committees direct the 
     Department of the Interior to identify by agency and account, 
     and submit no later than 60 days after enactment of this Act, 
     all funding and associated actions in the

[[Page H2610]]

     President's budget submission for fiscal year 2019, proposed 
     for the implementation of the coastal and marine spatial 
     planning and ecosystem-based management components of the 
     National Ocean Policy developed under Executive Order 13547.

                        REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES

       The following are the procedures governing reprogramming 
     actions for programs and activities funded in the Department 
     of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies 
     Appropriations Act. The Committees remind the agencies funded 
     in this Act that these reprogramming guidelines are in 
     effect, and must be complied with, until such time as the 
     Committees modify them through bill or report language.
       Definitions.--``Reprogramming,'' as defined in these 
     procedures, includes the reallocation of funds from one 
     budget activity, budget line-item, or program area, to 
     another within any appropriation funded in this Act. In cases 
     where either the House or Senate Committee report displays an 
     allocation of an appropriation below that level, that more 
     detailed level shall be the basis for reprogramming.
       For construction, land acquisition, and forest legacy 
     accounts, a reprogramming constitutes the reallocation of 
     funds, including unobligated balances, from one construction, 
     land acquisition, or forest legacy project to another such 
     project.
       A reprogramming shall also consist of any significant 
     departure from the program described in the agency's budget 
     justifications. This includes proposed reorganizations, 
     especially those of significant national or regional 
     importance, even without a change in funding. Any change to 
     the organization table presented in the budget justification 
     shall be subject to this requirement.
       The Committees are aware that agencies funded by this Act 
     are currently working to implement Executive Order 13781, a 
     Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch, and 
     have included in the fiscal year 2019 budget request a number 
     of significant reorganization proposals for the Committees' 
     consideration. The Committees are also aware of reports that 
     agencies funded by this Act may be weighing additional 
     organizational changes during the remainder of this fiscal 
     year. Agencies are reminded that this agreement continues 
     longstanding General Guidelines for Reprogramming that 
     require agencies funded by this Act to submit reorganization 
     proposals for Committee review prior to their implementation. 
     It is noted that such reprogramming guidelines apply to 
     proposed reorganizations, workforce restructure, reshaping or 
     transfer of functions presented in the budget justifications, 
     or bureau-wide downsizing, especially those of significant 
     national or regional importance, and include closures, 
     consolidations, and relocations of offices, facilities, and 
     laboratories presented in the budget justifications. In 
     addition, no agency shall implement any part of a 
     reorganization that modifies regional or State boundaries for 
     agencies or bureaus that were in effect as of the date of 
     enactment of this Act unless approved consistent with the 
     General Guidelines for Reprogramming procedures specified 
     herein. Any such reprogramming request submitted to the 
     Committees on Appropriations shall include a description of 
     anticipated benefits, including anticipated efficiencies and 
     cost-savings, as well as a description of anticipated 
     personnel impacts and funding changes anticipated to 
     implement the proposal.
       General Guidelines for Reprogramming.--
       (a) A reprogramming should be made only when an unforeseen 
     situation arises, and then only if postponement of the 
     project or the activity until the next appropriation year 
     would result in actual loss or damage.
       (b) Any project or activity, which may be deferred through 
     reprogramming, shall not later be accomplished by means of 
     further reprogramming, but instead, funds should again be 
     sought for the deferred project or activity through the 
     regular appropriations process.
       (c) Except under the most urgent situations, reprogramming 
     should not be employed to initiate new programs or increase 
     allocations specifically denied or limited by Congress, or to 
     decrease allocations specifically increased by the Congress.
       (d) Reprogramming proposals submitted to the House and 
     Senate Committees on Appropriations for approval shall be 
     considered approved 30 calendar days after receipt if the 
     Committees have posed no objection. However, agencies will be 
     expected to extend the approval deadline if specifically 
     requested by either Committee.
       Criteria and Exceptions.--A reprogramming must be submitted 
     to the Committees in writing prior to implementation if it 
     exceeds $1,000,000 annually or results in an increase or 
     decrease of more than 10 percent annually in affected 
     programs or projects, whichever amount is less, with the 
     following exceptions:
       (a) With regard to the tribal priority allocations of the 
     Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Bureau of Indian Education 
     (BIE), there is no restriction on reprogrammings among these 
     programs. However, the Bureaus shall report on all 
     reprogrammings made during a given fiscal year no later than 
     60 days after the end of the fiscal year.
       (b) With regard to the EPA, the Committees do not require 
     reprogramming requests associated with the States and Tribes 
     Partnership Grants, or up to a cumulative total of 
     $30,000,000 from carryover balances among the individual 
     program areas delineated in the Environmental Programs and 
     Management account. No funds, however, shall be reallocated 
     from individual Geographic Programs.
       Assessments.--``Assessment'' as defined in these procedures 
     shall refer to any charges, reserves, or holdbacks applied to 
     a budget activity or budget line item for costs associated 
     with general agency administrative costs, overhead costs, 
     working capital expenses, or contingencies.
       (a) No assessment shall be levied against any program, 
     budget activity, subactivity, budget line item, or project 
     funded by the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies 
     Appropriations Act unless such assessment and the basis 
     therefor are presented to the Committees on Appropriations in 
     the budget justifications and are subsequently approved by 
     the Committees. The explanation for any assessment in the 
     budget justification shall show the amount of the assessment, 
     the activities assessed, and the purpose of the funds.
       (b) Proposed changes to estimated assessments, as such 
     estimates were presented in annual budget justifications, 
     shall be submitted through the reprogramming process and 
     shall be subject to the same dollar and reporting criteria as 
     any other reprogramming.
       (c) The Committees direct that each agency or bureau which 
     utilizes assessments shall submit an annual report to the 
     Committees which provides details on the use of all funds 
     assessed from any other budget activity, line item, 
     subactivity, or project.
       (d) In no case shall contingency funds or assessments be 
     used to finance projects and activities disapproved or 
     limited by Congress, or to finance programs or activities 
     that could be foreseen and included in the normal budget 
     review process.
       (e) New programs requested in the budget should not be 
     initiated before enactment of the bill without notification 
     to, and the approval of, the Committees on Appropriations. 
     This restriction applies to all such actions regardless of 
     whether a formal reprogramming of funds is required to begin 
     the program.
       Quarterly Reports.--All reprogrammings between budget 
     activities, budget line-items, program areas, or the more 
     detailed activity levels shown in this agreement, including 
     those below the monetary thresholds established above, shall 
     be reported to the Committees within 60 days of the end of 
     each quarter and shall include cumulative totals for each 
     budget activity, budget line item, or construction, land 
     acquisition, or forest legacy project.
       Land Acquisitions, Easements, and Forest Legacy.--Lands 
     shall not be acquired for more than the approved appraised 
     value (as addressed in section 301(3) of Public Law 91-646), 
     unless such acquisitions are submitted to the Committees on 
     Appropriations for approval in compliance with these 
     procedures.
       Land Exchanges.--Land exchanges, wherein the estimated 
     value of the Federal lands to be exchanged is greater than 
     $1,000,000, shall not be consummated until the Committees 
     have had a 30-day period in which to examine the proposed 
     exchange. In addition, the Committees shall be provided 
     advance notification of exchanges valued between $500,000 and 
     $1,000,000.
       Budget Structure.--The budget activity or line item 
     structure for any agency appropriation account shall not be 
     altered without advance approval of the House and Senate 
     Committees on Appropriations.
       Fiscal Year 2019 Process.--Historically, the Interior, 
     Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act has not 
     included reprogramming direction in bill language. However, 
     this historical practice is not consistent with the majority 
     of other Appropriations subcommittees' bills. Therefore, the 
     Committees plan to consider including bill language in fiscal 
     year 2019. The agencies are therefore strongly encouraged to 
     work collaboratively with the Committees to develop language 
     in order to avoid any barriers to implementation.

                  TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR


                       bureau of land management

                   management of lands and resources

       Bureau of Land Management Directives.--The Bureau is 
     reminded of the importance of the directives included in 
     House Report 115-238 not addressed herein, as well as the new 
     directives in this explanatory statement, including the front 
     matter.
       The agreement provides $1,166,043,000 for Management of 
     Lands and Resources. Within this amount, the agreement 
     includes an additional $50,000,000 for deferred maintenance. 
     The Committees direct that the Bureau provide a report no 
     later than October 1, 2018, on the projects to be funded with 
     this funding. The Committees also note that there is 
     $5,465,000 in unobligated balances in the Construction 
     appropriation, which was discontinued in fiscal year 2014. To 
     augment the new funds for deferred maintenance, the Bureau is 
     directed to utilize these Construction funds for deferred 
     maintenance projects and to submit a reprogramming request to 
     the Committees, as necessary, to fully obligate the prior 
     year balances in fiscal year 2018.
       In addition to the funding allocation table at the end of 
     this explanatory statement, the agreement includes the 
     following instructions:
       Wild Horses and Burros.--The Committees are extremely 
     disappointed that the Department has failed to provide a 
     comprehensive plan, as directed by the Consolidated 
     Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) to address

[[Page H2611]]

     the fast-rising costs of the Wild Horse and Burro program and 
     overpopulation of wild horses and burros on the range. The 
     failure to address these problems is irresponsible and will 
     result in irreparable damage to the landscape and the welfare 
     of the animals protected by the Wild Free-Roaming Horse and 
     Burro Act. The Committees reiterate their belief that there 
     is no one solution to the problems with this program, and 
     that Congress and the Administration must work together to 
     correct them. Until the Department provides a comprehensive 
     plan and any corresponding legislative proposals to the 
     appropriate authorizing committees, the Committees will 
     maintain the existing prohibitions and reduce the resources 
     available for the program. Reprogramming requests will only 
     be considered for urgent needs. At a minimum, the Committees 
     expect a science-based, detailed plan that 1) reduces the 
     complexity and cost of contracting policies and procedures; 
     2) eliminates unnecessary environmental reviews; 3) 
     simplifies and expands the use of partnerships and 
     cooperative agreements; 4) identifies statutory and 
     regulatory barriers to implementing the plan; and 5) has the 
     goal of reducing costs while improving the health and welfare 
     of wild horses and burros, and the range. The Committees 
     direct the Department to provide the report within 30 days of 
     enactment of this Act.
       Greater Sage-grouse.--The agreement provides $60,000,000 
     for greater sage-grouse and related sage-steppe conservation 
     activities. This is equal to the amount of base funding 
     provided in fiscal year 2017. The Bureau is encouraged to 
     continue working with States and other interested entities on 
     the existing sage-grouse conservation plans and to improve 
     the condition of the sage-steppe ecosystem.
       Energy and Minerals.--The agreement provides sufficient 
     funding, within the total made available, to complete the 
     next cluster of legacy well remediation. Congress is closely 
     following the litigation regarding the Waste Prevention, 
     Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation 
     regulation and directs the Bureau to provide a report on the 
     costs and staffing needs associated with it, within 30 days 
     of enactment of this Act, to help the Committees prepare for 
     the fiscal year 2019 appropriations process.
       Onshore Orders #3 and #4.--The Committees are aware that 
     the Bureau is working with affected industries and other 
     interested stakeholders regarding these Orders and expect 
     that the Bureau will expeditiously resolve any remaining 
     issues consistent with current law.
       Required Reports.--The Bureau is reminded that the reports 
     to Congress required by 42 U.S.C. 15924(e) are due on 
     February 1 annually, and therefore is directed to submit the 
     reports for 2016 and 2017 no later than 30 days after the 
     date of enactment of this Act.
       Realty and Ownership Management.--The agreement provides 
     $1,000,000 for surveys along the Red River in Oklahoma and 
     Texas.
       Chaco Canyon Regional Management Plan.--The Bureau is 
     directed to continue its collaborative work with the Bureau 
     of Indian Affairs in the Greater Chaco Canyon area and to 
     maintain current management practices surrounding Chaco 
     Culture National Historical Park while a new resource 
     management planning process to protect cultural and 
     historical resources is completed.
       Rio Puerco Watershed.--The Bureau is encouraged to continue 
     supporting the Rio Puerco Watershed Committee's work to 
     identify and implement projects to restore the watershed.
       Resource Management Planning.--The agreement provides 
     $60,125,000 for resource management planning, which is 
     $8,000,000 above the fiscal year 2017 level. The Bureau is 
     directed to focus these additional resources on greater sage-
     grouse, sage-steppe, and other high priority conservation 
     areas.
       Committee Directives.--The Bureau is directed to continue 
     to follow the directions included in the explanatory 
     statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
     2017 (P.L. 115-31) related to Cooperative Efforts in Alaska, 
     Tribal Coordination, and Red River Land Ownership. The Bureau 
     also is directed to comply with the timelines required in the 
     Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act (ANILCA) and 
     complete environmental reviews, after local consultation and 
     subsistence impact reviews, as it relates to the 
     consideration of the application for the road from Dalton 
     Highway to the Ambler Mining District, as well as continue 
     the directions included in the explanatory statement 
     accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 
     114-113) related to placer mining.
       Soda Ash.--The Committees are concerned about maintaining 
     the United States' global competitiveness in the production 
     of natural soda ash. The United States contains approximately 
     90 percent of the world's natural soda ash deposits, while 
     many international competitors are producing synthetic soda 
     ash using more energy and generating higher emissions than 
     natural soda ash production. Therefore, the Committees expect 
     the Bureau to consider using its authority to reduce the 
     Federal royalty rate for soda ash to 2 percent.


                            LAND ACQUISITION

       The bill provides $24,916,000 for Land Acquisition. The 
     amounts provided by this bill compared with the budget 
     estimates by activity and project are shown in the table 
     below, listed in priority order pursuant to the project list 
     received for fiscal year 2018. Further instructions are 
     contained under the Land and Water Conservation Fund heading 
     in the front of this explanatory statement.
       The Committees note that almost none of the fiscal year 
     2017 land acquisition funding for the Bureau has been spent 
     through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and are 
     concerned about delays in project completions. The Committees 
     expect all projects, particularly those in project areas 
     identified by Congress in this report and in previous fiscal 
     years, to be completed as expeditiously as possible.

                   OREGON AND CALIFORNIA GRANT LANDS

       The agreement provides $106,985,000 for Oregon and 
     California Grant Lands, to be distributed as displayed in the 
     funding allocation table at the end of this explanatory 
     statement.


                           RANGE IMPROVEMENTS

       The agreement provides $10,000,000 to be derived from 
     public lands receipts and Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act 
     lands grazing receipts.


               SERVICE CHARGES, DEPOSITS, AND FORFEITURES

       The agreement provides an indefinite appropriation 
     estimated to be $24,595,000 for Service Charges, Deposits, 
     and Forfeitures.


                       MISCELLANEOUS TRUST FUNDS

       The agreement provides an indefinite appropriation 
     estimated to be $24,000,000 for Miscellaneous Trust Funds.


                UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE

                          RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

       The bill provides $1,279,002,000 for Resource Management. 
     All programs and activities, including youth programs and 
     cooperative recovery grants, are funded at the amounts 
     proposed in the budget request to the Congress unless 
     otherwise specified below or in the table at the end of this 
     division. The Service is expected to comply with the 
     instructions and requirements at the beginning of this 
     division, in addition to the following:
       Endangered Species Act (ESA).--The Committees support and 
     reiterate the guidance and directives beginning on page 12 of 
     House Report 115-238, aimed at improving and increasing 
     collaboration with States and other partners in all stages of 
     ESA implementation. Such collaboration ensures lasting 
     conservation success and upholds the integrity of the ESA, 
     which is premised upon the Federal Government working with 
     the States and other partners to recover species and 
     subsequently remove Federal protections.
       As the Service indicated in its fiscal year 2017 budget 
     request, ``Given the growing number of listed species--
     limited resources force the Recovery Program to make 
     difficult tradeoffs among these activities including 5-year 
     reviews, developing recovery plans, implementing recovery 
     actions, delisting and downlisting, all of which are 
     necessary to achieve recovery.'' Such tradeoffs have led to 
     backlogs of 837 species (53 percent) without a current 5-year 
     review, and 49 species awaiting downlisting or delisting, and 
     have contributed to a common sentiment that, once a species 
     is put on the list, it doesn't come off. Such sentiment has 
     made for reluctant State and local partners, adding further 
     strain to the Service's budget and making recovery more 
     difficult. Though the Service is to be commended for having 
     made progress on these backlogs in recent

[[Page H2612]]

     years, it cannot eliminate these backlogs without additional 
     help.
       Flexibilities already inherent in the ESA allow the Service 
     to collaborate and benefit from partner expertise and on-the-
     ground conservation, and the Service, to its credit, already 
     does a considerable amount of that in some regions. But the 
     Committees also recognize that several States and non-
     governmental partners have indicated a willingness to 
     increase their involvement when the Federal Government is a 
     willing and equal partner. The aim of this fiscal year 2018 
     appropriation is twofold: 1) to foster a more open, 
     transparent, and collaborative ESA process; and 2) to begin 
     to shift the workload by incentivizing increased involvement 
     by States and other partners in activities such as species 
     status assessments, and recovery planning and implementation, 
     so the Service can prioritize the ESA responsibilities that 
     are inherently Federal.
       Ecological Services.--The agreement provides $247,825,000 
     for programs and activities within Ecological Services, as 
     discussed below.
       Listing.--The agreement provides $18,818,000 for status 
     assessments, listings, critical habitat determinations, and 
     related activities. Bill language funding limitations are 
     consolidated under one cap.
       The Committees urge the Service to avoid entering into any 
     multi-species settlement agreement unless the State and local 
     governments where the species are located are a party to that 
     agreement.
       The Service is urged to continue to follow the guidance 
     contained in House Report 114-170 regarding the yellow-billed 
     cuckoo.
       The Service is directed to develop a plan to improve 
     transparency of the underlying data it uses to make 
     determinations for species listings and de-listing activities 
     before the end of fiscal year 2018, including details on how 
     the Service will publish data and materials used in listing 
     determinations on the Internet and improve what is currently 
     available on www.regulations.gov and the Service website.
       The Committees expect the Service to work with the States 
     to develop a more reasonable policy whereby the Service's 
     regulatory assurance criteria include responsible land 
     management commitments by private landowners, as described in 
     further detail in House Report 115-238.
       The Committees are concerned that the Service has not fully 
     incorporated traditional Tribal knowledge in its 
     implementation of the ESA. When appropriate, the Committees 
     expect the Service to make every effort to incorporate 
     traditional knowledge in ESA decisions. The Committees also 
     expect the Service to engage in additional outreach to Tribal 
     governments in circumstances where traditional knowledge may 
     provide valuable information, including for species like the 
     northern sea otter. The Service should brief the Committees 
     on its efforts regarding traditional knowledge within 60 days 
     of enactment of this Act.
       Planning and Consultation.--The agreement provides 
     $105,579,000 for project permitting and consultation 
     activities. A program increase of $2,500,000 is included to 
     avoid permitting delays and to achieve compliance with other 
     statutes, and should be apportioned in accordance with 
     workload needs nationwide rather than by region. Funding for 
     all other program elements within this subactivity are 
     restored to the fiscal year 2017 enacted levels, including 
     $4,000,000 for Gulf Coast restoration. Because the Committees 
     have provided substantial resources for Gulf Coast 
     restoration, the Service is expected to move forward with 
     project reviews in a timely manner. The Service is also 
     encouraged to evaluate establishing a reimbursement policy to 
     recover costs for work required by statute for projects 
     funded by future disaster settlements.
       The Committees support the continuation of collaborative 
     efforts in the Pacific Northwest with the National Marine 
     Fisheries Service, the Washington Department of Fish and 
     Wildlife, and affected Tribes that will result in the 
     completion of all Puget Sound hatchery program consultations 
     by the Fall, 2018.
       The Service is encouraged to place a priority on providing 
     technical assistance to partners making good faith efforts to 
     develop and implement responsible habitat conservation plans 
     as authorized by the ESA.
       The Service is urged to address consultations and 
     permitting of public and private projects related to the 
     Preble's meadow jumping mouse as one of the highest 
     priorities.
       Conservation and Restoration.--The agreement provides 
     $32,396,000 for conservation and restoration activities. 
     Funding for all program elements within this subactivity are 
     restored to the fiscal year 2017 enacted levels.
       The Service is expected to focus Candidate Conservation 
     funding on the annual Candidate Notice of Review as required 
     by the ESA, providing technical assistance to States and 
     others, and developing agreements that provide regulatory 
     certainty to landowners. The Service should look to its other 
     programs and its partners to fund and implement conservation 
     activities on the ground. The Service is commended for its 
     efforts in the Southeast to work with States and others to 
     preclude the need to list many of the hundreds of species 
     recently petitioned for listing, and is expected to expand 
     this model nationwide.
       Recovery.--The agreement provides $91,032,000 for 
     activities in support of the recovery and delisting of 
     threatened and endangered species, with continued funding for 
     the following program elements at or above the fiscal year 
     2017 enacted levels: Bay Delta, $1,659,000; white nose 
     syndrome, $2,000,000; State of the Birds, $3,000,000; and the 
     wolf-livestock loss demonstration program, $1,000,000. States 
     with de-listed wolf populations shall continue to be eligible 
     for funding, provided that those States continue to meet the 
     eligibility criteria contained in Public Law 111-11.
       General program activities are funded at $74,000,000. The 
     Service is expected to focus the funds on inherently Federal 
     activities such as recovery plan approvals, the backlog of 
     five-year reviews, status changes, and associated 
     collaboration with States and other partners. An additional 
     $4,373,000 is provided to propose and finalize rules for the 
     backlog of species with completed 5-year reviews that 
     recommend delisting and downlisting.
       In developing and implementing recovery plans, the Service 
     is directed to make full use of its authority under section 
     4(f)(2) of the ESA to ``procure the services of appropriate 
     public and private agencies and institutions, and other 
     qualified persons.'' While recovery plan approval and 
     delisting decisions ultimately rest with the Service and make 
     collaboration essential to success, plan development and 
     implementation are not inherently Federal. Species recovery 
     is a shared responsibility that does not default to the Fish 
     and Wildlife Service. Where able partners are willing to 
     increase or lead these efforts, the Service is expected to 
     shift to supportive roles through technical assistance and 
     cost-shared grants.
       To expand partnerships through cost-shared grants, the 
     agreement includes program increases within the Cooperative 
     Endangered Species Conservation Fund and State and Tribal 
     Wildlife Grants. In addition, $5,000,000 is provided in 
     Resource Management for Recovery Challenge matching grants to 
     enhance and increase partnerships with agencies and 
     organizations implementing highest priority recovery actions 
     as prescribed in recovery plans, and in particular for 
     genetically-sound breeding, rearing, and reintroduction 
     programs. Longstanding partnerships, including for the 
     northern aplomado falcon, California condor, and Steller's 
     eider, should be funded at not less than $2,000,000 and 
     partner contributions should be not less than their current 
     amounts. The remaining funds should be dedicated to new 
     partnerships and should require a 50:50 match, which may 
     include in-kind services. Unless an affected State is a 
     partner on the project, none of the funds may be awarded to a 
     project until the project partners have consulted with such 
     State. The Service is strongly encouraged to transfer similar 
     recovery plan implementation partnerships to Recovery 
     Challenge grants in future budget requests, so that all other 
     Recovery funds in the Resource Management account are 
     prioritized to ensure accomplishment of inherently Federal 
     functions.
       The Service is urged to work with the State of Utah on a 
     mutually agreeable plan to recover the Utah prairie dog, as 
     discussed in House Report 115-238.
       The Committees are aware that the Service is currently 
     undertaking a required status review of the American Burying 
     Beetle to determine whether listing as an endangered species 
     is still warranted. Within funds provided, the Service is 
     directed to propose a rule by the end of the fiscal year to 
     delist or downlist the American Burying Beetle should the 
     status review make a finding that delisting or downlisting is 
     warranted.
       The Committees acknowledge the important roles that science 
     and Federal wildlife biologists have in the Service's 
     decisions to recover species. The Service's Science program 
     is directed to initiate a study not later than 90 days after 
     the date of enactment of this Act, through a qualified 
     independent entity such as the Smithsonian Institution, to 
     determine whether or not animals currently classified as red 
     wolves and Mexican gray wolves are taxonomically valid 
     species and subspecies designations, respectively. The study 
     shall include publication of a scientific literature review, 
     including genetic research, not later than one year after the 
     date of enactment of this Act and, if the literature is 
     inconclusive, shall include any additional necessary research 
     and publication not later than three years after the date of 
     enactment of this Act. In the meantime, the Service's 
     Recovery program is reminded of its legal mandate to 
     cooperate to the maximum extent practicable with the States, 
     especially when there has been conflict between species and 
     private property owners. As such, the Service is directed to 
     continue working closely with the North Carolina Wildlife 
     Resources Commission on management of red wolves in fiscal 
     year 2018.
       The Service should seek the most current science as it 
     works to implement the agreement between the United States 
     and the Russian Federation on management of the Alaska-
     Chukotka Polar Bear Population. The Service is expected to 
     consult with and incorporate traditional knowledge from 
     Alaska Native Organizations on matters related to subsistence 
     hunting, and to work with Alaska Native Organizations and 
     other wildlife management organizations with expertise in 
     subsistence hunting to implement a civil-based, co-management 
     regime.
       Habitat Conservation.--The agreement provides $65,008,000 
     for habitat conservation programs, of which $51,633,000 is 
     for the Partners for Fish and Wildlife program and

[[Page H2613]]

     $13,375,000 is for the Coastal Program. All program elements 
     within these two subactivities are restored to fiscal year 
     2017 enacted levels, except as discussed in the opening 
     paragraph, including $1,285,000 for fisheries enhancement. 
     The Chesapeake Bay Nutria Eradication Project is funded at 
     $1,725,000.
       National Wildlife Refuge System.--The agreement provides 
     $486,757,000 for the National Wildlife Refuge System and 
     maintains subactivities and program elements at fiscal year 
     2017 enacted levels, except where identified in the opening 
     paragraph or described below.
       Wildlife and Habitat Management.--The agreement includes: 
     $2,835,000 to manage subsistence fishing and hunting; 
     $10,000,000 for invasive species, including $75,000 for the 
     Chesapeake Bay Nutria Eradication Project; $1,500,000 for the 
     Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument; and 
     $196,089,000 for general program activities which includes 
     the absorption of the former Healthy Habitats and Populations 
     initiative.
       The agreement supports the directive in House Report 114-
     632 instituting signage on any individual refuge where 
     trapping occurs and establishing guidance to be included in 
     the refuge manual. Until the Committees are notified in 
     writing that all directives are complied with, $2,000,000 of 
     the funding provided for Wildlife and Habitat Management is 
     not available for obligation.
       The Service is reminded of the directive contained in House 
     Report 115-238 regarding the Comprehensive Everglades 
     Restoration Plan.
       The Service is expected to follow the directive from 
     previous fiscal years that prohibits a caribou hunt on 
     Kagalaska Island and efforts to remove cattle on Chirikof and 
     Wosnesenski Islands in the State of Alaska.
       Visitor Services.--The agreement includes $2,000,000 for 
     the youth program. Funding has been provided to continue the 
     Urban Wildlife Refuge Partnership program at the fiscal year 
     2017 enacted level and to support efforts to promote 
     conservation in urban areas. The Committees encourage the 
     Service to consider prioritizing funding for a new visitor 
     center at the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge. The 
     Service is directed to brief the Committees on options for 
     preserving historic aircraft located within the World War II 
     Valor in the Pacific National Monument on Atka Island in 
     Alaska within 90 days of enactment of this Act. The 
     Committees encourage the Service to work with local 
     stakeholders and consider prioritizing enhancements at the 
     Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge in its internal budget 
     processes--including new trails, visitor center exhibits, and 
     other infrastructure priorities--to improve the visitor 
     experience for the increasing number of visitors at the 
     refuge.
       Conservation Planning.--The Service is encouraged to work 
     with affected landowners to address concerns about the 
     acquisition boundary for Bitter Creek National Wildlife 
     Refuge, as discussed in House Report 115-238.
       The agreement directs the Service to approve the 
     establishment of the Green River National Wildlife Refuge in 
     the Green River Bottoms area near the confluence of the Green 
     River and Ohio River in Henderson County, Kentucky. The 
     refuge should consist of approximately 24,000 acres--to be 
     acquired from willing landowners. The Service should partner 
     with other stakeholders on establishment of the refuge and 
     look for opportunities related to environmental mitigation 
     for interstate bridge construction projects in the area. The 
     Service is directed to wait to establish final boundaries of 
     the refuge until the new I-69 interstate bridge corridor is 
     selected. Within 120 days of the date of enactment of this 
     Act, the Service is directed to report to the Committees on 
     its progress toward establishment of the refuge.
       Refuge Maintenance.--The agreement includes $42,901,000 to 
     reduce the backlog of deferred maintenance and $649,000 to 
     continue the Youth Conservation Corps. The Service is 
     encouraged to consider prioritizing repairs of water control 
     structures at the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National 
     Wildlife Refuge.
       Conservation and Enforcement.--The agreement provides 
     $141,290,000 for other conservation and enforcement programs 
     as described below.
       Migratory Bird Management.--The agreement provides 
     $48,421,000 to continue all Migratory Bird Management 
     programs at or above fiscal year 2017 enacted levels, 
     including: $2,000,000 for aviation safety; $350,000 to manage 
     bird-livestock conflicts; and $3,424,000 to expedite permits. 
     The Service is commended for its efforts to work with 
     landowners to reduce black vulture predation on livestock.
       Law Enforcement.--The agreement provides $77,053,000 to 
     continue all law enforcement programs at fiscal year 2017 
     enacted levels and includes a $2,000,000 increase for 
     wildlife inspectors at ports currently without personnel, in 
     order to deter illegal activities and to ensure that legal 
     trade is not significantly slowed because of a lack of 
     Service personnel. Wildlife trafficking enforcement 
     activities continue to be funded at $7,500,000, which may 
     also be used as needed to supplement inspections. The Service 
     is directed to enforce illegal logging violations pursuant to 
     the Lacey Act. From within general program activities, 
     funding is provided to continue the Service's work with the 
     Indian Arts and Crafts Board to combat international 
     trafficking of counterfeit arts and crafts and to conduct 
     criminal investigations of alleged violations of the Indian 
     Arts and Crafts Act.
       The Committees support efforts outlined in House Report 
     115-238 for the Service to collaborate with U.S. Customs and 
     Border Protection on the Automated Commercial Environment 
     (ACE).
       International Affairs.--The agreement provides $15,816,000 
     and continues all program elements at the fiscal year 2017 
     enacted levels, including $550,000 to support the Arctic 
     Council.
       As outlined in House Report 115-238, the Committees 
     encourage the Service to continue to work with stakeholders 
     to address their concerns related to international trade in 
     wood and wood products and advance efforts to develop a 
     domestic electronic permitting system and an electronic form 
     for data collection to expedite processing of licit imports 
     and exports of these products.
       The Committees recognize the Service's work with Mexico and 
     Central American nations and urge the continuation of these 
     international partnerships.
       Within 150 days of enactment of this Act, the Committees 
     expect the report directed in House Report 115-238 on the 
     CITES permitting process for live plants and the analysis of 
     actions that could create efficiencies.
       Fish and Aquatic Conservation.--The agreement provides 
     $164,627,000 for fish and aquatic conservation programs and 
     maintains subactivities and program elements at fiscal year 
     2017 enacted levels, except where identified in the opening 
     paragraph or described below. The Service is expected to 
     continue its tradition of improving freshwater subsistence, 
     commercial, and recreational fishing since 1871.
       National Fish Hatchery System Operations.--The agreement 
     provides $55,822,000 and includes: $550,000 to implement the 
     Great Lakes Consent Decree; $1,430,000 for the national wild 
     fish health survey program; $1,475,000 to continue mass 
     marking salmonids in the Pacific Northwest; and $1,200,000 
     for the Aquatic Animal Drug Approval Partnership. None of the 
     funds may be used to terminate operations or to close any 
     facility of the National Fish Hatchery System. None of the 
     production programs listed in the March 2013 National Fish 
     Hatchery System Strategic Hatchery and Workforce Planning 
     Report may be reduced or terminated without advance, informal 
     consultation with affected States and Tribes.
       The Service is expected to continue funding mitigation 
     hatchery programs via reimbursable agreements with Federal 
     partners. Future agreements should include reimbursement for 
     production, facilities, and administrative costs. The Service 
     is expected to ensure that its costs are fully reimbursed 
     before proposing to reduce or redirect base funding.
       Maintenance and Equipment.--The agreement provides 
     $22,920,000 which includes $13,249,000 to reduce the deferred 
     maintenance backlog, and, in addition to amounts provided in 
     the Construction account, funding should continue to be 
     allocated to facilities with the most severe health and 
     safety deficiencies across the System as a whole, rather than 
     by region. All other funds should continue to be allocated as 
     in prior years and should include mitigation hatcheries as 
     needed to supplement reimbursable funds.
       Habitat Assessment and Restoration.--The agreement provides 
     $33,987,000, which includes $13,998,000 for the National Fish 
     Passage Program, $3,000,000 to implement the Klamath Basin 
     Restoration Agreement, and $5,000,000 to implement the 
     Delaware River Basin Conservation Act (DRBCA). Within 90 days 
     of enactment of this Act, the Service is directed to brief 
     the Committees on its efforts related to the DRBCA. The 
     Service is directed to be transparent with its partners 
     regarding Federal costs for program coordination and 
     administration of the National Fish Habitat Action Plan.
       Population Assessment and Cooperative Management.--The 
     agreement provides $30,150,000 which includes $9,554,000 for 
     subsistence fisheries management and $15,635,000 for general 
     program activities, of which $489,000 is for the Lake 
     Champlain sea lamprey program.
       Aquatic Invasive Species.--The agreement includes 
     $21,748,000 for aquatic invasive species programs, of which: 
     $1,000,000 is to help States implement plans required by the 
     National Invasive Species Act (NISA); $1,566,000 is for NISA 
     coordination; $3,088,000 is to implement subsection 5(d)(2) 
     of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act; $10,400,000 is for 
     controlling Asian carp in the Mississippi and Ohio River 
     Basins and preventing them from entering and establishing in 
     the Great Lakes, including $2,000,000 to expand and perfect 
     the combined use of contract fishing and deterrents to 
     extirpate Asian carp, including grass carp, where already 
     established; and $2,000,000 is to prevent the spread of 
     quagga and zebra mussels.
       The Committees support efforts to address threats to 
     aquatic invasive species and direct the Service to continue 
     to make available competitive grant funding for projects to 
     eliminate invasive species, including Asian carp, quagga and 
     zebra mussels, and variable-leaf watermilfoil. The Service 
     should continue to support research, monitoring, and 
     mitigation efforts, as well as efforts to disseminate such 
     work, in all regions.
       Cooperative Landscape Conservation.--The agreement provides 
     $12,988,000 for cooperative landscape conservation, of which 
     $1,000,000 is for the Gulf Coast ecosystem. The Committees 
     recognize the disparate levels of partner support across the 
     States and expect the Service to focus funding where 
     partnerships are strong.

[[Page H2614]]

       Science Support.--The agreement provides $17,267,000 for 
     the Science Support program and includes $931,000 to restore 
     the Gulf Coast ecosystem, and $3,500,000 for white-nose 
     syndrome in bats. The Service should continue to co-lead and 
     implement the North American Bat Monitoring Program with 
     other Federal, State, and non-governmental partners. The 
     Service is expected to partner with Cooperative Research 
     Units whenever possible.
       General Operations.--The agreement provides $143,240,000 
     for general operations and includes funding for central 
     office operations, regional office operations, and Service-
     wide bill paying at the requested levels. The National Fish 
     and Wildlife Foundation is funded at the fiscal year 2017 
     enacted level. A one-time program increase of $4,300,000 is 
     provided for annual maintenance needs of the National 
     Conservation Training Center (NCTC). The Committees 
     understand this funding will fully address backlog 
     maintenance at NCTC.


                              CONSTRUCTION

       The bill provides $66,540,000 for Construction and includes 
     a one-time increase of $50,000,000 for the backlog of 
     deferred maintenance principally at national fish hatcheries 
     and national wildlife refuges. The Service is directed to 
     provide a spend plan to the Committees within 120 days of 
     enactment of this Act for the additional deferred maintenance 
     funding. The detailed allocation of funding by activity is 
     included in the table at the end of this explanatory 
     statement. For line-item construction, the Service is 
     expected to follow the project priority list in the table 
     below. When a construction project is completed or terminated 
     and appropriated funds remain, the Service may use those 
     balances to respond to unforeseen reconstruction, 
     replacement, or repair of facilities or equipment damaged or 
     destroyed by storms, floods, fires and similar unanticipated 
     events.

                            LAND ACQUISITION

       The bill provides $63,839,000 for Land Acquisition. The 
     amounts provided by this bill compared with the budget 
     estimates by activity and project are shown in the table 
     below, listed in priority order pursuant to the project list 
     received for fiscal year 2018. Further instructions are 
     contained under the Land and Water Conservation Fund heading 
     in the front of this explanatory statement.
       In a time when budgetary constraints allow for only a 
     limited number of new land acquisition projects, the 
     Committees are encouraged by programs that leverage public/
     private partnerships for land conservation like the Highlands 
     Conservation Act, which has a record of more than a 2 to 1 
     ratio in non-Federal matching funds. Therefore, the 
     Committees include $10,000,000 for the Highlands Conservation 
     Act Grants and direct the Fish and Wildlife Service to work 
     with the Highlands States regarding priority projects for 
     fiscal year 2018.
       The Committees recognize there are concerns regarding the 
     acquisition and management of easements in some States. Any 
     uncertainty about the scope of management responsibilities 
     among stakeholders and agencies should be addressed by 
     engaging in a constructive dialogue and reaching a unified 
     solution that honors the rights of individual landowners 
     while implementing sound conservation practices. Therefore, 
     in lieu of the House directive, the Service is strongly 
     encouraged to begin this dialogue and brief the Committees 
     within 60 days of enactment of this Act on the challenges of 
     the Service harmonizing current easement laws and regulations 
     with landowners and State governments with options to resolve 
     these challenges.

            COOPERATIVE ENDANGERED SPECIES CONSERVATION FUND

       The bill provides $53,495,000 to carry out section 6 of the 
     Endangered Species Act of 1973, of which $33,857,000 is to be 
     derived from the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation 
     Fund and $19,638,000 is to be derived from the Land and Water 
     Conservation Fund. The detailed allocation of funding by 
     activity is included in the table at the end of this 
     explanatory statement. The Service is directed to lift the 
     artificial caps and apportion funds to Habitat Conservation 
     Plans (HCPs) based on need in order to increase on-the-ground 
     conservation and eliminate unobligated balances. The 
     agreement includes a program increase of $2,000,000 in 
     traditional conservation grants in order to foster increased 
     partner involvement in recovery plan development and 
     implementation, which is offset by a decrease in HCP planning 
     assistance grants due to a lack of demand.


                     NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE FUND

       The bill provides $13,228,000 for payments to counties from 
     the National Wildlife Refuge Fund.


               NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS CONSERVATION FUND

       The bill provides $40,000,000 for the North American 
     Wetlands Conservation Fund. The Service is directed to follow 
     the guidance in House Report 115-238.

                    STATE AND TRIBAL WILDLIFE GRANTS

       The bill provides $63,571,000 for State and Tribal Wildlife 
     Grants. The detailed allocation of funding by activity is 
     included in the table at the end of this explanatory 
     statement. All three grant programs shall place the highest 
     priority on species included in

[[Page H2615]]

     the most recent Candidate Notice of Review so as to preclude 
     the need to list such species under the ESA.
       States and Tribes receiving funds through this program are 
     encouraged to work with private landowners and organizations 
     representing agriculture, conservation science, and waterfowl 
     habitat enhancement to provide wetland habitat for at-risk 
     shorebirds, waterfowl, raptors and other species.

                         National Park Service


                 OPERATION OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM

       The agreement provides $2,477,969,000 for the Operation of 
     the National Park System and includes requested fixed costs. 
     The detailed allocation of funding by program area and 
     activity is included in the table at the end of this 
     division.
       Operation of the National Park System.--The bill does not 
     support reductions proposed in the budget request that would 
     diminish visitor services and reduce park and program 
     operations system-wide.
       Within Resource Stewardship, the Committees have restored 
     all proposed reductions to Everglades restoration efforts and 
     to complete restoration projects at newly established park 
     units. The recommendation also includes $3,000,000 to 
     continue zebra and quagga mussel containment, prevention, and 
     enforcement in western water bodies, and $500,000 for cave 
     and karst ecosystem research. The agreement continues the 
     directive provided within the Visitor Services line item 
     contained in House Report 115-238. The reduction from fiscal 
     year 2017 within Park Protection is for non-recurring 
     expenses related to the Presidential Inauguration. The 
     agreement includes $5,000,000 to support timely aviation 
     fleet replacement by the Washington, DC area U.S. Park Police 
     aviation unit which supports law enforcement and public 
     safety in the national capital region. Within Facility 
     Operations and Maintenance, the Committees have accepted the 
     Service's proposal to eliminate the Flex Park program in 
     order to focus resources on critical park operations and 
     programs. The agreement retains funding increases provided 
     within the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 to address 
     deferred maintenance needs and provides an additional 
     $15,000,000 to address cyclic maintenance needs, an 
     additional $10,000,000 for repair and rehabilitation 
     projects, and an additional $10,000,000 for project planning. 
     These funds are supplemented by $23,000,000 provided within 
     the Centennial Challenge matching grant program account 
     dedicated to funding joint public-private investments in 
     parks. Increases within Park Support are to address new 
     responsibilities and critical needs at park units including 
     but not limited to Freedom Riders, Castle Mountains, and 
     Birmingham Civil Rights units. The recommendation also 
     restores proposed reductions to park units including the 
     Manhattan Project National Historical Park and Honouliuli 
     units, and the Partnership Wild and Scenic River program. 
     Each are funded at the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. 
     Funding for the Roosevelt-Campobello International Park is 
     also maintained at the fiscal year 2017 enacted level.
       Quagga and Zebra Mussel Control.--The Committees remain 
     concerned about the spread of quagga and zebra mussels in the 
     West and have provided $3,000,000 for continued containment, 
     prevention, and enforcement efforts.
       Eastern Legacy Study (Lewis and Clark Trail Study).--The 
     Eastern Legacy Study, authorized to determine the feasibility 
     of extending the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, is 
     now four years overdue. The Committees direct the Service to 
     complete the study expeditiously.
       Mississippi National River and Recreation Area.--The 
     agreement maintains the directive related to the Mississippi 
     National River and Recreation Area contained in House Report 
     115-238.
       Elwha Water Facilities.--The agreement includes the 
     directive related to the Elwha Water Facilities contained in 
     House Report 115-238.
       Natchez Visitor Reception Center.--The Committees 
     understand that the Service is engaged in discussions with 
     Natchez, MS over accepting a donation of the Natchez Visitor 
     Reception Center and encourage the Service to reach agreement 
     on such donation in a timely fashion.
       National Park Service Local Hire Implementation.--Within 90 
     days of enactment of this Act, the Committees direct the 
     Service in cooperation with other relevant agencies to 
     provide a report on numbers of employees hired in Alaska with 
     the authorities under the Alaska National Interest Lands 
     Conservation Act (ANILCA).
       Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park.--The 
     agreement includes requested funding for the Blackstone River 
     Valley National Historical Park with the expectation that the 
     Service will continue to make funds available to the local 
     coordinating entity to maintain staffing and capacity to 
     assist in management of the park as authorized in Public Law 
     113-291.
       Cape Lookout National Seashore.--As the Service reviews the 
     Cape Lookout National Seashore's Off-Road Vehicle Management 
     Plan, the Committees expect the Service to adopt the least 
     restrictive land use option that allows adequate access to 
     the Seashore while maintaining sufficient protections for 
     wildlife and natural resources.
       National Trails System.--In preparation for the National 
     Trails System's 50-year anniversary in 2018, the Committees 
     urge the Service to make funding the construction and 
     maintenance of national trails a priority.
       Biscayne National Park.--The agreement maintains the 
     directive related to Biscayne National Park contained in 
     House Report 115-238.
       Everglades Restoration.--The Committees note the progress 
     made toward restoration of the Everglades ecosystem and 
     continue to support this multi-year effort to preserve one of 
     the great ecological treasures of the United States.
       Vicksburg National Military Park.--The agreement maintains 
     the directive related to Vicksburg National Military Park 
     contained in House Report 115-238.
       Arlington Memorial Bridge.--The Committees commend the 
     Department for its efforts, working with bipartisan Federal, 
     State, and local leaders, to secure $227,000,000 to 
     rehabilitate the Arlington Memorial Bridge, a historic and 
     critical transportation link in the nation's capital. As 
     awarded, the design-build contract will save $35,000,000 and 
     accelerate the project's completion by 18 months. Major 
     construction is scheduled to begin later in 2018.
       Ozark National Scenic Riverways.--The Service is directed 
     to work collaboratively with affected parties to ensure that 
     implementation of the General Management Plan for the Ozark 
     National Scenic Riverways addresses the concerns of affected 
     stakeholders including, but not limited to, local communities 
     and businesses.
       St. Anthony Falls Lock.--The agreement includes the 
     directive related to St. Anthony Falls Lock contained in 
     House Report 115-238.
       Yosemite Medical Clinic.--The agreement maintains the 
     directive related to the Yosemite Medical Clinic contained in 
     House Report 115-238.
       Director's Order 21.--Within 90 days of enactment of this 
     Act, the Service shall report to the Committees on steps it 
     has taken or plans to take in fiscal year 2018 to implement 
     Public Law 113-291.
       Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum.--The Committees 
     direct the Service to provide a report within 30 days of 
     enactment of this Act indicating what funds have been 
     allocated to the Memorial and options to provide the 
     remaining authorized amount.
       Alaska Hunting and Trapping.--The Committees are aware that 
     the National Park Service intends to initiate a rulemaking 
     process that will consider changes to the final rule 
     published October 23, 2015, related to hunting and trapping 
     in National Preserves in Alaska. This will include 
     identifying ways to address recreational hunting and fishing 
     cooperation, consultation, and communication with State of 
     Alaska wildlife managers. The Committees expect the Service 
     to complete the review in a timely manner.


                  NATIONAL RECREATION AND PRESERVATION

       The agreement provides $63,638,000 for National Recreation 
     and Preservation with the following specific directives:
       Natural Programs.--The Committees maintain funding for 
     Natural Programs, including the Chesapeake Gateways and 
     Trails program and Rivers, Trails and Conservation, at the 
     fiscal year 2017 enacted level.
       Cultural Programs.--The Committees provide $25,062,000 for 
     Cultural Programs, an increase of $500,000 above the enacted 
     level. The increase is provided for grants to nonprofit 
     organizations or institutions pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 4451(b). 
     The Committees direct the Department to consider funding the 
     Northwest Coast arts program as outlined by the memorandum of 
     agreement between the Institute of American Indian Arts and 
     the Sealaska Heritage Institute. Funding for the Native 
     American Graves Protection and Repatriation Grant Program and 
     the Japanese American Confinement Site Grant Program is 
     maintained at the fiscal year 2017 enacted level.
       Heritage Partnership Program.--The agreement provides 
     $20,321,000 for the Heritage Partnership Program. The 
     Committees continue to encourage individual heritage areas to 
     develop plans for long-term sufficiency. The Committees 
     commend the Alliance of National Heritage Areas, in response 
     to Congressional direction, for developing an allocation 
     model that maintains core services of more established areas 
     while proposing additional resources to newer areas. The 
     Committees note this progress and direct the Service to work 
     with heritage areas to further develop consensus toward a 
     sustainable funding distribution. As this effort continues, 
     the Committees expect the Service to distribute funds in the 
     same manner as fiscal year 2017 with the increase above the 
     enacted level to be equally distributed to Tier I areas or 
     Tier 2 areas currently receiving the minimum funding levels 
     of $150,000 and $300,000 respectively.
       Muscle Shoals National Heritage Area.--The Committees 
     encourage the continued partnership between the Muscle Shoals 
     Regional Center and the University of North Alabama.
       National Heritage Area Feasibility Study.--The Committees 
     understand that the Service has no intent to initiate or 
     conduct a feasibility study to establish a national heritage 
     area in Baca, Bent, Crowley, Huerfano, Kiowa, Las Animas, 
     Otero, Prowers, and Pueblo counties, Colorado. In the event 
     the Service alters its intentions, the Committees direct the 
     Service to notify the Committees 120 days in advance of 
     initiating such a study.

[[Page H2616]]

       American Battlefield Protection Program Assistance 
     Grants.--Funding is provided at the fiscal year 2017 enacted 
     level. The Committees recognize the importance of public-
     private partnerships to maintain the preservation of 
     America's battlefields and urge the Service to give priority 
     to projects with broad partner support. The Committees 
     continue to encourage the timely review and processing of 
     grants.


                       HISTORIC PRESERVATION FUND

       The agreement provides $96,910,000 for the Historic 
     Preservation Fund. Within this amount, $48,925,000 is 
     provided for grants to States and $11,485,000 is provided for 
     grants to Tribes. The recommendation also includes 
     $13,500,000 for competitive grants of which $500,000 is for 
     grants to underserved communities and $13,000,000 is for 
     competitive grants to document, interpret, and preserve 
     historical sites associated with the Civil Rights Movement. 
     The agreement also includes $5,000,000 for competitive grants 
     to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and 
     $13,000,000 for the Save America's Treasures competitive 
     grant program for preservation of nationally significant 
     sites, structures, and artifacts. The agreement also provides 
     $5,000,000 for preservation grants to revitalize historic 
     properties of national, State, and local significance. Grants 
     shall be made available to States, local governments, Tribes, 
     or community non-profit organizations for making sub-grants 
     to eligible projects. Priority shall be given to applicants 
     with a demonstrated capacity for allocating similar awards 
     for preservation of such sites. Prior to execution of these 
     funds, the Service shall submit a spend plan to the 
     Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate.


                              CONSTRUCTION

       The agreement provides $359,704,000 for Construction with 
     the following specific directive:
       Line Item Construction.--The agreement provides 
     $137,011,000 for line item construction and maintenance 
     including $129,011,000 for line item construction projects in 
     the fiscal year 2018 budget request as revised by the Service 
     and provided to the House and Senate Committees on 
     Appropriations on July 25, 2017, and shown in the table 
     below. A general program increase of $138,000,000 above the 
     request is provided to address only longstanding deferred 
     maintenance and major construction related requirements of 
     the Service. General management planning has been provided an 
     additional $1,860,000 above the request in order to 
     facilitate the completion of recently authorized special 
     resource studies. The Committees direct the Service to 
     provide no later than 60 days after enactment of this Act an 
     operating plan for allocation of funds. Requests for 
     reprogramming will be considered pursuant to the guidelines 
     in the front of this explanatory statement.

                 LAND ACQUISITION AND STATE ASSISTANCE

       The bill provides $180,941,000 for Land Acquisition and 
     State Assistance. The amounts provided by this bill compared 
     with the budget estimates by activity and project are shown 
     in the table below, listed in priority order pursuant to the 
     project list received for fiscal year 2018. The Committees 
     understand that donation projects, such as the Vicksburg 
     National Military Park listed on the NPS project list for 
     fiscal year 2018, are eligible to be funded from the amounts 
     included for donation projects. Funds provided for 
     recreational access are available to close gaps in national 
     trails, including the Ice Age, North Country, and New England 
     National Scenic Trails. The Committees urge the Service to 
     consider geographic distribution to ensure that investments 
     for the trail system are reflected in project prioritization. 
     Further instructions are contained under the Land and Water 
     Conservation Fund heading in the front of this explanatory 
     statement.
       The Committees continue to support the American Battlefield 
     Protection Program (ABPP) and are aware of the increased 
     workload and associated delays in grant processing due to the 
     program's expanded mission to include Revolutionary War and 
     War of 1812 sites and additional historic preservation 
     reviews. Therefore, the bill provides $10,000,000 for ABPP 
     grants and $252,000 is provided from within acquisition 
     management to ensure the timely awarding of grants.

                          centennial challenge

       The agreement provides $23,000,000 for the Centennial 
     Challenge matching grant program. The program provides 
     dedicated Federal funding to leverage partnerships for 
     signature projects and programs for the national park system. 
     The Committees expect these funds to be used by the Service 
     to address projects which have a deferred maintenance 
     component in order to alleviate the sizeable deferred 
     maintenance backlog within the national park system. A one-
     to-one matching requirement is required for projects to 
     qualify for these funds. The Service is urged to give 
     preference to projects that demonstrate additional leveraging 
     capacity from its partners. From amounts in the Centennial 
     Challenge account, the Committees encourage the Department to 
     make $3,000,000 available for critical programs and projects, 
     pursuant to 54 U.S.C. 1011 Subchapter II, subject to terms 
     and conditions outlined in Title VI of Public Law 114-289.


                    united states geological survey

                 surveys, investigations, and research

       The bill provides $1,148,457,000 for Surveys, 
     Investigations, and Research of the U.S. Geological Survey 
     (USGS, or the Survey). This includes additional, one-time 
     funding for the purchase of equipment, infrastructure related 
     projects, and deferred maintenance that should not be 
     considered programmatic increases and for which the 
     Committees expect a detailed spend plan within 180 days of 
     enactment of this Act. The detailed allocation of funding by 
     program area and activity is included in the table at the end 
     of this explanatory statement.
       Congressional Budget Justification.--The Committees direct 
     the Survey to include in future justifications base funding 
     and program descriptions for any subactivity, program, 
     project, or study proposed for increases or reductions.
       Ecosystems.--The agreement provides $157,732,000, and does 
     not include reductions for program terminations proposed in 
     the budget request for Status and Trends and the Wildlife 
     Program. The Survey is directed to formulate a transition 
     plan with the Smithsonian Institution regarding the curation 
     of the Institution's collection for which the Survey is 
     currently responsible.
       The agreement also includes an increase of $500,000 from 
     within available funds to address white-nose syndrome in 
     bats. The Committees are aware of the work the Survey is 
     performing in critical landscapes such as the Arctic, Puget 
     Sound, California Bay Delta, Everglades, Great Lakes, 
     Columbia River, and the Chesapeake Bay, and expect this work 
     to continue. The Terrestrial, Freshwater, and Marine 
     Environments program is funded as reported in House Report 
     115-238, and species-specific fisheries and Asian carp 
     funding are maintained at fiscal year 2017 enacted levels. 
     The Committees understand certain programs are nearing 
     completion; therefore, the Survey is directed to report back 
     to the Committees within 180 days of enactment of this Act on 
     anticipated balances of such programs.
       Land Resources.--The agreement provides $152,499,000, which 
     includes $93,094,000 for the National Land Imaging activity. 
     Within these funds, Landsat 9 is fully funded at a program 
     level of $26,200,000; satellite operations receive 
     $52,337,000; National Civil Applications Center receives 
     $4,847,000; and the AmericaView State grant program receives 
     $1,215,000.
       The Committees accept the proposed budget structure changes 
     with the understanding that the work previously funded in the 
     fiscal year 2017 structure will continue at fiscal year 2017 
     enacted levels and that the Survey will continue to track and 
     provide information on funding within the Land Change sub-

[[Page H2617]]

     lines. The Committees provide funding for the eight regional 
     science centers and grant awards should be made at the 
     negotiated annual agreement levels. The Survey is directed to 
     provide notification to the Committees as the grants are 
     awarded in full. As a result of the budget restructure, 
     $5,025,000 is provided so that work previously funded under 
     the old budget structure will continue within the Land Change 
     Science subactivity.
       Energy, Minerals, and Environmental Health.--The agreement 
     provides $102,838,000 for Energy, Minerals, and Environmental 
     Health, including $1,000,000 toward the domestic mineral base 
     survey and $4,700,000 for the implementation of Secretarial 
     Order 3352. As a result of the budget restructure, $1,477,000 
     is provided for work previously funded at this level in 
     fiscal year 2017 and now funded under the Mineral and Energy 
     Resources subactivity. The Committees accept the $2,457,000 
     reduction proposed in the budget due to the completion of 
     reports as required by the Energy Independence and Security 
     Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140). The Committees expect geologic 
     and biologic research to continue under the new budget 
     restructure.
       The Committees continue geophysical and remote sensing 
     activities at the enacted funding levels and direct the 
     Survey to continue this work following the requirements 
     outlined in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 
     115-31). The Committees also expect low permeability 
     reservoir assessments to continue at the 2017 enacted level 
     and that the Survey will continue to abide by the directive 
     outlined in Public Law 115-31 concerning consultation with 
     State geological surveys.
       The agreement provides $12,398,000 for toxic substances 
     hydrology. The Committees support the Survey's comprehensive 
     research on cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms and provide 
     an increase of $1,350,000 over the fiscal year 2017 enacted 
     level for this effort.
       Natural Hazards.--The agreement provides $178,613,000 for 
     the Natural Hazards Program, including $83,403,000 for 
     earthquake hazards. Within this funding, $12,900,000 is 
     provided for continued development of an earthquake early 
     warning (EEW) system and for the first limited public rollout 
     of ShakeAlert, and an additional $10,000,000 is provided for 
     capital costs associated with the buildout of the EEW. Within 
     60 days of enactment of this Act, the Survey is directed to 
     provide to the Committees an updated Technical Implementation 
     Plan for the ShakeAlert Production System, including revised 
     cost estimates and timelines. Additionally, $5,000,000 is 
     provided for necessary upgrades and replacement equipment at 
     the USGS National Earthquake Center and seismic stations that 
     make up the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS).
       The agreement includes $800,000 for the Central and Eastern 
     U.S. Seismic Network (CEUSN). The Committees continue 
     $1,000,000 for regional seismic networks and expect the 
     Survey to allocate funds according to the same methodology 
     used in fiscal year 2017. The agreement includes $1,400,000 
     for the adoption of seismic stations currently deployed as 
     part of the Earthscope USArray project. The Committees direct 
     the Survey to consult with the National Science Foundation 
     (NSF) on acquiring these seismic stations beginning in fiscal 
     year 2019 and to brief the Committees within 60 days of 
     enactment of this Act on the progress of these discussions 
     and the plan to acquire the stations. The Committees 
     understand the adoption of the seismic and geodetic stations 
     currently deployed as part of the USArray project, along with 
     the ANSS investments in seismic monitoring, could contribute 
     to a monitoring network similar to the earthquake early 
     warning system currently under development for the west coast 
     and encourage the Survey to consider this effort once the 
     west coast system is close to completion.
       The agreement provides $42,621,000 for volcano hazards, 
     which includes $1,000,000 for next-generation lahar detection 
     systems and $13,000,000 for the repair and upgrade of analog 
     systems on high-threat volcanos, including $12,500,000 to 
     update the instrumentation that is currently not in 
     compliance with the National Telecommunication and 
     Information Administration (NTIA) radio spectrum guidelines.
       The agreement provides an additional $1,500,000 for new 
     lahar detection instrumentation and telecommunications 
     equipment to address significant lahar threats and meet 
     National Volcano Early Warning System (NVEWS) standards.
       The Committees are concerned about the potential landslide 
     risk to communities and direct the Survey to report back 
     within 180 days of enactment of this Act identifying specific 
     areas of the country that are at the highest risk.
       Water Resources.--The agreement provides $217,554,000 for 
     Water Resources, with $59,927,000 directed to activities 
     associated with the Cooperative Matching Funds. Increases 
     include an additional $1,000,000 for groundwater resource 
     studies in the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain; $1,500,000 
     for streamgages; and $300,000 to begin research on shallow 
     and fractured bedrock terrain.
       The National Groundwater Monitoring Network is funded at 
     the fiscal year 2017 enacted level of $3,600,000. The 
     agreement includes funding for the streamgage on 
     transboundary rivers at $120,000. The Committees direct the 
     Survey to partner with local Tribes and other Federal 
     agencies as necessary in the area to develop a water quality 
     strategy for the transboundary rivers impacted by mining 
     activities. Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, the 
     Survey is directed to report back to the Committees on the 
     necessary work needed to collect, analyze, and assess the 
     hydrologic, water-quality, and ecological data needed to 
     document baseline conditions and assess potential mining-
     related impacts.
       Core Science Systems.--The agreement provides $116,302,000, 
     which includes $23,000,000 for 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) 
     National Enhancement and $7,722,000 for Alaska Mapping and 
     Map Modernization.
       Facilities.--The agreement includes $120,091,000 for 
     facilities, deferred maintenance and capital improvement. 
     Within these amounts, $11,772,000 is included for the Menlo 
     Park facility transition. The Committees have almost doubled 
     the funding for deferred maintenance with the expectation the 
     Survey will be able to make much needed facility 
     improvements. The Committees understand that a report on the 
     National Wildlife Health Center's infrastructure needs is 
     nearing completion and expect the report to be provided to 
     the Committees within 60 days of enactment of this Act.

                   Bureau of Ocean Energy Management


                        OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT

       The bill provides $171,000,000 for Ocean Energy Management 
     to be partially offset with the collection of rental receipts 
     and cost recovery fees totaling $56,834,000, for a net 
     discretionary appropriation of $114,166,000. The bill does 
     not include a rescission of funds to cover the anticipated 
     shortfall from the loss of revenue, but the Committees are 
     monitoring the continued decline in rental receipts. The 
     Bureau is reminded to review the directives contained in the 
     front matter of this explanatory statement. The agreement 
     includes the following additional guidance:
       Five-year lease plan.--The request for the Bureau's efforts 
     to initiate a new five year offshore leasing program is fully 
     funded and the Committees encourage an expeditious and 
     thorough review.
       Offshore Revenues.--The Committees do not approve of the 
     proposal in the budget request to divert outer continental 
     shelf oil and gas revenues from Gulf of Mexico coastal 
     communities. The Committees direct the Department to 
     distribute revenues from Gulf of Mexico operations in a 
     manner consistent with the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act 
     of 2006 (P.L. 109-432).
       Offshore Wind Energy Development.--The Committees 
     understand that the Bureau is continuing to work in North 
     Carolina with local stakeholders, industry, and State task 
     forces and that there will be no lease sales for offshore 
     areas in North Carolina during fiscal year 2018.
       Renewable Energy.--The Bureau should continue to follow the 
     direction under this heading in Senate Report 114-281 
     concerning offshore wind energy and working cooperatively 
     with the Department of Energy and coastal States.


             BUREAU OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT

             OFFSHORE SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT

       The bill provides $186,411,000 for Offshore Safety and 
     Environmental Enforcement to be partially offset with the 
     collection of rental receipts, cost recovery fees and 
     inspection fees totaling $77,871,000 for a net discretionary 
     appropriation of $108,540,000. The bill does not include a 
     rescission of funds to cover the anticipated shortfall from 
     the loss of revenue, but the Committees are monitoring the 
     continued decline in rental receipts.


                           OIL SPILL RESEARCH

       The bill provides $14,899,000 for Oil Spill Research.


          OFFICE OF SURFACE MINING RECLAMATION AND ENFORCEMENT

                       REGULATION AND TECHNOLOGY

       The bill provides $115,804,000 for the Office of Surface 
     Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) Regulation and 
     Technology account. Within this amount, the bill funds 
     regulatory grants at $68,590,000, equal to the fiscal year 
     2017 enacted level.
       Approximate Original Contours.--When appropriate, the 
     Committees encourage OSMRE to discontinue cases related to 
     Approximate Original Contour policies and regulations when 
     OSMRE has lost the initial administrative court case on the 
     merits of the case.


                    ABANDONED MINE RECLAMATION FUND

       The bill provides $139,672,000 for the Abandoned Mine 
     Reclamation Fund. Of the funds provided, $24,672,000 shall be 
     derived from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and 
     $115,000,000 shall be derived from the General Fund.
       The agreement provides $115,000,000 for grants to States 
     and Indian Tribes for the reclamation of abandoned mine lands 
     in conjunction with economic and community development and 
     reuse goals. Consistent with fiscal year 2017, $75,000,000 
     shall be distributed in equal amounts to the three 
     Appalachian States with the greatest amount of unfunded needs 
     and $30,000,000 shall be distributed in equal amounts to the 
     three Appalachian States with the subsequent greatest amount 
     of unfunded needs. Grants shall be distributed to States with 
     the same goals, intent and direction as in fiscal year 2017.
       The Committees believe that Tribes can also contribute to 
     the success of the pilot and provide $10,000,000 for grants 
     to federally recognized Indian Tribes to be distributed for 
     the same goals, intent and purpose as the

[[Page H2618]]

     grants to States. Eligible grant recipients for the 
     $10,000,000 are limited to Tribal governmental entities who 
     may subcontract project-related activities as appropriate.
       Coal Act.--The Committees believe OSMRE should avoid taking 
     any action that would place in jeopardy the mandatory 
     benefits for eligible United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) 
     health beneficiaries, including those who receive benefits 
     because of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 
     115-31), as well as mandatory funds provided to States and 
     Indian Tribes. It has also been brought to the attention of 
     the Committees that certain businesses in rural areas may 
     face job losses because of affiliate liability for healthcare 
     that is unrelated to the benefits enacted in the Consolidated 
     Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). Given the 
     disproportionate impact of job losses in rural areas, the 
     Committees are concerned about those job losses. The 
     Committees urge stakeholders to find a solution that would 
     both avoid job losses in rural areas and is consistent with 
     other potential needs for the mandatory funds overseen by 
     OSMRE.


        BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AND BUREAU OF INDIAN EDUCATION

                      OPERATION OF INDIAN PROGRAMS

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

       The bill provides $2,411,200,000 for Operation of Indian 
     Programs. The Bureaus are expected to execute their budgets 
     in accordance with the justification submitted to the 
     Congress, except as otherwise directed below or in the 
     funding allocation table at the end of this report. The table 
     has been expanded to include additional lines for the Bureau 
     of Indian Education and Public Safety and Justice. The 
     Bureaus are reminded of the guidance and reporting 
     requirements contained in House Report 115-238 that should be 
     complied with unless specifically addressed to the contrary 
     herein, as explained in the front matter of this explanatory 
     statement. The Committees also expect the timely submission 
     of reporting requirements as contained in House Report 115-
     238 and as outlined in this explanatory statement. The 
     agreement includes requested fixed costs and transfers except 
     where discussed below, and the following details and 
     instructions.
       The Committees are concerned about the addition of several 
     programs to the Government Accountability Office's 2017 high 
     risk list (GAO-17-317). The inclusion of these programs to 
     this list indicate there are several challenges to overcome 
     in order to improve the Federal management of programs that 
     serve Tribes and their members. The Committees stand ready to 
     work with the Bureaus to implement the necessary GAO 
     recommendations.
       Tribal Government.--The agreement provides $317,967,000 for 
     Tribal government programs, of which $1,120,000 is for new 
     Tribes including those recognized during fiscal year 2018 
     beyond those contemplated in the budget request. The 
     Committees expect the Bureau to efficiently administer the 
     Tribal recognition process and strongly encourage action on 
     pending requests. The Small and Needy Tribes program is 
     funded at $4,448,000, ensuring that all Tribes receive the 
     maximum base level provided by the Bureau to run Tribal 
     governments.
       Road maintenance is funded at $34,653,000 and includes 
     $1,000,000 to improve the condition of unpaved roads and 
     bridges used by school buses transporting students, and 
     $1,000,000 for road maintenance in support of implementing 
     the NATIVE Act (P.L. 114-221). The Bureau is directed to 
     report back to the Committees within 60 days of enactment of 
     this Act on how the Bureau plans to allocate the funds 
     provided in the bill and the progress being made to implement 
     the GAO recommendations outlined in the report GAO-17-423.
       The Committees are aware that in some areas along the 
     border, including the areas of the Tohono O'odham Nation in 
     Arizona, and the Blackfeet Nation in Montana, U.S. Customs 
     and Border Protection (CBP) and Tribes work together on 
     border security. The Committees have included bill language 
     to support the transfer of funds from CBP to BIA, in 
     consultation with affected Tribes, for the reconstruction or 
     repair of BIA owned roads needed as a result of cooperative 
     security efforts on the U.S. border.
       The Committees are concerned about the Consolidated Tribal 
     Government Program internal transfer of $1,733,000 and have 
     not agreed to any changes from the fiscal year 2017 enacted 
     level of $75,429,000 for this program. The Bureau is directed 
     to report back to the Committees within 30 days of enactment 
     of this Act with a description of the number of Tribes that 
     use this program and how increases for this program compare 
     to others that offer similar services.
       Human Services.--The agreement provides $161,063,000 for 
     human services programs and includes funding to continue the 
     Tiwahe initiative at the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. The 
     Bureau is directed to report back to the Committees within 90 
     days of enactment of this Act on the performance measures 
     being used to monitor and track the Tiwahe initiative's 
     effectiveness in Indian Country. The Committees are aware of 
     the pressing needs women and children face in domestic 
     violence situations; therefore, the Committees expect at 
     least $200,000 from human services activities be used to 
     support women and children's shelters that are serving the 
     needs of multiple Tribes or Alaska Native Villages in the 
     areas served by the Tiwahe pilot sites.
       The Committees are concerned about the funding distribution 
     for welfare assistance and direct the Bureau to report back 
     to the Committees within 30 days of enactment of this Act on 
     how this funding would be distributed.
       Trust--Natural Resources Management.--The agreement 
     provides $204,202,000 for natural resources management 
     programs and includes $390,000 to continue the Seminole and 
     Miccosukee water study as requested. The agreement includes 
     $355,000 in the Tribal Management Development Program (TMDP) 
     for fisheries activities previously funded within the 
     Forestry program. Future funding requests should reflect the 
     transfer of this activity to TMDP.
       It is the Committees' understanding that the Bureau has 
     entered into cooperative agreements with the Ahtna 
     Intertribal Resource Commission and the Kuskokwim River 
     Inter-Tribal Fisheries Commission, and with other 
     organizations interested in establishing similar agreements; 
     therefore, it is the Committees' expectation that within the 
     funding provided for the Tribal Management Development 
     Program (TMDP), pilot projects and programs for Alaska 
     subsistence will continue.
       Consistent with treaty and trust obligations, the 
     Committees direct the Bureau to work with at-risk Tribes to 
     identify and expedite the necessary resources to address the 
     resiliency needs of Tribal communities.
       Within the amounts provided for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, 
     the agreement continues $545,000 for substantially producing 
     Tribal hatcheries in BIA's Northwest Region currently not 
     receiving annual BIA hatchery operations funding. This 
     funding should be allocated in the same manner as in fiscal 
     year 2017 but should be considered base funding in fiscal 
     year 2018 and thereafter.
       The Department of the Interior is expected to promote and 
     expand the use of agreements with Indian Tribes to protect 
     Indian trust resources from catastrophic wildfire, insect and 
     disease infestation, or other threats from adjacent Federal 
     lands, as authorized by law. The Committees direct the Bureau 
     to coordinate with the Office of Wildland Fire to submit a 
     report describing how the Department determines the use of 
     wildfire suppression and rehabilitation resources and 
     prioritizes Indian forest land, the title to which is held by 
     the United States in trust.
       The Bureau is directed to enter into a formal partnership 
     with local Tribes and the United States Geological Survey to 
     help develop a water quality strategy for transboundary 
     rivers.
       The Committees expect that Tribes east of the Mississippi 
     River who have resource challenges also receive appropriate 
     funding.
       Trust--Real Estate Services.--The agreement provides 
     $129,841,000 for real estate services. All program elements 
     within this subactivity are continued at fiscal year 2017 
     enacted levels plus fixed costs and transfers, except where 
     discussed below.
       The following line items each receive a $500,000 program 
     increase: land title and records offices; land records 
     improvement--regional; and regional oversight. The Bureau is 
     expected to distribute the program increases to regional 
     offices to address administrative backlogs for Trust Real 
     Estate Services programs. As discussed in House Report 115-
     238, the Committees expect an update on the status of 
     outstanding conveyances by September 2018, and an update on 
     what the Bureau will be changing in its operations policy to 
     ensure backlogs and documentation-related rejections do not 
     occur in the future.
       Alaska Native programs are funded at $1,470,000 to support 
     a program level of $450,000 for the ANCSA Historical Places 
     and Cemetery Sites Program.
       A program increase of $3,000,000 is included for the 
     plugging of abandoned wells not under Bureau of Land 
     Management authority. The Committees direct the BIA to 
     conduct an inventory of wells for which the BIA is 
     responsible to reclaim, including cost estimates for 
     submission to the Committees within 180 days of enactment of 
     this Act.
       The Committees direct the Secretary, or his designee, to 
     work with the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe to identify 
     appropriate lands in Clallam County, Washington, to satisfy 
     the requirements of section 7 of the Elwha River Ecosystem 
     and Fisheries Restoration Act (P.L. 102-495).
       The Secretary, in consultation with other interested 
     agencies, is directed to provide a report to Congress, on or 
     before August 1, 2018, on the estimated cost of responses 
     that are necessary under applicable Federal and State laws to 
     protect human health and the environment with respect to any 
     hazardous substance or hazardous waste remaining on the 
     property as authorized by section 13 of Public Law 102-497.
       Public Safety and Justice.--The agreement provides 
     $405,520,000 for public safety and justice programs. The 
     detailed allocation table at the end of this explanatory 
     statement has been expanded in order to more fully outline 
     program levels. Included within Criminal Investigations and 
     Police Services is $1,000,000 to implement the Native 
     American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and 
     $7,500,000 to help people affected by opioid addiction. 
     Within Detention/Corrections is a $1,400,000 increase for 
     recently constructed facilities that do not currently have 
     existing program funding within the BIA budget; additional 
     funding in future years will be considered as information 
     becomes available. Within Law Enforcement Special Initiatives 
     is $3,033,000 to reduce recidivism through the Tiwahe 
     initiative. Within Tribal Justice Support is $2,000,000 to 
     implement the Violence Against Women Act for both training

[[Page H2619]]

     and specific Tribal court needs, and $13,000,000 to address 
     the needs of Tribes affected by Public Law 83-280. Within Law 
     Enforcement Program Management is a $500,000 increase for the 
     Office of Justice Services' District III Office to promote 
     timely payments.
       The Committees remain concerned about Tribal courts' needs 
     as identified in the Indian Law and Order Commission's 
     November 2013 report, which notes that Federal investment in 
     Tribal justice in ``P.L. 280'' States has been more limited 
     than elsewhere in Indian Country. The Committees expect the 
     Bureau to continue to work with Tribes and Tribal 
     organizations in these States to consider options that 
     promote, design, or pilot Tribal court systems for Tribal 
     communities subject to full or partial State jurisdiction 
     under Public Law 83-280.
       The Committees understand that several Tribes whose Federal 
     recognition was terminated and then subsequently restored now 
     face significant challenges in securing law enforcement 
     funding through self-determination contracts. The Bureau is 
     directed to work with affected Tribes to assess their law 
     enforcement needs and submit a report within 120 days of 
     enactment of this Act that details the amounts necessary to 
     provide sufficient law enforcement capacity for them.
       Community and Economic Development.--The agreement provides 
     $46,447,000 for community and economic development programs, 
     of which: $12,549,000 is for job placement and training and 
     includes $1,550,000 for the Tiwahe initiative; $1,826,000 is 
     for economic development; $26,416,000 is for minerals and 
     mining and includes $1,000,000 for the modernization of oil 
     and gas records including the National Indian Oil and Gas 
     Management System (NIOGEMS); and $5,656,000 is for community 
     development central oversight, of which $3,400,000 is to 
     implement the Native American Tourism and Improving Visitor 
     Experience Act, including via cooperative agreements with 
     Tribes or Tribal organizations. The Committees understand 
     that the NIOGEMS has been distributed to some Tribes and 
     regional offices; the Bureau is instructed to report back 
     within 120 days of enactment of this Act on the cost to 
     further expand this system to more reservations and offices.
       The recent high risk GAO report (GAO-17-317) found the 
     Bureau does not properly manage Indian energy resources. The 
     Committees request the Bureau to report back within 180 days 
     of enactment of this Act outlining any barriers, statutory or 
     regulatory, that impede development of these resources.
       Executive Direction and Administrative Services.--The 
     agreement provides $231,747,000 for executive direction and 
     administrative services. All budget line items are funded at 
     fiscal year 2017 enacted levels and adjusted for fixed costs 
     and transfers, except for human capital management and intra-
     governmental payments, which are funded at the requested 
     levels.
       Within 60 days on enactment of this Act, the Bureau is 
     directed to make funds provided within executive direction 
     available to solicit proposals from independent non-profit or 
     academic entities to prepare a report on the likely impacts 
     of the closure of the Navajo Generating Station power plant 
     on affected Tribes, State and local governments and other 
     stakeholders within the Four Corners region. In consultation 
     with impacted Tribes, an entity shall be selected to prepare 
     a report within 12 months of the award that (1) details 
     potential economic impacts related to the plant's closure; 
     and (2) identifies specific policy recommendations that would 
     mitigate the potential economic and societal consequences of 
     the plant's closure on affected Tribes or other stakeholders.
       The Committees note that the Bureau has not yet complied 
     with the fiscal year 2017 directive to provide a report on 
     funding requirements associated with operating and law 
     enforcement needs for congressionally authorized treaty 
     fishing sites on the Columbia River. The Bureau is directed 
     to transmit the report no later than 30 days following 
     enactment of this Act. The Bureau is also urged to 
     incorporate unfunded needs for these sites as part of future 
     budget requests.
       Indian Affairs is directed to complete annual health and 
     safety inspections and background checks at all BIE system 
     facilities, and to submit quarterly updates on the status of 
     such efforts to the Committees.
       Bureau of Indian Education.--The agreement includes 
     $914,413,000 for the Bureau of Indian Education, the details 
     of which are included in the expanded allocation table at the 
     end of this explanatory statement. Tribal grant support costs 
     continue to be fully funded. Additional details follow:
       A one-time increase is provided to complete the transition 
     to a school year funding cycle for all Tribal colleges and 
     universities, including Haskell Indian Nations University and 
     Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute. The Committees 
     recognize that many Tribal colleges have significant unfunded 
     needs, and direct the Bureau to work with Tribal leaders and 
     other stakeholders to develop a consistent methodology for 
     determining Tribal college operating needs to inform future 
     budget requests. The Committees expect the methodology to 
     address operating and infrastructure needs including 
     classrooms and housing.
       The agreement includes $18,810,000 for early child and 
     family development, which should be used to expand the Family 
     and Child Education (FACE) program. The agreement rescinds 
     $8,000,000 from expiring prior year balances that the Bureau 
     failed to obligate. This rescission does not impact the 
     program's operating level for fiscal year 2018.
       The Committees support efforts to revitalize and maintain 
     Native languages and expand the use of language immersion 
     programs. The ISEP program is expected to continue to enhance 
     access to Native language and culture programs in Bureau-
     funded schools, and the Bureau shall report back within 60 
     days of enactment of this Act on how funding has been and can 
     continue to be used to support these programs. In addition, 
     $2,000,000 is provided within Education Program Enhancements 
     for capacity building grants for Bureau and tribally operated 
     schools to expand existing language immersion programs or to 
     create new programs. Prior to distributing these funds, the 
     Bureau shall coordinate with the Department of Education and 
     Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that Bureau 
     investments complement, but do not duplicate, existing 
     language immersion programs. The Committees also direct the 
     Bureau to submit a report to the Committees within 120 days 
     of enactment of this Act regarding the status of fiscal year 
     2017 funds and the planned distribution of funds in this Act.
       The Johnson O'Malley program is funded at $14,903,000. The 
     Committees remain concerned that the distribution of funds is 
     not an accurate reflection of the distribution of students. 
     The Bureau is directed to report back to the Committees 
     within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the status of 
     updating the student counts.
       The Committees remain concerned about recent Government 
     Accountability Office (GAO) reports detailing problems within 
     the K-12 Indian education system at the Department of the 
     Interior, in particular as they pertain to organizational 
     structure, accountability, finance, health and safety, and 
     ultimately student performance. As the Department takes steps 
     to reform the system, the Secretary is reminded that future 
     support from Congress will continue to be based in large part 
     upon successful implementation of GAO report recommendations. 
     In particular, consistent with GAO report 13-774, the 
     Secretary is urged to reorganize Indian Affairs so that 
     control and accountability of the BIE system is consolidated 
     within the BIE, to present such reorganization proposal in 
     the next fiscal year budget request, and to submit to the 
     Committees a corresponding updated workforce plan. Consistent 
     with GAO testimonies 15-389T, 15-539T, 15-597T, and any 
     subsequent reports, the Secretary is urged to personally 
     oversee immediate actions necessary to ensure the continued 
     health and safety of students and employees at BIE schools 
     and facilities. The Office of the Assistant Secretary-Indian 
     Affairs is directed to report back within 60 days of 
     enactment of this Act on the progress made towards 
     implementing all the GAO recommendations and the current 
     status of the reform effort.
       The Committees understand the importance of bringing 
     broadband to reservations and villages, but remain concerned 
     about the planning process used for this type of investment. 
     The Committees direct the agency to report back within 90 
     days of enactment of this Act on a scalable plan to increase 
     bandwidth in schools, procure computers and software, and to 
     include in this report how the Bureau is working with other 
     Federal agencies to coordinate and plan for the technology 
     buildout.
       The BIE is encouraged to coordinate with the Indian Health 
     Service to integrate preventive dental care and mental health 
     care at schools within the BIE system.
       The bill includes modified language limiting the expansion 
     of grades and schools in the BIE system which allows for the 
     expansion of additional grades to schools that meet certain 
     criteria.
       The Committees continue to encourage efforts to improve 
     interagency coordination for the wide range of programs that 
     affect the wellbeing of Native children and expect the Bureau 
     to work with relevant Federal, State, local and Tribal 
     organizations to make these programs more effective.
       The Committees are concerned by the recent Government 
     Accountability Office report (GAO-17-423) on Tribal 
     transportation, which identified potential negative impacts 
     of road conditions on Native student school attendance. The 
     Committees recommend BIE take steps to improve its data 
     collection on the cause of student absences, including data 
     on road and weather conditions, and to report back to the 
     Committees within 120 days of enactment of this Act regarding 
     its actions to improve student absence data tracking and 
     analysis.


                         CONTRACT SUPPORT COSTS

       The bill provides an indefinite appropriation for contract 
     support costs, consistent with fiscal year 2017 and estimated 
     to be $241,600,000.


                              CONSTRUCTION

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

       The bill provides $354,113,000 for Construction. Details 
     are contained in the justification submitted to the Congress 
     and in the funding allocation table at the end of this 
     explanatory statement, except as otherwise discussed below:
       Account-wide.--Not later than 90 days after enactment of 
     this Act, Indian Affairs shall submit an operating plan to 
     the Committees detailing how fiscal year 2018 funding will be 
     allocated and including specific projects where available and 
     the methodology used in the prioritization. Where specific 
     project allocations are not yet available, the plan shall 
     provide the circumstances and Indian Affairs shall brief the

[[Page H2620]]

     Committees when project allocations are available.
       Joint Ventures.--Indian Affairs is expected to comply with 
     the directive in House Report 115-238 regarding the 
     establishment of joint venture programs for schools and 
     justice centers and modeled after the Indian Health Service's 
     program.
       Education Construction.--The agreement provides 
     $238,245,000 for schools and related facilities within the 
     Bureau of Indian Education system and includes the following: 
     $105,504,000 for replacement school campus construction; 
     $23,935,000 for replacement facility construction; 
     $13,574,000 for employee housing repair; and $95,232,000 for 
     facilities improvement and repair. The Committees expect the 
     increase provided for facilities improvement and repair to be 
     used to address deficiencies identified by annual school 
     safety inspections.
       The Committees continue to expect BIA and BIE to work 
     together to ensure that annual safety inspections are 
     completed for all BIE schools and remain concerned that the 
     Bureaus have not developed concrete tracking and capacity-
     building systems to ensure that safety issues flagged by 
     these inspections are addressed in a timely manner. The 
     Committees are also concerned by reports from tribally 
     operated schools that BIE is not providing necessary training 
     or access to funding from the Facilities Improvement and 
     Repair program to meet urgent safety and maintenance needs. 
     The Committees direct BIE and BIA to provide an 
     implementation plan to the Committees to address these 
     concerns within 120 days of enactment of this Act.
       The Bureau of Indian Education is directed to report back 
     within 60 days of enactment of this Act on the progress the 
     Bureau has made towards implementing a long-term facilities 
     needs assessment modeled after the Department of Defense 
     Education Activity, as directed by House Report 114-632.
       The Committees continue to strongly support innovative 
     financing options to supplement annual appropriations and 
     accelerate repair and replacement of Bureau schools, 
     including through the use of construction bonds, tax credits, 
     and grant programs.
       Public Safety and Justice Construction.--The agreement 
     provides $35,309,000 for public safety and justice 
     construction and includes the following: $18,000,000 to 
     restart the facilities replacement and new construction 
     program; $4,494,000 for employee housing; $9,372,000 for 
     facilities improvement and repair; $169,000 for fire safety 
     coordination; and $3,274,000 for fire protection.
       The Committees include funding for the replacement 
     construction program, which has not received funding from the 
     Bureau since fiscal year 2010, as other agencies have sought 
     to build these facilities. The Committees also understand the 
     Bureau currently has compiled a list of replacement 
     facilities based upon the facilities condition index, inmate 
     populations, and available space. It is the expectation the 
     funding made available for this activity will utilize this 
     list. Further, the Committees encourage the Bureau to develop 
     a master plan that details the location and condition of 
     existing facilities relative to the user population, and 
     incorporates the use of existing tribally constructed 
     facilities and regional justice centers, such as the 
     Shoshone-Bannock Tribes' Justice Center, as an efficient 
     approach to filling gaps where additional facilities are 
     needed. Reasonable driving distances for visitation should be 
     taken into consideration.
       Resources Management Construction.--The agreement provides 
     $67,192,000 for resources management construction programs 
     and includes the following: $24,692,000 for irrigation 
     project construction; $2,596,000 for engineering and 
     supervision; $1,016,000 for survey and design; $648,000 for 
     Federal power compliance; and $38,240,000 for dam safety and 
     maintenance.
       The Committees are aware of the aging Indian irrigation 
     systems and that most of these systems are in need of major 
     capital improvement; therefore, additional funding has been 
     included to address the infrastructure needs. Additionally, 
     it is the Committees' understanding that these projects are 
     consistent with those activities authorized as part of the 
     Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (P.L. 
     114-322).
       The Committees are concerned that there are an unknown 
     number of dams on reservations that have not received a 
     hazard classification, and that the current review process is 
     behind schedule. The Committees strongly encourage the Bureau 
     to begin the work on these dams and report back to the 
     Committees on the best way to effectively quantify the 
     potential pool of dams on reservations in need of a review 
     and/or classification.
       Other Program Construction.--The agreement provides 
     $13,367,000 for other programs and includes the following: 
     $1,119,000 for telecommunications; $3,919,000 for facilities 
     and quarters; and $8,329,000 for program management, 
     including $2,400,000 to continue the project at Fort Peck.

     watershed-focused pilot program to eradicate tamarisk in the 
     southwestern United States.
       Departmental Documents.--The Committees remind the 
     Department of the need in departmental documents that 
     delineate Federal, State, and private land, such as 
     acquisition boundary maps and resource management plans, to 
     more clearly indicate that Federal land management documents 
     apply only to Federal lands and do not apply to private land 
     unless authorized by law and approved by the landowner.
       Tribal Energy Development.--The Committees direct the 
     Secretary to provide a report to the Committees within 90 
     days of enactment of this Act on efforts to improve the 
     ability of Tribes to develop energy resources on tribal 
     lands. Such report should address any potential obstacles, 
     including statutory or regulatory, to full resource 
     utilization.
       Conservation Partnerships.--The Committees continue to 
     support the partnership between the Department and the 21st 
     Century Conservation Service Corps and Public Lands Corps 
     which engage youth and veterans in protecting, restoring, and 
     enhancing America's great outdoors.
       Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT).--The agreement includes

     fiscal year 2018 in Section 118 of Title I General 
     Provisions.
       National Park Fees.--The Secretary is directed to provide 
     to the Committees within 60 days of enactment of this Act a 
     report analyzing the Administration's October 24, 2017 
     proposal to raise national park entry fees. Such report must 
     include a cost benefit analysis and evaluation of the impact 
     on accessibility to the parks.

     is directed to continue to award noncompetitive technical 
     assistance funds to support investments in civic education 
     programs for Insular Area students.
       U.S. Virgin Islands Hurricane Impacts.--The Committees 
     continue to be concerned about the catastrophic impacts of 
     Hurricane Irma to the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Committees 
     recognize that the Office will play an important role in 
     long-term disaster recovery and direct the Office to continue 
     to provide information to the Committees on recovery needs.

               TITLE II--ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

       The bill provides $8,058,488,000 for the Environmental 
     Protection Agency (EPA). The bill does not support reductions 
     proposed in the budget request unless explicitly noted in the 
     explanatory statement.
       Congressional Budget Justification.--The Agency is directed 
     to continue to include the information requested in House 
     Report 112-331 and any proposals to change State allocation 
     formulas that affect the distribution of appropriated funds 
     in future budget justifications.
       Reprogramming and Workforce Reshaping.--The agreement does 
     not include any of the requested funds for workforce 
     reshaping. Further, the Committees do not expect the Agency 
     to consolidate or close any regional offices in fiscal year 
     2018. The Agency is held to the reprogramming limitation of 
     $1,000,000 and should continue to follow the reprogramming 
     directives as provided in the front of this explanatory 
     statement. It is noted that such reprogramming directives 
     apply to proposed reorganizations, workforce restructure, 
     reshaping, transfer of functions, or downsizing, especially 
     those of significant national or regional importance, and 
     include closures, consolidations, and relocations of offices, 
     facilities, and laboratories.
       Further, the Agency may not use any amount of deobligated 
     funds to initiate a new program, office, or initiative, 
     without the prior approval of the Committees. Within 30 days 
     of enactment of this Act, the Agency is directed to submit to 
     the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations its annual 
     operating plan for fiscal year 2018, which shall detail how 
     the Agency plans to allocate funds at the program project 
     level.
       Other.--It is noted that the current workforce is below the 
     fiscal year 2017 level, therefore, the agreement includes 
     rescissions in the Science and Technology and Environmental 
     Programs and Management accounts that capture expected 
     savings associated with such changes. The Agency is directed 
     to first apply the rescissions across program project areas 
     to reflect routine attrition that will occur in those program 
     project areas in fiscal year 2018 and then to reflect 
     efficiency savings in a manner that seeks, to the extent 
     practicable, to be proportional among program project areas. 
     Amounts provided in this Act are sufficient to fully fund 
     Agency payroll estimates. The Committees understand that the 
     Agency routinely makes funding payroll requirements a top 
     priority, and the Committees expect the Agency will continue 
     to do so as it executes its fiscal year 2018 appropriation 
     and applies the rescissions.
       The Committees do not expect the Agency will undertake 
     adverse personnel actions or incentive programs to comply 
     with the rescissions nor do the Committees expect the Agency 
     will undertake large-scale adverse personnel actions or 
     incentive programs in fiscal year 2018. As specified in the 
     bill language, the rescissions shall not apply to the 
     Geographic Programs, the National Estuary Program, and the 
     National Priorities funding in the Science and Technology and 
     Environmental Programs and Management accounts. The Agency is 
     directed to submit, as part of the operating plan, detail on 
     the application of such rescissions at the program project 
     level.


                         science and technology

                    (including rescission of funds)

       For Science and Technology programs, the bill provides 
     $713,823,000 to be partially offset by a $7,350,000 
     rescission for a net discretionary appropriation of 
     $706,473,000. The bill transfers $15,496,000 from the 
     Hazardous Substance Superfund account to this account. The 
     bill provides the following specific funding levels and 
     direction:
       Indoor Air and Radiation.--The bill provides $5,997,000 and 
     funding for the radon program is maintained at not less than 
     the fiscal year 2017 enacted level.
       Research: National Priorities.--The bill provides 
     $4,100,000 which shall be used for extramural research 
     grants, independent of the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) 
     grant program, to fund high-priority water quality and 
     availability research by not-for-profit organizations who 
     often partner with the Agency. Because these grants are 
     independent of the STAR grant program, the

[[Page H2622]]

     Agency should strive to award grants in as large an amount as 
     is possible to achieve the most scientifically significant 
     research. Funds shall be awarded competitively with priority 
     given to partners proposing research of national scope and 
     who provide a 25 percent match. The Agency is directed to 
     allocate funds to grantees within 180 days of enactment of 
     this Act.
       Additional Guidance.--The agreement includes the following 
     additional guidance:
       Alternatives Testing.--The Agency is directed to follow the 
     guidance contained under this heading in House Report 115-238 
     and to also include in its report to the Committees 
     information and analysis related to potential barriers or 
     limitations on the use of alternative test methods and to 
     ensure that any future plans address such barriers or 
     limitations, particularly as they relate to susceptible 
     populations.
       Computational Toxicology.--The Committees support the 
     Agency's computational toxicology research activities to 
     advance the next generation of risk assessment methods, 
     including for prioritization, screening and testing under the 
     Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act (LCSA). Such research 
     activities must be carried out following the requirements of 
     the LCSA to ensure that alternative test methods ``provide 
     information of equivalent or better scientific quality and 
     relevance'' and to protect susceptible subpopulations from 
     unreasonable risk. The Agency's National Center for 
     Computational Toxicology (NCCT) is encouraged to expand its 
     collaborations with scientific experts outside of the Agency 
     to advance development and use of human biology-based 
     experimental and computational approaches for chemical 
     assessments.
       The Committees direct the Agency to develop the strategic 
     plan on alternative methods and testing strategies required 
     by the LCSA utilizing the leadership of the Director of 
     Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT), the 
     Director of NCCT, the Director of the National Toxicology 
     Program (NTP), and the Director of the National Center for 
     Environmental Assessment (NCEA). The process for developing 
     this strategic plan shall include requests for information 
     from the scientific community and the public and two or more 
     public meetings or workshops. The Agency shall circulate the 
     draft strategic plan for public review and comment, revise 
     the plan to address comments and then issue the strategic 
     plan, which shall include an appendix documenting response 
     to, and disposition of, public comments. In addition, NCCT, 
     OPPT, NTP, and NCEA shall each assign 1 FTE to collaborate on 
     evaluating computational toxicology, in vitro methods and 
     alternative test methods for specific scientifically-valid 
     applications by OPPT for implementation in the LCSA. The 
     Committees request the Agency to provide a status report on 
     these activities no later than September 30, 2018.
       Enhanced Aquifer Use.--The Agency is directed to continue 
     following the guidance contained in Senate Report 114-281 in 
     addition to the guidance contained in House Report 115-238 
     directing the Agency to coordinate with other Federal 
     research efforts in this area.
       Integrated Risk Information System.--The agreement 
     continues to provide funding for the Integrated Risk 
     Information System (IRIS) program at the fiscal year 2017 
     enacted level and direction that the program continues within 
     the Office of Research and Development. The Committees remain 
     concerned that the program has appeared on the Government 
     Accountability Office's (GAO) High Risk List since 2008. The 
     Committees are aware of progress made by the Agency to 
     implement the 2011 National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) 
     Chapter 7 and 2014 NAS report recommendations for the IRIS 
     program, but remain concerned that the recommendations have 
     not been fully implemented. The Committees note that the 
     Agency and the NAS held a workshop in February 2018 to review 
     advances made to the IRIS process, and that an NAS report on 
     IRIS' progress is forthcoming. The Committees are encouraged 
     that the program indicated its willingness to more closely 
     align the development of risk assessments with stated 
     regulatory priorities of the Agency, and believes that these 
     efforts will make the assessments more relevant. The 
     Committees understand that the program intends to continue 
     the development of new methodologies and technologies to 
     enhance the development of future IRIS assessments and 
     encourages the program to do so, while also encouraging the 
     program to ensure that all IRIS methodologies attain the 
     highest scientific rigor. Finally, the Committees urge the 
     expedited completion of the IRIS handbook and direct that the 
     public be afforded an opportunity to provide comment on the 
     handbook before it is placed in use.
       National Air Toxics Trends Station Network.--The agreement 
     maintains funding for the National Air Toxic Trends Station 
     Network, which tracks air pollution trends at 27 stations 
     across the country, at the fiscal year 2017 enacted level to 
     accommodate the network's ongoing activities to gather 
     consistent, high-quality monitoring data on hazardous air 
     pollutants across the country.
       Nanomaterials Research.--The Agency should continue to 
     follow the direction included in Senate Report 114-281 and 
     seek to maximize collaborative research efforts with the Food 
     and Drug Administration.
       Partnership Research.--The Committees encourage the Agency 
     to continue leveraged partnerships with not-for-profit 
     institutions that often partner with the Agency, industry, 
     and affected stakeholders to produce independent science and 
     evaluate the effectiveness of environmental regulations 
     relating to unconventional oil and gas development. The study 
     should be used to provide credible science, of national 
     scope, relating to unconventional oil and gas development. 
     Within available funds, the Agency is directed to use not 
     less than $1,000,000 to partner on such a study during fiscal 
     year 2018.
       STAR Grants.--The agreement provides funds to continue the 
     Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program and the Committees 
     direct the Agency to distribute grants consistent with fiscal 
     year 2017. Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, the 
     Committees direct the Agency to provide a briefing on its 
     plans for the program in fiscal year 2018.


                 environmental programs and management

                    (including rescission of funds)

       For Environmental Programs and Management, the bill 
     provides $2,643,299,000 to be partially offset by a 
     $45,300,000 rescission for a net discretionary appropriation 
     of $2,597,999,000. The bill provides the following specific 
     funding levels and direction:
       Clean Air.--The agreement maintains funding for the 
     EnergySTAR program at the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. In 
     2009, the Agency and the Department of Energy (DOE) signed a 
     Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) related to the EnergySTAR 
     Program, which shifted some functions related to home 
     appliance products from the DOE to EPA. The Agency shall work 
     with the DOE to review the 2009 MOU and report to the 
     Committees within 90 days of enactment of this Act on whether 
     the expected efficiencies for home appliance products have 
     been achieved.
       Further, the Committees do not support the proposed 
     termination of voluntary programs, including Natural GasSTAR, 
     AgSTAR, the Combined Heat and Power Partnership, and other 
     partnership programs where EPA works collaboratively with 
     nongovernmental entities to identify beneficial methods to 
     reduce emissions, reduce pollution, or increase efficiency. 
     The Committees also maintain both program areas related to 
     stratospheric ozone at not less than the fiscal year 2017 
     enacted level.
       Environmental Protection: National Priorities.--The bill 
     provides $12,700,000 for a competitive grant program to 
     provide technical assistance for improved water quality or 
     safe drinking water, adequate waste water to small systems or 
     individual private well owners. The Agency shall provide 
     $10,000,000 for the Grassroots Rural and Small Community 
     Water Systems Assistance Act, for activities specified under 
     section 1442(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 
     300j-1(e)(8)). The Agency is also directed to provide 
     $1,700,000 for grants to qualified not-for-profit 
     organizations for technical assistance for individual private 
     well owners, with priority given to organizations that 
     currently provide technical and educational assistance to 
     individual private well owners. The Agency is directed to 
     provide on a national and multi-State regional basis, 
     $1,000,000 for grants to qualified organizations, for the 
     sole purpose of providing onsite training and technical 
     assistance for wastewater systems. The Agency shall require 
     each grantee to provide a minimum 10 percent match, including 
     in kind contributions. The Agency is directed to allocate 
     funds to grantees within 180 days of enactment of this Act.
       The Committees understand the Agency has made a decision to 
     put out a multi-year Request for Applications for fiscal year 
     2017 and fiscal year 2018 without expressed approval from the 
     Committees. The Committees expect the Agency to formally 
     consult on similar decisions in the future.
       Geographic Programs.--The bill provides $447,857,000, as 
     distributed in the table at the end of this division, and 
     includes the following direction:
       Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.--The bill provides 
     $300,000,000 and the Agency shall continue to follow the 
     direction as provided in House Report 112-589 and in Senate 
     Report 114-281 related to the Great Lakes Restoration 
     Initiative. Additionally, the Committees encourage Agency 
     funds for Great Lakes projects to be made available for 
     projects in the historic Great Lakes Basin, which includes 
     the Chicago River Watershed.
       Chesapeake Bay.--The bill provides $73,000,000 and the 
     Agency shall allocate funds consistent with the direction 
     under this heading in Senate Report 114-281.
       Gulf of Mexico.--The bill provides $12,542,000 for the Gulf 
     of Mexico Geographic Program where hypoxia is a growing cause 
     for concern. The Committees direct the Agency to coordinate 
     with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Gulf States, and 
     other State, local and private partners to leverage greater 
     resources toward conservation projects on working-lands 
     within the Gulf Region and Mississippi River Basin. The 
     Agency is directed to distribute funds in the same manner as 
     fiscal year 2017.
       Lake Champlain.--The bill provides $8,399,000 for the Lake 
     Champlain program. From within the amount provided, 
     $4,399,000 shall be allocated in the same manner as fiscal 
     year 2017 and $4,000,000 shall be for otherwise unmet needs 
     necessary to implement the Agency's 2016 Phosphorus Total 
     Maximum Daily Load Plan for Lake Champlain for projects and 
     work identified in the State implementation plan.
       Puget Sound.--The bill provides $28,000,000 and the Agency 
     shall follow the direction under this heading in House Report 
     115-238.

[[Page H2623]]

       Northwest Forest Program.--The Northwest Forest Program is 
     funded at not less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level.
       South Florida Program.--The agreement maintains funding for 
     the South Florida Program and directs the Agency to allocate 
     funds in the same manner as fiscal year 2017.
       Indoor Air and Radiation.--The agreement maintains funding 
     for the radon program at the fiscal year 2017 enacted level 
     and funds have been included for Radiation Protection and 
     Reduce Risks from Indoor Air programs.
       Information Exchange/Outreach.--The agreement includes 
     funding for tribal capacity building equal to the fiscal year 
     2017 enacted level, and the Agency is directed to use 
     environmental education funds for the smart skin care 
     program, similar to prior years. The agreement also provides 
     for the Small Minority Business Assistance program to be 
     continued.
       International Programs.--The bill provides $15,400,000 and 
     includes funds to maintain the U.S.-Mexico Border program at 
     the fiscal year 2017 enacted level.
       Legal/Science/Regulatory/Economic Review.--The bill 
     provides $111,414,000, equal to the fiscal year 2017 enacted 
     level. Within that amount, Integrated Environmental 
     Strategies is funded at the fiscal year 2017 level, so that 
     the Agency can continue to provide locally-led, community-
     driven technical assistance to communities in partnership 
     with localities, States, and other Federal agencies.
       Official Reception and Representation Expenses.--The bill 
     provides necessary funding for the Agency's Commission on 
     Environmental Cooperation meeting in fiscal year 2018.
       Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.--The bill provides 
     $109,377,000. Of the funds provided under this section, 
     $6,000,0000 should be allocated for the purpose of developing 
     and implementing a Federal permit program for the regulation 
     of coal combustion residuals in nonparticipating States, as 
     authorized under section 4005(d)(2)(B) of the Solid Waste 
     Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(2)(B)). The Committees also 
     reiterate the importance of additional language included in 
     House Report 115-238 related to coal combustion residuals and 
     recognize that additional State grants may be necessary as 
     States work to implement permit programs as authorized under 
     section 2301 of the WIIN Act (Public Law 114-322).
       Additionally, the Committees continue to support the Waste 
     Minimization and Recycling program, and the Agency is 
     encouraged to use funds from within the program to help 
     public entities demonstrate community anaerobic digester 
     applications to municipal solid waste streams and farm needs 
     such as capturing excess phosphorus.
       Toxics Risk Review and Prevention.--The bill provides 
     $92,521,000 and maintains funding for the Pollution 
     Prevention program and the Lead Risk Reduction program.
       Water: Ecosystems.--The bill provides $47,788,000. From 
     within the amount provided, $26,723,000 has been provided for 
     the National Estuary Program (NEP) grants as authorized by 
     section 320 of the Clean Water Act. This amount is sufficient 
     to provide each of the 28 national estuaries in the program 
     with a grant of at least $600,000.
       Further, in the Administrative Provisions section, the 
     Committees direct that $1,000,000 in competitive grants be 
     made available for additional projects, and encourages the 
     Agency to work in consultation with the NEP directors to 
     identify worthy projects and activities.
       Water Quality Protection. --The bill provides $210,417,000 
     and maintains funding for the WaterSENSE program at the 
     fiscal year 2017 enacted level.
       Additional Guidance.--The agreement includes the following 
     additional guidance:
       Chesapeake Bay.--The Committees note the agreements signed 
     by the Agency, States and other stakeholders to locate a 
     Chesapeake Bay Liaison Office in Annapolis, Maryland to 
     facilitate coordination among jurisdictions and from 
     participating Federal agencies in support of the Chesapeake 
     Bay Program. Currently, the Chesapeake Bay Program Office is 
     located in Annapolis, per the agreement, and houses staff 
     from the Chesapeake Bay Program, five Federal agencies and 35 
     non-Federal partners in order to facilitate program 
     coordination. The Committees note and appreciate the 
     commitment made by the Agency to locate the office in, or 
     immediately adjacent to, Annapolis, in compliance with the 
     signed agreements and to also ensure that the future office 
     space will continue to accommodate all of the current 
     Chesapeake Bay Program Office participants. The Committees 
     direct the Agency to completely fulfill those commitments and 
     to keep the Committees fully apprised of progress in each 
     step of the lease process.
       Coal Refuse-Fired Electrical Generating Units.--In its 
     rulemaking on New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), the 
     Agency provided a separate subcategory for SO2 emissions 
     standards for owners and operators of affected coal refuse-
     fired facilities combusting 75 percent or more coal refuse on 
     an annual basis. In the subsequent rulemaking, ``National 
     Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Coal- 
     and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units,'' (the 
     MATS rule) the Agency did not provide a separate subcategory 
     for coal refuse-fired Electric Generating Units (EGUs). It is 
     noted that some stakeholders believe that the NSPS standard 
     appropriately recognizes the multimedia environmental 
     benefits provided by coal refuse-fired EGUs and that the high 
     sulfur content present in coal refuse presents economic and 
     technical difficulties in achieving the same acid gas 
     standards as for coal. The Agency should consider revising 
     the MATS Rule as soon as practicable to provide a separate 
     category for coal refuse-fired EGUs for purposes of the acid 
     gas requirement and its SO2 surrogate consistent with the 
     NSPS.
       Diesel Generators in Remote Alaska Villages.--Under 40 CFR 
     60.4216, diesel generators purchased after Model Year 2014 
     are required to have a diesel particulate filter if they are 
     used as the primary power generator. The Committees 
     understand that these filters have a high failure rate in 
     harsh weather conditions and that repair of the filters can 
     be difficult and expensive. The Committees direct the Agency 
     to reexamine 40 CFR 60.4216 and consider exempting these 
     Villages from the diesel particulate filter requirement.
       Ecolabels for Federal Procurement.--Multiple forest 
     certification systems have been recognized throughout the 
     Federal government as supporting the use of sustainable 
     products in building construction and other uses. The 
     Committees are concerned that the Agency's efforts have not 
     acknowledged many of these certification systems and are 
     therefore limiting the procurement of some products that may 
     be sustainable. The Committees understand that the Agency's 
     Wood/Lumber product category recommendation is currently 
     under review. The Committees direct the Agency to align its 
     Wood/Lumber recommendation with the provisions of the USDA 
     BioPreferred program.
       Elk River.--The Committees encourage the Agency, in 
     coordination with the Department of State and other Federal 
     agencies, to work with State, local, and Tribal partners on 
     efforts to reduce selenium, sulfates, nitrates and other 
     harmful contaminants in the Kootenai Watershed, to which the 
     Elk River is a tributary. The Agency is directed to brief the 
     Committees on its efforts within 180 days of enactment of 
     this Act.
       Exempt Aquifers.--The Agency shall follow the guidance 
     contained under this heading in House Report 115-238.
       Fish Grinding.--Under a Clean Water Act general permit, 
     onshore seafood processors in Alaska are allowed to grind and 
     discharge seafood waste. The permit requires that all seafood 
     waste be ground to a size of no more than one-half inch in 
     any dimension. Unfortunately, in some instances, the best 
     available technology is unable to achieve a half inch grind 
     dimension on a consistent basis due to the malleable nature 
     of fish waste. The Agency should develop a policy to ensure 
     that fish processors using the best available technology and/
     or best conventional practice will be considered in 
     compliance. Additionally, processing vessels operating in 
     waters off-shore of Alaska are subject to the same one-half 
     inch grinding requirement even though there are no documented 
     water quality issues that require such grinding. The Agency 
     should exempt offshore processing vessels from the 
     requirement.
       Glider Kits.--The Committees understand the Agency has 
     announced plans to revisit portions of its Phase 2 Greenhouse 
     Gas (GHG) Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- 
     and Heavy-Duty Engines. Upon completion of the review, the 
     Agency is directed to update the Committees on the matter.
       Integrated Planning.--The Agency is encouraged to continue 
     using an integrated planning approach to enhance flexibility 
     for communities struggling to meet compliance costs mandated 
     under the Clean Water Act (CWA) as well as the Agency's 
     efforts to consider a community's ability to pay for 
     compliance costs when determining permitting actions under 
     the CWA. The Agency is directed to maintain technical 
     assistance and outreach to communities seeking to develop and 
     implement an integrated planning approach to meeting Clean 
     Water Act requirements. Further, the Committees urge the 
     Agency to implement integrated planning measures through a 
     flexible permit process rather than enforcement actions and 
     consent decrees.
       Interagency Consultations.--The Agency is directed to 
     continue following the requirements in Senate Report 114-281 
     regarding consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture 
     related to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
     Rodenticide Act.
       Pesticides Registration Improvement Act.--The agreement 
     provides additional funding for compliance with the 
     Pesticides Registration Improvement Act. The Committees 
     direct the Agency to comply with the fiscal year 2017 
     quarterly reporting requirement related to previously 
     collected maintenance fees that are currently unavailable for 
     obligation. To ensure the Committees have the most accurate 
     information regarding this issue, the Agency is directed to 
     provide a briefing within 30 days of enactment of this Act.
       Public Access to Research.--The Agency released its Plan to 
     Increase Access to Results of EPA-Funded Scientific Research 
     on November 29, 2016. The Committees urge the Agency to 
     continue its efforts towards full implementation of the plan, 
     and directs the Agency to provide an update on its efforts 
     within 60 days of enactment of this Act.
       Regulation of Groundwater.--Since enactment in 1972, the 
     Clean Water Act (CWA) has regulated impacts to navigable 
     waters, while

[[Page H2624]]

     regulation of groundwater has remained outside of the Act's 
     jurisdiction. Instead, legislative history surrounding the 
     CWA indicates that Congress intended for groundwater 
     pollution to be regulated through CWA's nonpoint source 
     programs and other Federal and State laws. For example, 
     releases into groundwater from solid waste units are 
     regulated at a Federal level by the Resource Conservation and 
     Recovery Act (RCRA). Recently, some courts have imposed a 
     broad view of CWA liability based on a theory of hydrological 
     connection between groundwater and surface water. Other 
     courts have taken a more narrow view and have focused on 
     statutory distinctions between surface water and groundwater. 
     The Committees are aware that the Agency has requested 
     comment on its previous statements ``regarding the Clean 
     Water Act (CWA) and whether pollutant discharges from point 
     sources that reach jurisdictional surface waters via 
     groundwater or other subsurface flow that has a direct 
     hydrologic connection to the jurisdictional surface water may 
     be subject to CWA regulation.'' After completing the public 
     comment process, the Committees encourage the Agency to 
     consider whether it is appropriate to promulgate a rule to 
     clarify that groundwater releases from solid waste units are 
     regulated under RCRA and are not considered point sources, 
     and, that releases of pollutants through groundwater are not 
     subject to regulation as point sources under the CWA. The 
     Agency is directed to brief the Committees about its findings 
     and any plans for future rulemaking.
       Small Refinery Relief.--The Committees continue the 
     directive contained in Senate Report 114-281 related to small 
     refinery relief. The Agency is reminded that, regardless of 
     the Department of Energy's recommendation, additional relief 
     may be granted if the Agency believes it is warranted.
       Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Risk Evaluations.--
     Under the agreement, the Agency is directed to implement the 
     Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act 
     in a manner that reflects the best available science as now 
     required under TSCA section 26.
       Agricultural Operations.--The Committees note that Congress 
     never intended the Solid Waste Disposal Act to govern animal 
     or crop waste, manure, or fertilizer, or constituents derived 
     from such sources. The Agency's longstanding regulations 
     accurately reflect Congress' intent not to regulate manure 
     and crop residues under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, and the 
     Committees support legislative efforts to clarify and codify 
     the treatment of agricultural byproducts under the Solid 
     Waste Disposal Act.


            HAZARDOUS WASTE ELECTRONIC MANIFEST SYSTEM FUND

       The bill provides $3,674,000 which is expected to be fully 
     offset by fees for a net appropriation of $0. The Committees 
     continue to support the expeditious development of a system 
     that would allow for the electronic tracking of hazardous 
     waste shipments pursuant to Public Law 112-195.
       The Committees realize the Agency is transitioning from the 
     developmental phase to the implementation phase for the E-
     Manifest System. Therefore, the Committees urge the Agency to 
     use an adequate portion of funding to begin the 
     implementation of the Application Program Interface System 
     which will allow hazardous waste treatment, storage, 
     transport and disposal facilities to interface their computer 
     systems with those of EPA to upload and download manifest and 
     other important information related to full scale 
     implementation of the system.


                      OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

       The bill provides $41,489,000 for the Office of Inspector 
     General.


                        BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES

       The bill provides $34,467,000 for Buildings and Facilities.


                     HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE SUPERFUND

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

       The bill provides $1,091,947,000 for the Hazardous 
     Substance Superfund account and includes bill language to 
     transfer $8,778,000 to the Office of Inspector General 
     account and $15,496,000 to the Science and Technology 
     account. When combined with an additional $54,389,000 for the 
     Superfund Remedial program and an additional $8,611,000 for 
     the Superfund Emergency Response and Removal program in a 
     general provision in Title IV, the bill provides a total of 
     $1,154,947,000 for the Hazardous Substance Superfund. The 
     bill provides the following additional direction:
       Enforcement.--The agreement provides $166,375,000 for 
     Superfund enforcement, equal to the fiscal year 2017 enacted 
     level. The Committees do not concur with the proposed 
     elimination of financial support to the Department of Justice 
     (DOJ). The Agency is directed to continue financial support 
     of the DOJ in fiscal year 2018 at a level that will ensure 
     the DOJ can continue to initiate and prosecute civil, 
     judicial, and administrative site remediation cases and 
     ensure that responsible parties perform cleanup actions at 
     sites where they are liable.
       Additional Guidance.--The Committees have provided the 
     following additional guidance with respect to funding 
     provided under this account:
       Baseline Testing Study.--The Committees direct the Agency 
     to work with the Municipality of Vieques to partner with a 
     University-led coalition, which shall include a School of 
     Public Health, to conduct research to facilitate the 
     effective testing, evaluation, quantification and mitigation 
     of the toxic substances in the soil, seas, plant, animal and 
     human population of Vieques. This effort will fill an 
     information void at this site, which functioned as a military 
     training installation for decades, and serve as the baseline 
     study for all potential future mitigation efforts.
       Contaminants of Emerging Concern.--The bill provides 
     $181,306,000 in base funds for Emergency Response and Removal 
     activities. When combined with an additional $8,611,000 in a 
     general provision in Title IV, the bill provides a total of 
     $189,917,000 for Emergency Response and Removal activities. 
     These activities should include collaborative work with 
     State, Tribal, and local governments to help communities 
     address contaminants of emerging concern. Furthermore, the 
     Committees recommend that the Agency expeditiously remediate 
     Superfund sites contaminated by these emerging contaminants, 
     and provide technical assistance and support to States and 
     Tribes during the remedial cleanup process.
       Financial Assurance.--Since enactment of the Comprehensive 
     Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
     (CERCLA) in 1980, Federal agencies like the Bureau of Land 
     Management and Forest Service have created and updated 
     financial assurance requirements for reclamation and closure 
     of hardrock mining facilities on Federal lands. Similarly, 
     several States have developed financial assurance programs 
     for mining activities occurring on private and State lands. 
     The Committees understand that, pursuant to a Federal 
     Register notice signed on December 11, 2017, the EPA will not 
     impose new Federal financial assurance requirements on 
     hardrock mining facilities.
       Sediment Guidance.--When implementing the recommendations 
     of the Superfund Task Force, the Agency should consider 
     additional improvements to the consistency of the application 
     of sediment guidance among regions. At sites expected to 
     exceed $50,000,000, the Committees encourage the Agency to 
     include the Contaminated Sediment Technical Advisory 
     Committee (CSTAG) and the National Remedy Review Board (NRRB) 
     throughout the process and to ensure that their technical 
     review and remedy recommendations are evaluated and 
     considered for inclusion in the final remedy. Additionally, 
     the Committees encourage the Agency to, consistent with 
     National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan, set 
     achievable cleanup goals, broaden the use of adaptive 
     management and early actions, explore the utility of public-
     private partnerships similar, expand stakeholder 
     participation, and promote cost-effectiveness, redevelopment, 
     and sustainability in the Superfund process.
       Tribal Guidance.--The Committees recognize the importance 
     of government-to-government Tribal consultation as well as 
     the necessity to honor Tribal treaty rights and resources 
     protected by treaties. The Agency is directed to fully 
     implement the Agency's Guidance for Discussing Tribal Treaty 
     Rights to ensure Agency actions adequately consider treaty 
     rights proactively throughout the consultation process.


          LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK TRUST FUND PROGRAM

       The bill provides $91,941,000 for the Leaking Underground 
     Storage Tank Trust Fund Program.


                       INLAND OIL SPILL PROGRAMS

       The bill provides $18,209,000 for Inland Oil Spill 
     Programs.


                   STATE AND TRIBAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS

       The bill provides $3,562,161,000 for the State and Tribal 
     Assistance Grants program and includes the following specific 
     funding levels and direction:
       Infrastructure Assistance.--The bill provides 
     $2,486,120,000 in base funds for infrastructure assistance. 
     When combined with an additional $650,000,000 in a Title IV 
     general provision, the bill provides a total of 
     $3,136,120,000 for infrastructure assistance. The amount 
     provided increases funding for the State Revolving Loan Funds 
     $600,000,000 above the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. The 
     agreement includes a total of $1,693,887,000 for the Clean 
     Water State Revolving Loan Fund and $1,163,233,000 for the 
     Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund.
       Assistance to Small and Disadvantaged Communities.--Within 
     a Title IV general provision, the bill provides $20,000,000 
     to begin a grant program to help small and disadvantaged 
     communities develop and maintain adequate water 
     infrastructure. The program was created in section 2104 of 
     Public Law 114-322. The Agency is directed to brief the 
     Committees prior to publishing its request for applications 
     related to this new grant program.
       Reducing Lead in Drinking Water.--Within a Title IV general 
     provision, the bill provides $10,000,000 to begin a grant 
     program, created in section 2105 of Public Law 114-322, to 
     provide assistance to eligible entities for lead reduction 
     projects. The Agency is directed to brief the Committees 
     prior to publishing its request for applications related to 
     this new grant program.
       Lead Testing.--Within a Title IV general provision, the 
     bill provides $20,000,000 to begin a grant program for 
     voluntary testing of drinking water for lead contaminants at 
     schools and child care facilities, as authorized in section 
     2107 of Public Law 114-322. The Agency is directed to brief 
     the Committees prior to publishing its request for 
     applications related to this new grant program.
       Brownfields Program.--The bill provides $80,000,000 for 
     brownfields grants and directs

[[Page H2625]]

     that at least 10 percent of such grants be provided to areas 
     in which at least 20 percent of the population has lived 
     under the poverty level over the past 30 years as determined 
     by censuses and the most recent Small Area Income and Poverty 
     Estimates.
       Use of Iron and Steel.--The bill includes language in Title 
     IV General Provisions that stipulates requirements for the 
     use of iron and steel in State Revolving Fund projects, and 
     the agreement includes only the following guidance. The 
     Committees acknowledge that EPA may issue a waiver of said 
     requirements for de minimis amounts of iron and steel 
     building materials. The Committees emphasize that any coating 
     processes that are applied to the external surface of iron 
     and steel components that otherwise qualify under the 
     procurement preference shall not render such products 
     ineligible for the procurement preference regardless of where 
     the coating processes occur, provided that final assembly of 
     the products occurs in the United States.
       Diesel Emission Reductions Grants (DERA).--The bill 
     provides $75,000,000 for DERA grants. For fiscal year 2018, 
     the Committees direct the Agency to continue to make at least 
     70 percent of DERA grants available to improve air quality in 
     non-attainment areas.
       Targeted Airshed Grants.--The bill provides $40,000,000 for 
     targeted airshed grants to reduce air pollution in non-
     attainment areas. The Agency is directed to distribute the 
     grants on a competitive basis using the same criteria as 
     specified under this heading in the explanatory statement 
     accompanying Division G of the Consolidated Appropriations 
     Act, 2017 (Public Law 115-31). Not later than the end of 
     fiscal year 2018, the Agency should provide a report to the 
     Committees on Appropriations that includes a table showing 
     how fiscal year 2016 and 2017 funds were allocated. The table 
     should also include grant recipients and metrics for 
     anticipated or actual results.
       Animas River Spill.--The Committees concur with the 
     Agency's decision to reconsider its previous determination to 
     deny claims for damages from the Animas River Spill by 
     invoking the discretionary act exemption in the Federal Tort 
     Claims Act, but are concerned that little progress has been 
     made on processing or paying out claims. The Committees are 
     also concerned that the Agency is applying or may apply an 
     inconsistent standard that discriminates against certain 
     claimants. The Committees expect the Agency and the Federal 
     government to take a clear and consistent position on the 
     question of whether they are responsible for damages caused 
     to others by the Gold King Mine release. The Committees 
     support paying out all legitimate claims from the Judgment 
     Fund, consistent with the Federal Tort Claims Act, and 
     communicating all relevant aspects of the claims process 
     clearly to all affected communities, State, local and Tribal 
     governments, along with the Committees. Within 30 days of 
     enactment of this Act, the Agency shall provide to the 
     Committees a written report detailing the status of the 
     review of the legal basis for allowing or rejecting claims 
     and the date by which such review will be complete, the 
     current process underway for processing claims, the status of 
     all claims, including reconsidered claims, the Agency's 
     complete plan for processing all claims, and any other future 
     planned actions related to current or future claims. Finally, 
     the bill provides $4,000,000 for a long-term water quality 
     monitoring program, as authorized by Public Law 114-322. The 
     Agency is directed to continue to work in consultation with 
     affected States and Tribes on that effort.
       Categorical Grants.--The bill provides $1,076,041,000 for 
     Categorical Grants and funding levels are specified in the 
     table at the end of this division. Within this amount, the 
     Beaches Protection program and Radon program are both 
     maintained at the fiscal year 2017 enacted levels. The Agency 
     shall continue to allocate radon grants in fiscal year 2018 
     following the direction in House Report 114-632.
       The amount also includes $228,219,000 for the State and 
     Local Air Quality Management grant program, and the Agency is 
     directed to allocate funds for this program using the same 
     formula as fiscal year 2015. The Committees understand the 
     Office of Air and Radiation was able to provide some 
     additional funds to the States in fiscal year 2016 using 
     balances. The Committees encourage the Agency to do the same 
     in fiscal year 2018 and to provide those additional funds to 
     the regions with the highest need.
       Categorical Grant: Multipurpose Grants.--Because the States 
     are expected to take a leading role in compliance with 
     environmental cleanup, the agreement provides $10,000,000 for 
     Multipurpose grants to States and Tribes. The Committees were 
     disappointed with the Agency's funding formula in fiscal year 
     2016 because it did not provide the flexibility that Congress 
     expected and instead gave preference to air programs. In 
     fiscal year 2018, the Agency is directed to give maximum 
     flexibility to States, so that States, not the Agency, may 
     determine where funds from this grant program are of most 
     value.
       Categorical Grant: Nonpoint Source (Sec. 319).--The bill 
     provides $170,915,000 and the Committees expect the Agency to 
     examine the allocation formula to ensure that the resources 
     are being spent in areas with the most pressing needs.


      WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE AND INNOVATION PROGRAM ACCOUNT

       The bill provides a total of $63,000,000 for the Water 
     Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program. 
     Within base funding in Title II, the bill provides 
     $10,000,000 for the WIFIA program, and a Title IV general 
     provision provides an additional $53,000,000 for the program. 
     By utilizing $5,000,000 in base funds and $3,000,000 in Title 
     IV funds, the Agency may use up to a total of $8,000,000 to 
     assist with the administrative expenses for the program. The 
     remaining $55,000,000 in WIFIA funds is provided for direct 
     loan subsidization which may translate into a potential loan 
     capacity in excess of $6,000,000,000 to eligible entities for 
     water infrastructure projects.
       Greater investment in the replacement of aging 
     infrastructure will help mitigate nationwide issues the 
     Committees are tracking related to contaminants such as lead 
     and arsenic, help address Combined Sewer Overflows and 
     Sanitary Sewer Overflows, and allow systems to improve water 
     delivery for residents. The Committees expect that the Agency 
     will issue loans for the first time in fiscal year 2018 and 
     the Committees intend to closely monitor implementation.


       ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS--ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

             (INCLUDING TRANSFERS AND RESCISSION OF FUNDS)

       The bill continues several administrative provisions from 
     previous years.
       Rescission.--The bill rescinds $96,198,000 of unobligated 
     balances from the State and Tribal Assistance Grants account. 
     The Agency shall calculate the requisite percent reduction 
     necessary to rescind such amounts from new obligational 
     authority provided to this account, both from the direct 
     appropriation and from amounts provided in a general 
     provision in Title IV, and apply it across program project 
     areas by formula. The Agency is directed to submit, as part 
     of the operating plan, detail on the application of such 
     rescissions by program project area.

                      TITLE III--RELATED AGENCIES

                       Department of Agriculture


                             FOREST SERVICE

       Forest Service Directives.--The Forest Service is reminded 
     of the importance of the directives included in House Report 
     115-238 not specifically addressed herein, as well as the new 
     directives in this statement, including the front matter, and 
     the Committees encourage the Service to share this statement 
     with all staff. The Service also is reminded to include the 
     research report, as required by the House report, in its 
     fiscal year 2020 budget request.
       Forest Service Accounting, Budgeting, and Management.--The 
     Committees appreciate the Service's efforts to improve its 
     accounting, budgeting, and management practices and look 
     forward to working with the Service, Office of Budget and 
     Program Analysis, Under Secretary for Natural Resources and 
     Environment, and Secretary of Agriculture to continue these 
     improvements. The agreement includes bill language and 
     directives to further increase transparency and confidence in 
     the Service's management of its programs and activities.
       Government Accountability Office Report.--Over the past 
     three fiscal years, the Committees have become increasingly 
     concerned about the Service's lack of internal controls over 
     budgetary resources, reimbursable agreements, and 
     unliquidated obligations. The lack of controls indicates a 
     weak financial system, which increases the possibility of 
     inefficient and ineffective use, if not outright waste, 
     fraud, and abuse, of taxpayer funds. After conducting an 18-
     month audit, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
     recently made 11 recommendations in a report titled ``Forest 
     Service: Improvements Needed in Internal Control over Budget 
     Execution Process'' (GAO-18-56). While the Service is 
     expected to implement the recommended changes as soon as 
     practicable, Congress also recognizes the challenges of 
     developing, updating, and implementing these important fiscal 
     controls. As such, the Committees request that the Service 
     work with the Committees to remedy any hindrances to their 
     implementation.
       Standardized Budget Practices.--The Committees continue to 
     support the Service's efforts in centralizing and 
     standardizing budgeting and accounting practices among the 
     Regions and program offices and look forward to reviewing the 
     Service's plan for updating its budget process and 
     presentation.
       Integrated Resource Restoration Pilot Project.--The 
     agreement ends the Integrated Resource Restoration pilot 
     project. The Committees remind the Service of its previous 
     direction to adopt the best practices and methods discovered 
     through the pilot project and to require unit, forest, 
     region, station, and Washington Office budgets to be 
     collaboratively developed, while reflecting the priorities 
     established by Congress.
       Alignment of Funding and Program Goals.--This fiscal year, 
     Congress takes an important step to increase transparency by 
     aligning program dollars to the accounts that best meet 
     program goals. For example, in the past, Fire Plan Research 
     and Development has been funded from within the Wildland Fire 
     Management Account, yet its funding was routinely transferred 
     to the Forest and Rangeland Research Account. This agreement 
     appropriates funds for Fire Plan Research and Development 
     within the Forest and Rangeland Research account and 
     Hazardous Fuels within the National Forest System account to 
     minimize unnecessary transfers and increase transparency.

[[Page H2626]]

       Cost Pools.--The Service has been utilizing Cost Pools to 
     pay for certain costs associated with personnel, 
     administrative activities, facilities, and other expenses 
     rather than utilizing an administrative account. As part of 
     continuing efforts to improve collaboration in budgeting, the 
     Committees have determined that ending the practice of Cost 
     Pools in favor of more direct accounting is in the best 
     interest of the Service and the taxpayer. The Committees are 
     committed to working with the Service as it reviews options 
     for replacing Cost Pools. As such, the Service is directed to 
     develop a plan to transition away from Cost Pools, with the 
     exception of Cost-Pool 9, which occurs with this bill, and 
     provide that plan to the House and Senate Committees on 
     Appropriations within 180 days of enactment of this Act.
       Cost-Pool 9.--For 12 years, the Service has assessed 
     program funds for facilities maintenance needs, causing the 
     funds appropriated to programs to appear greater than they 
     actually were. The Committees believe all facility projects 
     should be accounted for in the facility line item, and that 
     projects should be prioritized within that line item. As 
     such, this agreement moves funds from programs to the 
     dedicated facilities account. Where such changes have been 
     made, it is noted within the account in this explanatory 
     statement. If the Service identifies shortfalls for critical 
     facilities maintenance needs, it is directed to submit a 
     reprogramming request to the Committees. Additionally, the 
     Service should reduce the size of its facilities footprint, 
     where possible, particularly in areas where management 
     functions can be combined while still providing comprehensive 
     service to a geographic area.
       National Fire Plan.--Despite more than $5,000,000,000 in 
     investments in hazardous fuels mitigation since the 
     development of the National Fire Plan following the 2000 fire 
     season, the Service has not been able to keep pace with the 
     challenges caused by previous management decisions, a 
     changing climate, ever-increasing costs, and an expanding 
     wildland-urban interface, all of which exacerbate the risk of 
     catastrophic wildfire. The Committees direct the Service to 
     work with the Office of Management and Budget and the 
     Department of the Interior, as well as other relevant 
     agencies, to review and update the National Fire Plan, as 
     needed.
       Fire Hazard Potential Mapping Initiative.--The Committees 
     believe the Service should more precisely and effectively 
     target forest management activities to reduce the threat of 
     catastrophic wildfires, improve the management of the 
     national forests, and assist in protecting other Federal, 
     State, and private lands. The Service is directed to develop 
     a Fire Hazard Potential mapping tool to identify areas at a 
     high risk for wildland fire and describe the resources that 
     would be necessary to address the highest risk areas. The 
     Service should cooperatively work with universities, such as 
     the University of California and the University of Nevada, 
     that have expertise in this area, as well as the Department 
     of the Interior.
       Printing Costs.--The Committees continue to be concerned 
     about the Service's printing costs. The Service is directed 
     to provide updated information as specified by Senate Reports 
     114-70 and 114-82 within 60 days of enactment of this Act. 
     The Service should provide a justification for its costs, 
     explain why they have not been reduced, and significantly 
     reduce printing expenditures.
       Reprogramming.--The Committees remind the Service to follow 
     the letter and spirit of the reprogramming requirements in 
     this explanatory statement and direct the Service to submit 
     requests through the Office of Budget and Program Analysis.
       Ceratocystis Disease.--The Service is directed to continue 
     its collaborative efforts to respond to the emergence of 
     Ceratocystis disease in Hawaii and Florida and to develop 
     recommended actions.
       Puerto Rico Hurricane Recovery.--The Committees recognize 
     the devastating effects of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico's 
     natural resources, especially El Yunque National Forest, the 
     International Institute of Tropical Forestry, and private 
     forests, and strongly encourage the Service to utilize its 
     expertise, working with private partners and the Government 
     of Puerto Rico, to restore and rehabilitate the island's 
     unique forest ecosystems.


  OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

       The bill provides $875,000 for the Office of the Under 
     Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment. In previous 
     fiscal years, the Office was funded through the Agriculture, 
     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related 
     Agencies Appropriations Act. This action aligns funding for 
     the Office consistent with the 2017 reorganization of U.S. 
     Department of Agriculture agencies and offices.


                     FOREST AND RANGELAND RESEARCH

       The agreement provides $297,000,000 for Forest and 
     Rangeland Research, including $77,000,000 for Forest 
     Inventory and Analysis. The Service is directed to continue 
     important work previously funded through the Wildland Fire 
     Management account for Fire Plan Research and Development 
     that significantly contributes to the understanding of 
     wildfire regimes.
       Cost-Pool 9.--The Committees note that funding previously 
     assessed for Cost-Pool 9 from Forest and Rangeland Research 
     is now accounted for in Capital Improvement and Maintenance.
       Forest Research Priorities.--The Committees are concerned 
     that the research program is not well aligned with the needs 
     of the National Forest System. When assessing the value of 
     existing programs and new proposals, significant weight 
     should be given to projects whose findings could be 
     incorporated into forest management decisions. Within the 
     funds provided, the agreement includes sufficient funding to 
     support existing academic partners focused on research and 
     technology development to create new and expanded markets and 
     to advance high-value, high-volume wood markets; wood bridge 
     and other infrastructure needs in rural areas; bottomland 
     hardwood plantation management research; and forest 
     monitoring cooperatives in the Northern Region.
       Research Reports.--The Committees direct the Service to 
     cease publishing, within 30 days of enactment of this Act, 
     paper copies for public distribution of science and research 
     accomplishment reports and to redirect these funds to 
     priority research projects, consistent with reprogramming 
     requirements.


                       STATE AND PRIVATE FORESTRY

                    (INCLUDING RESCISSION OF FUNDS)

       The agreement provides $335,525,000 for State and Private 
     Forestry.
       Cooperative Forestry Activities.--The Committees direct the 
     Service to continue to utilize existing partnerships with 
     research institutions and States to fund research to 
     establish methods, tools, and standard protocols that help 
     quantify forest ecosystem services. Additionally, when 
     funding decisions are made regarding tree mortality, strong 
     consideration should be given to spruce beetle, Emerald Ash 
     Borer, and bark beetle infestations, which affect forests 
     throughout the Nation.
       Forest Legacy.--The bill provides $67,025,000 for the 
     Forest Legacy program. This includes $6,400,000 for program 
     administration and $60,625,000 for projects. The Service 
     should fund projects in priority order according to the 
     updated, competitively selected national priority list 
     submitted to the Committees and the directive contained in 
     Division G of the explanatory statement accompanying Public 
     Law 115-31, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The 
     Committees include a rescission of $5,938,000 in Forest 
     Legacy funds. This funding rescission is from cost savings of 
     some projects and funds returned from failed or partially 
     failed projects.
       International Forestry Technical Assistance.--The 
     Committees acknowledge that Timor-Leste and Australia have 
     entered into a treaty to establish a permanent maritime 
     boundary. The Committees recognize the increased development 
     that will likely occur and encourage the Service to provide 
     technical assistance, as appropriate, to Timor-Leste to 
     protect the unique biodiversity of the region while 
     facilitating robust economic development.


                         NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM

       The agreement provides $1,923,750,000 for the National 
     Forest System.
       Cost-Pool 9.--The Committees note that funding previously 
     assessed for Cost-Pool 9 from the National Forest System is 
     now accounted for in Capital Improvement and Maintenance.
       Hazardous Fuels.--The agreement provides $430,000,000 for 
     hazardous fuels management activities within the National 
     Forest System account. With the accounting change for Cost-
     Pool 9, this is a $45,500,000 increase over the fiscal year 
     2017 level. Within the total provided, $15,000,000 is for 
     biomass utilization grants, in accordance with the directions 
     included in Senate Report 114-281. The Committees direct the 
     Service to prioritize hazardous fuel removal projects that 
     are critical to protecting public safety in high hazard areas 
     in the national forests facing significant tree mortality and 
     to increase cross-boundary collaboration with landowners near 
     National Forest System lands and encourage the use of 
     hazardous fuels funding for this purpose.
       Uinta National Forest.--The Committees are concerned about 
     the number of dead and dying trees in the Mirror Lake Scenic 
     Byway region in the Uinta National Forest and urge the 
     Service to evaluate the risk of wildfire to the area and 
     target management practices accordingly.
       Grazing Fee Rates.--The Service is directed to provide 
     information to the Committees detailing the implications on 
     grazing fee calculations if the Service adopted the 
     definition of Western States as defined by Public Law 95-514.
       Recreation, Heritage and Wilderness.-- The Committees have 
     been made aware that the majority of recreation special-use 
     permitting activities take place in the Landownership and 
     Access Management subaccount, previously known as 
     Landownership Management. Given the importance of special-use 
     permitting activities to users of our national forests and 
     concerns about significant delays in processing requests, 
     funding is included to increase the pace and scale of such 
     activities. Within the funds provided for recreation, 
     $750,000 shall be for the maintenance of rural airstrips and 
     $500,000 is made available to support infrastructure and 
     trails development and to build the capacity of local user 
     groups and partnership organizations for all National 
     Recreation Areas administered by the Service that were 
     established after 1997.
       Law Enforcement.--The agreement provides $2,500,000 for the 
     Service's illegal marijuana eradication and remediation 
     efforts.

[[Page H2627]]

       Lake Tahoe.--The Committees are encouraged by the work 
     conducted in the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit and expect 
     the Service to prioritize funding the implementation of P.L. 
     106-506, as amended, and to do so in consultation with 
     affected States, local governments, and other stakeholders. 
     Within 60 days of enactment of this Act, the Service shall 
     report to the Committees on these activities and the funding 
     that will be allocated in fiscal year 2018.
       Tongass National Forest.--Without a comprehensive stand-
     level inventory, the transition plan described by the Tongass 
     Land and Resource Management Plan Amendment lacks the 
     scientific basis needed for success, and no less than 
     $1,000,000 is provided for the continuation of the inventory 
     currently underway. The Committees expect the Service to meet 
     the requirements of section 705(a) of the Alaska National 
     Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 539d(a)) and to 
     consider a plan revision or new plan amendment based on the 
     results of the inventory. Any plan revision or amendment 
     should include a timber management program sufficient to 
     preserve a viable timber industry in the region. Until the 
     Service has determined, based on a completed stand-level 
     inventory, the timing and supply of economic young growth 
     needed for a successful final transition and whether the 2016 
     Forest Plan should be amended or revised, the Service is 
     directed not to implement a final transition away from its 
     Tongass old growth timber program to a program based 
     primarily on young growth.


                  CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)

       The agreement provides $449,000,000 for Capital Improvement 
     and Maintenance programs. This includes $49,986,000 made 
     available by discontinuing the use of Cost-Pool 9 and 
     $35,000,000 in one-time infrastructure funding to address 
     deferred maintenance.
       Legacy Roads and Trails.--The Committees recognize the need 
     to remediate legacy roads and trails and direct the Service 
     to address these projects as they rank in priority along with 
     all other infrastructure needs from the appropriations 
     provided for roads and trails through the Capital Improvement 
     and Maintenance account and provide $40,000,000 within the 
     Roads budget line item.
       Smokejumper Bases.--The agreement provides funds for 
     repairs, maintenance, and upgrades at smokejumper bases to 
     ensure operational readiness.
       Green Mountain and Finger Lakes National Forests.--The 
     Committees urge the Service to address longstanding capital 
     improvement needs in the Green Mountain and Finger Lakes 
     National Forests, particularly those that will save the 
     Service money while also improving the public's access and 
     use of these forests.
       Comprehensive Capital Improvement Plan.--The Service is 
     directed to establish a long-term, multi-year plan to guide 
     needed investments in buildings, facilities, transportation 
     systems, and other infrastructure by December 30, 2018. The 
     plan should: (1) establish a process for setting and ranking 
     construction and maintenance priorities; (2) reflect the 
     Service's mission, goals, and requirements; (3) identify 
     facilities, roads, and other infrastructure that should be 
     disposed of or decommissioned; (4) consider existing 
     investments in planning, construction, and maintenance, as 
     well as deferred maintenance needs; and (5) identify future 
     needs for investment to improve the physical infrastructure 
     and health of the national forests. The plan also should 
     include estimated funding requirements. In future budget 
     requests, the Service is directed to provide the Committees 
     with a list of any proposed construction project with a cost 
     greater than $1,000,000.


                            LAND ACQUISITION

       The agreement provides $64,337,000 for Land Acquisition. 
     The amounts provided by this bill compared with the budget 
     estimates by activity and project are shown in the table 
     below, listed in priority order pursuant to the project list 
     received for fiscal year 2018. The Service is expected to use 
     the Critical Inholdings/Wilderness account to acquire high 
     priority lands, such as wilderness and lands of significant 
     value in designated conservation units, to consolidate 
     Federal ownership. The Committees strongly encourage the 
     Service to close projects once funds have been made 
     available, an appraisal has been completed, and a purchase 
     contract has been agreed to. Further instructions are 
     contained under the Land and Water Conservation Fund heading 
     in the front of this explanatory statement.
       The Committees support the continuation of efforts to 
     resolve the long-standing management challenges regarding 
     school trust lands within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 
     the Superior National Forest in Minnesota and encourage the 
     Service to collaborate with nonprofit partners on the private 
     forestland exchange alternative, which will provide the added 
     benefit of preserving valuable forestlands outside of 
     Superior National Forest.

       The agreement provides $2,500,000 for the Management of 
     National Forest Lands for Subsistence Uses.


                        WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT

                     (INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF FUNDS)

       The agreement provides a total of $2,880,338,000 for Forest 
     Service Wildland Fire Management. Of the funds provided, 
     $1,556,818,000 is for suppression operations, which includes 
     an additional $500,000,000 above the 10-year average.
       Cost-Pool 9.--The Committees note that funding previously 
     assessed for Cost-Pool 9 from Wildland Fire Management is now 
     accounted for in Capital Improvement and Maintenance.
       Regional Restoration.--The agreement provides an additional 
     $200,000 for partnerships that enhance the Service's capacity 
     to execute science-based forest restoration treatments to 
     reduce the risk of wildfires and improve the health of dry 
     forest ecosystems.
       Unmanned Aerial Systems.--The Committees recognize Unmanned 
     Aerial Systems (UAS) can aid incident commanders as well as 
     improve the safety of firefighters and the public. As such, 
     the Service is expected to work with the Department of the 
     Interior and the Federal Aviation Administration's Center of 
     Excellence for Unmanned Aircraft Systems to continue 
     evaluating these systems' use and to develop an overall 
     strategy for integrating this additional tool into the 
     Federal firefighting mission. The Committees also recognize 
     that certain satellite-based ground surveillance systems 
     could significantly improve the accuracy of information 
     provided to fire-fighters, other first responders, and 
     communities and encourage the Service to seek opportunities 
     to utilize these satellite systems, as appropriate, as

[[Page H2628]]

     well as other systems that help detect and monitor fire 
     activity.
       Aviation Safety.--The bill repurposes $65,000,000 provided 
     in fiscal year 2015 for the purchase of new aircraft in order 
     to enhance firefighter mobility, effectiveness, efficiency, 
     and the operational safety of the Service's aviation program. 
     The funds shall be used to modernize aviation, radio, and 
     evacuation system infrastructure; and acquire sensory 
     equipment, UAS, and other platforms that detect and monitor 
     fire. Projects may include replacement or upgrades of 
     existing infrastructure at airtanker, helicopter, and 
     smokejumper bases; replacement of equipment, including 
     agency-owned aircraft; and improvements in training and night 
     air operations, but no project shall be undertaken that 
     increases recurring program costs. Within 60 days of 
     enactment of this Act, the Service shall provide a complete 
     list of anticipated projects to the Committees on 
     Appropriations utilizing this entire amount. The Committees 
     expect these funds to be obligated in fiscal years 2018 and 
     2019.


                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

                         INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE

                         INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES

       The agreement provides a total of $5,537,764,000 for the 
     Indian Health Service (IHS), of which $3,952,290,000 is for 
     the Services account as detailed below and in the funding 
     allocation table at the end of this explanatory statement. 
     All proposed cuts are restored, and increases above the 
     fiscal year 2017 enacted levels are detailed below and in the 
     table. The Service is reminded of the guidance and reporting 
     requirements contained in House Report 115-238 which must be 
     complied with unless specifically addressed to the contrary 
     herein, as explained in the front matter of this explanatory 
     statement.
       Current Services.--The agreement provides $93,935,000 to 
     partially cover the cost of maintaining current levels of 
     service, of which $23,543,000 is for pay costs and 
     $70,392,000 is for medical inflation.
       Indian Health Care Improvement Fund.--The agreement 
     provides $72,280,000 for the Indian Health Care Improvement 
     Fund. The Committees recognize the funding disparities that 
     exist across the Indian Health Service system and the ongoing 
     efforts by Tribes and the Service to update the allocation 
     formula accordingly. Upon completion of these efforts, the 
     Service is directed to update the Committees on the resulting 
     allocations.
       Staffing for New Facilities.--The agreement includes 
     $60,336,000 for staffing newly opened health facilities, 
     which is the full amount based upon updated estimates 
     provided to the Committees. Funds for the staffing of new 
     facilities are limited to facilities funded through the 
     Health Care Facilities Construction Priority System or the 
     Joint Venture Construction Program that have opened in fiscal 
     year 2017 or will open in fiscal year 2018. None of these 
     funds may be allocated to a facility until such facility has 
     achieved beneficial occupancy status.
       Accreditation Emergencies.--The Committees consider the 
     loss or potential loss of a Medicare or Medicaid agreement 
     with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) at 
     any facility to be an accreditation emergency. The agreement 
     includes $58,000,000 for accreditation emergencies at an 
     increasing number of direct service facilities, and is based 
     upon updated and itemized information provided to the 
     Committees on December 13, 2017. The Service is encouraged to 
     share this information with Tribes, and to keep Tribes and 
     the Committees apprised of any need for significant 
     deviations from the planned used of funds. Bill language has 
     been added as requested to allow the use of a portion of the 
     funds for facility expansion or renovation and staff 
     quarters.
       Of the amounts provided, no less than $20,000,000 is 
     directed to facilities for purchased/referred care, 
     replacement of third-party revenues lost as a result of 
     decertification, replacement of third-party carryover funds 
     expended to respond to decertification, and reasonable costs 
     of achieving recertification, including recruitment costs 
     necessary to stabilize staffing. Primary consideration should 
     be given but is not limited to facilities that have been 
     without certification the longest. Such funds shall be made 
     available to Tribes assuming operation of such facilities 
     pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
     Assistance Act of 1975 (P.L. 93-638).
       The Committees are concerned by the continued occurrence of 
     deficiencies in patient care, facilities and hospital 
     administration at IHS facilities, including the recent 
     identification of these deficiencies at the Gallup Indian 
     Medical Center (GIMC) by the Centers for Medicare and 
     Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Joint Commission. It is 
     imperative that the Service take all needed steps to ensure 
     patient safety, improve the quality of care, and ensure that 
     GIMC does not lose access to third-party reimbursements, 
     which account for more than 90 percent of the facility's 
     funding. Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, the Service 
     is directed to provide a report to the Committees that 
     details all actions taken to address the deficiencies 
     identified by CMS and the Joint Commission and a list of any 
     outstanding recommendations that require future action by 
     GIMC or the Service to implement. The Service is expected to 
     include its corrective action plans submitted to CMS and the 
     Joint Commission as well as the CMS 2567 deficiency report as 
     part of this report.
       Hospitals and Health Clinics.--The agreement provides 
     $2,045,128,000 for hospitals and health clinics, including: 
     $36,242,000 for current services; $43,708,000 for staffing 
     new facilities; $1,000,000 for retinal cameras; $58,000,000 
     for accreditation emergencies as discussed above; $11,000,000 
     to continue operations and maintenance of village built and 
     tribally leased clinics; $4,000,000 to continue domestic 
     violence prevention; and $1,000,000 to continue prescription 
     drug monitoring.
       Dental Health.--The agreement provides $195,283,000 and 
     includes $5,864,000 for current services and $6,822,000 for 
     staffing new facilities. The Service is directed to backfill 
     vacant dental health positions in headquarters and encouraged 
     to coordinate with the Bureau of Indian Education to 
     integrate preventive dental care at schools across the 
     system.
       Mental Health.--The agreement provides $99,900,000 for 
     mental health programs and includes: $2,891,000 for current 
     services; $2,929,000 for staffing of new facilities; 
     $6,946,000 to continue behavioral health integration; and 
     $3,600,000 to continue the suicide prevention initiative.
       Alcohol and Substance Abuse.--The agreement provides 
     $227,788,000 for alcohol and substance abuse programs and 
     includes: $8,220,000 for current services; $1,215,000 for 
     staffing new facilities; $6,500,000 for the Generation 
     Indigenous initiative; $1,800,000 for the youth pilot 
     project; and $2,000,000 to fund essential detoxification and 
     related services provided by the Service's public and private 
     partners to IHS beneficiaries. The Committees expect the 
     Service to continue its partnership with the Na' Nizhoozhi 
     Center in Gallup, New Mexico, as directed by the Consolidated 
     Appropriations Act, 2017, and to distribute funds provided 
     for detoxification services in the same manner as in fiscal 
     year 2017.
       Purchased/Referred Care.--The agreement provides 
     $962,695,000 and includes $32,327,000 for current services 
     and $1,538,000 for staffing new facilities. The Committees 
     remain concerned about the inequitable distribution of funds 
     as reported by the Government Accountability Office (GAO-12-
     446).
       Public Health Nursing.--The agreement provides $85,043,000 
     for public health nursing and includes $2,702,000 for current 
     services and $3,640,000 for staffing new facilities.
       Health Education.--The agreement provides $19,871,000 for 
     health education and includes $724,000 for current services 
     and $484,000 for staffing new facilities.
       Urban Indian Health.--The agreement provides $49,315,000 
     for urban Indian health and includes $1,637,000 for current 
     services. The Service is expected to continue to include 
     current services estimates for urban Indian health in future 
     budget requests.
       The Committees direct the Service to work with Veterans 
     Affairs on the report examining services for Indian veterans 
     at urban clinics as outlined in House Report 115-188 
     accompanying the Fiscal Year 2018 Military Construction, 
     Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill.
       Indian Health Professions.--The agreement provides 
     $49,363,000 for Indian health professions and includes 
     $18,000 for current services. Within funds, the agreement 
     includes funding for the Quentin N. Burdick American Indians 
     into Nursing Program, Indians into Medicine Program, and 
     American Indians into Psychology Program at no less than 
     fiscal year 2017 enacted levels.
       Extension Services.--The Committees continue to be 
     concerned about the urgent need for skilled health providers 
     in AI/AN communities and are encouraged by the success of the 
     University of New Mexico's Project ECHO--Extension for 
     Community Healthcare Outcomes--in delivering timely care to 
     underserved communities. The Service shall consider how 
     Project ECHO could support existing Indian Health Service 
     providers, and how potential partnerships with Project ECHO 
     could aid in the recruitment and retention of healthcare 
     providers to IHS sites, thereby expanding the provider 
     network and improving access to care.
       Patient Wait Times.--The Committees are encouraged by the 
     Service's recent focus on improving wait times for patients 
     seeking primary and urgent care, including the August 2017 
     publication of Circular No. 17-11 and related efforts to 
     track, report, and improve patient wait times. The Committees 
     direct the Service to provide a report to the Committees on 
     the status of these efforts no later than 90 days after 
     enactment of this Act. This report shall include a clear 
     explanation of how these efforts will address GAO's 
     recommendation in report number GAO-16-333 of setting and 
     monitoring agency-wide standards for patient wait times in 
     federally operated facilities and an analysis of any 
     potential barriers to continued monitoring of wait times 
     caused by IT infrastructure limitations or incompatibility.
       The Committees request that the Service provide, no later 
     than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, a 
     detailed plan with specific amounts identified to fully fund 
     and implement the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, as 
     discussed in House Report 115-238.
       Reimbursable Funding.--This agreement directs the Service 
     to report, within 180 days of enactment of this Act, on 
     patient population and service growth over the past ten years 
     and the funding sources used to provide for these medical 
     services. The Service is to include a breakdown, by dollar 
     amount and percentage, of funding sources which supplement 
     appropriated dollars to cover the provision of medical 
     services at Service operated facilities. The Committees are 
     interested in detailed information on whether

[[Page H2629]]

     medical services have been able to expand over this time 
     period as a result of increases in the ability to charge 
     medical services due to new authorities outlined in the 
     Indian Health Care Improvement Act and other Federal laws. As 
     a point of comparison, and to the extent possible, the 
     Service shall compare these impacts across the twelve Service 
     areas, with the degree to which patient population services 
     in the respective States has increased.
       Quality of Care.--The Committees are extremely concerned 
     about the lack of access to quality healthcare for Tribes 
     around the Nation, including the ongoing healthcare quality 
     problems in the Great Plains. In order to address these 
     issues, the agreement includes a pilot program and related 
     directives to improve access to quality health services and 
     to improve recruitment and retention of qualified medical 
     personnel as detailed below:
       Housing Improvements.--In addition to funds provided for 
     staffing quarters within the Facilities Appropriation, the 
     administrative provisions section of the bill also contains 
     new language allowing for a program to provide a housing 
     subsidy to medical personnel at facilities operated by the 
     Indian Health Service. The Committees are concerned that the 
     lack of affordable and available housing plays a significant 
     role in the agency's personnel vacancy rates and contributes 
     to lowering the quality of care. The Committees expect the 
     Service to provide a plan within 90 days of enactment of this 
     Act that details how the agency plans to use this authority 
     in fiscal year 2018, including the measures it will use to 
     determine whether the authority is successful and how it 
     should be expanded in future years. The Committees have added 
     funds for accreditation emergencies that could be made 
     available for this purpose. The Committees also direct the 
     Service to work with Tribes and with the Department of 
     Housing and Urban Development to develop a long-term strategy 
     to address professional housing shortages in Indian Country 
     and to ensure that the Service and its partner agencies are 
     fully utilizing existing authorities to improve the 
     availability of housing stock.
       Workforce Development.--The Committees believe that 
     expanded workforce development training for all Service 
     personnel--including non-clinical personnel--must be part of 
     efforts to improve healthcare quality. In addition to 
     continuing skills development opportunities, the Committees 
     believe that IHS should expand its efforts to provide 
     education to all staff, and Federal employee management 
     training to facility and area leadership that will provide 
     employees a better understanding of their obligations to 
     report failures in quality of care.
       Title 38 Personnel Authorities.--The Committees are aware 
     of significant differences between the personnel authorities 
     used by the Service versus the Department of Veterans Affairs 
     (VA) under Title 38 of the United States Code. The Committees 
     believe that an analysis of these differences--which include 
     hiring and benefits authorities--may provide strategies for 
     recruiting and retaining qualified personnel in the same 
     rural and remote locations as the VA. The Committees direct 
     the Service to work with the Department of Health and Human 
     Services to analyze the differences between the two agencies' 
     personnel authorities and to submit a report no later than 90 
     days after enactment of this Act that details the differences 
     and makes specific legislative recommendations, as 
     appropriate, to provide parity between the two agencies.
       ISDEAA Contracts.--The Committees encourage the transfer of 
     amounts provided to tribal organizations for the Substance 
     Abuse and Suicide Prevention Program, for the Domestic 
     Violence Prevention Program, for the Zero Suicide Initiative, 
     for aftercare pilots at Youth Regional Treatment Centers, and 
     to improve collections from public and private insurance at 
     tribally-operated facilities to such organizations through 
     Indian Self-Determination Act compacts and contracts, and not 
     through separate grant instruments. This will ensure that 
     associated administrative costs will be covered though the 
     contract support cost process.


                         contract support costs

       The agreement continues language from fiscal year 2017 
     establishing an indefinite appropriation for contract support 
     costs estimated to be $717,970,000, which is equal to the 
     request. By retaining an indefinite appropriation for this 
     account, additional funds may be provided by the agency if 
     its budget estimate proves to be lower than necessary to meet 
     the legal obligation to pay the full amount due to Tribes. 
     The Committees believe fully funding these costs will ensure 
     Tribes have the necessary resources they need to deliver 
     program services efficiently and effectively.


                        indian health facilities

       The bill provides $867,504,000 for Indian Health 
     Facilities. In addition to the funding allocation table at 
     the end of this explanatory statement, the agreement includes 
     the following details and changes relative to fiscal year 
     2017 enacted levels:
       Staffing for New Facilities.--The agreement includes 
     $5,480,000 for staffing newly opened health facilities, which 
     is the full amount based upon updated estimates provided to 
     the Committees. The stipulations included in the ``Indian 
     Health Services'' account regarding the allocation of funds 
     pertain to this account as well.
       Current Services.--The agreement provides $4,329,000 to 
     partially cover the cost of maintaining current levels of 
     service, of which $2,440,000 is for pay costs and $1,889,000 
     is for medical inflation.
       Indian Health Care Improvement Fund.--The bill includes 
     language allowing funds in the Indian Health Care Improvement 
     Fund to be used for activities in the Facilities account.
       Maintenance and Improvement.--The agreement provides 
     $167,527,000. The Service is directed to use this increase to 
     address the backlog of essential maintenance, alteration and 
     repair (BEMAR) and to provide a spend plan within 60 days of 
     enactment of this Act detailing how IHS plans to utilize this 
     funding.
       Sanitation Facilities.--The agreement provides $192,033,000 
     for sanitation facilities construction and includes $261,000 
     for current services. The Committees expect the Service to 
     continue following its existing interpretation of criteria 
     for the funding of new, improved, or replacement sanitation 
     facilities.
       Health Care Facilities Construction.--The agreement 
     provides $243,480,000 for health care facilities construction 
     and includes $15,000,000 for small ambulatory clinics and 
     $11,489,000 for staff quarters.
       The Committees remain dedicated to providing access to 
     health care for IHS patients across the system. The IHS is 
     expected to aggressively work down the current Health 
     Facilities Construction Priority System list, as well as work 
     with the Department and Tribes to examine alternative 
     financing arrangements and meritorious regional demonstration 
     projects authorized under the Indian Health Care Improvement 
     Act that would effectively close the service gap. Within 60 
     days of enactment of this Act, the Service shall submit a 
     spending plan to the Committees on Appropriations that 
     details the project-level distribution of funds provided for 
     healthcare facilities construction.
       The Committees believe that additional funds for quarters 
     is essential to help resolve the widespread housing shortages 
     which have contributed to high vacancy rates for medical 
     personnel throughout the system, particularly in rural areas. 
     These funds have been used in areas with chronic housing 
     shortages like Alaska and the Great Plains in order to 
     ameliorate these problems. The Committees expect a report 
     from the Service within 60 days of enactment of this Act on 
     the distribution of funds.
       The Service is reminded of the directive in House Report 
     115-238 regarding the completion and publication of a gap 
     analysis.
       The Committees strongly support the small ambulatory clinic 
     program. This program provides another critical tool for 
     addressing facilities maintenance and construction backlogs 
     throughout the nation.
       In advance of the opening of the Sacred Oaks Healing Center 
     in California in late 2019, and within available funds, the 
     Service is expected to construct a left-turn lane and make 
     other safety improvements recommended by the Service's 2017 
     transportation impact study. The Service is further directed 
     to report to the House and Senate Committees on 
     Appropriations within 60 days of enactment of this Act 
     regarding the status of the project.
       Facilities and Environmental Health Support.--The agreement 
     provides $240,758,000 for facilities and environmental health 
     support and includes: $3,328,000 for current services; 
     $5,480,000 for staffing new facilities; and a $5,000,000 
     program increase to address the increased workload in 
     construction. The Service is expected to provide a spend plan 
     within 60 days of enactment of this Act for the additional 
     infrastructure funding provided above the fiscal year 2017 
     enacted level.

     and Hazard Investigation Board.


              office of navajo and hopi indian relocation

                         salaries and expenses

       The bill provides $15,431,000 for the Office of Navajo and 
     Hopi Indian Relocation. The agreement continues the direction 
     provided in the explanatory statement accompanying Division G 
     of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, P.L. 115-31. 
     The Committees remain committed to bringing the relocation 
     process to an orderly conclusion and ensuring all eligible 
     relocatees receive the relocation benefits to which they are 
     entitled. Consultation with all affected parties and agencies 
     is the key to a transparent, orderly

[[Page H2630]]

     closeout. The statute provides for termination of the Office 
     when the President determines its functions have been fully 
     discharged. That determination requires development of a 
     comprehensive plan. The Committees expect to receive a 
     progress report on development of this plan within 90 days of 
     enactment of this Act.


    institute of american indian and alaska native culture and arts 
                              development

                        payment to the institute

       The bill provides $9,835,000 for fixed costs and academic 
     program requirements of the Institute of American Indian 
     Arts.


                        smithsonian institution

                         salaries and expenses

       The agreement provides a total of $1,043,347,000 for all 
     Smithsonian Institution accounts, of which $731,444,000 is 
     provided for salaries and expenses. The Committees maintain 
     their longstanding commitment to the preservation of 
     priceless, irreplaceable Smithsonian collections and have 
     provided funds as requested for collections care and 
     preservation. The Committees continue their longstanding 
     support for the National Museum of African American History 
     and Culture (NMAAHC). Within amounts provided for the 
     Salaries and Expenses account, the NMAAHC is fully funded. 
     The Committees provide funds as requested for the 
     Institution's Latino initiatives and support the Smithsonian 
     Latino Center's goal of promoting the inclusion of Latino 
     contributions in Smithsonian Institution programs, 
     exhibitions, collections, and public outreach. The Committees 
     continue to urge collaboration between the Smithsonian Latino 
     Center and appropriate Federal and local organizations in 
     order to advance these goals and expand the American Latino 
     presence at the Institution. Further, the Committees provide 
     funds as requested for the Institution's Asian Pacific 
     American initiatives and continue to support the 
     Institution's efforts of developing programs and expanding 
     outreach to promote a better understanding of the Asian 
     Pacific American experience. Lastly, the agreement provides 
     $2,000,000 for the American Women's History Initiative within 
     Institution-wide programs.


                           facilities capital

       The agreement provides $311,903,000 for the Facilities 
     Capital account. The recommendation includes funding to 
     complete construction of the Dulles Storage Module at the 
     Udvar-Hazy Center, and $198,000,000 for the National Air and 
     Space Museum revitalization effort.
       National Air and Space Museum Revitalization.--The 
     Committees support the multi-year, multi-phase renovation of 
     the National Air and Space Museum (NASM), including the 
     replacement of the building's facade and internal building 
     systems. The recommendation includes $198,000,000 for this 
     critical revitalization effort. The Institution is directed 
     to follow the reprogramming guidelines contained in this 
     explanatory statement and may not redirect the use of these 
     funds for other capital projects without prior approval of 
     the Committees. Given the scale of the project, the 
     Committees direct the Institution to make available to the 
     Committees on a timely basis the most updated and 
     comprehensive information on project and funding 
     requirements. The Government Accountability Office is also 
     directed to continue its review and analysis of the project's 
     cost estimates, as directed in the Consolidated Appropriation 
     Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). The Committees urge the Smithsonian 
     to evaluate potential partnership opportunities that may 
     provide non-Federal funding sources to advance this and other 
     revitalization projects. The Institution is directed to 
     submit to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, 
     within 60 days of enactment of this Act, a detailed list and 
     description of projects funded within the Facilities Capital 
     account.


                        national gallery of art

                         salaries and expenses

       The agreement provides $141,790,000 for the Salaries and 
     Expenses account of the National Gallery of Art, of which not 
     to exceed $3,620,000 is for the special exhibition program.
       Harassment-Free Workplace.--The Committees believe all 
     employees have the right to a harassment-free workplace and 
     are deeply concerned by recent reports of harassment and a 
     hostile work environment at the Gallery. The Gallery is 
     expected to ensure it has strong and consistent anti-
     harassment policies in place to protect its workforce and is 
     directed to report to the Committees within 120 days of 
     enactment of this Act regarding specific corrective actions 
     it is taking to preclude additional incidents from occurring 
     in the future.


            REPAIR, RESTORATION, AND RENOVATION OF BUILDINGS

       The agreement provides $24,203,000 for the Repair, 
     Restoration, and Renovation of Buildings account and includes

       The agreement provides $12,000,000 for the Woodrow Wilson 
     International Center for Scholars.


           NATIONAL FOUNDATION ON THE ARTS AND THE HUMANITIES

                    NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS

                       GRANTS AND ADMINISTRATION

       The agreement provides $152,849,000 for the National 
     Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to continue the important work 
     of the Endowment. Changes to the enacted level are included 
     in the detail table accompanying this agreement, and the 
     agency is expected to use the increases provided for direct 
     grants to expand its Creative Forces: Military Healing Arts 
     Network and to increase grants made available to Tribes and 
     to rural and underserved areas. The Committees particularly 
     commend the NEA for its work incorporating arts therapy into 
     the treatment of active-duty military patients, veterans, and 
     their families through its Creative Forces: Military Healing 
     Arts Network. This successful program places creative arts 
     therapies at the core of patient-centered care and increases 
     access to therapeutic arts therapies at Walter Reed National 
     Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, and 
     eleven other clinical sites across the United States. The 
     Committees support the expansion of this successful program 
     to assist service members and their families in their 
     recovery, reintegration, and transition to civilian life. The 
     Committees also urge State arts agencies to explore how they 
     can contribute to expanding arts programs for service members 
     and their families at the local level. The Committees 
     acknowledge there are currently vacancies on the National 
     Council on the Arts and many members have agreed to continue 
     to serve even though their term has expired. While the 
     Council has the ability to operate and conduct important 
     work, the Committees encourage the timely appointment of 
     members. The Committees value greatly the longstanding 
     collaborative relationship between the NEA and the States. 
     The Committees direct that priority be given to providing 
     services and grant funding for projects, productions, or 
     programs that encourage public knowledge, education, 
     understanding, and appreciation of the arts. The Committees 
     maintain support for the 40 percent allocation for State arts 
     agencies as allocated in previous years. Any reduction in 
     support to the States for arts education should be no more 
     than proportional to other funding decreases taken in other 
     NEA programs.


                 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES

                       GRANTS AND ADMINISTRATION

       The agreement provides $152,848,000 for the National 
     Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to continue the important 
     work of the Endowment. Changes to the enacted level are 
     included in the detail table accompanying this agreement, and 
     the agency is expected to use increases provided to expand 
     its work with Tribes to preserve Native languages and culture 
     as detailed below as well as to support other local history 
     preservation initiatives. Funds are also provided within the 
     Challenge Grants program to support NEH's local 
     infrastructure and capacity building grant program. The 
     Committees acknowledge there are currently vacancies on the 
     National Council on the Humanities and many members have 
     agreed to continue to serve even though their term has 
     expired. While the Council has the ability to operate and 
     conduct important work, the Committees encourage the timely 
     appointment of members. The Committees commend the NEH for 
     its support of grant programs to benefit wounded warriors and 
     to ensure educational opportunities for American heroes 
     transitioning to civilian life. The Committees commend the 
     NEH for its ongoing support to American Indian and Alaska 
     Native communities in preserving their cultural and 
     linguistic heritage through the Documenting Endangered 
     Languages program and a variety of preservation and access 
     grants that enable American Indian and Alaska Native 
     communities to preserve cultural artifacts and make them 
     broadly accessible. The Committees also support NEH efforts 
     to provide educational opportunities for tribal communities 
     through Humanities Initiatives at Tribal Colleges and 
     Universities. The Committees commend the NEH Federal/State 
     partnership for its ongoing, successful collaboration with 
     State humanities councils in each of the 50 States as well as 
     Washington, DC, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. 
     Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
     Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. The Committees urge the 
     NEH to provide program funding to support the critical work 
     of State humanities councils consistent with guidance 
     provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 
     115-31). The Committees encourage NEH to continue providing 
     support to two popular components of the ``We the People'' 
     initiative, the National Digital Newspapers Program (NDNP) 
     and the Landmarks of American History and Culture workshop 
     that focus on our Nation's history and culture.
