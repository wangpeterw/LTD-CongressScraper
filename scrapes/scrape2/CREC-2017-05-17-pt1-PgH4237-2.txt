                     HONORING BEN AND DAN MATHESON

  (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring to the House's attention two 
fine Texans who are sitting up in the House gallery, Ben and Dan 
Matheson.
  Ben has been on my Air Force advisory committee down in Texas for the 
entire 32 years that I have been in Congress. He and the other two 
members of that nominating committee have recommended to me over 100 
young men and women whom we have nominated to the Air Force Academy and 
who are now serving, defending our Nation.
  His son is Dan Matheson, one of my best friends, a proud graduate of 
the University of Texas Law School, former head of the Texas State Fed 
office, and a successful practicing attorney in Austin, Texas.
  I am very proud to have their friendship, and I am glad to bring to 
the attention of the House these two fine Americans.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds Members not to refer to 
persons in the gallery.
