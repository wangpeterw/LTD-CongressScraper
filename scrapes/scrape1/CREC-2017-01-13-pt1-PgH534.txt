MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. DAY OF SERVICE AT CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA FOOD BANK

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend hisremarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, I will honor 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s, legacy by volunteering mytime to help 
veterans in my community. Congressman Scott Perry of Pennsylvania's 
Fourth District and I will be at theCentral Pennsylvania Food Bank in 
Harrisburg to pack boxes for the MilitaryShare program.
  MilitaryShare is a program that serves fresh, nutritious meals to 
families with at least one member who has served in themilitary. This 
program assists area veterans and their families to ensure they do not 
go hungry.
  Our veterans have numerous needs when they leave the military, and 
many of them are life-threatening challenges as a resultof combat such 
as post-traumatic stress injury. When we help meet the nutritional 
needs of military families, it allows them tofocus on other pressing 
issues such as joblessness or treatment for combat-related health 
issues.
  MilitaryShare serves more than 4,000 households in central 
Pennsylvania, which translates to about 10,000 people a month.
  Mr. Speaker, to serve one's country is a noble and selfless act. The 
very least we can do is to help our veterans transitionto civilian life 
when they return home.
