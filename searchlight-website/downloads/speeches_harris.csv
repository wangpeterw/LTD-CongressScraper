Black women have long gone above and beyond the call of duty in their contributions to American civic society, particularly when it comes to voter turnout and political participation. They have routinely stepped up as leaders and bulwarks in their communities, sacrificing their own health and time for the betterment of others. Even in the face of grave oppression dating back to our Nation's origins, Black women have continued to stand strong and contribute to the well-being of families, communities, the economy, and our country as a whole. A recognition of the Week on the Status of Black Women would send a critical message that the government wishes to elevate Black women's role in history and contemporary society and recognizes the unique struggles they continue to experience today.[[Page S1942]]  Black women have played a critical role in this Nation's history and evolution, often with little thanks or recognition. Harriet Tubman escaped slavery and bravely returned to the enslaved South over a dozen times to herald her people to freedom on the Underground She served in the Union army as a spy, a medic, and the first woman ever to lead an armed expedition; yet despite this immense service to our country, we are still debating her recognition on our currency. A century later, Rosa Parks resisted the continued oppression and marginalization of her people. Before she was the face and organizational leader of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, she led campaigns against the sexual harassment and assault of Black women. The Week on the Status of Black Women offers us a chance to honor and uplift the sacrifices of Black women such as Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks, who gave us so much and received so little in return.  It gives us an opportunity to add new names to celebrate to this list, for contributions that build the future as much as they ground the past. This week of recognition honors so many of whom we are proud, an infinite list at which we can only hint. It includes those hidden figures who did the math to get us to the stars--Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Christine Darden--and the interstellar figures who have actually been there, like Mae Jemmison, the first African-American woman astronaut to travel in space; those consciousness raisers who provoked thought and progress in a country that needed to catch up with them, like Pauli Murray, who graduated first in her class from Howard Law and offered up the visionary arguments that won Brown v. Board of Education, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who has issued an international invitation to embrace feminism; those courageous testifiers who spoke out with such foresight, from Anita Hill's willingness to speak her own truth to power, to Tarana Burke, whose compassionate decision to say ``Me Too'' inspired and named a movement that is changing the world; those athletes and artists who inspire us with their unprecedented feats and the lyricism of their movement, from American Ballet Theater's principal dancer Misty Copeland to America's swiftest young icon on ice, Maame Biney; and those who hold and disseminate knowledge, expanding our horizons and our minds, like Monica Drake, who last year became the first African-American woman on the New York Times' print masthead, and Carla Hayden, a visionary librarian who is the first woman and first African American to lead the Library of Congress, the largest library in the world.  We celebrate that this momentous week gives us an opportunity to both enrich the historical record, and to enliven our future possibilities. We know that raising the stories of Black women in every walk of life teaches little girls to see themselves in all their full and powerful potential.  As we anticipate the future, we must also stand to recognize that, while Black women have dedicated themselves to bettering our country, they continue to face countless barriers to full inclusion and equality in American society. Black women are disproportionately subject to compromising health conditions, such as poor-quality environments in impoverished neighborhoods, food deserts, and a lack of access to basic healthcare--conditions that make them more susceptible to life-threatening diseases such as HIV and heart disease and which often make highly treatable illnesses, like breast cancer, lethal. Single Black women's median wealth is just $100, while single White women have a median wealth of $41,000; and White households have a median wealth of 13 times more than Black households. Even more alarming, around half of single Black women have zero or negative wealth, meaning their debt equals or exceeds their assets. On average, Black women workers are paid only 67 cents on the dollar relative to White non-Hispanic men, even after controlling for education, years of experience, and location.  Further, while Black women, especially trans Black women, are exceptionally vulnerable to violence, both at the hands of the state and at the hands of intimate partners, often they are not listened to or believed when they speak out. On all these fronts, we can and must do better, and we will.  In conjunction with the congressional declaration, a coalition of organizations advocating for the well-being of women and communities of color will partner to elevate the stories, histories, and realities of Black women's lives through a series of events entitled ``Her Dream Deferred''. These events will address a number of issues facing Black women today, including maternal mortality, sexual assault and harassment, political participation, and police violence through artistic expression and academic fora.  Exploring these issues and acknowledging the centrality of Black women to our history and social fabric, along with recognizing the uniquely gendered and racialized inequities they face, is critical as we seek to extend equal rights to all We hope and request that this year will be a continuation of years past in celebration and recognition of Black women through the Week on the Status of Black  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1941-3.txt,CREC-2018-03-22-pt1-PgS1941-3.xml,WEEK ON THE STATUS OF BLACK WOMEN,2018,22,March
13761,2301,Kamala,HARRIS,REPRESENTATIVE,D,CA,1.0,H001075,115,13761,topic-id,2112,"Mr.President, I would like to thank the senior Senator from Senator Durbin has been a longstanding leader in this Chamber and in our country on this issue, and I can't thank him enough for all he does so tirelessly. I see his work behind closed doors, and I know his passion and personal commitment to this issue. I thank the Senator from  Mr.President, on February 16 of this year, which was 292 days ago, I offered my maiden speech as a new Member of the U.The subject of the speech was immigration--in particular, an emphasis on DACA and the Here we are 292 days later, and we have failed to move forward in any substantial or substantive way in bringing relief to these Dreamers who have qualified for DACA status. So we stand here, these 292 days later, talking about an issue that we must ultimately, and before the end of this year, resolve.  Let's also be clear that 3 months ago today, on September 5 of this year, the administration arbitrarily, recklessly, and cruelly ended DACA--the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA allowed young immigrants who were brought here by their parents to live and work in this country without fear that they would be deported. Later this week, on Friday, December 8, funding for the government runs out. I have been clear, along with my friend from Illinois and several other colleagues, that any bill that funds the government must also include a fix for  I want to talk with you about why I believe it is important that we resolve this issue. I do believe there is a lot of misinformation out there. I think it is important that we as policymakers, as leaders in our country, craft and create public policy based on facts, not on misinformation and certainly not fear.  Let's begin by being very clear. The decision to rescind DACA is part of a much broader and troubling attempt to remake the demographics of the country by cracking down on immigrants. We have an administration that has ignited anti-immigrant sentiment, characterizing immigrants as rapists and murderers and people who are going to steal your jobs. We have an administration that has implemented an aggressive anti-immigrant agenda. This administration has called for a border wall that could cost up to $70 billion. They have implemented Muslim bans which severely restrict immigration from six Muslim-majority countries. They have requested 10,000 new ICE agents and 5,000 new Border Patrol agents when they have not given the resources to be able to fill all the vacant positions they now have. They have ended the protected immigration status, known as TPS, for Haitians and Nicaraguans who fled disasters and may crack down on the protective status on Salvadorans as well. They are seeking to lower the refugee cap from 110,000 to 45,000 at a time when we have seen an increase in the worldwide number of refugees who are in crisis. This is the lowest number ever in the history of this country--actually, since 1980. John Kelly, the President's Chief of Staff and former Homeland Security Secretary, said that he wishes the number of refugees we would admit into our country were between zero and one.  I want to be clear. I have an incredible amount of respect for the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security, who each day leave their homes, committed to doing the work of keeping our homeland secure. It is noble and important work, and their mission is critical. I believe the vast majority of those frontline agents are doing their jobs honorably and effectively, but it is troubling when the White House has encouraged frontline agents to ``take the shackles off.'' In fact, the Acting ICE Director has said:       If you're an immigrant in this country illegally . . . you      should be uncomfortable. You should look over your shoulder.  When you look at these independent acts, there is a clear constellation that has formed. This enforcement surge is a barely disguised purge. This is not leadership. Leaders should not be in the business of inciting fear and sowing hate and division. Instead, leaders should be about creating smart public policy based on facts. So here are some of the facts.  It is a fact that there are 700,000 DACA recipients, 200,000 of whom are in California alone.  It is a fact that the Dreamers have been extensively vetted before they have qualified for They have gone through a process. They have turned over copious amounts of paperwork with incredible detail. They have gone through background checks. They have given personal information about the circumstances of their arrivals. They have answered questions that seek to figure out whether they have committed crimes. If they applied and they received DACA status, we determined that they were not threats in that regard to our public safety. We asked questions that sought to figure out if they have graduated high school. Are they living lawful and productive lives? It is only when they cleared that extensive vetting that they qualified for DACA status and received DACA status.  Let's be clear. These Dreamers who receive DACA status study in our colleges, serve in our military, and work in Fortune 100 companies. They are contributing to our economy in a way that we all are benefiting. If DACA recipients were to be deported, it is estimated that California would lose $11 billion a year. The U.economy as a whole would lose an estimated $460 billion over a decade.  It is also a fact that these young people have stood in classrooms and stood in line in many places and have placed their hands over their hearts, pledging allegiance to the flag of the United States--a flag that many of us wear on our lapels, a flag that represents the best of what we are in terms of the ideals upon which we were founded. We must be true to those ideals and consistent in the way that we approach so many issues as applied to this issue about what we do with these DACA kids. We must keep our word and our promise to them and guarantee what we promised, which is that we would not share their personal information with ICE and that they would not be deported if they continued to follow the rules.  In my experience, it is also true that many who have opinions or who have expressed opinions or who have the opportunity to make decisions about this issue have never met a We cannot fault them, but what we can ask is that those who have the power to make a decision on this issue make it their business and make an effort to really understand who we are talking about. Senator Durbin talked about it, and Senator Carper talked about it. My colleagues will be talking about who these Dreamers are, who these young people are.  I have to say that I have been a bit troubled when I have had this conversation. I remember when I had a conversation many months ago with the then-nominee to head up the Department of Homeland Security, John I asked him if he had ever[[Page S7855]]met a Dreamer, and he said that he had not. When I asked him if I could arrange a meeting, he then went on to say: How about if I could take a meeting, instead, with their representatives? That is disheartening.  Before our colleagues make a decision about where they stand on this policy, I believe that it is only fair--it is only the right thing to do--that they make an effort to sit down and talk with Dreamers and get to understand who they are, the circumstances of their arrivals, and how they are contributing to our country.  There are going to be hundreds of Dreamers here tomorrow on Capitol I want to thank them for their leadership and their tireless advocacy because their stories will change hearts and minds. Let me just speak of a few. My colleagues have shared some; I will share some others.  I met Yuriana Aguilar, whom I took to the President's joint session address this Her parents brought her here from Mexico when she was just 5 years old. She grew up in Fresno, She attended public schools, and she attended UC She was the first DACA recipient to earn a Ph.and now is a biomedical researcher in Chicago who is focused on the human heart. She is doing everything that she can to improve the condition and the lives of the people in our country because of the work she has done and the research she has done.  I met Eric Yang, who came from South He grew up in Irvine, CA, and is now studying business economics at UC Irvine, where he works to help other students.  My husband and I recently attended a play in Los It is a great program at which there is free entertainment in the community park, and families show up and have a wonderful evening outdoors with each other in fellowship. I met a young woman who came up to me. She was with a group of friends.  Her friends said: Tell her. Tell her.  I looked at this young woman. She looked as if she was about maybe 19 years old.  I said: Tell me what? Tell me what is going on.  She looked at me, and she spoke so quietly that I didn't hear what she had said, so I asked her to repeat herself. She looked at me, and she started crying.  She said: I am  She was trembling as she cried, absolutely in fear of what her future may hold.  I suggest that before we take a position on this issue, we take a moment, each one of us as colleagues and each one of us as individuals, to see these young people, to truly see them--to see them not through a lens that is about partisanship or politics, not through a lens that is ideological, but based on who they really are and the practical realities of the lives they lived that brought them to this country, the circumstances that brought them to this country, and the lives they are living every day now.  These are incredible young people who are doing everything that we hope and pray will epitomize the American dream--work hard, be respectful, play by the rules, contribute to your community, have dreams and aspirations about how you can be productive. That is who these young people are.  Let's reject the fearmongering. Let's also understand that this is an imminent issue and that this is something we must address immediately. Let's agree that each day in the lives of these young people is a very long time. Each day that they go to sleep at night and are worried about a knock on the door at midnight that might tear them away from their families is a very long time. Let's not wait. Let's not wait to help them.  Let's reject those folks who say that there is no crisis, the folks who say that this is not an emergency. Let's understand that for these 700,000 Dreamers who cannot concentrate at school or at work and who are terrified of that midnight knock, this is an emergency. Let's think about the classmates and the coworkers and our neighbors and family members who have these children who are terrified that this protected status will be stripped and taken away. For them, this is an emergency.  Let's think about the 122 Dreamers who are losing their DACA status every single day, 851 of them every week, over 11,000 of them since Let's agree that this is a crisis, that this is an emergency. It has been 91 days since this administration ended DACA, and we cannot wait a single day longer.  Let's reject the fearmongering. Let's find a bipartisan consensus to act in the way that we know we should and can. Let's put the Dream Act to a vote today. I believe it could pass and would pass if everyone looked in their hearts and looked at the facts.  Today, 35 House Republicans signed a letter, writing that they want a DACA fix before the end of the year. It included Members from California and Texas and Florida and Utah and Pennsylvania and New Earlier today, my colleague, the junior Senator from Arizona, said:       We don't need to make a statement. We need to make a law.  I could not agree more. Let's give these Dreamers a future.  I yield the floor.

She has been an extraordinary hero of mine, personally, and so many of us look to her leadership. So I thank her--and for her speaking on the nomination of Judge  Across the street from this Chamber stands the U.Supreme Above its doors are the words ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' As Senators, we have a solemn responsibility to ensure that every man and woman who sits on that Court upholds that ideal. As a U.Senator, I take that responsibility extremely seriously.  Almost two decades after the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, I was part of only the second class to integrate the Berkeley, CA, public schools. If the Court had ruled differently, I likely would not have become a lawyer or a prosecutor or a district attorney or the Attorney General of California, and I certainly would not be standing here today as a U. I know from personal experience just how profoundly the Court's decisions touch every aspect of Americans' lives, and for that reason, I rise to join my colleagues in strong opposition to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme  As we know, Judge Gorsuch went through 4 days of hearings in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and here is what we learned: We learned that Judge Gorsuch refused to answer the most basic of questions. He initially even refused to share his views on Brown v. Board of We learned that Judge Gorsuch has a deeply conservative worldview. And we learned that Judge Gorsuch interprets the law in a theoretical bubble, completely detached from the real world--as he puts it, ``focusing backward, not forward.'' If Judge Gorsuch joins the U.Supreme Court, his narrow approach would do real harm to real people, especially the women of  America deserves a Supreme Court Justice who will protect a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own health. Judge Gorsuch will not. Judge Gorsuch carefully avoided speaking about abortion, but he has clearly demonstrated a hostility to women's access to healthcare.  Last year, when the court he sits on sided with Planned Parenthood, Judge Gorsuch took the highly unusual step of asking the court to hear the case again.  Judge Gorsuch determined that a 13,000-person, for-profit corporation was entitled to exercise the same religious beliefs as a person. That meant the company did not have to provide employees birth control coverage and could impose the company's religious beliefs on all of its female employees. I ask my colleagues, why does Judge Gorsuch seem to believe that corporations deserve full rights and protections but women don't?  As we mark Equal Pay Day today, Americans deserve a Supreme Court Justice who will protect the rights of women in the workplace. Judge Gorsuch won't. In employment discrimination cases, Judge Gorsuch has consistently sided with companies against their employees. These employees include women like Betty The facts of the case were undisputed. Her boss repeatedly asked her about her sexual habits and breast size and invited her to his home--then fired her when she reported his sexual harassment. Judge Gorsuch ruled against Why? Well, part of his justification that he offered was that she waited 2 months before reporting the harassment.  Americans deserve a Supreme Court Justice who upholds the rights of all women, including transgender women. Judge Gorsuch won't. When a transgender inmate claimed that the prison's practice of starting and stopping her hormone treatment was a violation of her rights, Judge Gorsuch disagreed.[[Page S2197]]  As the National Women's Law Center observed, his ``record reveals a troubling pattern of narrowly approaching the legal principles upon which everyday women across the Nation rely.'' They write that his appointment ``would mean a serious setback for women in this country and for generations to come.''  But judging by his record, if Judge Gorsuch becomes Justice Gorsuch, women won't be the only ones facing setbacks. Take Luke, a young boy with autism whose parents sought financial assistance after switching him from public school to a school specializing in autism education. Judge Gorsuch ruled that the minimal support Luke received in public school was good enough. People in the autism community were up in arms. And in the middle of a Senate hearing 2 weeks ago, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Judge Gorsuch was wrong on the law.  Consider Alphonse Maddin was a trucker who got stuck on the road in subzero temperatures--minus 27 degrees, as he recalls--and abandoned his trailer to seek help and save his life. For leaving the trailer, he was fired. Judge Gorsuch wrote that the company was entitled to fire Maddin for not enduring the cold and for not staying in his freezing truck.  Then there is Grace Hwang, a professor diagnosed with cancer. She sued when her university refused to provide the medical leave her doctor recommended. Judge Gorsuch called the university's decision ``reasonable'' and rejected her lawsuit. Sadly, Grace died last summer.  Judge Gorsuch has Ivy League credentials, but his record shows he lacks sound judgment to uphold justice. He ignores the complexities of human beings--the humiliating sting of harassment, the fear of a cancer patient or a worker who feels his life is in danger. In short, his rulings lack a basic sense of empathy. Judge Gorsuch understands the text of the law, to be sure, but he has repeatedly failed to show that he fully understands those important words: ``equal justice under law.''

My heart breaks, as I know all of us feel for the 42 people and their families whose lives were ended in these fires. There were 42 people in this region who lost their lives. In addition, more than 8,400 homes and buildings were destroyed. For example, in Santa Rosa, 5 percent of the entire housing stock is gone. Many of the folks in these neighborhoods are middle-class families--working families. They are plumbers and teachers and first responders who were barely able to meet their mortgage. The fires have scorched more than 245,000 acres, and 100,000 Californians were forced to evacuate.  I must tell you, I am in awe of the work of the firefighters and first responders who fought tirelessly day and night. I heard stories of firefighters who worked 80 hours straight to do the work of evacuation, ensuring that no lives were lost and no lives were in peril. I am in awe of their work.  I met a firefighter. His first name is Paul, who, when I met him, was finally taking a moment of rest from the firefighting he had been doing. He was wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt and flip-flops he borrowed from another firefighter because he lost his home and everything he had. Yet there he was on the frontlines fighting to make sure no other Californians, no other people faced the kind of devastation he faced.  There were more than 11,000 total firefighters who went to the fire. Some were from other States and even other countries. They deserve our thanks. I stand here in the U.Senate to thank them for the work they did, coming to California and helping us deal with this crisis.  First responders and medical professionals did important work as well. Fifty-one doctors from Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital who lost their homes and possessions still stayed overtime to help crowded emergency rooms full of patients. I am uplifted by what I know, and the world now sees, which is the character of People rushed to help the elderly in nursing homes evacuate. I heard the story of a doctor who used his motorcycle to save newborn babies from a neonatal unit.  Now these folks need our help. Senator Feinstein and I will continue to demand FEMA resources, which include the need for housing, individual assistance, transportation, and water infrastructure. We need to make sure all Californians, regardless of status, can get help at the shelters.  I spoke with DHS Acting Secretary Elaine Duke and confirmed that ICE will suspend immigration enforcement in the area until further notice. It is our belief, and it is our understanding as Californians, that notice will be clear as to when this effort will end, in terms of not enforcing immigration. We want to be clear when it is going to start so we can tell Californians because right now they are trusting DHS's word that this immigration enforcement has been suspended. We are told that FEMA, through Elaine Duke, will also support emergency packages that provide disaster relief for the hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin  California is resilient and will rebuild, but we need help. More than 12,000 constituents have contacted our office, and we will continue to work with FEMA, HUD, the Small Business Administration, and the USDA to ensure that those affected in my State will get all the relief that is necessary.  Congress needs to fund programs like community development block grants and section 8 housing to help provide affordable housing for low- and middle-class residents. They need the help to find affordable housing. California is facing an affordable housing crisis like many other States in our country, and this is something that has been highlighted by the devastation these various States and territories have experienced recently, but it is an ongoing issue we must deal with.  We cannot stop there. We need larger supplemental emergency packages that include helping This has to be a long-term commitment. California is experiencing the worst fires in history, and they are becoming more frequent. In the 1980s, fires burned and wildfires burned under 25 acres, on average. Now typical wildfires will burn over 100 acres. California's 2017 fire season has not yet ended, and it has already burned more acres than the average for the past 5 years. In Southern California, from Kern County to San Diego, red flag warnings are occurring as we speak. There are currently up to 55 mile-an-hour winds and warm, dry weather, with no humidity or very little humidity. These are the conditions that were at play during the most recent wildfire crisis.  We must also look at the future and how we can prevent wildfires from reaching this magnitude as we go forward. We must pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding  Today, over half of the U.Forest Service budget is dedicated to combating wildfires, compared to just 13 percent of the budget in 1993. The wildfires are treated differently than floods or hurricanes. The Forest Service is not allowed to use general disaster relief funds at FEMA, and that makes no sense.  Prevention is cheaper than reaction. The U.Forest Service estimated that there are 6.3 billion dead trees in the Western Removing them would improve safety by mitigating wildfires. Also, it would have an economic benefit and create jobs. There are certain bills, and the bill I mentioned, that will help achieve this because it will allow the Forest Service to dedicate part of the budget to forest management and not just reacting.  We must listen to the experts. For example, CAL FIRE agrees. Too often, States are picking up the bill for prevention in forest management, and we should make it very clear that fires are not partisan. This bill I mentioned, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, is a bipartisan bill, and it should be inserted cleanly into the next supplemental emergency package.  Finally, let's recognize the connection between these disasters and climate change. California is leading the way and preparing for increasing wildfires, but the Federal Government needs to do its part. Natural disasters from fires to hurricanes, to floods do not discriminate by region or by party. We must help each other when these travesties hit, but also we must prepare for the future.  In closing, I would suggest and urge our colleagues to pass the supplemental bill and future emergency resources, ensure that Federal agencies deliver prompt help on the ground, and pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-10-24-pt1-PgS6721-4.txt,CREC-2017-10-24-pt1-PgS6721-4.xml,BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIP ACT OF 2017,2017,24,October
13778,2301,Kamala,HARRIS,REPRESENTATIVE,D,CA,1.0,H001075,115,13778,topic-id,3221,"Mr.President, I rise to celebrate the anniversary of one of the most significant legislative achievements in American history, the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as  I rise in strong opposition to the American Health Care Act, a callous and carelessly written bill that would roll back progress and strip health insurance from millions of  I rise on behalf of people like Chrystal from my home State of You see, I know She works in my dentist's office. In early 2011, just after I was elected attorney general of California, I went in for a checkup. It had been a while since I had seen her. Chrystal asked me how I had been, and I asked her how she had been, and then she shared with me great news. She was pregnant.  As a dental hygienist, she was working for a few different dentists and wasn't on the payroll of any of them as a full-time employee. This was before the ACA was in place, so Chrystal was on private insurance with only basic coverage, just enough to cover her annual exams.  When Chrystal found out she was pregnant, she went to her insurance company to apply for prenatal coverage. She was denied. When I asked her why, she told me that they said she had a preexisting condition. So you can imagine I asked her: Are you OK? What is wrong? What is the preexisting condition?  She told me she was pregnant.  When she applied to another healthcare company for insurance, again, she was denied. Why? Preexisting condition. What was it? She was pregnant.  So this young woman was forced to go into her sixth month of pregnancy before she received a sonogram. Instead, thankfully, there was a free clinic in San Francisco, so she could get her prenatal care.  Thank God she had a strong and beautiful baby boy. His name is They are both doing well today.  Thank God that situation is no longer the reality for millions of  I share Chrystal's story to remind us what America's healthcare system looked like only a few years ago.  We should not forget that before the ACA, 48 million Americans lacked health insurance. That is more people than the entire country of  Before the ACA, when these people got sick, they had three choices: Go without treatment, go to the emergency room, or go broke.  Before the ACA, 129 million people--almost one out of every two Americans--could be denied insurance coverage because of preexisting conditions. And the minute you got sick, your insurer could dig up some flimsy reason to drop your coverage. You could be denied coverage for chemotherapy or insulin if you had cancer or diabetes. You could be denied prenatal coverage if you were pregnant, like You could even be denied health coverage if you were a victim of domestic violence.  Before the ACA, healthcare costs were crushing low-income and middle-class Premiums--which, of course, are those monthly bills that we all pay for our insurance--were going up and up. Sky-high medical bills were the 1 reason Americans went broke, causing them to sell their homes, their cars, and even pawn their jewelry to pay off their debts.  One of the worst things about facing the healthcare system without coverage before the ACA was that it left you feeling utterly alone. Most Americans know what I am talking about: that knot in your stomach when you know there is something wrong with your health or the health of your child or your parent, but you are not sure what it is, whether it can be fixed or whether your insurance will cover it, and the frustration, the anger as you try to make sense of the fine print and codes on the medical bill that has so many zeros.  How many of us have walked into an emergency room with a loved one and felt time just stop? Maybe it was with your child who was running a fever or having trouble breathing. Maybe your partner is being rushed in with a possible heart attack. All you will know is that something is wrong. All you know is that you are overwhelmed and scared, and you know that you should not also have to fight on the phone with an insurance company or wonder if a doctor will even see you at all. That is how millions and millions of Americans experienced our healthcare system.  It was not right or fair. So the ACA set out to make things better, and 7 years ago today, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It finally extended good, affordable health insurance to Americans like Chrystal all across the Vice President Biden was absolutely right when, at the time, he said that it was a ``big''--and then I will not quote the next word; let's call it blanking--``deal.''  It is a shame that people have been playing politics with this law and with America's health. The former Speaker of the House said that the ACA would be ``Armageddon.'' A Republican Presidential candidate who now sits in the Cabinet called the ACA--and these are his actual words--``the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.''  Earlier this month, the President of the United States tweeted that the ACA is ``a complete and total disaster.'' Well, I say: Tell that to the people of California because when a State wants to make the ACA work, it works--whether that is California or Kentucky, and real people living real lives know it.  For example, I recently heard from Myra from Sherman Oaks, CA, who was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. She wrote:       Before ObamaCare, my husband and I lived under constant      stress due to our lack of good health insurance.  But, because of the ACA, Myra told me:       We had a Silver Blue Shield plan that covered . . . well      over a million dollars in bills to date. I am happy to report      I am now well, but without insurance, I was facing a death      sentence. Without the ACA, we would certainly have had to      sell our home to pay my bills and try to figure out how to      make ends meet.  She wrote that it covered well over a million dollars. That is what the ACA does.  Here is how Cindy of from Oakley, CA, has experienced real life. She wrote:       My daughter was diagnosed with an eating disorder at 13      years old and I can directly thank the excellent care      received at Kaiser Northern California for her good health      today at age 17. Without the ACA and the mental health parity      it helps provide . . . I would not have had treatment options      available to me.  Again, coverage for mental health treatment--that is what the ACA does.  Honoree, a single mom from Samoa, CA, living with a spinal cord injury that has kept her from working for 3\1/2\ years, wrote to me and said:       I wanted to let you know that I love ObamaCare! My      healthcare has steadily improved since the ACA was enacted. .      . . I can't tell you how AMAZING it felt to get my teeth      cleaned and cared for after waiting more than a decade.       I walked around for weeks saying, ``thanks, ObamaCare!''      whenever I sensed how good my teeth felt.       I would be saddened to see the ACA get scrapped. It's made      a huge difference in our lives. Actually, I'd be more than      saddened, I'd be very scared.  Again, this is testimony about the ACA, in this case about dental coverage and improved healthcare. That is what the ACA does.  I will state that I believe there is a huge disconnect between the over-the-top criticism of the ACA and the law's actual impact. There is a disconnect between the politics and how people are actually living and thriving under the In fact, in a recent poll, one in three Americans didn't even realize that the ACA and ObamaCare were actually the same thing, and they are. So, everybody, let's be clear about this. The Affordable Care Act is ObamaCare, and ObamaCare is the Affordable Care  We all know, of course, that there are ways to improve the ACA, but ending it is not the answer. The truth is that the ACA has largely done what it was supposed to do--expand, protect, and reduce--expand coverage, protect consumers, and reduce the pace of rising healthcare costs. Thanks to the ACA and Medicaid expansion, 20 million[[Page S1953]]more Americans have health insurance. That is the population of the entire State of New Thanks to the ACA, premiums are going up at the slowest rate in half a century. Thanks to the ACA, doctors are innovating and providing better preventive care, from keeping people out of the hospital to delivering healthier babies. Thanks to the ACA, insurers cannot set lifetime limits on your care, meaning your insurance company won't tell you in the middle of a cancer treatment that they have paid all they ever will. Thanks to the ACA, millions of underserved Americans in rural towns and in cities and everywhere in between have access to care for the first time. Thanks to the ACA, young people can stay on their parents' insurance until they are 26. Thanks to the ACA, 55 million women have insurance that works--mammograms, checkups, and birth control with no copays. When you pick up your prescription at the pharmacy and see that the bill is zero dollars, well, that is the And thanks to the ACA, you can't be discriminated against if you have a preexisting condition, including that preexisting condition called being a woman.  Of course, navigating the healthcare system is still daunting, but things are better. There are now some rules of the road to keep insurance companies from taking advantage of you during some of life's most vulnerable moments. Because of the ACA, because of ObamaCare, you can sleep a little easier at night and know that your care will be there when you need it.  Let's fast-forward to today. Today, we mark the seventh anniversary of this historic life-changing law. But all that it covers and protects could also be ripped away, and that is because of the American Health Care Act, the Republican healthcare plan on the House side. That is what it will do--rip it all away.  They have done their best to mislead folks about their plan. They have criticized objective news reports, and they even questioned the Congressional Budget Office--which, as we know, is, by the way, a nonpartisan, independent office which crunched the numbers and found that this new plan would cause millions of Americans to lose insurance coverage.  Before we leap on to this new bill, let's all ask some key questions. Let's all take a good look at what this plan really would and would not do.  First, will this bill provide insurance for everybody, as President Trump promised? Well, the answer is no. In fact, the independent Congressional Budget Office says that under the GOP plan, 24 million Americans will lose their health insurance by the end of the decade. That is equal to the population of 15 States combined.  Who are these people? These are middle-class families, our Nation's teachers, veterans, truckdrivers, nurses, and farmers. These families include those who struggle with opioid addiction, have a child that needs support for autism, or have an aging parent who needs a nursing home. This bill threatens them all.  Let's ask: Will the plan help the folks who need care most? The answer is no. The House Republican plan's flat tax credits are based only on age, with no consideration of income level. So what that means is that a 40-year-old cashier making $10,000 gets the exact same amount as the 40-year-old banker making $74,000 a year. It doesn't matter whether you live in downtown Manhattan or the Cleveland suburbs or rural  Let's ask: Will monthly costs go down for low-income and middle-class families who are stretched horribly thin right now? The answer is no. According to that same independent analysis, the Republican plan will immediately increase American families' premiums by 15 to 20 percent, with higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs after that. In the next decade, a person in their fifties could see their insurance costs go up 850 percent. Their insurance costs can go up 850 percent.  Let's ask: What about our seniors--will their monthly costs go down? Sadly, the answer is no. The Republican plan lets insurers charge seniors five times as much as other Americans, meaning that high cholesterol your doctor diagnosed could cost you $3,200 more a month.  Let's ask: Will all women still have access to affordable family planning? The answer is no. This new bill will give Americans choice in healthcare, but the women of America will not have choice. The bill denies women tax credits if they get a plan that covers abortions. It prohibits Planned Parenthood from providing care for millions on Some 2.5 million patients choose Planned Parenthood every year, including roughly 1 million in They should be able to see the provider they choose and trust.  Let's ask: Will this new plan protect Medicaid, as President Trump promised? Well, the answer is no. Medicaid covers many people whose jobs don't offer healthcare, and it also pays for half of all the births in this It supports people with disabilities and children with special needs. Most people don't realize that Medicaid is the primary payer for treatment of opioid addiction and substance abuse. But this new plan being offered by House Republicans would roll back Medicaid coverage and cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid benefits over the next decade.  Let's ask: Does the plan put American families ahead of insurance companies? The answer, tragically, is no. Under this plan, if you lose your job and it takes more than 2 months to find another, you will be charged a 30-percent penalty on top of the monthly costs you are already paying. That money goes right into the insurance company's pockets.  So, by now, you are probably wondering: Who exactly does this bill help? Well, here is your answer. It gives millionaires a $50,000 average tax cut every year. It gives the top 0.1 percent in this country a $195,000 tax cut every year. It gives insurance companies a $145 billion tax break over the next decade. The President and the Speaker want you to believe that this plan is good for American families, but under their bill, the only thing that gets healthier are the insurance companies' bottom line.  As far as California is concerned, this bill would devastate our families. Here are the facts, and, frankly, here is the fight. Over 5 million Californians have received insurance through the Affordable Care I say they are worth fighting for.  Since the ACA went into effect, California's uninsured population has been cut almost in half, from 17 percent to about 7 percent. I say they are worth fighting for.  Medi-Cal went from covering 8.5 million Americans to 13.5 million today. One in two children are covered under I say they are worth fighting for.  The community clinics and health centers that so many Californians rely on would be cut back or closed. I say they are worth fighting for.  A UC Berkeley study estimates that repealing the ACA would cost California up to 200,000 jobs, everyone from home healthcare aides and janitors to workers in retail, restaurants, and accounting. I say they are worth fighting for.  I rise today to emphasize that it is really important that we understand the everyday consequences of this bill. We are talking about real people. If you are a farmer in the Central Valley on Medicaid, you can lose that coverage. If you are a Los Angeles senior with diabetes, you may no longer be able to afford coverage on the individual market. If you are a family in Shasta County with a child dealing with a prescription drug addiction, substance abuse treatment likely will not be covered. If you are a couple in Humboldt County with an ailing parent, your request for home health services could be denied. These are the kinds of Californians and the kinds of Americans who this plan would hurt.  When these folks wake up at 3 a.m. worrying about an ache or pain or their next chemo appointment, when they wake up with that concern and that thought at 3 a.m., I promise you, they are not thinking about that through the lens of being a Republican or a They think about themselves as fathers, mothers, parents, daughters and sons, and grandparents. They worry about their health needs and how their health needs will affect not only themselves but their loved ones. These concerns are not about politics. These are universal concerns, and we have all been there.  It is because all of us share these concerns and because all of us would be badly harmed by this new plan that[[Page S1954]]this bill is opposed by the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association, the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, and the They are the most respected medical and patient advocacy groups in this country, and they know what is at stake.  Ultimately, I believe this bill is not just about medicine or math; I believe this is about morals. The plan that the House is voting on today is a values statement, and it is not a good one. As our former President said about the ACA, this is more than just about healthcare; it is about the character of our country, and it is about whether or not we look out for one another.  I think we need to take a good, hard look in the mirror and ask: Who are we as a country? Are we a country that cuts the deficit by cutting care for our most vulnerable?  Let's look in the mirror and ask: Are we a country that gives tax breaks to insurers while giving higher medical bills to patients?  Are we a country that tells seniors and cancer patients and women ``You are on your own''?  Are we a country that sees healthcare as a privilege for a few or a right for all?  I believe that is what we have to decide.  The ACA is not perfect. It can be strengthened, and I am willing to work with anyone who will work in good faith to do that, but it is time to stop playing politics with public health.  Our government has three main functions: public safety, public education, and public health. We shouldn't be turning these responsibilities into partisan issues. Instead, we should be figuring out how to improve the lives of all Americans, whether we are Democrats, Republicans, or  People are counting on us, people like one of my constituents in Kern County--a woman who is suffering from lung disease, who said:       We are not asking for much . . . decent healthcare. . . .      Don't take it away. . . . Make it better.  I say to my colleagues: Do not take away American people's healthcare. Let's make it better.  I yield the floor.

13780,2301,Kamala,HARRIS,REPRESENTATIVE,D,CA,1.0,H001075,115,13780,topic-id,1789,"Mr.President, my parents met when they were graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley, in the 1960s when they were active in the civil rights movement. In fact, my sister and I joke that we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent their full time marching and shouting for this thing called justice.  I was part of only the second class to integrate Berkeley, CA, public schools almost two decades after the U.Supreme Court declared that separate was inherently unequal in the great case of Brown v. Board of Education--a case, I might add, that was supported by an amicus brief from the then U.Attorney  In fact, it was the lawyers in Brown v. Board of Education--Thurgood Marshall, Charles Hamilton Houston, and Constance Baker Motley--who inspired me at a young age to become a lawyer.  Simply put, it is likely that had the U.Supreme Court not decided the[[Page S944]]way it did in Brown v. Board of Education, I would not be standing here as a Member of the U. So then, as a direct beneficiary of landmark rulings by the U.judicial system and the American judicial system, I am acutely aware of the lasting and profound impact our courts can have on the everyday lives of It is with a deep sense of respect and admiration for the role of our justice system that I rise to oppose the nomination of Senator Sessions to be the next Attorney General of the United  The mission of the Department of Justice is clear: ``To enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats, foreign and domestic; to provide Federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.''  It is those words--``justice for all''--that best articulate the spirit behind our judicial system.  I am a career prosecutor. In fact, I started my work as a young deputy district attorney in the Alameda County District Attorney's That office was once led by U.Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Every time I filed a case, it would never read with the name of the victim versus the name of the defendant. It always read ``the people'' versus the defendant because in our democracy, in our great judicial system, we have rightly said a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us, especially because we know that harm is most often directed at some of the most vulnerable and voiceless among us. So we rightly have declared that as a civil society, we will not require them to fight alone. We will stand with them. Justice for all.  This point is what raises my question of whether this nominee can fulfill the role and responsibility of this job. Let's be clear. This is not a debate about a President's nominee. It is not simply a debate about a President's nominee. This is a debate about the fundamental ideals of our country--ideals that date back to the founding of our country and those great words we spoke in 1776: ``We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.''  All men are created equal, with unalienable rights. In other words, President Lincoln was fulfilling the promise first made in the Declaration of Independence, a promise that made clear the basis for legal equality derives not through a right that is given but from natural rights--rights that have been endowed upon us by our Creator; rights that cannot and should not be taken away or given up.  So let us recognize that civil rights are not given through the enactment of a law or the publication of a court decision. Rather, our inherent civil rights are fulfilled when we guarantee them through the implementation and enforcement of the law.  Well-meaning people indeed can argue over the best means to ensure our fundamental rights, but it is crucial that we do not allow ourselves to be drawn into a suggestion that enforcing civil rights is favoring one group over another. Protecting civil rights is not about taking care of someone else. It is in our common interests. It is in each of our self-interests.  Liberty for each of us depends on liberty for all of us. It is just like the Department of Justice's mission, which articulates in those three words, ``justice for all.''  This is the Department's charge. It is its mission, and the next Attorney General of the United States must use his powers as a prosecutor to uphold it.  This brings me to the troubling and, frankly, unacceptable record of the nominee for this office. It is the U.Department of Justice that is charged with enforcing the rights of those trying to cast a ballot, but Senator Sessions cheered the Supreme Court's decision to gut the Voting Rights Act, used his power as a U.attorney to prosecute three African-American Civil Rights activists in Alabama, and then called the NAACP ``un-American.''  It is the U.Department of Justice that addresses systemic inequalities that we know, unfortunately, still exist in our criminal justice system and have led to mass incarceration--but Senator Sessions led the opposition to bipartisan sentencing reform.  It is the U.Department of Justice that investigates and prosecutes crimes motivated by hate based on race, religion, gender, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation of its victim--but in the 1990s, when lawmakers worked to pass hate crime legislation after the brutal killing of Matthew Shepard, Senator Sessions was a vocal opponent.  It is the U.Department of Justice that uses the power of the prosecutor to protect women who have been victims of crime--but Senator Sessions voted no when both Democrats and Republicans came together to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which gives support and assistance to survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, including members of our LGBT community.  It is the U.Department of Justice that defends that most fundamental right of freedom to worship--but it was Senator Sessions who was one of the most outspoken defenders of then-candidate and now-President Donald Trump's unconstitutional Muslim travel ban which, by the way, was roundly denounced by many of his fellow  It is the U.Department of Justice that enforces Federal laws prohibiting employment practices that discriminate on the grounds of race, sex, religion, and national origin. But Senator Sessions has opposed the Paycheck Fairness Act, Lilly Ledbetter Act, and the Employee Non-Discrimination  It is the U.Department of Justice that implements the Americans with Disabilities But when both Democrats and Republicans worked to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which provides resources to children with special needs, Senator Sessions said that providing educational services for these children ``may be the single most irritating problem for teachers throughout America today.''  Whether you are the father of a special needs child in a classroom, a woman trying to earn fair pay, an African-American man in a voting booth, or a victim at a police station trying to report a crime, Senator Sessions has not been your advocate.  As a former U.Attorney General, the great Bobby Kennedy once said:       We must recognize the full human equality of all our people      before God, before the law, and in the councils of      government. We must do this, not because it is economically      advantageous, although it is; not because the laws of God and      man command it, although they do; not because people in other      lands wish it so. We must do it for the single and      fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do.  The right thing to do. That is what makes us special as a country. That is what makes us right. That is what makes us great--our values and our ideas. It is the belief that no matter who you are, whether young or old, rich or poor, gay or straight; whether you are a child from Oakland or a child from Birmingham; whether you came here by plane to escape the hardships of war and torture or by foot to build a better life; whether you have been the victim of gun violence or opioid addiction; whether you are paid less than others doing the same work or stopped at a red light because of the color of your skin, you deserve an Attorney General who recognizes the full human quality of all people.  It is what led Attorney General Herbert Brownell, when there was rampant voter discrimination and intimidation here in the United States, to create in the United States Department of Justice the Civil Rights Division, whose mission is to ``uphold the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans, particularly some of the most vulnerable members of our society.''  It is what led Attorney General William Rogers to forcefully demand the integration of an elementary school at the Redstone missile center in Alabama when the children of Black servicemembers were being denied entry.  It is that commitment that led Bobby Kennedy to send 500 U.marshals to Oxford, MS, to escort a young Black man, James Meredith, to enroll at Ole It is what led U.Attorney General Elliott Richardson to resign rather than do the bidding of a corrupt President during  It is what led my friend, Attorney General Eric Holder, to sue the State[[Page S945]]of Arizona over SB 1070, a law that led to the unjust racial profiling of immigrants and to say that the U.Government would no longer defend a law that prevented LGBT Americans from expressing their love for one another.  It is what led Attorney General Sally Yates, on a Monday evening this month, to stand up and refuse to defend a Muslim ban.  More than most Cabinet positions, the U.Attorney General enforces the principles that are the founding of our country, but I have seen no evidence in his record or testimony that Senator Sessions will approach this office in furtherance of these noble ideals. The gains our country has made are not permanent, and it is incumbent on the Attorney General of the United States to fight for the civil rights of all people.  No one said it better than Coretta Scott King:       Freedom is never really won. You earn it and win it in      every generation.  If Senator Sessions won't, then it is incumbent upon the rest of us to persist.  I urge my colleagues to vote no.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The mission of the Department of Education, as mentioned, ``is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.'' The Department achieves this by establishing policies on Federal financial aid for education and distributing as well as monitoring those funds, collecting data on America's schools and disseminating research, focusing national attention on key educational issues, prohibiting discrimination, and ensuring equal access to education.

13792,2301,Kamala,HARRIS,REPRESENTATIVE,D,CA,1.0,H001075,115,13792,topic-id,1350,"Mr.President, I rise today, humbled to offer my first official speech as the junior U.Senator from the great State of I rise with a deep sense of reverence for this institution, for its history, and for its unique role as the defender of our Nation's ideals.  Above all, I rise today with a sense of gratitude for all those upon whose shoulders we stand. For me, it starts with my mother Shyamala She arrived at the University of California, Berkeley, from India in 1959 with dreams of becoming a scientist. The plan, when she finished school, was to go back home to a traditional Indian marriage. But when she met my father Donald Harris, she made a different plan. She went against a practice reaching back thousands of years, and[[Page S1258]]instead of an arranged marriage, she chose a love marriage. This act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me, and it made us Americans, like millions of children of immigrants before and since.  I know she is looking down on us today, and knowing my mother, she is probably saying: Kamala, what on Earth is going on down there? We have to stand up for our values.  So in the spirit of my mother, who was always direct, I cannot mince words. In the early weeks of this administration, we have seen an unprecedented series of Executive actions that have hit our immigrant and religious communities like a cold front, striking a chilling fear in the hearts of millions of good, hard-working people, all by Executive fiat.  By fiat, we have seen the President stick taxpayers with a bill for a multibillion-dollar border wall, without regard to the role of the U.Congress under article 1 of the By fiat, we have seen a President mandate the detention of immigrants, both documented and undocumented, creating a dragnet that could ensnare 8 million people. By fiat, the President has ordered the creation of what essentially will be a 15,000-member deportation force. By fiat, he wants to take away State and local authority by making local police officers act as Federal immigration officials. By fiat, the President wants to slam the gates of freedom by instituting a Muslim ban--a ban which was as carelessly written as it has been incompetently enforced.  In recent days, we have seen an increased severity in immigration raids sweeping across this country, including the arrest of a DREAMer in Seattle and a domestic violence victim in And we have seen an administration violate court orders, attack the First Amendment, bully Federal judges, and mock Americans exercising their right to freely assemble.  I rise today to discuss how these actions impact my State of California and our country. In particular, the State of California, I believe, is a microcosm of who we are as In California, we have farmers and environmentalists, welders and technologists, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and the largest number of immigrants, documented and undocumented, of any State in the  I rise because the President's actions have created deep uncertainty and pain for our refugee and immigrant communities. I rise on behalf of California's more than 250,000 DREAMers, who were told by the Federal Government: If you sign up, we will not use your personal information against you. I rise to say the United States of America cannot go back on our promise to these kids and their families.  I rise today as a lifelong prosecutor and as the former top cop of the biggest State in this country to say that these Executive actions present a real threat to our public safety. Let me repeat that: The President's immigration actions and Muslim ban will make America less safe.  As a prosecutor, I can tell you it is a serious mistake to conflate criminal justice policy with immigration policy, as if they are the same thing. They are not. I have personally prosecuted everything from low-level offenses to homicides. I know what a crime looks like, and I will tell you, an undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. But that is what these actions do; they suggest all immigrants are criminals and treat immigrants like criminals.  There is no question, those who commit crimes must face severe and serious and swift consequence and accountability. But the truth is, the vast majority of the immigrants in this country are hard-working people who deserve a pathway to citizenship.  Instead of making us safer, these increased raids and Executive orders instill fear in immigrants who are terrified they will be deported or have to give up information resulting in the deportation of their family members. For this reason, studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 9-1-1 when they have been a victim of crime. This climate of fear drives people underground and into the shadows, making them less likely to report crimes against themselves or others--fewer victims reporting crime and fewer witnesses coming forward.  These Executive actions create a strain on local law enforcement. Any police chief in this country will tell you that they barely have enough resources to get their job done. So when you make local law enforcement do the job of the Federal Government, you strain the resources for local law enforcement and that hurts everybody's safety.  Let's consider the economic harm this order will cause. Immigrants make up 10 percent of California's workforce and contribute $130 billion to our State's gross domestic product. Immigrants own small businesses, they till the land, they care for children and the elderly, they work in our labs, they attend our universities, and they serve in our military. So these actions are not only cruel, but they cause ripple effects that harm our public safety and our economy.  The same is true of this Muslim ban. This ban may as well have been hatched in the basement headquarters of We handed them a tool of recruitment to use against us. Policies that demonize entire groups of people based on the God they worship have a way of conjuring real-life demons. Policies that isolate our Muslim-American communities take away one of the greatest weapons we have in the fight against homegrown extremism.  Here is the truth. Imperfect though we may be, I believe we are a great country. I believe we are a great country. Part of what makes us great are our democratic institutions that protect our fundamental ideals: freedom of religion and the rule of law, protection from discrimination based on national origin, freedom of the press, and a 200-year history as a nation built by immigrants.  So this brings me to my message today. We have a responsibility to draw a line with these administrative actions and say no. This is not a question of party. This is about the government of coequal branches, with its inherent checks and balances. This is about the role of the Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the world. I know, having spent now a few weeks in this Chamber, that we have good men and women on both sides of the aisle--men and women who believe deeply in our immigrant communities and who understand that nationalism and patriotism are not the same thing.  I know that it was the junior Senator from the State of Texas who said: ``It is an enormous blessing to be the child of an immigrant who fled oppression, because you realize how fragile liberty is and how easily it can be taken away.''  It was the junior Senator from the great State of Kentucky who said: ``We must always embrace individual liberty and enforce the constitutional rights of all Americans, rich and poor, immigrants and natives, black and white.''  It was the senior Senator from the great State of Arizona who said: Undocumented immigrants should not be ``condemned forever'' to a twilight status.  So, yes, we have good people on both sides of the aisle. I say that we must measure up to our words and fight for our ideals because the critical hour is upon us.  I yield the floor.
