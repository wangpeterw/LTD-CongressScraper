                   OBAMACARE HAS NOT BEEN AFFORDABLE

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare has been a disaster for Arizonans. 
My home State of Arizona has been hit the hardest.Premiums in Arizona 
for many have increased over 100 percent, and providers have fled the 
State, leaving some counties with oneprovider and little options for 
healthcare insurance.
  ObamaCare must be repealed. In fact, there is no constitutional 
authority given to the Federal Government to take over ourhealthcare 
system. These issues are, in fact, best left to the States to manage.
  I am advocating for a complete repeal of ObamaCare as soon as 
possible, with a transition period of no longer than 24months.
  The approach I am suggesting will remove government from between 
patients and their doctors. Our alternative will encouragecompetition, 
which will in turn lead to lower costs to all Americans, but in 
particular, Arizonans.
  I remain committed to seeing this happen.
