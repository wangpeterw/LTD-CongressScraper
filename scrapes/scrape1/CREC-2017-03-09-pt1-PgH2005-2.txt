                      PAKISTAN IS NOT ON OUR SIDE

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of TEXAS. Mr. Speaker, it is no surprise Pakistan is not the 
friend they portray themselves to be. They are a devious, deceptive, 
and disloyal ally.
  For years they have supported the Taliban by providing them cover, 
cash, and weapons. However, this Benedict Arnold ally is among the 
leading recipients of U.S. foreign assistance for the last 14 years.
  Mr. Speaker, we don't need to pay Pakistan to betray us, they will do 
it for free.
  The Taliban's headquarters is, you guessed it, in Pakistan. When a 
U.S. drone attack took out the Taliban's leader in May 2016, he was in 
Pakistan.
  This should be the last rodeo for Pakistan. This is why I have 
introduced the Pakistan State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act. The 
bill requires the administration to issue a report containing either a 
determination that Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism or a 
justification as to why it is not.
  It is time to determine whose side Pakistan is on. And, Mr. Speaker, 
they are not on our side.
  And that is just the way it is.
