                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  With the Psalmist, we pray: O, Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will 
declare Your praise.
  Even before the first word is formulated, Lord, guide our minds, our 
thoughts, our hearts and desires. By Your holy spirit, breathe into us 
a new spirit. Shape this Congress and our world according to Your 
design that we may fulfill Your holy will.
  Give the Members of this people's House the gift of attentive hearts 
and open minds, that through the diversity of ideas they may sort out 
what is best for this Nation. Let them not be afraid of silence, that 
even before they speak, they may heed Your revealed Word with longing.
  May their speech be deliberately free of all prejudice that others 
may listen wholeheartedly, then their dialogue will be mutually 
respectful in the hope of bringing unity and justice.
  May all that we do be done for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
