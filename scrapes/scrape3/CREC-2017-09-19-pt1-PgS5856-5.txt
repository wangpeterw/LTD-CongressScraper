                      TRIBUTE TO ALISON CHEPERDAK

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of 
my Commerce, Science, and Transportation committee intern Alison 
Cheperdak. Alison hails from Hopkinton, MA, and is in her third year at 
George Washington University Law School.
  While interning on the Commerce Committee, Alison assisted the 
Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security. She 
is a dedicated worker who was committed to getting the most out of her 
internship. I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Alison for 
all of the fine work she did for the committee and wish her continued 
success in the years to come.
