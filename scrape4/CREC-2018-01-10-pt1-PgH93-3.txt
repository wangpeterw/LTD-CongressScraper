                            FIX OUR TAX CODE

  (Mr. CARDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the tax scam 
that was voted for by 100 percent of Republicans and signed by 
President Trump.
  We all know that this bill puts middle class families out in the 
cold. This tax scam raised taxes on 86 million American families. It 
robs our ability to help American veterans, children, and seniors. 
Republicans have slashed taxes on the wealthiest among us, and now they 
want us to slash, cut, decimate Medicare, Medicaid, and Social 
Security.
  Some of my colleagues would have us believe that this bill is about 
prosperity for all.
  Prosperity for whom?
  It is a tax giveaway to billionaires and millionaires.
  Does slashing tax revenue create prosperity for communities like 
Flint, Michigan, where American families continue to suffer through a 
water crisis, a crisis that my Republican colleagues claim they can't 
find the funding to help our American brothers and sisters who are 
suffering?
  Republicans want us to believe this bill is fiscally responsible, but 
we all know there is nothing fiscally responsible about taking 
healthcare away from millions of Americans while ballooning our 
country's deficit by as much as $2 trillion.
  Mr. Speaker, we need to fix our Tax Code, not leave American families 
out in the cold.
