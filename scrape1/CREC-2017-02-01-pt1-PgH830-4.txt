                PRESIDENT'S EFFORTS ARE BEING DISTORTED

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, approximately 58 percent of the 
people in this world have to get by on $4 or less a day. This means 
roughly 4 billion of the 7 billion in the world are living in extreme 
or very great poverty.
  If we simply opened our borders, probably several hundred million 
would come here over the next 2 or 3 years. Our entire infrastructure--
our schools, hospitals, jails, sewers, roads--in fact, our entire 
economy could not handle a massive, rapid influx like that.
  The American people are the kindest, most generous people in the 
world. We have allowed far more immigration than any other country over 
the last 50 years--many millions. No other country has even come close. 
But we must enforce our immigration laws.
  The great majority of the American people want border security. 
President Trump's immigration order was not a Muslim ban. It did not 
even apply to 9 of the 10 largest population Muslim countries.
  The President's efforts are being completely distorted. He is simply 
trying to do what the people want.
