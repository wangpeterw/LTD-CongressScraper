        RECOGNIZING ERIEZ MANUFACTURING ON 75 YEARS IN BUSINESS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Eriez Manufacturing on 75 years in business in Erie, 
Pennsylvania. Eriez has grown exponentially since the early days when 
Orange Fowler Merwin--or O.F., as he was known--sold equipment to grain 
millers.
  His customers often complained about stray pieces of metal that found 
their way into the grain that the farmers brought to the mills for 
grinding. In 1942, O.F. devised a permanent magnetic separator in the 
basement of his home and sold it to a grain miller. Eriez was 
officially on its way.
  Since those humble beginnings in that Erie basement, Eriez has 
expanded into the world authority in separation technologies with 
operations all over the world. Of course, it has always been 
headquartered in Erie and on Asbury Road since 1962.
  Mr. Speaker, today, Eriez employs more than 300 Erie residents, 
between its two locations on Asbury Road and at its facility near Belle 
Valley.
  The story of Eriez Manufacturing truly is a classic American Dream 
tale, and it has maintained local family ownership throughout its 
history. I congratulate them on this milestone.
