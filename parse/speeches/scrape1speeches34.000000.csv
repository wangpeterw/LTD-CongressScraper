1584,topic-id,723,"Mr.Speaker, this final amendment says plainly that the Securities and Exchange Commission should take intoaccount whether any proposed rule will have an impact on outsourcing American jobs.  Many of us, especially those of us in the industrial heartland, represent regions that have experienced serious job lossesbecause of companies sending jobs overseas. I will tell you a little bit about mine.  I have the honor of serving Illinois' 17th Congressional Most of my district is rural. It spans 7,000 squaremiles, 14 counties, and covers the entire northwestern region of the State of We are the world headquarters for You have probably seen the tractors or the combines out there on the farmland.  We are also the world headquarters for Caterpillar, and, as you have traveled around our country and around our world, youhave probably also seen the yellow, big, earth-moving equipment. That comes from my congressional district.  But like many parts of our heartland, our region has seen far too many manufacturing jobs shipped overseas. I am going togive you a couple of examples.  In a town called Galesburg, Illinois, we had a Maytag plant that made refrigerators. Overnight, every last one of those jobswas shipped to A dozen years later, the wages there still have not recovered because of that outsourcing.  We have a town called Hanover, Illinois, a little, bitty town in northwestern There was a plant called Robertshaw.They made little valves that go inside of washing machines and dishwashers that measured the water that would flow through.There was nearly a zero percent defect rate on what was produced out of that plant, and the company was profitable. And yet,every last one of those jobs went to  And then we had a company called They made auto part sensors, and it was bought out by a company called You might know a little bit about this company called Bain And they shipped every one of those jobs over to I have made friends with a lot of the workers there, one of whom is named Dot She had worked there for 40-plusyears, started right out of high school. And she had the indignity of--the last function that she had to do at that plant was toscrape the tape off the floor that laid the area for where the machinery had been; that was what she had to do.  So I am here to tell you those stories, but also to say that this is happening to way too many workers. Men and women likeDot Turner understand the dignity that comes with having a good job and putting in a good, hard day's work. They understand thata good career is a pathway to a better future for themselves and for their families. But too many people like Dot have been leftbehind.  So what are we going to do? What is ahead?  In just 9 days, President-elect Trump will take the oath of office after running on a platform of making America greatagain. He said he would do that by bringing home jobs that had been sent overseas.  Well, many my colleagues on this side of the aisle have been fighting to protect American jobs for years. In fact, we haveput forth real solutions to spur growth in the manufacturing sector and get our middle class back to work. We have introducedmore than 80 bills in our Make It In America agenda, but we have been blocked at so many turns.  So what kind of legislation is making it to the House floor instead? Bills like the one we are going to be voting on soon;bills that would make it more difficult for the Securities and Exchange Commission to protect investors and consumers, wouldmake it more difficult for that to happen, and bills that would gamble the retirement savings of everyday Americans as if wewere a Trump casino.  Working families deserve more than a bumper sticker slogan. They know that talk can be cheap in a place like Washington,D.C., and they are tired of politicians putting billionaires over the little guy. That is why this motion would ensure that ourfocus is on bringing back outsourced jobs.  Working families need to know that we here in Washington are fighting for them. Please join me, and let's show the Americanpeople that we are serious about this issue.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

1563,topic-id,1180,"Mr.President, today I wish to celebrate Black History Month, a time to honor and reflect on the many achievements and sacrifices of African Americans throughout our Nation's history.  This February, we highlight the titans of African-American history. We honor the culture-shifting accomplishments of civil rights icons such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Dorothy Height, and our esteemed colleague, Congressman John  As the senior Senator from Maryland, I would be remiss if I didn't also honor Harriet Tubman, Thurgood Marshall, and--perhaps one of the greatest Marylanders in our long history--Frederick There are some out there who may not know it, but Douglass was born in Maryland around 1818. He learned to read and write in Baltimore before escaping slavery. Despite unknowable hardship and systemic discrimination, he went on to become one of the most influential writers, orators, publishers, and abolitionists of his time. Though Douglass fiercely and vocally opposed slavery, he would want us to remember that he stood for the rights of all Americans, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin. These views--revolutionary for the time--gained him increasing prominence, leading to 1872, when Victoria Woodhull chose him as her Vice Presidential nominee.  Frederick Douglass was the first Black American ever to hold that title. His legacy continues to make Maryland proud.  While we take time to recognize Frederick Douglass and others this month, we must also celebrate the countless men and women whose names and heroism will never grace the history books. Let us never forget all of those who suffered discrimination in silence, who endured civil rights abuses without recognition, who sat-in and stood up to oppression without accolade. We should use this month to lift up their memories and to recommit to the causes of justice and equality for which they also fought so diligently.  In particular, we should honor the Black teachers who taught generations of children in the dark, against the odds and sometimes the law, with little more than old, secondhand books and makeshift buildings. We honor the businessowners who laid the foundations of the Black community in places like Baltimore, Harlem, Chicago, Washington, DC, and We honor the civil rights movement foot soldiers who rejected subservience and embraced rebellion by marching in the streets of Selma and We honor the factory workers who left the South behind with hopes of a brighter[[Page S1297]]future, only to struggle in Northern cities for pennies.  For too long, Black Americans' rich and vibrant history has been ignored or obscured by the specter of prejudice. But today, and for the rest of the month, in classrooms and cities across our Nation, we will shine a spotlight on that history.  We will vow to honor it here, now, in the present and in the future, through protecting both the legacy of civil rights and the Americans who are counting on us to uphold them. As lawmakers and as leaders, it is our duty to fight on their behalf. It is our duty to pass laws that will protect all Americans, support all Americans, and defend all Americans, especially those who have been victims of institutional and systemic prejudice.  That is why I introduced the End Racial Profiling Act in 2011. It is incumbent upon every Member in this Chamber to be an advocate for the men and women of color who are singled out every day simply because of their skin color and appearance. These individuals are your constituents. They are my constituents. They are our fellow  They deserve our commitment and an attention span that lasts longer than 1 month a year.  Discriminatory profiling based on race--or religion or gender identity, nation of origin, sexual orientation--has no place in our society. It is un-American; it is also counterproductive. Racial profiling doesn't keep us safer. To the contrary: it breeds hostility and distrust, and it turns communities against law enforcement and against each other. It wastes resources that our law enforcement agencies can't afford to spend. And the more time we waste targeting Americans because of their race or religion, the less time we are devoting to those who are actually committing crimes or trying to harm us.  My End Racial Profiling Act, which I plan to reintroduce this week, would eliminate this harmful practice and instead offer resources for more police training, mandate greater accountability, and offer recourse for Americans who have been unduly profiled.  Our duty to African Americans does not end there. That is why, as ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I intend to introduce the National Security Diversity and Inclusion Workforce Act, which would codify and build upon President Obama's efforts to diversify our national security workforce. Having a workforce that looks like America is not just good personnel policy, it is also a national security imperative.  Our diversity is one of the strongest assets that the United States has. It allows us to connect and work with different communities and countries across the globe; it helps us to foster the relationships we need to fight terrorism across the globe. And having a diverse set of backgrounds, skills, knowledge, perspectives, and experiences contributes to better national security decisionmaking. We should lead the world and protect our homeland not just by preaching pluralism and tolerance, but by practicing it.  While we embark on that mission, we should take with us the words of Frederick Douglass: ``If there is no struggle, there is no progress.'' Everyone in this body has a responsibility to be part of the struggle and, through it, to be part of progress. Everyone in this body has a responsibility to embrace struggle, even when it occurs right here on this floor, if it is in the name of progress.  I am talking about protecting the Voting Rights The right to vote is fundamental to every democracy. Every vote counts and must be counted fairly.  I am talking about ending the senseless and discriminatory practice of racial profiling. It is painful that, in 2017, we still need to explain that Americans should not be considered suspects or targets because of the color of their skin.  I am talking about criminal justice reform--and prioritizing criminal justice reform in this  I am talking about recognizing the incredible contributions of Frederick Douglass, Dorothy Height, Harriet Tubman, Katherine Johnson, Mae Jemison, and others in our public school curricula.  Many Americans would not even recognize their names, and that is a tragic failure on our part to honor Black history.  I am talking about not just talking, but committing to these causes through actions around our States and through legislation right here in this Whether through passing my End Racial Profiling Act or my National Security Diversity and Inclusion Workforce Act or any other bills introduced by my colleagues, Black History Month reminds us that we can and must do more. Let us begin by remembering that Black history is American history. Their story is our story. When we celebrate Black pioneers and activists and inventors and artists, we celebrate the diversity and the strength of character that are the reasons we are here today.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgS1296.txt,,SEC REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT,2017.0,16.0,April

1743,topic-id,771,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak about the need for bipartisan and comprehensive immigration reform. I am disappointed by President Trump's actions on immigration during his first 2 months in office. I do not say that lightly, because I want this President to succeed, as I want every President to succeed, because if they succeed, so does our country.  But the President's comments and actions to implement policies that don't hold up American values has me feeling very uneasy. To say the least, his erratic statements made on domestic and foreign policy, that he has either taken back or corrected, demonstrates a lack of diplomatic experience. For example, issuing an executive order to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border is not a real solution to fixing our broken immigration system. It does little, if anything, to improve our national security, and it would only hurt trade relations with Mexico, which would have a very serious economic impact not only on American exporters, but especially California's agriculture industry.  Additionally, the Trump administration's directives to deport undocumented immigrants, regardless of how long they have lived here and the contributions they have made to our society, is a strong example of the President's implementing policy that not only is flawed from a human rights perspective, but it is going to have a negative impact on our economy as well.  President Trump is forcing over 11 million individuals who have lived in the United States for decades deeper into the shadows of our communities. They are scared to go to work, scared to go to school, and scared to live their lives. California's agriculture industry relies heavily on a workforce of individuals who are undocumented and work every single day to accomplish the American Dream for themselves and their families. These individuals are not only contributing to the agriculture industry, but they are also students, entrepreneurs, and businessowners.  Furthermore, implementing an executive order to ban travel to the United States is not the American way. As many people in my district are aware, President Trump's first travel ban prohibited a 12-year-old girl, Eman, and her U.citizen father from coming home to the United States, and his order put them in harm's way while they waited in                              {time}  1030  Last month, a Federal appeals court ruled to block that executive order travel ban. Four weeks ago, father and daughter finally came back to Los Banos to rejoin their family.  Our President and his team had to go back to the drawing board, as we know, to issue a new executive order. And just last night, his second executive order to ban travel was blocked.  The Trump administration claims that the flawed executive orders are:  One, a vital measure for protecting national security;  Two, work to improve the vetting process; and  Three, that the United States has a right to vet people who are entering the country and keep people out who are doing us harm.  I agree that we need to work together to protect national security. The Federal Government is obligated to keep our country safe and vet people who enter this country. And guess what? Thorough and rigorous vetting policies are already in place, and they have been going back to the Bush administration ever since 9/11. That is nothing new. My office receives casework on a weekly basis regarding visas that are being extremely vetted and individuals who are waiting for years to get the proper visa to come to this country. That is extreme vetting.  I strongly encourage the President to work with us in Congress and implement a policy that actually strengthens our national security, upholds our national security, and upholds our American values that we all cherish. Working together on a bipartisan basis, we can fix our Nation's broken immigration system. Working together, we can make important investments in our infrastructure, and we should. Working together, we can reform our tax system so it is simple and fair. Working together, we can negotiate a farm bill that provides benefits for all Working together, we can fix the Affordable Care  Clearly, in regards to the ACA, my Republican friends have decided to go at it alone. That is too bad.  I stand ready to work with the President on a bipartisan basis on all of the above, but the President must reach out. I sincerely want our President to do well because that is what is in the best interest of our country, as I want every American President to do well. But it will not happen. It will not happen, my colleagues, my friends, unless we work together.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2088.txt,1774,ANTIOCH BAPTIST CHURCH,2017.0,16.0,February
1660,topic-id,746,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from Michigan for yielding me this time, the vice ranking member of our committee, and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.Hultgren), my good friend, for cosponsoring this legislation with me.  I do rise in support of H.1343, Mr.Speaker, and I think it is a very simple piece of legislation. The chairman of the committee said it was a simple piece of legislation. It is very straightforward. It simply raises the threshold as to the amount of stock a private corporation can give its employees, from $5 million to $10 million, without triggering additional disclosure.  What this bill is not about is rolling back disclosure because, as a practical matter, it simply defines the threshold as to when additional disclosure is required. That threshold was originally[[Page H2671]]established in 1988 at $5 million. Five million dollars was good in 1988; it is no longer good in 2017. We have simply escalated that amount by inflation, and we have come up with the number $10 million, which is proposed in the legislation.  One of the reasons this legislation does not roll back disclosures, which is a myth that I intend to debunk here this afternoon, is because, as a practical matter, what corporations will do is, in fact, not give additional stock to their employees if, in fact, it triggers additional disclosures. That is what actually happens in the private market is this threshold defines the amount of stock that a company will, in fact, give to its employees in any given year; and, if we don't raise the cap from $5 million to $10 million, we are effectively preventing companies from allowing their employees to share in stock ownership.  Private companies make decisions, Mr.Speaker, to stay private for many reasons: either because they are too small and they don't want to go public; or they don't want to, in fact, disclose their confidential information; or they don't want the costs or burdens of being a public company; or because they don't want to give up control. Whatever reason they have, it is a very important decision for a private company to stay private and not go public. The current threshold of $5 million effectively forces a company to make the kind of disclosures it would have to make as a public company if it elects to give more than $5 million of stock to its employees.  We, as policymakers, should encourage more employee ownership in the markets because it is good for both the corporations and the employees. It is good for the corporations because it creates a better culture. It allows the management team and the employees of the company to have a more long-term perspective, and it reduces turnover, which is one of the highest costs that companies have. So it is very good for the companies.  But, in fact, Mr.Speaker, it is even better for the employees. The data suggest that companies that have high employee ownership are much less likely to lay off their employees during a recession. So it creates, effectively, better retention, which is obviously in the interest of employees.  But the other thing it does--and I think this is the most important point--is it encourages kind of an inclusive capitalism whereby workers actually own more of the U.economy. This is something, as Democrats, we should care about, in particular, because we have talked for many years about how the growth in the U.economy and the increases in productivity have disproportionately gone to capital and not to workers.  We believe there are many reasons this has occurred, but one of the things we should be advocating for, strongly, is increasing workers' ownership of capital. It will inevitably lead to more savings among workers, and it will start balancing out the distribution of profits in society. One of the ways we do that is to eliminate the barriers for companies to issue stock to their employees, which is effectively what this bill does.  So if we care about this concept of inclusive capitalism, if we believe American workers should own a greater percentage of the economy and, therefore, benefit from the productivity enhancements that are occurring in the economy and the economic growth that is occurring in the economy, we should put policies in place specifically to make it easier for corporations to engage in shared employee ownership, which is exactly what this bill does.

1654,topic-id,958,"Mr.Speaker, the value of companies doesn't always go up. It is not true that the stock market always goes up and only goes up. It would be nice if Methuselahs at Google and every other company in America could get stock options and end up millionaires, but the truth is the world doesn't work that way. That is why disclosure is very important. That is why there is nothing wrong and no one objects to employees being compensated with stock options, but those employees ought to at least know the value of those stock options.  If you give me a check and it has a monetary value, I can read it and I know how much it is. If you give me stock options and you don't tell me because you don't have to disclose how much they are worth, then that is not fair, and that is what we object to.  This bill simply allows companies to avoid disclosure to employees of what those stock options are worth. That is wrong, and that is why we oppose it.  Let me just start in terms of the context, Mr.Today we consider yet another bill in favor of the moneyed interests. Today we consider another bill that basically helps out people who have a lot while so many Americans are struggling to get by and problems abound almost everywhere.  I have got to wonder, of all the things the American public want, why is a revision to the SEC's rule--section 701, to be precise--the priority for this week?  We have been here for about 3 months now. The Republicans have set[[Page H2669]]the agenda. They are in the majority. They get to decide which bills come up. Why do they keep on bringing up bills that only the moneyed interests want?  Mr.Speaker, in the past few months, congressional Republicans--I almost called them corporate Republicans--who decide which bills are the priority, have brought forth a hodgepodge of pieces of legislation. I will just review a few.  Republicans made it easier to drug test people receiving unemployment compensation.  Do you think the unemployed want that?  I doubt it.  Republicans have passed and the President even signed a law to protect corporate firms from having to disclose labor violations like wage theft before winning government contracts. I have got a feeling the employees were not calling for that.  House and Senate Republicans passed laws that allow internet service providers to sell your browser history. I don't think most folks on the internet today were clamoring for that gem, which I was proud to vote ``no'' on.  Republicans enacted a new law making it easier to dump coal debris near rivers and streams.  Republicans stopped efforts to help governments around the world avoid corruption.  H.41 removed the requirement that corporations disclose resource payments to foreign governments, which is a crushing blow to democracy activists working in fragile nations.  Mr.Speaker, this particular piece of legislation comes within a certain kind of context--a context where we are not talking about increase in pay, making people safer, making water cleaner, making foreign governments more honest. It is quite the opposite.  In the 3 months that we have been back in Congress, these laws removing competition, removing disclosure, and removing consumer privacy are all priorities of Republicans, who set the agenda.  Mr.Speaker, people who might be clued into this broadcast today need to know what the majority has been up to. It has not been up to business.  These are all multinational corporate interests that don't punish people for polluting, allow them to sell your internet browser's history, allow them to make money off of testing laid-off workers receiving employment compensation that is due them, and don't make corporate interests disclose payments to foreign governments when they drill for oil and minerals.  I just want the American people and Members to understand what is going on here, what is the larger context of this piece of legislation that we look at today.  When I talk to my constituents, they don't bring up any of this stuff. Mr.Speaker, they want to know: Where is the jobs bill? When are we going to get back to work? Somebody said we were going to work on real infrastructure, real fair trade. When is that going to happen?  Well, the people who are in charge around here, I guess they are going to get around to it at some point.  My constituents say: Can't we raise the minimum wage from something higher than $7.25 an hour, which is the Federal minimum wage? When is that bill coming up? Or, what about reconstructing our roads and our bridges and allowing us to raise a gas tax to invest in our Nation's infrastructure?  They say they want to increase skills. Let's invest in preschool, Pell grants, and community college. Let's put the people, not the corporate wish list, first.  Today we are asked to vote on a bill that basically makes it easier for private companies to provide options, like stocks, rather than compensation to their employees. As I have said, fundamentally, this may not be a bad thing if disclosure is made. This bill makes it not required. This bill makes it easier for firms to offload some of their options to employees without disclosing financial information to them.  While I am glad to see employers reward employees with stock and other compensation in addition to salaries, workers should be told the value of the compensation they receive. I don't think that is asking too much, Mr. With this bill, H.1343, it is possible that employees would be promised stock options which could be worth less than promised or even completely worthless.

Why should employees receive less information than any other minority shareholder?

One image consistently stuck with me: a staff rally where leaders extolled the virtues of the firm. Just as we heard on the other side of the aisle a moment ago, leaders whipped employees into a frenzy to buy Enron stock, even as leaders knew it was worthless. In fact, corporate leaders had already sold their stock while urging employees to buy. Enron had a strategy of buying companies and then pressuring new employees to buy Enron stock to keep the stock price inflated. Since Enron usually fired 10 percent of the workers every year, workers felt pressured to buy stock to show commitment to the firm.  I can't just support a bill that gives employees fewer protections than investors. I can't support a bill that encourages employees to possibly forgo cash in their paychecks in exchange for some unverified investment option. It is not right.  Mr.Speaker, I see you reaching for the gavel. I will include the rest of my comments in the I urge a ``no'' vote on this particular piece of legislation until it allows for disclosures.

We've been here for three months now.  House Republicans set the agenda.  They lead this governing body.  Why do they keep bringing us bills that corporate America wants?  In the past few months, Congressional Republicans, who decide which bills are priorities have brought forward a hodgepodge of corporate requests.  Here are some of the bills that are now law.  Republicans made it easier to drug test people receiving unemployment compensation (H.42).  Republicans passed--and the President signed--a law to protect corporate firms from having to disclose labor violations--like wage theft--before winning government contracts (H.37).  House and Senate Republicans passed laws that allow internet services providers to sell your browser history.  Republicans enacted a new law making it easier to dump coal debris near rivers and streams (H.38).  Republicans stopped efforts to help governments around the world avoid corruption.  H.41 removed the requirement that corporations disclose resource payments to foreign governments.[[Page H2670]]  Which is a crushing blow to democracy activists working in fragile nations.  And, a law preventing State governments from setting up retirement plans for residents who do not have a work-based plan.  So, in the three months we've been back, these laws--removing competition, disclosure, and consumer privacy--are the priorities of Republicans who set the agenda.  These are all asks of corporate America--don't punish us for polluting streams; let us sell your internet browser history; let us make money drug testing laid off workers receiving unemployment due them, and; don't make us disclose our payments to foreign governments when we drill for oil or minerals.  When I talk to my constituents, they don't ask for any of these.  They say, ``Where's the jobs bill?''  My constituents say, can't we raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour?  They say, our roads and bridges need work. Let's raise the gas tax a skoch and invest in infrastructure?  They say, we want to increase our skills; let's invest in pre-school, Pell grants and community colleges.  Let's put people, not corporate wish lists--first.

They might also say that it's irrelevant since Enron was a public company and we are talking about private companies.  So, let's talk about Palantir  This $20 billion company convinced top-tier engineers to accept below-market salaries by promising them generous stock options.  But some employees who accepted this bargain, hoping to make money on selling their shares, cannot sell them.

Pushing employees to own more of employer's stock exposes workers--like George Maddox--to put all their retirement eggs in one basket--what we call ``concentration risk.''  I ask this Congress to stop doing the bidding of corporate America until we address the priorities of American families and workers.  We should increase wages and access to affordable housing, provide clean air and clean water, and protect our privacy.  We should not make it easier for employers to pressure workers to choose options over salary without adequate disclosures. Vote no on H.1343.

1549,topic-id,2181,"Mr.Speaker, yes, this is an important week. There are a lot of things we are bringing up, but nothing is more important than the bill that is supposed to address the Affordable Care Act, as it was called. But it is kind of tough to call it that since it has been completely unaffordable for so many. So many lost their health insurance and lost their doctor. Some lost medication that they were taking before. It is now no longer approved under their new policy. So it has been a very difficult period of time as ObamaCare has been foisted on the country. It came so close to not passing.                              {time}  2100  And every Republican that I am aware of has promised: You give us the majority in both Houses and the President and we will repeal it. I believe Majority Leader McConnell said we will repeal it and rip it out root and branch. Republican leaders, I believe, mentioned lock, stock, and barrel. And I have great respect for my friends who were just speaking here, but I have got a real problem with the bill.  We are told there will be three phases, three buckets, three stages, whatever you want to call it. The first will be to pass this bill. It leaves in place the parts of ObamaCare that caused insurance to skyrocket. It is leaving in place the part of ObamaCare that caused deductibles to rise from very little to thousands and thousands of dollars, beyond so many Americans' ability to ever reach. So the insurance, they are paying them money every month, but they realize: I don't have $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 to pay the deductible; therefore, I am really paying for nothing. Especially young people have found this.  We are told that it is because the Senate has what they refer to as the Byrd rule that would not allow us to take the part that is not currently in the bill regarding all of the regulations. We are told that the Byrd rule--and we have looked into it, apparently--if a bill is moving under reconciliation, as this is, then in the Senate, in essence, it must do more than affect the budget incidentally; it must materially affect the budget. And yet we know that if we repeal all of the part that is being put off for stage 2 or 3, but particularly stage 2, the regulations that were put in place by the Obama administration, the regulatory authority that was given to them, by putting that off, it means the prices that dramatically skyrocketed, they are not going to skyrocket down.  We are told, well, they may go up some, but we think there is a good chance they will come down 10 percent. But for my constituents, so many of whom either lost their insurance or are now paying for skyrocketing prices two, three, four times or more than what they used to pay, a 10 percent drop will not be a help at all. Their deductibles will not be coming down anytime soon.  We are told, though, with the regulatory reform that my good friend Secretary Tom Price will do, that will be the phase, the stage, the bucket, that will drop the prices. But when I read through--and I know some people said 2,700 pages, my two part. And I have[[Page H2237]]gotten two copies, and they are both around 2,500 pages. So unless there are 200 pages I never found, I did read the bill more than once. And someone said 1,400 times. I don't know. I know it is a lot. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is given wide discretion in putting in place rules and regulations to implement the act.  We have heard that there will, no doubt, be, immediately, litigation filed, lawsuits filed, to try to overturn the regulations that are put in place by Secretary Well, since I have had experience in litigation, including Federal litigation, Federal appeals, what would be the issue?  Well, the issue would be whether or not the Secretary of Health and Human Services has authority to create regulations that will, in effect, completely destroy the bill so that eventually the prices will come back down, the deductibles eventually will come back down. That is what we are told. And I trust Secretary Price will do everything within his power to make this happen.  So Secretary Price will come forward with regulations that will emasculate the bill, emasculate Litigation is filed. Ultimately, at some point, it will come back to a judge, an appellate judge.  As a State district judge, I handled cases and matters that I knew were going to be appealed. As a chief justice of an appellate court, I made those decisions and sat in on discussions with other justices, and so it seems I am in a good position to potentially analyze what would happen on appeal.  We know the Secretary has wide discretion promulgating the regulations, the rules, to bring about the implementation and the intent of the ACA, But the question will be, on appeal: Does the Secretary of Health and Human Services have the authority, under the bill, to render it meaningless?  Now, I am not aware of justices at the appellate level who are a great deal more conservative than I was, but I believed in following the law even though I, at times, didn't like the law. I would not legislate from the bench. And in a case such as this, you would look, well, yes, the Secretary should have wide discretion to implement the intention of the bill and see that it is carried out.  But it would certainly seem the more powerful argument--perhaps, most likely, the winning argument--will be, yes, but he doesn't have discretion to kill the bill. He has discretion, wide discretion, to implement the bill and carry out the intent of the bill.  I just can't help but think, again, back to words from my late friend, Justice We weren't talking about a specific case, because he never betrayed the trust that he had as Associate Justice of the U.Supreme We were talking about things in general. He said at times it bothered him that Congress had the power to end some bill, to change some law, and yet we seem to put a rubber stamp and encourage people to go file a lawsuit to get the law struck down instead of just winning the vote in the House and Senate and repealing the law.  The words that really come back are: If you guys in Congress don't have the guts to do what needs to be done, that you have the power to do and you are supposed to do, don't come running to us over at the Supreme Court expecting us to do your job for you.  He was right. This body, along with the Senate, has the power to do exactly what we have promised for 7 years we would do if we got the House, the Senate, and the We would repeal  Now, I don't know how many there are of us that cannot vote for a bill that will leave in place the regulations and the parts that made our insurance skyrocket, that caused me to lose my insurance. And I wouldn't take the subsidy for 3 years until we got insurance through other means. The law is very clear that, as Members of Congress, we weren't supposed to get that, so I went without insurance for a few years. But we promised our constituents we would repeal  So what about, we are told, this part that can't make it through the Byrd rule in the Senate? Well, for one thing, 51 votes could change the Byrd rule. For another, there is nothing that is going to more materially affect the budget, in this reconciliation or any other, than bringing the price of health insurance and health care down dramatically. That is more appropriate under the Byrd rule than the whole other part that we are told will make it through the Byrd rule in the  The most important part is the part being left out. That will bring the prices down. That will give control back to the patients and the doctors. That will allow the States to come up with new ideas and new ways to provide health care and to get it to those who need it. But more important than anything, it restores freedom in America that has been lacking since that bill passed.  When the government is in charge of every Americans' health care, the government has every right to tell people how to live. Those claims from years past--we don't want the government in our bedroom--became rather hollow when ObamaCare passed and the government came into your bedroom, your dining room, everywhere in the house. It has got to be repealed. As Mitch McConnell has said previously, rip it out root and branch.  Who is going to make the decision on what seems so clear should allow all of ObamaCare to be repealed? Who is going to make that decision in the Senate?  Well, we know the Vice President can come right on down to the Capitol, come down Pennsylvania Avenue and come into the Senate He is the President of the Senate, and I couldn't be more thrilled that he is.  If he is unable to come, then the majority leader could sit in the chair, or he could appoint someone to sit in the chair pro tem. But it will be a Republican who decides whether or not all of ObamaCare can be repealed, but especially the part that is left out right now.  Mr.Speaker, I know the President is coming, and I am so glad that we have this chance because he is But I believe that the President of the United States who has been sold this bill that won't bring down prices--maybe 10 percent, we are told, some day--he deserves better. He does not deserve to be slapped in the face with a midterm election when prices have not come down, as people pushing this bill know they won't--maybe 10 percent. That is not going to change votes of those who know we promised a full repeal. We have the power to do a full repeal, and we should do a full repeal.                              {time}  2115  Let's get freedom back to a doctor-patient relationship. And from what I am told--they certainly haven't called me--I am told that the health insurance lobbyists have been very active, and people in our leadership are listening. But if that is true, these are the same people with Big Pharma that signed off on It meant they would make billions more than they ever had in the short term, but in the long term, they signed their own death warrant.  We owe it to the American people to make sure that insurance is viable for the future, and the only way to do that is to repeal ObamaCare, rip it out, root and branch. I like Mitch McConnell's expression. That is what needs to happen. And for those of my colleagues who are getting nervous about having pressure from the White House, pressure from the House leaders, pressure from the Senate leaders, it is nothing like the pressure you will get from your constituents when they find out you didn't really do anything to make their lives better because the prices are not coming down; the regulations that require all of those parts and policies that people don't want that they should have the freedom to choose, they are still there; and in the meantime, the new regulations by the great Secretary of Health and Human Services, in whom I have great faith, they will be tied up in litigation. Maybe they get to the Supreme Court in 2 years. Maybe they don't. Maybe it is longer.  And the American people continue to suffer because we didn't have the guts to do what we should do, what we promised we would do, and that is: Repeal  I would like to keep the Senate majority in 2018, and I am convinced that the only way we do that is if enough of us endure the name calling in the short term, and stand up and say no on this bill that doesn't keep our promises. It has got some good stuff in it, no question, but it doesn't keep our promises.[[Page H2238]]And if enough of us will do that, then maybe we can get the Senate and the House leadership to agree to do what we promised.  Then the President will be hailed in 2018, as prices of insurance actually come down, people are given their freedom back to choose their doctor, their health insurance, and the short stint of the name calling now ends up paying dividends in a glorious future.  So, Mr.Speaker, thank you for recognizing me. We will see how the week plays out.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-20-pt1-PgH2236.txt,1801,ENCOURAGING EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP ACT OF 2017,2017.0,20.0,January
1590,topic-id,288,"Mr.Speaker, it is always an honor to be here and, especially, to look out and see some people for whom I have eminent respect in this body. That is a nice thing, being in a body where I actually have respect for the people in the body, a good thing.  We know that elections, as President Obama told us quite succinctly 8 years ago, have consequences. Elections do have consequences, and we have a new team coming to town. One of the things that has concerned me greatly, and I know it has concerned many in this body, is that we as a Nation have had the ability to give protection basically to this idea of freedom that our Founders had, cultivated, and gave their lives to create.  As I have mentioned from this podium previously, as I was told by some west African Christians in Togo, they said:       We were so excited when you elected your first Black      President, but since your President has been there, we have      seen America get weaker and weaker. We all are Christians and      we know where we are going when we die, but we also know our      only chance for peace in this world is if America is strong.      So please go back to Washington and please tell the other      Members of Congress to stop getting weaker. We suffer when      you get weaker.  I seen this article from Melissa Mullins after a study was done. It said, ``Christians Most Persecuted Religious[[Page H286]]Group in the World.'' And that is while America is supposed to be the strongest nation in the world.  Mr.Speaker, I see a friend is here on the floor, and I now yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.Mooney).  ",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH285-3.txt,1801,ENCOURAGING EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP ACT OF 2017,2017.0,10.0,March
1591,topic-id,4035,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate so much my friend Mr.Mooney's points. Well made.  This administration hasn't turned around health care in America, hasn't seen more choices, people keeping their doctors, keeping their insurance policies they liked. They have seen deductibles skyrocket, such that so many people across America have had $5-, $6-, $7-, $8,000 deductibles. We never had deductibles that high before.  What that effectively meant was they weren't going to get any health insurance help. They were totally on their own, that every single payment that they made, even if they got subsidies from the Federal Government, was for nothing. They got no help. They could never come up with enough money in 1 year to meet the deductible so that the insurance would start paying in.  What is even more egregious is that apparently we found out that much of this was known would happen before people had ObamaCare forced onto them.  Then, in the last week we have had this story from Stephen Dinan, from The Washington Times, finding out that the IRS prioritized their role in ObamaCare over taxpayer customer service. That is what their own inspector general report said.  You would think that an administration that says their number one concern was America's health care, that they would not drive so many people off of the insurance they had, they loved, that they could afford, that had the doctor in the system they could use, had the medicine in the policy covered that they could use. Millions have been driven off of their policies to Medicaid, which so many doctors don't even take, and this administration has called that a great victory.  Yet, in the midst of all of this, we knew--it was talked about back in 2010 when this bill was being passed--that there could be 18,000, 17-, 18,000 new IRS agents that would force ObamaCare upon the country. And as so many people have reported, when you get notice from the Internal Revenue Service that they are coming after you, it does not do anything to enhance your health.  KLTV, in my hometown, contacted me here today, wanting to know more about what was happening with the It has been outrageous what they have been doing across the country in their local taxpayer service assistance offices.  It was reported to us that a sign was put up by one of the IRS employees that, basically, if you don't like the long line and the bad service, then contact your Member of Congress--and fortunately, many did, so we became acutely aware of it.  And what was worse, I mean, we had an office in Some people are able to go--are required to go get documentation from the IRS in order to do[[Page H287]]what they need, whether it is with insurance, with their employer, and they couldn't get into the IRS office. The IRS office closed in Longview, making it so much more difficult for Americans in east Texas to get the customer service they needed.  Well, this article from The Washington Times points out that the IRS has made things much more painful for taxpayers than it should have been, and that is according to the IRS' inspector general. That was in a report Thursday that accused the agency of cutting money for customer service and ignoring phone calls while moving the money over to keep ObamaCare and other administration priorities on track.  Well, what that means is the IRS would be there to bully people who had concerns about or problems with ObamaCare, which certainly would not help their health at all.  But one reporter had told me that previously they were told by the IRS that Congress cut funding and, you know, that is why customer service was cut. Yet, when we presented the actual facts of what had happened, yes, in the past 6 years, the House of Representatives--not the Senate, for heaven's sake. They haven't cut anything in their own House of But the House of Representatives cut our own budgets about 22 percent over a 3-year period, and that is pretty dramatic.  Anybody that has ever had to cut their budget by a fourth understands. Americans have had to do that across the country. We did it right here in the House of Representatives, and it has been very difficult for some of our offices to provide the care for constituents. So many areas, we are it. We are the ones that can help them stand up against the bureaucracy and demand that they get what the government is required to provide, and yet we were able to do it.  On the other hand, the IRS wasn't cut 22 percent like the House cut ourselves down to the bone. In fact, they had a substantially smaller cut over 2 years, I believe it was.  In this past year, we increased the amount of money the IRS got by millions and millions of dollars. What the IRS chose to do is not help taxpayer service, which could also help the IRS from increasing their punitive work against taxpayers that make mistakes because they didn't get proper advice or service from the IRS assistance.  But no, they moved the money. The massive increase we gave to the IRS, they moved it over to be a bigger bully regarding ObamaCare and cut out offices, like the one in Longview, and fell more into the stereotype than I have ever seen for the IRS, this as ``IRS employees ignored more than 30 million phone calls from desperate taxpayers seeking help in the run-up to the 2015 filing deadline--and those who did get through often waited a half hour before getting help.  ``The IRS apologized publicly for the poor service and blamed Congress, saying lawmakers needed to pony up more money if they wanted better results.  ``But Inspector General Russell George said the IRS cut its own funding by eliminating nearly $150 million from customer service, slashing more than 2,000 staff positions''--and that is so they could go after more enforcement of ObamaCare, as if ObamaCare wasn't doing enough damage to people's health as it was.  As my friend, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady pointed out: ``The IRS is running out of excuses for its abysmal customer service record and poor management decisions.'' This new report is even more proof the IRS is failing the very people it was created to serve--American taxpayers.  Congress did add more money for the agency last year, just as I was saying, Mr.This article also echoes the same thing. The IRS doubled the number of calls it was able to answer, but the agency has promised to maintain a level of service for next year.  But let's face it, the IRS has shown they will target people because of their political beliefs. They will allow themselves--not just allow themselves. They insert themselves and have allowed themselves to be political weapons. Certainly saw that occurred from what has come out from 2012.  Did they affect the election? It is hard to say. But they certainly prevented many conservative groups from being able to organize.  I have heard some who are liberal, not that smart, asking questions: Well, I don't see how that would hurt conservative groups just because the IRS did not recognize them. They could still have gone ahead and organized and done their thing.  Again, apparently they pay too much attention to the mainstream media and don't think for themselves, because when one begins to understand the power of the Internal Revenue Code in the United States, you put a group together and you pool your money into one pool to start spending as a group, somebody's going to be in trouble and going to be accounting for that money as income. I mean, there may be creative ways to handle it, but the way you are supposed to handle it is to get recognition from the Internal Revenue Service that you have a group that can come together, put your money together, and work together toward a common goal. Liberal groups have not had much problem getting that kind of approval, but conservative groups really were targeted by the  And there is a law--we didn't need to pass a new one--that, according to the facts that have come out regarding Lois Lerner and others at the IRS, it certainly appears that there is probable cause to believe crimes were committed and should have been pursued. Yet nothing was done.  Why?  Because they were groups that were persecuted, not allowed to organize, that did not support this administration; therefore, according to the Justice Department that became more of ``just us department,'' they weren't going to pursue anything like that.  And in the further category of further de-Americanization of America, this report from Paul Bedard that U.shipped 6 of 10 refugees to the United States, even more this year.  Then there is a list from the United Nations refugee resettlement referrals. This report just came out in the last week, less than a week. The U.reports that of the 134,044 refugees settled in 2015, gee, 82,491 of the 134,000 were sent to the United States, that despite the fact information came out, study done, that actually we can support 12 refugees in place in the Middle East for the same price of bringing 1 refugee to the United                              {time}  1845  In fact, this administration didn't have to use the term redline. This administration could have simply said: we are going to make sure there is a safe zone in which people can live in the Middle East in a certain area and the U.will assist them with food--hopefully, without raping the women and girls, because they have in some areas. We will provide them a safe zone, and their needs will be cared for there. We can handle 12 times as many for the same price as bringing 1 into the United  I think voters understood that, when they voted Donald Trump as President, there are so many of these refugees that simply cannot be vetted.  We know this administration has made mistake after mistake, not only with people that we have no information to use to determine whether or not they are a threat because we have no background information on so many of these, but also, once they are here, we don't know where they are, we don't know where they go. We don't know even the threat.  Then, on top of that, we find out hundreds, maybe thousands--we know hundreds--of people were supposed to be deported that this administration accidentally--instead of deporting them and getting them out of the country so they were no longer a threat, this administration accidentally granted them citizenship.  There are some things that this government could do and you would say: well, it is easy to understand. That is an easy mistake. Instead of a 1, they put an 11. Or, instead of a 0, they put a 3.  Instead of deporting people and getting them out of our country, this administration accidentally gives them citizenship and has made clear that they are not capable of protecting us from the threats that we are seeing all over Europe and other areas of the world.  A point of personal privilege, really, I would like, Mr.Speaker, a shout out to the TSA, which is underneath our[[Page H288]]Department of Homeland It was such an honor to be singled out last Friday for the two molestations. Apparently, I am attractive when it comes to TSA agents. They want to feel up and down, make sure all the parts are actually attached.  They did a very good job of that both times on Friday evening when I was flying back to So my thanks to the Job well done. It delayed me 30 minutes or so. I kept thinking the TSA agent was going to lie back and have a cigarette or something, but that never happened.  Anyway, due regards for the I am really and truly hoping that we can change substantially management of the TSA in this coming year. At airport after airport, we see two, three, four times longer lines for the TSA PreCheck than there is for the general boarding. Yet, TSA continues to encourage people to go ahead and apply. We can streamline your getting through the inspection. And yes, that does mean when you are in PreCheck, you will enjoy having hands laid on you, not in a Christian kind of sense.  Over and over, there are good TSA agents, I am finding, all over the country, but the management is atrocious. How long would any security agency stay in business if every day they had longer lines in one area that was the least threat to our security as they do in the general boarding lines that need to be more carefully monitored, we are told? Well, you would fire them. You would hire another security agency.  I haven't seen a study done on this, but, as I recall--I was watching back during my days as a judge and chief justice, and I will have to go back and look--there were so many screams from Congress, especially the Senate, especially on the other side of the aisle, that we have got to have the Federal Government take over security at the airports. We have got to. We are in such danger. We have to have that happen.  Has security been enhanced by adding tens of thousands of people to the government unions? No, it hasn't. It really hasn't.  So, what I want to go back and look at, it seems like I remember back years ago, after the Democrats were able to prevail over Republicans who were in the majority and get them to agree to federalize the security at airports so that they could get them in the government unions, I was thinking, I don't know that that is really going to help. Are we going to see a better quality of TSA agent than we had in private security? I would like to see an official number.  Maybe if somebody in Homeland Security is listening, Mr.Speaker, they could, in their time between looking the other way as people come into the country illegally, they might just look up how many private security airport personnel were not hired by  The reason for federalizing the security was so that we will get a better quality of security. It seems like there was a lawsuit back there by a couple hundred people, maybe. We are the only ones not hired by Out of the thousands and thousands, we are the only ones that weren't hired.  It seems like there was a problem in response that yeah, we really needed people that could read and had finished high school. If you couldn't read or hadn't finished high school, we really needed that level.  So, basically, it seems what happened is one group here in Congress--and it wasn't the Republicans--had their way. The security at airports was federalized. We are not seeing an increased percentage of capturing items that are coming in, but I have got to say they do a good job of feeling up and down my person.  I am not really a threat, though Homeland Security would assume that. Well, I was in the Army for 4 years. I am a strong I believe in the Bible, and I believe in the United States Constitution as the greatest governing document that was ever promulgated.  Apparently, according to the minds at the top of this Homeland Security Department, that makes me more of a threat than most anybody in the country. I was even told back in London, coming back, I believe that was from another trip to Egypt or maybe Israel, and I had to go out from security and come back through. I was told by one of the security guys: Sir, I know who you are and your position, but your Homeland Security Department tells us we have to thoroughly inspect your baggage and you personally. I got it from the British security folks as well.  Apparently, if you believe in the Constitution, you believe in the Bible, you have served your country in the United States Army, and you are a Christian then you are a big-time threat.  It will be so nice to have an administration that doesn't see the world the way this administration has seen it.  We had a lecture from the Secretary of The President of the United States said amen and hallelujah when he condemned Israel over and over and over. We stabbed our friend, Israel, in the back. There are reports in some sectors that not only did we abstain but we encouraged the resolution to be brought forward so that Israel could be condemned.  It apparently generated this article from Victor Davis Hanson from National He said:  ``Secretary of State John Kerry, echoing other policymakers in the Obama administration, blasted Israel last week in a 70-minute rant about its supposedly self-destructive policies. Why does the world, including now the U.S.''--I would submit, Mr.Speaker, not for much longer--``single out liberal and lawful Israel but refrain from chastising truly illiberal countries? Kerry has never sermonized for so long about his plan to solve the Syrian crisis that has led to some 500,000 deaths or the vast migrant crisis that has nearly wrecked the European No one in this administration has shown as much anger about the many thousands who have been killed and jailed in the Castro brothers' Cuba, much less about the current Stone Age conditions in Venezuela or the nightmarish government of President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, an ally nation.  ``President Obama did not champion the cause of the oppressed during the Green Revolution of 2009 in Did Kerry and Obama become so outraged after Russia occupied South Ossetia, Crimea, and eastern Ukraine?  ``Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power was never so impassioned over the borders of Chinese-occupied Tibet, or over Turkish-occupied Northern  ``In terms of harkening back to the Palestinian `refugee' crisis that started in the late 1940s, no one talks today in similar fashion about the Jews who survived the Holocaust and walked home, only to find that their houses in Eastern Europe were gone or occupied by others. Much less do we recall the 11 million German civilians who were ethnically cleansed from Eastern Europe in 1945 by the Soviets and their imposed Communist governments. Certainly, there are not still `refugee' camps outside Dresden for those persons displaced from East Prussia 70 years ago.  ``More recently, few nations at the U.faulted the Kuwaiti government for the expulsion of 200,000 Palestinians after the liberation of Kuwait by coalition forces in 1991.

And I might add parenthetically, when we have a new President, that will drop even further because the United States will begin to produce more of the energy that we have been blessed with. There will be more nations in the world that will not have to go begging to Russia, which supposedly those on the left are so concerned about these days. Well, if they are so concerned, let us produce more west Texas oil, more east Texas natural gas, more oil and gas from around the country, and, boy, we will be energy independent. And as smart people have pointed out for a long time, it is a whole lot easier to take on terrorists who are throwing rocks than terrorists who are launching nuclear weapons.  Back to this point being made here in National Review: ``Partly, the criticism of Israel is explained by oil--an issue that is changing daily as both the U.and Israel cease to be oil importers.  ``Still, about 40 percent of the world's oil is sold by Persian Gulf nations. Influential nations in Europe and China continue to count on oil imports from the Middle East--and make political adjustments accordingly.  ``Partly, anti-Israel rhetoric is due to herd politics.

Instead, they prefer sermons to other Westerners as a sort of virtue-signaling, without any worries over offending politically correct groups.  ``Partly, the piling on Israel is due to American leverage over Israel as a recipient of U.aid. As a benefactor, the Obama administration expects that Israel must match U.generosity with obeisance. Yet the U.rarely gives similar `how dare you' lectures to less liberal recipients of American aid, such as the Palestinians,'' for example, ``for their lack of free elections,'' not to mention their lack of paying, encouraging, immortalizing people who are suicide bombers who are successful in killing innocent victims.  The article says: ``Partly, the cause of global hostility toward Israel is jealousy. If Israel were mired in Venezuela-like chaos, few nations would care. Instead, the image of a proud, successful, Westernized nation as an atoll in a sea of self-inflicted misery is grating to many.

But ``a Palestinian who may be linked to ISIS rammed his speeding truck into a group of Israeli soldiers in Jerusalem Sunday, killing four people and wounding 15 others before being shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a year-long campaign of violence.''  Now, even that, from friends at FOX News, is not as accurate as it could be. Yes, they were soldiers that were killed. They were on a sight-seeing tour, and apparently the insidious radical Islamist sat parked and waited for them to be in a vulnerable position, not in a position to use weapons, not fighting. They were sightseeing. As this radical Islamist saw these people getting off the bus, that is when he moved and became the murdering, blood-thirsty, radical Islamist that he was.

1592,topic-id,1460,"Mr.Speaker, I wanted to finish talking about this issue that has been raised about the Russians being such a big threat to our elections. Some of us have been screaming here on Capitol Hill that we need to have security of the And as part of that, one of the last things we needed to do was give control over Web site determinations to the international community. That was created as an American entity, the We had control over ICANN, the organization controlling the Web sites, and this President did irreparable damage to our security. Oh, I know he thinks he didn't, so I am not accusing anything untoward, but irreparable damage was done by giving over that power to the so-called international community.  This article from John Fund, who had a great book about election fraud, points out, and he quotes from a former colleague, Rahm Emanuel: ```You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,' Rahm Emanuel, Obama's just-named chief of staff, told a Wall Street Journal conference of top CEOs in November 2008 while his boss was still President-elect. Since then a slew of constitutionally dubious executive orders, presidential emergencies, and rushed legislation have characterized the Obama presidency. Now he is leaving office by issuing a blizzard of `midnight regulations' and edicts.  ``One of the most troublesome came last Friday and gave the federal government the power to begin centralizing our election systems. The Constitution explicitly gives states the power to set the `times, manner and places of holding elections.'  ``But Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson used the excuse of Friday's release of a report on Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee to declare that state and local voting systems will be designated as `pieces of critical infrastructure' so that the U.Department of Homeland Security can protect them from hackers.  ``His move--coming just 15 days before President Obama leaves office--led many experts to question both its wisdom and its constitutionality. `While the Federal Government has the general power to protect the nation's cyber infrastructure, it cannot intrude into areas of state sovereignty without clear constitutional mandate,' John Yoo, a law professor at UC Berkeley, told CNSNews.com.  ```There is no federal power to control or secure elections. Each state administers its own elections, restricted only by constitutional protections for voting rights,' agreed Illya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato `It may make sense for states to request federal support here, but it would set a dangerous precedent for a federal agency to unilaterally take over state electoral processes.  ``Secretary Johnson's decision sparked outrage among many of those who are most knowledgeable about our election system--the 50 secretaries of state who, along with local officials, run the election process. Even Johnson admitted that `many of them are opposed to this designation.'  ``Secretary of State Brian Kemp of Georgia, told me in an interview that Johnson's action `uses security as an excuse to subvert the Constitution and establish the basis for Federal encroachment into election systems.'''  Now, Mr.Speaker, I think it is important to pause and look at what happened in this last election. Now, there have been some people saying, as I heard down at the Senate in the Kennedy Room at Jeff Sessions' hearing this morning, there were 17 intelligence agencies that agreed about the Russian hacking. Well, I am not sure. They must have seen something I didn't, but I had understood there was, like, three, and that we have been told actually they had these conclusions, but people have admitted--no, actually, they didn't hack our election system. They didn't hack any voting machines. Clapper even admitted that. Of course, he has said: I have testified very falsely. He has admitted under oath that he has not been truthful under oath to the Senate before.  So as a law professor once asked: If you have admitted lying, well--he[[Page H290]]would say--are you lying now or were you lying then? If you admit you are lying, which one is really the lie?  We don't know. Is he lying now or lying then?  You have said--you have told us you are a liar. Which one is it?  What we find among smart juries, once they found you lied to them, is that they are not going to trust you about anything else. I think that contributed to the voting results we had.  But Conservative HQ had an article: ``Russian Hacking Story A Twofer For Obama And the Left.'' Say, gee, they get to blame the Russians and they get to take control of the voting system.                              {time}  1915  Well, all that has come out is somebody hacked John Podesta's emails--most likely an unprotected server like Hillary Clinton was using--and we lost secrets we may never know. But it was unprotected. Podesta's was at least protected. And people saw published what Democratic people participating in the Hillary Clinton campaign had said about Christians, Catholics, the duplicity of trying to bring down Bernie Sanders, the duplicity at debates, the if it is not illegal, the certainly rule-violating strategies of revealing questions before a debate.  Shockingly, when the truth was revealed and certain people in the Hillary Clinton administration, or in their campaign, were exposed as lying about so many things, those people are now saying: Hey, when America found out we were lying, they voted against They hurt our election. They affected our election because we were exposed as liars and it cost us votes. That is grossly unfair. The American people should never have known the truth that we were lying about so many things, that we were conspiring to bring down Bernie Sanders and defeat him unfairly. The American people weren't supposed to find those things out and, doggone it, those Russians need to be punished.  Well, I don't know where it came from. And I also know, as a fact, that some intelligence personnel have lied to the chairman of our Intel Committee in the last I know it is a fact. I don't know who it was, but they did.  When you have Clapper say, Yeah, I came in here and testified about a bunch of stuff that wasn't true, you wonder wouldn't it be a good idea to take those incredible individuals in our intelligence agencies that have been faithful to our country, served our country, not their political agenda, and done great things for America, let's get them in the positions of authority in the intelligence agencies. And since they have been working there, they will know what to do; they will know who to trust, who not to trust.  As you find out, if you ever sit on the bench as a felony judge very long, it doesn't matter what area of life you are in, there are people that are not honest. Fortunately, in law enforcement, intelligence agencies, homeland security, places like that, in my opinion, there is a much higher number of good, honorable, honest people that care about providing for the safety of the American people. That is where we need to go. Find those people in those departments and put them in positions of leadership.  We have a great opportunity now before us, and if you are agnostic or atheist, you should believe it was all a roll of the dice. This kind of stuff happens. Hey, even a pragmatist agnostic would probably say: Well, if I am honest, somebody--Julian Assange said it wasn't the Indications were it may well have been an unhappy Democratic operative in the party that provided. But wherever they came from, information was provided to the American public showing the terribly unfair and untruthful things that have been said or done, and they voted against the party that had apparently done the unfair, untruthful things.  So I think we need to look, as Shakespeare would say, not to our stars, but in ourselves. Personally, I think we were mercifully given another chance to give back to the American people the power that this Congress and the executive branch has used for far too long and let America be America, not the evil parts--the KKK, the lynchings, the horrid things that mar our history--but the goodness, the part of America that would say, ``I don't care about the I am going to take you into my home. I am going to protect you''; the parts of America that said, ``I don't care what color your skin is. We are fellow human beings and we have got some good ideas and we are going to work together and we are going to raise this Nation to heights it has never seen before.'' I am hoping and praying that is where we are headed.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH285-3.txt,1801,ENCOURAGING EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP ACT OF 2017,2017.0,10.0,April

The answer to the question, why now, is that this Federal Government has not done its job. This Congress has not done its job in complying with the aspirations of the  When you have disagreement between documents, as we did between the Louisiana Purchase on the south border of the Red River, and Oklahoma going to the middle of the Red River--and, of course, the Red River changes as time goes on--then the Federal Government should have long since stepped in and said: Here is the land we are talking about. Here is where the borders will actually go.[[Page H1158]]  I am amazed at times, we talk in terms of agencies, of bureaus, of departments, as if they are some independent country that deserves a place at the United Nations making policies and making executive decisions all their own.  These people work for us. The Bureau of Land Management does have some folks that don't understand that. They think they are an entity unto themselves, and they make policy. Well, that is not what the Constitution set up.  In fact, the Constitution, in the preamble, as my friends know, says: ``We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic . . .''  This is what this bill is trying to do.  Now, last Congress, my friend, Mac Thornberry, had a bill that went ahead and took care of the issue, once and for all, and it was going to sell the land, and this dispute could be over. But since friends in the Senate were not able to come to a conclusion and they still just could not figure out what an appropriate disposition was, then my friend, Mr.Thornberry, has come back with this bill.  It is consistent with what every good parent will tell the child: Before you make a decision, gather all the evidence and information you can, then make a more educated, informed decision.  That is all this bill does, Mr.It says, we are going to do a survey now. We are going to figure out what land we are talking about.

Why now?  That is a great question. This should have been done 100 years ago or more than 100 years ago. It wasn't, so it is time to do it now and ensure domestic tranquility.

1638,topic-id,871,"Mr.Speaker, if Donald Trump is going to be successful as a President--successful from his point of view; not the point of view of the American people, or history, or the rest of the world, or the point of view of people who like peace and freedom, but from his point of view--then he is going to have to rely on fear.  He got elected by creating fear about immigrants, Mexicans, and Latinos, calling us rapists and criminals. He got elected by creating fear about President Obama, the Blacks, thugs, and big cities.  He got elected by creating fear among Americans about the big, scary world out there with threats from ISIS, al-Qaida, and But for some reason, he left out things like the fear of Russia or his buddy and friend,  And if President Trump is going to enact his agenda of deportations, building a wall, and making it impossible for people to come to the United States with visas, he needs to use fear as well. For example, he feels he needs to publish a list every week of the crimes that were committed by immigrants to scare Americans into fearing our community.  And Trump needs to use fear in another very important way. He needs to scare the immigrant community.  Why?  Because he knows he doesn't have the money, the manpower, or the time to drive 11 million men, women, and children who are undocumented out of this country. He doesn't have enough jails, ICE agents, or airplanes to deport[[Page H2700]]11 million people. That is the population about as big as the State of Illinois, and such a max exodus will not be easy.  So what do they do?  They use fear. Trump has to make immigrants scared to leave their houses. Trump has to make parents scared to take their kids to school. Trump has to make doctors' offices, courthouses, police stations, and fire departments places where immigrants are afraid to go.  Trump has to make sure that undocumented immigrants who are raising children--most of whom are American citizens--in families who have lived in the U.on average for more than a dozen years, and who own homes, cars, and businesses, he has to make them so afraid that they want to leave this country.  It is a Presidency and a Presidential policy agenda that relies on fear and bullying to achieve success--or what people who surround Trump define as success, at any rate.  How do Americans respond to fear? Do we hide in our homes and isolate ourselves and run?  No, that is not what people do in the United States of America, and we never will. We stand up and we stand together and confront fear.  So on May 1, millions of Americans are going to stand up. We are going to stand together and we are going to rise up.

This is a campaign to galvanize broad support for immigrants, so this is not going to just be a Latino thing or an immigrant thing. Churches, mosques, and congregations are going to rise up. Unions, students, teachers, and working men and women are going to rise up on May 1.  Let's be clear, when we marched for women in massive numbers the day after the inauguration, it was not just women marching. When we came to the airports to stand up for American values and against Trump's Muslim ban, it was not just Muslims standing up for American values. It was a lot of the rest of us, too.  So if you care about justice, rise up with us on May 1. If you think a man should be able to use a men's bathroom, even if his birth certificate says he was born a woman, rise up with us.

1608,topic-id,918,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, Federal ownership of the land along the Red River dates back to the Louisiana Over time, gradual changes in the course of the river have created uncertainty regarding Federal interests in the area as well as confusion about the exact boundary between Texas and Further complicating the matter, Native American Tribes have mineral and other interests in the area impacted by the precise ownership of the land in question.  In fact, as noted in the Supreme Court case of Oklahoma v. Texas, a 1923 case, the decision was the boundaries were changed due to accretion and erosion. It is important to note that the gentleman from Texas does not dispute the criteria set forth by the Supreme Court in Oklahoma v. Moreover, in 2000, Congress passed the Red River Boundary Compact, which shifted the boundary line between the States, but the location and status of lands in the public domain remain unchanged. Along the 116-mile stretch, a portion of the land in the Red River area is still under Federal ownership because it has never been disposed of under the authority of  In 2013, the Bureau of Land Management set out to revise the Federal resource management plan for Federal lands--not private lands, Federal lands--in Oklahoma, Kansas, and As part of that process, the BLM began to survey the lands to determine the extent of all ownership claims. According to the 2014 testimony from the Deputy Director of the BLM, Steve Ellis, the survey process the BLM intends ``to identify, with certainty, and propose management alternatives for lands which fall within the public domain but have never been patented, reserved, or disposed.''  According to that same testimony, the BLM estimates that approximately 30,000 acres of public land exist along the Red River between the north fork of the river and the 98th meridian. They also estimate that as many as 23,000 of those acres may be overlaid by private ownership interests.  One of the most significant and advantageous parts about the process for updating land use plans is that it includes steps along the way that allow for public input, analysis, and informed decisionmaking.  Once the survey is complete, the BLM has a variety of statutory authorities the agency can use to resolve conflicting claims, including the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Color of Title  H.428, the bill before us today, has a troubled history. Flaws in the bill have prevented it from becoming law for several years. Some of those shortcomings have been addressed, but others remain.  H.428 would halt the planning and survey process in its tracks. The bill would strip the Bureau of Land Management of its survey authority along the 116-mile stretch of the Red River, and it would force the Federal Government to accept the survey completed by the States of Texas and  Prohibiting the Federal Government from surveying its own land is unprecedented and unwarranted. What is also troubling is that, in stark violation of Republican policy against authorizations without an offset, this legislation authorizes the expenditure of $1 million in Federal funding to pay the States to complete the survey.  It is important to note that allowing State governments to dictate the outcome of this process is a terrible precedent, and forcing the American taxpayers to pay the States for those surveys adds insult to injury.                              {time}  1515  Parts of this case are currently in the Federal court of the U.District Court for the Northern District of The parties include the State of Texas, BLM, and plaintiff landowners; and they are in mediation working to resolve these very complicated issues.

1610,topic-id,789,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I think it is very important for us--though they have made light of the fact that this has a history, beginning with the Louisiana Purchase--that this is not a new issue. There are a series of subsequent treaties with foreign governments in 1819, 1828, and 1838, which set the south bank of the river as the southern border of the United States and the northern border of what is now the State of  In 1867, when a portion of this public domain was reserved for the Kiowa-Comanche-Apache (KCA) Reservation, the middle of the main channel of the river between the 98th meridian and the north fork of the river was established as the reservation's southern boundary. The remaining land between what is now called the medial line and the southern bank retained its status as public land, which continues through the present.  In a series of decisions in the 1920s, the U.Supreme Court adopted a method known as the gradient boundary method for determining the location of the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma along the southern bank of the river. In giving certainty to the boundary's location and the extent of tribal holdings, the Court's decision also provided a basis for clarifying private land ownership on each side of the river.  In 1981 and 1984, two separate Oklahoma landowners argued in the United States District Court that, under riparian law, changes in the river's location had expanded their private holdings while reducing the acreage of the Texas landowners whose properties faced them across the river. In both cases, the district court followed the Supreme Court's established principle concerning the location of public and private lands.  Private property in Oklahoma extended to the center of the river while private property in Texas stopped at the ordinary high-water mark on the southern bank, with the remaining land being part of the original public domain located in  In 2000, the State legislatures of Oklahoma and Texas, along with tribal leaders from the neighboring KCA Tribes and Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations, attempted to resolve these remaining issues by agreeing to the Red River Boundary Congress later consented to the compact, and, in so doing, agreed to move the jurisdictional boundary between the States from the south bank gradient line to the south bank vegetation line.  The BLM began updating its resource management plan for public lands in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, which includes the area along the Red River, in 2013. The BLM doesn't full know the extent of public domain, and that is why they are trying to do the survey. The resource management planning process would update the current RMPs covering this area, which were developed in 1994 and 1996, and establish a long-term plan articulating the BLM's objectives and strategies for maintaining the health and productivity of public lands in the region.  As we discussed earlier, in 1923, the United States Supreme Court also interjected into this and set the criteria.  We can disagree on some of these issues, but we can at least agree to get[[Page H1157]]our facts straight. We do know, Mr.Speaker, that this has been an ongoing process and this has gone back for different administrations.  I think the question becomes: Why is it necessary to do this now? What is it that is happening now? They are in court. They have been in court. They have availed themselves of the court process. No one disagrees with the United States Supreme Court decision.  So the question we should all ask ourselves is: Why now? Why take out, in this bill, my amendment that was rejected by the Rules Committee which would have eliminated that portion which says basically the Federal Government has no say in the survey? So why would we abdicate that major responsibility?  We not only have responsibility to the tribes listed, but there are also different kinds of tribal lands, which we must take into account. So the question is: Why abdicate it?  If as was stated earlier that what we are talking about is just a bill that says to the BLM to do the survey, then why does it contain within it a statement that says it has no right to concur or to approve?  I think that it would be a different situation if this was a bill that said: hurry up and do your survey. But that is not what this bill says.  This bill says the States of Texas and Oklahoma will do it--actually, Texas will do it in consultation with Oklahoma and specific tribes.  Why doesn't it say, if what we want is a survey, that BLM do the survey?  I reserve the balance of my time.

1611,topic-id,472,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  It is very interesting because we seem to be confusing what is at issue here. If what is at issue here is a survey process, then there is no question. The survey process is set up in the United States Supreme Court decision of Oklahoma v. No one disputes that that should be it.  Neither is it disputed that BLM cannot illegally claim private property and, in fact, it does have a process by which it can sell that private property.  First, under Section 203 of FLPMA, the BLM may sell public lands for private fair market value if, through the planning process, the public land has been determined to be difficult and uneconomic to manage; the land was acquired for a specific purpose but no longer fulfills the Federal purpose; or disposal may serve important public objectives which cannot be achieved prudently on land other than public land.  Under Section 206 of the FLPMA, the Secretary of the Interior can also conduct land exchanges of equal value with the same State so long as the public interest is well served.  Mr.Speaker, the reason why there is a compact of 2000 on this specific issue is because the States can't do it without the concurrence of What is being proposed here, in terms of the survey, is really using a Federal standard.  Again, the question is: Why?  More importantly, Mr.Speaker, there are tribal lands involved; not only the tribes noted, but also different types of tribal lands, private tribal lands different from that which is held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior, and we are abdicating that responsibility.  We have a fiduciary duty to these tribal lands, and it should not be treated basically with, well, if we don't agree, maybe we can come forward and say we don't agree. That is not what this is about.  They are beginning the process. They are in mediation. The courts have been the mechanism by which landowners have views, and there is one going on. So why not let the process go?  It just seems to be out of Congress' authority to simply abdicate the responsibilities that we have and say: The States can do it. And then we pay for it. Now, that makes no sense.  We need to be able to say to those that we have a fiduciary obligation to, and others, that we have done our job; that the Federal Government has done its job.  They are in the process. So the question I have again is, why now? Why now? This has been going on since way--I read through all the different treaties and the different types of cases that came up since 1923, Oklahoma v. So why now?

1613,topic-id,662,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I respectfully disagree. In the year 2000, when the Red River Compact was approved by Congress, and because of the nature of a compact and because of the requirements of our United States Constitution, which I know my colleagues abide by, it is a different situation. This could have been addressed if they wanted it addressed, but that is not what was done.  It is not over 100 years. We have intervening facts, like the compact of 2000, which afforded Congress the opportunity to look at this and, more importantly, the States the opportunity to decide.  Now, what did they do?  They disagreed on the high-water mark. They did not go into these specific issues. I am sure it is not something that occurred within the last 17 years. This is something that existed all along. So I call everyone's attention to the compact of 2000.  Last year's bill, H.2130, contained in there the following statements: The Secretary disclaims any right, title, and interest to the land located south of the south bank boundary line in the affected area.  It also said that surveys conducted by the Bureau of Land Management before the date of enactment of this act shall have no force or effect in determining the south bank boundary line.  So to say that they didn't do anything--or it was being done--the law that was attempted to be passed, it passed out of the The bill that passed out of the House contains in it specific language that they are saying they don't want any of that to apply.  So, Mr.Speaker, we come back to, I guess, why? Why? The authority to survey and approve or disapprove the sale or transfer of public lands belongs to the Federal Government acting on behalf of the American people.  The Bureau of Land Management has held the authority to examine the accuracy of these surveys and make revisions, when necessary and, in this instance, an ongoing process to make changes began in 2013. It is not like nothing has happened. It has been ongoing. The BLM has the tools and authority to resolve this survey problem, and Congress should just get out of the way and allow the process to play out.  Instead, my colleagues across the aisle want to use the situation as an excuse to make progress on their larger goal, alienating public land.  Just last week, they voted to repeal the BLM's efforts to update their resource management planning process. BLM's new rule increased the opportunities for the public to engage in the management of public lands and help the agency respond more efficiently to changes taking place in the environment and across the landscape.  By repealing BLM's planning rule, Republicans are ensuring that more disputes like Red River will develop, more public land will be lost or destroyed, and more litigation will ensue, all costing taxpayers more money.  So, Mr.Speaker, when we talk about H.428, it is just the latest step in a very unpopular, anti-public lands campaign. Americans across the country have equal ownership and right to access and to enjoy all the resources. Whether it is a national park in Montana, a national park in Hawaii that has a volcano, forest lands in Pennsylvania, or wetlands in Colorado, the opportunities afforded through these resources belong to us all, regardless of hometown, education, means, or experience.  Despite the fact that we are talking about a 160-mile stretch of the Red River, by cutting away at the authority and management tools Federal agencies have at their disposal, this bill furthers my colleagues across the aisle's national public lands agenda and threatens the multiple-use principle that governs all BLM lands, all while costing the taxpayers the money.  It is like adding insult to injury. Not only do we pass a law, but we are also paying the States to do the survey.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

However, it would be unprecedented and would only further complicate matters to transfer the Federal survey authority over public domain to the This is not the way our public lands should be managed.  There is a transparent, objective process to determine ownership along the Red This bill subverts that process and sends $1 million in Federal taxpayers' money for a State purpose. This is neither fair nor just outcome.  With the long, complicated history and various ownership claims along the Red River, BLM has to be allowed to complete its planning process and land survey. It also needs the right to have a say, which this bill, H.428, eliminates that right.  Congress should not determine the outcome of what essentially amounts to a three-way property dispute by conceding Federal authority to a BLM has its tools it needs.

Mr.Speaker, what we are here talking about today is opportunity. We are not talking about the money interests. We are not talking about waving the bloody shirt of the Enron debacle. What we are talking about here today, Mr.Speaker, is in the interest of innovators. It is in the interest of talented Millennials who have huge student loans, who have a great idea to benefit themselves, their community, their economy. We are here to be in the interest of hardworking workers who have no big investment dollars, but have an abundance of sweat equity. We are here in the interest, Mr.Speaker, of building businesses and growing this economy. If we do that, we are growing jobs and opportunity for our citizens. And we are in the interest, Mr.Speaker, again, not of the money interest, but of efforts all over this country, led by people like John Delaney of Maryland and Stephen Case of Virginia, to build out venture capital and entrepreneurship in places other than Boston, Massachusetts; Menlo Park; places like Detroit; Flint; Little Rock; Louis; and That is why we are here today. This bill is a simple, commonsense, small step in that effort.  For many years, in my private sector life, I helped young companies form and raise capital for them. In my own business, I extended stock options and[[Page H2673]]opportunities to buy stock to those very people who did not have the excess cash to invest. Many companies issue stock to compensate their employees, but it is especially important to startup businesses and private businesses. It is especially important to those businesses that are trying to compete with big private enterprises that have a public stock to offer as an incentive. And structuring competitive compensation in private businesses is very challenging.  Further, for employees, this stock ownership is a huge source of pride, allowing individuals to participate in the growth and prosperity that their hard work and sweat equity have helped build.  Through rule 701, the SEC allows private companies to offer up to $5 million in their own securities without additional regulatory bureaucracy. My friend from Illinois (Mr.Hultgren) and my friend from Maryland (Mr.Delaney) have simply made a small change, Mr.Speaker; and that is to raise that commensurate with inflation to $10 million to reflect the world we live in today. This is not rocket science; this is something we need to do for building our economy.  As we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the JOBS Act by President Obama and the successes this legislation has yielded in capital formation for small and emerging growth companies, I urge my colleagues to support this effort by my friend from Illinois in this bipartisan, commonsense job-creating proposal.

Mr.Speaker, small businesses and entrepreneurs are what drive the American economy. I meet with them in my district, the Second District of Michigan, all the time. I know my colleagues do as well back in their districts.  We see them firsthand. We see firsthand the benefits that their dreams, their innovations, their inspiration, and their hard work provide to our communities.  These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk-takers are critical for our country's economic growth and prosperity. In fact, small businesses are responsible for 60 percent of the Nation's net new jobs over the past two decades. Not 2 years, not 10 years, but over the last 20 years, the last two decades.  If our Nation is going to have an economy that provides opportunity for every American, then we must promote and encourage success and growth in our small businesses and our startups. It is this notion that brings us this legislation we are discussing today.  H.1343, Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, would simply level the playing field for small companies by updating Federal rules that allow small businesses to better compensate their employees with ownership in their own businesses.  Currently, Securities and Exchange Commission rule 701 permits private companies to offer their securities as part of written compensation agreements to employees, directors, general partners, trustees, officers, or certain consultants without having to comply with rigid Federal securities registration requirements. SEC rule 701, therefore, allows small companies to reward its employees.  Despite the SEC having the authority to increase the $5 million threshold disclosure via rulemaking, the SEC has once again chosen to prioritize highly politicized regulatory undertakings instead of focusing on its core mission. That mission includes facilitating capital formation. If the SEC cannot or will not focus its priorities, Congress will.  It is imperative that small businesses in west Michigan, all of Michigan, and across America have the ability to compete. A critical element of competition and success is for those small businesses to be able to offer compensation packages that attract and retain top-tier talent.  In today's world, that includes rewarding employees in stock options. To me, this just makes common sense. Small-business employees have a clear and vested interest in the success of their employer.  By increasing the rule 701 threshold to $10 million, it will give private companies more flexibility to attract, reward, and retain those highly valuable employees. This simple change will allow companies to offer twice as much stock to their employers annually, as they currently can, without having to trigger additional disclosure information to investors about compensation packages that include these security offerings.  By reforming this regulatory burden, startups, small businesses, and emerging growth companies will be better equipped to attract highly talented individuals from companies that are better capitalized and able to maybe provide some additional cash compensation.  By incentivizing employees with stock options, small businesses will now be able to compete on a more level playing field with older, larger, and maybe more established companies. They are going to be able to retain their invaluable employees as well.  This bill is an example of the positive bipartisan results that can be achieved when Republicans and Democrats reach across the aisle. I commend the sponsors of the bill, Representatives Hultgren, Delaney, Higgins, MacArthur, Sinema, and Stivers for their leadership on this issue. I encourage my colleagues to support H.1343.

1685,topic-id,469,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close.  My colleague on the other side is trying to maybe split some hairs. We heard some rhetoric earlier on the floor here which, I think, shows why many on both sides of the aisle scratch their heads in opposition to this bill. We heard about monied interests. We heard about corporate wish lists. We heard about Enron which is, by the way, a publicly traded company which has absolutely nothing to do with this bill. Now, that all might play really well on a leftwing political base, but that is detached from the realities of what our economy is about.  As we have talked, 60 percent of all new job creation happens in small businesses. These are not corporations. These are LLCs, limited liability corporations. These are subchapter S sole proprietorships. These are small entrepreneurs and innovators.  By the way, I looked up the definition of innovator. It is a person who introduces new methods, ideas, or products. Those are the kind of dynamic elements that we are seeing here. And I think this confusion between corporations and Enron and what we are trying to do here is really a disservice to the American people.  This is about making sure that we update basically an inflation escalator from 1988. We update a rule that the SEC could have the power to do, which it has not done, that benefits employees and benefits those owner-employer's workers who oftentimes, more often than not, work alongside their employees. So they are the ones who are seeing this on a daily basis.  I can just say to you that, as was pointed out by my colleague from across the aisle from Maryland, if we don't do this, what most of those small businesses are going to do is say: You know what, it is just not worth the effort; I am not going to do it. And we will see that lack of upside going to those employees.  As was pointed out by my fellow colleague from Michigan, this is beyond their salary, this is beyond bonuses. This is an additional way to make sure that those relationships get cemented in.  So, at a minimum, all you would be doing is voting to confirm the inflation escalator from 1988. It is not a radical change to the law.

1664,topic-id,810,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman.  I do want to thank my colleagues for being here. I think this is a really important discussion that we are having today. It is such an honor to serve with all of my colleagues.  I do think some who have spoken opposed to this legislation really don't understand the impact. There is nothing in this legislation that takes away any disclosures. Disclosures still remain. The same disclosures that have been in place for 30 years remain exactly there. This does not have anything to do with Enron, a publicly traded company. It is completely different. This is private sector. This is opening up opportunity. I think, by arguing against this, ultimately, it is taking away opportunity from employees to benefit.  It is such a privilege to serve with people like the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.Delaney), who was part of this, opening up opportunities to hundreds of families. Congressman MacArthur, similarly, opened up opportunities that changed lives, as well as Congressman Trott, who is going to be speaking as well. They opened up opportunities to people who would never have had opportunity to own a company, to own that and to have it completely change their family and their future.  I rise to support H.1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017.  My legislation is based on a simple principle: Employees who own a stake in the company they work for every day want to see it do well and will do their best to make sure that that business succeeds. Their sense of ownership over details, large and small, makes a real difference to the bottom line and, just as importantly, to the quality of life of the employers and employees. When the company succeeds, the employee succeeds. The business, in turn, receives a large boost in productivity, enabling it to expand its reach and invest in new technology and equipment.  EEOA would make it easier for companies in Illinois and nationwide to let hardworking employees own a stake in the business they pour their sweat into every single day. This benefit also helps companies attract top talent, even if the company is just starting out.  Warren Ribley of the Illinois Biotechnology Industry Organization, which represents companies that employ thousands of residents in the 14th Congressional District, believes: `` . . . offering an ownership stake to employees is a critical tool in recruiting top talent to job-generating companies. And there is no doubt that an equity stake encourages employees to drive hard for success of that enterprise.''  Unfortunately, some companies are shying away from offering employee ownership because of regulations that limit how much ownership they can safely offer. SEC rule 701 mandates various disclosures for certain privately held companies that use more than $5 million worth of securities for employee compensation per year.  This threshold was arbitrarily set by the SEC in 1999. For businesses that want to offer more stock to more employees, this rule forces those businesses to make confidential disclosures that could greatly damage future innovation if they fell into the wrong hands; this includes business-sensitive information, including the financials and corresponding materials like future plans and capital expenditures. The SEC's original rulemaking acknowledged these concerns.  And these disclosures aren't just risky, they are costly. As the Chamber of Commerce has explained, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act would instead ``help give employees of American businesses a greater chance to participate in the success of their company.''  EEOA builds off the JOBS Act reform to rule 12(g), which increased the number of shareholders of record that a company could have without SEC registration from 500 to 2,000 and exempted employee compensation securities from the registration requirements. This idea championed in the JOBS Act,[[Page H2672]]that the law should treat employee compensation securities differently than traditional securities, has not been extended to the SEC rule 701.  My bill is simple. It is a bipartisan fix. EEOA raises the outdated threshold for enhanced disclosure from $5 million to $10 million, keeping pace with inflation every 5 years. We are taking something that is already working and making it available for even more companies and, more importantly, more employees.  To be clear, issuers who are exempt from enhanced disclosure would still have to comply with all pertinent antifraud civil liability requirements. Furthermore, the employees purchasing these securities observe the business they work for every day and have a closer perspective on its operation that is not available to the traditional investor, thus negating the need for additional disclosure. We should applaud the employee ownership from the board room to the shop floor.  I thank the bipartisan cosponsors of this EEOA legislation, especially Congressman Delaney for his hard work and Congressmen Stivers, Sinema, Higgins of New York, MacArthur, Gottheimer, and I thank Speaker Ryan and Chairman Hensarling for their support in advancing this critical legislation.

I believe that employee ownership opportunities should be made widely available to all employees of a company, from the boardroom to the shop floor.  As the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Polis) stated, this legislation is an important step forward to increasing ownership opportunities and gives companies more flexibility to make those opportunities available.  We should understand how this legislation would help increase participation for employees at all key levels.

1740,topic-id,485,"Mr.Speaker, this is a monumental week here on Capitol Hill as we will decide the fate of health care in  Despite the evidence that the Affordable Care Act has made a positive difference in the lives of everyday Americans, Republicans are set to destroy it. But the Affordable Care Act has improved the quality of life for tens of millions of people all across this country.  As a result of the Affordable Care Act, people born with preexisting conditions can no longer be denied health insurance.  As a result of the Affordable Care Act, young people can remain on their parents' health insurance all the way through to the age of 26.  As a result of the Affordable Care Act, women can no longer be discriminated against with respect to the issuance of insurance simply based on their gender.  As a result of the Affordable Care Act, seniors are paying less for lifesaving prescription drug medication.  As a result of the Affordable Care Act, more than 1 million people throughout this country--including in rural America--are able to receive substance abuse treatment because of them being caught up in the opioid addiction epidemic.  The Affordable Care Act has made a positive difference in the lives of everyday Americans, yet this President says it has been a disaster. This is the same President who, for 5 years, perpetrated the racist lie that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America, who said that he received more votes than Hillary Clinton, who claimed that there were more people at the inauguration than in 2009. This is an individual who still maintains that his predecessor, Barack Obama, committed a felony and ordered a wiretap, despite testimony from the FBI Director to the contrary.  Let's be clear. What will be an unmitigated disaster is TrumpCare, which House Republicans are working to jam down the throats of the American people.  TrumpCare, the Republican healthcare plan, will result in 24 million Americans losing their health care.  TrumpCare, the Republican plan, will gut Medicaid, stripping it of $880 billion, taking dead aim at seniors, the poor, and the afflicted.  TrumpCare will impose an age tax on people between the ages of 50 and 64, causing some in that category who are currently paying approximately $1,700 per year to pay close to $14,000 in age tax--on people between 50 and 64.                              {time}  1045  That is TrumpCare, the Republican plan, an unmitigated disaster taking dead aim at the American people. It will result in tens of thousands of Americans dying. It is a death sentence. Seniors will die. The poor will die. The chronically ill will die. Rural Americans will die. People between the age of 50 and 64 will die. And the executioner will be the authors and those who support the Republican healthcare plan.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

H.1343, Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017, eliminates important disclosures that private companies must provide to their employees in the event they are compensating those employees with stock.  This bill would limit transparency. If companies want to pay their employees in stocks, they should have to simply disclose to their workers the risks associated with those investments.  Currently, private companies can provide up to $5 million worth of stock compensation annually to their employees and are not required to provide any financial disclosure. This bill would lift that cap to $10 million.  If companies choose to provide an employee with stock compensation, they should be required to inform that employee of the appropriate financial information, benefits, and the risks associated with that investment, including 2 years of company financial statements. All of this information is commonly available to typical investors.  Let's be clear: this stock is compensation for their work. Employees deserve to understand the value of their compensation prior to accepting it. They deserve the same protections that other investors would get.  I agree with Professor Mercer Bullard, who is a professor of law at the University of Mississippi School of Law, who testified before the Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments Subcommittee voicing his concerns about the bill. In his testimony, he noted that to take advantage of the terms of this legislation, an issuer would have to have at least $34 million in total assets. Surely, such minimal disclosures are not too burdensome for those sort of companies.  I do also understand that some proponents of this legislation argue that such an exemption is needed because disclosure of company information to employees runs the risk that confidential information could be leaked to competitors.  Employees with access to such information could simply be subject to nondisclosure agreements, which are typical today. Indeed, nondisclosure agreements are a simple solution that protects the company, but does not deny the employees the right to understand the worth of, or the risks associated with, the compensation they are receiving. Unfortunately, this bill would limit that transparency and those protections.  Mr.Speaker, I oppose this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

1665,topic-id,999,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate the comments of my colleague and friend. I do, however, disagree that the question here derives from a lack of understanding of the legislation. I think it is entirely possible--in fact, I would suggest that it is likely--that members of a body such as this, from 435 distinct districts and different experiences, can look at the same information, fully understand it, and come to different conclusions as to what sort of policy ought to be in place, and that is where I have landed on this particular subject. I fully understand.                              {time}  1545  I also think it is important to note that we can't on one hand say that this is not about disclosure and on the other hand mention that these disclosure requirements could have a negative impact and encourage or discourage companies from engaging in the practice of awarding employees with stock as a part of their compensation.  It is a question of disclosure. This legislation is about the disclosure requirements that should be applied in this case. That is really what we have heard from both sides of this argument: where should that disclosure requirement be, and at what level should it be incurred?  What I would say is--and I think this is important to note, speaking for myself--I know many other members of the Financial Services Committee and Members of this body that may oppose this legislation feel strongly that the direction toward awarding employees with stock ownership is a positive direction. It is something that my friend, Mr.Delaney, has not only advocated for, but has practiced in his own private sector experience. It is a positive thing for a company and it is a positive thing for the employees.  The only point that I continue to drive home and that others have reiterated is that it is important that employees understand the nature of the stock that is being awarded to them and that the disclosure requirements make clear employees are aware of the compensation and its true value. That is really the point of my objection.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter I received from Public Citizen, which articulates some of these same arguments.                                               PUBLIC CITIZEN,                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 2017.     Member,     House Committee on Financial Services,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of more than 400,000 members      and supporters of Public Citizen, we offer the following      comments on bills facing a committee vote March 9, 2017.       In securities lawmaking, we believe the committee's compass      should always point to investor protection. Well informed      investors who can trust disclosures form the bedrock of      capital formation. We are concerned that a few of these      measures point in a different direction.       HR 910: The ``Fair Access to Investor Research Act of      2017'' directs the SEC to eliminate restrictions on research      reports that cover Exchange Traded Funds (ETEs). The result      of this measure means that firms promoting ETFs can      simultaneously publish reports that appear to be impartial      analysis. This may lead investors to take unwarranted comfort      in the security. In the last decade, ETFs have grown from      about 100 funds with $100 billion in assets to more than 1300      funds with $1.8 trillion in assets,That makes the playing      field for mischief immense.       Puffery parading as research led to the dot-com bubble in      the late 1990s, where analysts disregarded fundamental      metrics such as a revenue and income when recommending the      purchase of new internet-based firms. This measure improves      on a previous iteration of the legislation by allowing      fundamental fraud oversight by the But the bill ignores      the basic hazard that a firm's motivation in funding research      may be sales promotion and not bona fide education for its      clients. We also note that ETFs represent the securities of      active firms. That is, an ETF holds assets such as stocks or      bonds. That means this has little to do with capital      formation. Now, research reports insulated from government      scrutiny may too often serve to promote more turnover and      commissions, not sound guidance. For these reasons, we oppose      this bill and encourage members to vote no.       HR 1343: The ``Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017''      increases from $5 million to $10 million the amount of      securities a firm may sell annually to its employees without      providing certain basic financial information. We believe      this is misguided for a number of reasons. First, defenders      of this measure reference the potential for leakage of      propriety information. There's little evidence of this      problem. It's simply not in the self-interest of an employee-     owner to divulge critical information to a rival, especially      if it would undermine the value of the stock. Second,      employees who are compensated in stock (instead of additional      cash) should be entitled to be informed about the financial      condition of their company, the same as any other investor.      Other company creditors, such as the firm's bank or major      supplier, receive this information, however this measure      reduces stock-compensated employees to a class below these      other creditors. Young firms may be struggling with cash-flow      problems and choose to use stock rather than cash for      compensation. But those employees should be informed about      such risks. Third, the basic thrust of this measure is to      lead employees to hold a greater share of their savings in      the firm. An employee invested in his or her own firm may be      more productive and lead to greater profits at the firm that      the employee then shares; but there is a point beyond which      this dynamic dissipates. Any prudent investor should      diversify. Overconcentration in one asset, especially where      the firm's prospects are less than stellar, compounds the      employee-investor's risk. We oppose this bill, and encourage      members to do the same.       HR 1366: The ``U.Territories Investor Protection Act''      extends basic U.securities law oversight to investment      firms operating in Puerto Rico and other U.territories. To      date, these firms have escaped oversight, disclosure and      conflict-of-interest requirements that mainland firms face.      We support this common sense reform.

I would just point out again that the position many of us are taking does not contradict the principles that are being articulated. In fact, the law does not preclude any company from awarding stock as compensation at any level. It simply requires that information be provided so that those individuals who are receiving that compensation have the information and have the resources to understand the value of that compensation. I just want to reiterate that because it is important that the position not be mischaracterized as one that wants to dampen the ability of companies to reward their employees with stock or use that as a form of compensation. It is just important that they have transparency in that process so people who are receiving that compensation understand its true value.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

1684,topic-id,494,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close.  I have heard a number of my colleagues point to the red tape and the unnecessary burdens that are placed on a company that wishes to provide stock compensation.  Let me be clear about what it is that we would require. This is what is required for a company that exceeds the threshold: That they provide a copy of the compensation plan or a contract, if they disclose that; a copy of a summary plan description, if it is an ERISA retirement plan or, if not, a summary of the plan's material terms; risk factors associated with the stock; and the company's most recent financial statements from the last 2 years, which don't need to be audited.  This is important information for anyone receiving stock as compensation in order to understand the value of that stock and not a burdensome requirement on a company, particularly a company of the size that would be required under the increased threshold that is being proposed by this law.  If there is any aspect of this debate which is common sense, it is common sense that a person receiving compensation ought to have information that tells them the value of that compensation.  Mr.Speaker, I think this is an important debate and discussion. It is one that this body is well-served by taking on.  I do agree, as I said, that this is an important direction for us to take as a nation. And it certainly makes sense that, in order for us to fully all participate in the economy, employee ownership is a value. It creates more productive companies, more competitive companies. It provides better compensation, and, as has been pointed out, it creates more stable organizations less likely to lay people off, more likely to be sustainable companies. That is all good, and that is important.  It comes down to the question of transparency. Employees deserve to know the state of their employer's finances, if they are to accept stock in lieu of monetary compensation. They deserve no less protection than other investors in the company.  We shouldn't fear that kind of transparency. A company that wants its employees to accept stock instead of monetary compensation should embrace this sort of compensation. If they want to empower those employees and they want to make them a part of the company, they should provide them with[[Page H2675]]the information that helps them understand the value of that ownership.  Transparency is important for individuals to make informed choices, not informed choices coming from a dictate from Washington but information that they have the right to have. It empowers them with knowledge that allows them to make choices about the form of compensation that they would accept.  That is what this legislation really is about, and that is why I oppose the legislation and encourage my colleagues to join me in that.  I yield back the balance of my time.

1779,topic-id,2330,"Mr.President, I rise today to express my deep concern about this administration's ties to the country of We are just 3 months into the 115th Congress, and I have come to the Senate floor multiple times to discuss inappropriate contact between Trump administration officials and the Russian This is truly unprecedented.  Our Constitution was set up to guarantee that our democracy would be free of influence from foreign powers. For months, U.intelligence agencies have said that Russia used covert cyber attacks, espionage, and propaganda to try to undermine our democracy. Reports show it, and the facts prove it. As I learned from my trip at the end of the year with Senator McCain and Senator Graham to the Baltics, Georgia, and Ukraine, this is not unique to our country and our elections and our democracy. This is something that has gone on for years--where Russia shut down the internet in the little country of Estonia simply because they had the audacity to move a bronze statue to a public square in Lithuania where they invited members of the Ukrainian Parliament who were in exile from Crimea in Kiev and invited them to Lithuania to celebrate their 25th anniversary of independence from Russia, and then they attempted to hack into the computers of the members of the Parliament in  As Senator Marco Rubio noted, this is not just about one party or one candidate or even about one country; this is an assault on democracies across the world. Last month, we learned that the very day President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia, with unprecedented attacks on our democracy, General Flynn, a member of the Trump transition team, spoke to a senior Russian official regarding those sanctions. The National Security Adviser, the person charged with the most sensitive matters of U.national security, then misled the Vice President of the United States and then, in turn, the American people. He resigned, as did the former chairman of the Trump campaign; he resigned.  Now we have learned that Attorney General Sessions met with the Russian Fine, Members meet with Ambassadors; we know that happens. But in fact, he met with the Russian Ambassador only 3 days after then-President Obama was at the G20 He was at the G20 Summit, and he met with Vladimir Putin himself. He told him to stop the cyber attacks, but he also told him that America was not going to back down from the sanctions. In fact, President Obama told the whole world that day in a press conference that we were not going to roll over and back down on the sanctions imposed against Russia because of their illegal invasion of  What happened 3 days later? Then-Senator Sessions, now our Attorney General, in fact, met with the Russian  Senator Sessions was then asked about contacts with the Russians from Trump officials during his hearing. I was there. I serve on the Judiciary Senator Franken posed some of those questions, in addition to Senator Leahy, who has noted that, at best, the answer was misleading.  That is why I feel so strongly that a press conference today is not enough and that Senator Sessions must come before the Judiciary Committee and answer under oath the questions that we now have.  What are those questions?  What was actually said at the meeting? Were sanctions discussed? Remember, 3 days--this meeting occurred 3 days after President Obama had said he would not roll back the sanctions. Were the sanctions discussed? Why did the Russian Ambassador, by the way, not meet with many other Members that day? We may not have a full accounting, but it appears that many of the Armed Services Committee members did not meet with the Russian Ambassador that day.  2, what were the discussions with the Trump administration, then-campaign officials back in September, before that meeting occurred between Senator Sessions and the Russian Ambassador? What were the discussions leading into it? What were the discussions after the meeting? Those are things we truly need to know.  For weeks, Senator Sessions could have corrected the record--for weeks, during the time in which this Russian issue and the contact with the Trump administration were discussed thoroughly. For weeks, I have been calling on Senator Sessions, now Attorney General Sessions, to recuse himself from any investigation into  There are clear Department of Justice guidelines about conflicts of interest, and, as I have said for weeks, when you read those rules, there is a clear conflict of interest. Today, Attorney General Sessions agreed to a partial recusal. He recused himself on the part of the investigation that relates to the Presidential campaign. Well, the American people deserve a full recusal.  Think about it. The meeting between General Flynn and the Russian Ambassador took place after the campaign ended. The meeting that we just learned about today between the President's son-in-law and Russian officials happened after the campaign ended. We need a full recusal and an independent counsel to manage the investigation of contacts between the Russian Government, the Trump campaign, and the Trump administration.  I believe, as I have noted earlier, that Attorney General Sessions must come before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath and answer these questions:  Were sanctions discussed? What were his discussions leading into that meeting with the Russian Ambassador? What were the discussions afterwards? And I am sure my other colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have many, many other questions.  I know when I asked about Russia at Senator Sessions' nomination hearing, I asked him very specifically if he had any reason to doubt the evidence put forward by our 17 intelligence agencies that there had, in fact, been an attempt by a foreign government, the country of Russia, to influence our election. He said he had no reason to doubt those findings. He had no reason to doubt those findings, so he clearly understood when you read that report how important this is--the $200 million spent in propaganda by Russian TV, as well as the hacking, as well as the attempts to influence the election.  So we have these facts. We know that meeting took place just 3 days after the President, our then-President Obama, met with Vladimir Putin at the G20 We know that is a time when Putin was told by the President of the United States to stop undermining the U.election system with cyber attacks. This was back in September before the election even occurred. We saw Paul Manafort resign from the campaign over We saw General Flynn step down over his contacts with the Russian Ambassador, and then we have that meeting. To me this seems like a pattern, and I want to not only see the facts through the investigations that are ongoing but also hear from the Attorney General himself.  That is why I am calling for the Department of Justice inspector general to investigate the actions of the Attorney General and whether the ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign and administration contacts with the Russian Government has been compromised in any way.  We know that Russia attempted to interfere with our election. Russia tries to undermine our democracy. This is not fake news. This is as real as it gets.  Aides and surrogates of this administration during the campaign and the transition were in contact with officials from a foreign government that was actively working to bring our democracy down. They were actively working to influence our elections. As Senator Rubio has noted, one time it is one candidate and one political party, and the next time it will be the other candidate and the other political party, unless we all come together in a bipartisan fashion to get to the bottom of the facts.  So how do we do that beyond the recusal and the independent counsel and having Senator Sessions come back before the Judiciary Committee to thoroughly answer my questions and the questions of my colleagues? Well,[[Page S1587]]the other way we do it is by having an independent commission. That is why I introduced, along with Senators Cardin, Leahy, Feinstein, and Carper, the bill that was announced by Senator Cardin and me, with Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings, that would create an independent, nonpartisan commission to uncover all the facts and make sure that future elections and political campaigns are safeguarded from foreign interference. Remember that this commission can go alongside the Intelligence Committee investigation--not to replace it but to be in addition to it--because this committee and experts appointed by this Congress from both sides of the aisle, just like the 9/11 Commission so successfully did, could actually not just uncover some facts that aren't known publicly, but, most importantly, they can make recommendations to make sure this doesn't happen again.  By the way, there are upcoming elections in Germany and in France, and getting that information out there doesn't just help our democracy, it also helps democracies in other parts of the world. We also need--and I touched on this earlier--an independent counsel, special prosecutor to look into all the contacts between the Trump administration and the campaign and have a full recusal.  What else can Congress do besides the independent commission? We have to make sure that the Intelligence Committee proceeds with its investigation. I am pleased that Senator Burr and Senator Warner have come together and announced that they are going to do a full and thorough investigation. They will also be looking into the contacts with the campaign--incredibly important.  Now we have the issue of the sanctions. As I mentioned, the day that the Obama administration was imposing additional sanctions on Russia--and the Trump campaign, through General Flynn, was actually meeting during this transition day with the Russian Ambassador to perhaps undermine those sanctions--I was with Senators McCain and Graham in Eastern As I noted, when we were in the Baltics, we heard and met with leaders--Prime Ministers and Presidents of these countries in Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, who have seen this movie before. We went to We went to We heard from Ukraine--6,500 attempts to hack into their country's computer system alone, shutting down access in Trolls, in a building in Moscow--nearly 1,000 people--who are now working and have been working to undermine democracies all around the world.  So this isn't just about defending our own democracy; it is about defending the world's democracies. It is about saying to a country that thinks they can just get us to roll over and say: Hey, you can influence our election. No, that is not right. That is why we worked for expanded sanctions; that is why we introduced on a bipartisan basis with Senator McCain and Senator Graham--and I was one of the original sponsors with Senator Cardin and others--the Countering Russian Hostilities Act that would impose more sanctions on It would address cyber attacks, human rights violations, and its illegal annexation of land in Ukraine and  Just this weekend, on Sunday afternoon, I met with my Ukrainian community. Hundreds of people showed up on a Sunday afternoon in Minnesota because they are so concerned about their friends and relatives and they so believe in our democracy. Right down the road from the Ukrainian Center, where we held our meeting and where I listened and answered questions from my constituents, is a deli called Kramarczuk's. It is owned by a Ukrainian immigrant family whose parents came over to our country having fled oppression, and they came over to our country and bought this deli. They put this beautiful mural across an entire wall, and it is a beautiful photo of our Statue of Liberty, that beacon of democracy. Because of the Kramarczuks--they believe in our country. They believe in They believe in a country that is going to stand up for freedom of the press, that is going to stand up for freedom of religion, and that is going to stand up for them and their rights as immigrants to be citizens in this country. They believe in it because they have seen the worst of it. They have seen dictatorships, they have seen oppression, and they came to our country. They expect our country, as they serve their Ukrainian food to the people all over Minnesota in front of the big mural of the Statue of Liberty--they believe that our country is going to stand up for democracy.  That was the message that Senator McCain, Senator Graham, and I brought to the people of We not only, of course, met with the President and their official leaders, but we also went right to the frontline. On New Year's Eve, we were in Eastern Ukraine on the sea--cold, snow coming down--with hundreds and hundreds of Ukrainian troops, hearing the stories of a mother who was so young, who had just lost her son a week before to a Russian separatist sniper. We heard the stories of the 10,000 people killed just as this conflict began, standing up for democracy, just as we have stood up for our democracy.  So when all of these discussions go on about recusals and about who should resign and what should happen, let's remember what this is all about. This is about saving our democracy and making our democracy strong so we can continue to be the beacon that those Ukrainians put on their wall in their deli because they believe in this country so much. This isn't about partisan divides. This is simply about being a democracy and getting to the bottom of it. When something goes on and a foreign country is trying to influence things, you have to put your party aside. You have to say: You know what, I want to know what happened here. If I am a Democrat or Republican, I want to know what happened so it doesn't happen again. I want to be able to protect our citizens and our election system and our democracy. That is what this is about.

1673,topic-id,429,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding the time.  Mr.Speaker, over the last 8 years, our Nation has experienced sluggish economic growth. Americans have suffered through stagnant paychecks and a lack of new opportunities. Last year, the economy grew at a meager 1.6 percent, which is half of the historic average.  However, there has been one job filled that has grown at a faster rate than any other; and that job is those who specialize in regulatory compliance. This is a testament to the crushing onslaught of new regulations under the previous administration, where compliance with regulation and red tape was emphasized more than growing businesses and creating jobs.  We in Congress must do our part to foster economic growth and relieve our job creators of the excessive burden of complying with unnecessary regulation. The bill before us today will do exactly that.  Currently, businesses that offer more than $5 million in stock to their own employees are required by law to comply with costly financial disclosures. This number was set nearly 20 years ago. It is time to update the law and raise this threshold to encourage small-business startups and give them the resources they need to expand and create jobs.  The Encouraging Employee Ownership Act would raise this threshold to $10 million and give private businesses more flexibility to reward their employees with ownership of a company. This bill passed the Financial Services Committee last month with strong bipartisan support.  This is just one of the many steps that we must take to foster innovation and encourage capital formation, to provide every American with opportunities that they deserve. We must build an economy that is open and accessible to every single American, not one that is closed off to those who can't afford to comply with the high cost of bureaucratic red tape and endless government paperwork.  As a former small-business owner for 20 years, I know the employees benefit tremendously from any opportunity to participate in a company's success. I support this bill because I know from personal experience this model works and helps startup companies to retain their best employees over the long term.  Americans are not satisfied with the stagnant economy that has become the new norm in our It is unacceptable for government to stand in the way of prosperity and make it harder for Americans to succeed. Small businesses employ half of U.workers, and we must promote, not hinder, small business growth.  This bill, Mr.Speaker, empowers Main Street, not Wall I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill.

1658,topic-id,328,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I also want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr.Hultgren) for his work on this legislation and, more broadly, issues surrounding American entrepreneurship. He has been a tireless advocate.  Mr.Speaker, over the last 2 weeks, the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, which I chair, has held hearings to examine the impact regulations have had on financial institutions, small businesses, and American consumers. What we have seen is that the burdens stemming from Dodd-Frank and associated Obama era policies continue to harm consumers and small businesses.  We have what some have referred to as a two-speed economy. Large banks and their large customers are thriving, but the story isn't as bright for small businesses. That is why H.1343 is so important. Small businesses and startups don't necessarily have the same opportunities to access the capital markets as their larger competitors, but from a regulatory standpoint, the small guys are treated the same as the big guys.  Mr.Hultgren's legislation takes an important step in addressing some of the disparities that exist. H.1343 will allow small businesses to attract and retain employees through incentives similar to those that may be offered by large businesses. Unlike the gentleman who just got done speaking, this is not about It is about small businesses that we are talking about.  It will also ease some of the reporting burden on small and emerging businesses. The bill does so simply by increasing the SEC rule 701 threshold, taking the existing rule and simply expanding it, a figure that hasn't been touched since 1999.  It is essential that Washington take steps to level the playing field for small businesses and eliminate this two-speed economy. The bill the House will consider today is another step toward job creation and a more reasonable regulatory environment.  I again want to thank and commend Mr.Hultgren for his leadership and ask that my colleagues join me in supporting H.1343.

1670,topic-id,383,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.  Various measurements of the economy have shown economic growth and an increase in the stock market. The frustration that I hear from so many of my constituents is that: With all of this economic growth, why haven't my prospects improved? Why has there been wage stagnation? Why aren't my family and I earning any more than I was?  It is true, because a lot of the benefits of this economic growth have gone to shareholders and consumers rather than workers. We are all consumers, and we have all benefited from that. And do you know what? We are all shareholders through pensions and through retirement accounts, public and private. Many people also put food on their table and pay their rent, wearing their hat as an employee or a worker.  One of the things that we can do not just by passing this bill, but by passing a whole host of legal changes both in the tax framework and in the regulatory framework to make it easier for employees to own companies, is allow employees and workers to share in the value that is being created on the shareholder side of the ledger. Then, and only then, can we have an economy that works for more people rather than just a few.  This bill is a small step in that direction. It can reduce the cost and remove a detriment that small to midsize companies have from aggressively pursuing employee stock ownership. But it is just a first step.  There is a lot of work that we need to do to reorient the economy around a shareholder economy that aligns the incentives of workers with those of shareholders. It is good for sustainable profits, it is good for long-term economic growth, it is good for stability. It is a better way to make sure that of this vast value that is being created, we all can partake in it on both sides of the ledger, as shareholders and as workers.  That is why I rise today in support of the bill, and that is why I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see this as but a modest first step towards a shareholder economy that works for every worker.

When employees are offered the opportunity to have an ownership stake in the place they work, there are benefits for both workers and businesses in our entire economy.  Many studies have shown that employee ownership increases productivity, promotes employee retention and stability, and has long-term growth benefits for the business. I believe that the underlying legislation is an important first step to increase employee ownership opportunities, but we should want to make sure that opportunities for participation are widely available to employees at different income levels.  The amendment also requests the GAO to see the effect of this legislation on the diversification of securities held in ERISA-governed retirement plans. As we all know, diversification in any type of financial portfolio can help weather dramatic fluctuations in the economy and limit financial risk for retirees.

This training into all of the ethical standards that were just invoked by my distinguished colleague from Michigan iscritical to guard against regulatory capture and to protect the public interest. The whole challenge of a republic is how to getlegislators and other public officers, who are agents of the people, to serve the common good rather than their own, privateinterests. In the cost-benefit terms of this legislation, you would call this the ``agency problem.''

Providingmandatory ethics training is a simple way to remind all of us in public life whom we really work for--the American people.  Requiring employees to undergo basic ethics training is not unusual. In fact, every congressional staffer who works in thisbody is required to undergo ethics training in his or her first 60 days of employment here.

1769,topic-id,1362,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today wearing this pink scarf in solidarity with so many millions of Americans who rose up this past Saturday, whether it be in D.C., on the West Coast, East Coast, so many cities in the Midwest, as well as those around the world.  It is interesting. My wife and I awoke to chanting of thousands of people. It almost felt like the protest was in our living room. And when we got out on the balcony, we saw thousands of people who were wearing pink hats and carrying signs and so boisterous with hope.  Amanda and I decided we would go down to join them. When we got to the street, it was an amazing scene, with the Capitol ahead of us, and so many folks just gathered together--like-minded--with a message of respect and of resistance. As we tried to get towards the stage as we got to The Mall and about a mile away, we couldn't even get past a wall of bodies of so many people who were there to cheer on the message of so many great speakers.  But we found our way through, eventually, and made it onto the stage. And what I can tell you was just sheerly unimaginable: 17 blocks of Americans, of all States, of all creeds, of all colors, of all backgrounds, who were there with a message.  We had some wonderful speakers that day. We had folks from labor. We had folks from criminal justice reform groups. We had folks who were fighting for reproductive rights. We had many celebrities there, of course, and we also had folks who cared about everything from our economy to agriculture, to equality, to anything you could imagine, so many values that we fought for over the last 8 years.  There is a sense that there is going to be common ground among many of these issues as we go forward.  American jobs, obviously, everybody in this Chamber wants to make sure that we protect Americans and make sure that we have employment for everyone.  We are also going to fight for common infrastructure among all of the 50 States, and that is something that we saw in the Senate the other day that was presented.  We may also have some common ground on tax reform, particularly if it means bringing back from overseas a lot of corporate money that certainly would be important to go through the same process as profits derived here.  But there is certainly, as we saw at the speech of so many people, there will be areas of resistance.  We care about workers' rights. We care about making sure that we have a Department of Labor that will stand on the side of working American families.  We care about having an inclusive economy, one that will respect a higher minimum wage; one that will fight for more high-tech, higher paying jobs; one that will fight for our manufacturing base; one that will be based upon tax cuts for the middle class, tax cuts for folks who are working, everyday Americans, as opposed to trickle-down economics and tax cuts for the wealthy.  It was also about health care and about saving ACA or, at the very least, replacing it with something that is still going to make sure that we don't have 18 million Americans, according to the CBO, losing their health insurance.  It is about making sure that we have a Medicare system that is not going to be block-rented out to the States as a creative way to cut Medicaid for our seniors and for our poor.  It is also about protecting Medicare for our seniors who paid into it through their whole lives and making sure it is not privatized, as well as Social Security, making sure that not only those who are receiving it today, but up to those who are millennials and beyond, will be able to receive that benefit. We all paid into it, and we all expect it to be there.  But it was also about equality. Many of our LGBT community are worried: Are these executive orders in place that are protecting equality in our Federal workforce going to be continued? Is this advance, this progression, this success in the Supreme Court and in so many other areas of society to have equality for the LGBT community going to be continued onward? There is a big doubt about that.  It is also about women's reproductive rights. We saw so many, including Planned Parenthood and so many other groups, who fought not only to protect health care, but to protect women's choice, stand up and say that they don't want to revert back, that they don't want our society to revert back on equal rights for women.  And we saw that today with the reinstatement of the gag rule across the Nation and the world, to encourage nations to prohibit reproductive rights, prohibit the ability to have birth control, prohibit the right to be able to exercise the right to choose.  So many of my fellow Hispanics are worried about immigration. A simple executive order can assure that our DREAMers go from law-abiding students and members of our military and those who are applying in part of this program to being undocumented and being potentially even hunted down by their government. It is about long-term comprehensive immigration policy and reform.  So many from my district, whether it be those who are also Hispanic or those who are from the Caribbean in my district, they care deeply about this. So does our agriculture community, so does our tourism community, so does business in general. These are going to be things that people are going to stand up for, and they certainly stood up for them during the march, along with women's rights, along with equality in general.  Then there is the concern about climate change and how there was a push forward over the last 8 years and there will be an attempt to backtrack.  I don't have to tell everybody, from the way the weather has been working over the last 10 to 15 to 20 years, that this is going to be one of the greatest challenges of our time--and for our kids and for our grandchildren. We do have to do it the right way, but we stood up to make sure that everybody knows we cannot go back.[[Page H669]]  In addition, Dodd-Frank and financial reform, so critical to preventing another Great Many of us remember in 2008, in October, when President George Bush got on TV and told everyone that we were in for a Great Recession and one that President Obama described as the greatest recession since the Great There will be an attempt to chip back on those reforms and an attempt to try to get away from the lessons we learned to try to prevent another global meltdown.  And of course criminal justice was critical. So many of our youth, so many Hispanics, so many African Americans, so many people who find themselves in greater proportion than other Americans in jail from a system that sometimes discriminates against them.  All of these folks stood up, millions of Americans stood up, and, yes, we had hats and, yes, we had pink scarfs and, yes, we spoke about the progress that we made in the fight. But in one word, this was about respect. It was about respect for all women across the Nation, all minorities across the Nation, regardless of ethnicity and religion, all Americans, all of our Americans with disabilities, all of our working class folks who are fighting every day to try to make a good living.  The message is clear. The message is clear from the millions of Americans who marched on Saturday that we will be watching, that we will speak up when we see things we disagree with, and when we have to, we will resist.  Those who marched on Saturday, we welcome you to the resistance, and we thank you for your support. It is going to be a long 2 years.

1607,topic-id,554,"Mr.Speaker, first, let me thank Chairman Bishop[[Page H1155]]for not only yielding me the time, but for his patience and diligence and understanding this issue, and I also want to thank Subcommittee Chairman McClintock for the work that he has put into it.  The Natural Resources Committee has conducted hearings on this issue. They have reported out bills related to this issue in the last two Congresses, and last Congress, the whole House voted for a bill that deals with this issue. I am grateful to Chairman Bishop and Subcommittee Chair McClintock for all of that effort.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is just a small sliver of what this House has passed before. This bill requires the Federal Government to do what the Federal Government should have done long ago, and that is to conduct a survey along the Red River following the instructions of the United States Supreme That is all this bill does.  It does not dispose of any land; it does not alter the rights or claims of any State, any tribe, any individual. It just says the Federal Government has a responsibility to know what the Federal Government is supposed to be controlling. They have never, ever conducted a survey of this area, and so this bill says: You will have a survey conducted using the method that the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held is a method you ought to use.  I am a little taken aback, Mr.Speaker, on why that should be controversial. We could go on at some length about how this came to be. It is interesting, historically, and we could go into a variety of details and so forth; but, again, the bottom line is the Federal law currently says the Federal Government has a responsibility to inventory and ascertain where Federal land is. Yet the Bureau of Land Management not only has never done it in close to 100 years after the Supreme Court decision, the Bureau of Land Management has said they never intend to. They will never conduct a survey of this 116-mile area.  So this bill, as I say, is very simple. It says the Bureau of Land Management shall commission a survey, jointly agreed upon by Texas and Oklahoma, tribal and other interests a full part of that, but there will, once and for all, be a survey to determine where the Federal claim is and where the Federal claim is not.  Now, part of the reason that is so important is because the Bureau of Land Management has, especially in 2013, come out and made a variety of claims that has thrown in doubt the proper title and ownership of land that has been in families for generations, that people have paid taxes on for generations. That has put a cloud on title of private landowners, and it does not help that cloud when the Bureau of Land Management says: We will never conduct a survey to determine exactly where the claim is.  So everyone, Mr.Speaker, every State, every tribe, every local government, every individual--even the Federal Government and the BLM itself--deserves to know where the claims rightfully are and where the claims are rightfully not.  First step is information. That is all this bill does. I think it is pretty clear that we should at least take this step.

1676,topic-id,408,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership  I want to thank my colleagues, Mr.Hultgren and Mr.Delaney, for their thoughtful and bipartisan work on this issue.  This is a commonsense, simple bill that makes it easier for employees to obtain ownership in the companies[[Page H2674]]they work for. When I was in the private sector, I gave dozens of employees an ownership interest. It worked out great for them, it worked out great for the company, and it worked out great for our customers. Ownership interest gave them an upside that could not be realized through a salary. The stock instilled loyalty and dedication. More importantly, it created a family atmosphere. We were all in it together. Our opportunities would rise and fall, depending on our collective success.  To have a career where someday, through your hard work, you can end up owning a piece of action is what the American Dream is all about. The outdated cap is keeping this dream, for no good reason, from many  I suspect that those who oppose the bill, while they may understand the legislation, probably have never worked in the private sector and have no clue how meaningful incentives and opportunities, such as stock ownership, are to individuals. I found it was the best way to motivate and reward employees. In fact, it worked so well, no one ever left the company except to retire.  My friends from Michigan and Minnesota oppose the bill because of a lack of transparency. The argument is flawed because it assumes stock ownership opportunities comprise all or a significant portion of the individual's compensation. This is not correct. A stock ownership benefit is typically over and above salary and bonuses.  To require the owner of a small business or a startup to make disclosures will cause many employers not to give employees this opportunity. Implicit in their argument is an assumption, like in so many other areas of life, that individuals cannot be trusted to make decisions on their own, that they need the help of all of the smart politicians and bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., to tell them what to do and what they need to see, and, of course, we cannot trust people to make decisions and discern for themselves whether stock ownership is a fair opportunity.

1777,topic-id,2790,"Mr.President, I am here to give my weekly ``Time to Wake up'' speech. It is occurring on a day when the President has signed an Executive order that purports to be an effort to undo a good deal of work the American Government has done to address climate change. I have to say that it is a little bit hard to take this Executive order very seriously when the President is in trouble, which seems to be an everyday experience for him right now. The White House staff seems to entertain him and distract him by putting on these amateur theatricals in which they can give him a nice big folder that he can make a big signature on with a flourish and feel like he is doing something significant, when, in fact, these entertainments create little effect and mostly just confusion.  The administrative agencies that he is purporting to direct to stop taking action on climate change have a couple of differences from this particular Oval One is that they are obliged to follow the law and will be held to the law. The second is that under the Administrative Procedures Act, they have to follow real facts. They don't get to make up ``alternative facts'' in the fever swamp of the Breitbart imagination--at least not for long, because their record can be reviewed by courts. Finally, they can't make decisions that are, to use the standard of administrative law, ``arbitrary and capricious.'' This is an Oval Office that lives by ``arbitrary and capricious,'' but administrative agencies don't get to follow it there without having their rulings thrown out by courts.  So ultimately this is going to come down to lawyers and to courts, and lawyers and courts are actually pretty good places for addressing climate change seriously because it is very hard for the lies that are at the heart of climate denial to withstand cross-examination and to stand up to the obligation of witnesses to actually testify truthfully and under oath in court proceedings or even in administrative proceedings.  The inconsistencies of people's statements and behavior can be brought out through cross-examination, which has been described as ``the greatest engine for the discovery of truth ever invented.''  Discovery means that litigants get access to documents on the other side, and it also means that the court has a chance to look into conflicts of interest.  Administrator Pruitt, thanks to the backing of the fossil fuel industry, which is well on its way in trying to turn America into a banana republic through its interests, actually got through the Senate without ever having to disclose who funded his dark money operation. That alone is a kind of preposterous statement, but it is true, because the Senate majority wouldn't insist that those questions be answered because they were so all-fired eager to shove this fossil fuel tool into the Administrator's seat at Those questions never got answered.  Once there is a case brought against him in which he has to decide whether to recuse himself and that decision gets reviewed by a court, guess what. A court gets to have those questions answered. So there is going to be a lot more that gets discovered as this all goes forward.  The President, with the Executive order today, has made himself ridiculous, which is no great achievement given his recent record. He has made his administration ridiculous, which is unfortunate but not unexpected given the climate-denying crowd who has been given positions of responsibility in this administration. Unfortunately, he has also made the United States of America ridiculous, at least until the checks and balances of government set aright the forces unleashed by this ridiculous Executive order. So let's go on to something that is a little bit more fact-based and serious.  I take climate trips to various places. I went to Ohio back in 2015, and there I met two remarkable and very cool people: Ellen Mosley Thompson and her husband, Lonnie They have been married for 45 years, and that is also how long, more or less, they have been research partners. They do particularly amazing research. They are glaciologists. They study glaciers. They run the Byrd--as in Commander Byrd--Polar and Climate Research Center at Ohio They have spent years and years, decade after decade, studying the world's glaciers and leading expeditions to the far corners of the world to incredible places--to the North Pole, the South Pole, the Greenland ice cap, the high mountains of Peru, and glaciers in faraway  They gave me this on my visit. This is a little piece of a plant. You can look closely at it, and you can see the little sticks and leaves that are in it. This plant has an interesting history. It grew about 6,600 years ago, and when it grew and lived, woolly mammoths roamed the Woolly mammoths might have been eating neighboring plants. The human race was just entering the Bronze Age, and it began to snow. It snowed on this little plant. Snow piled on snow year after year, and this plant was buried under a glacier, preserved by the pressure and the cold. And there it stayed, so that now I can hold it up on the floor of the Senate 6,600-and-some years later.  Climate change is what brought me this plant because as temperatures steadily rise, glaciers the world over are melting. The glacier that buried this little plant 6,000 years ago receded so fast that here it is now--6,000 years in a glacier and now here in my hand in the  It is not just plants that are emerging from this great melting. We are actually seeing remains of our own long-dead ancestors emerge from melting glaciers. This is all becoming so common that a new field of study has been created--glacial archeology.  For my 162nd ``Time to Wake up'' speech, I will share the story of the warming Arctic and our world's disappearing glaciers.  The Thompsons, when they leave Ohio State and travel, drill down into the ice, and they take deep core samples out of the glacier, long tubes of ice from the glacier. For Ellen and Lonnie, that means long trips and some challenging logistics, making sure that packed-down ice and snow containing hundreds of thousands of years of accumulated snow and ice doesn't melt along the way back to their lab at Ohio State because in those hundreds of thousands of years of accumulated snow and ice are hundreds of thousands of years of data.  I remember going to visit them. They store the core samples from these glaciers around the world in a huge walk-in freezer. It is like a library with metal shelving, except instead of having books on the shelves, it has these tubes, and they are marked as to where they were drilled out. You can pull the tubes off the shelf and take them to a viewer, and they have a light underneath it, and you can look at the light coming through it. You can see bubbles in the glass that captured the atmosphere from thousands of years ago, and you can draw the air out of those ancient bubbles and learn what the atmosphere was like back then.  There was a line through the core that they showed me, and I asked them: What is this line in the core? They said: Well, that was a really bad sandstorm. It is actually written about in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, and we can connect the timing of those ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs talking about this terrific sandstorm and going back through time, the date. And we know that this dark line in the core reflects that big storm that ancient[[Page S2053]]Egyptians wrote about thousands of years ago.  There are other researchers doing similar things. France and Italy have researchers creating a separate ice core repository, and they have dubbed their project ``Protecting Ice Memory.'' Their bunker for these cores is going to be 33 feet under Antarctica's surface, where they hope to be able to keep the cores cold for posterity because given the rate of climate change, these carefully preserved, packed-away, and frozen ice core samples are probably going to be the last record we have of all the information that was left in and lost in melting glaciers.  This photo depicts Grinnell Glacier in Montana in what is now called Glacier National This was a picture that was taken in 1940. You can see the glacier here pushing up into the mountain. In this photo, you can now see the glacier as it is here. If it is not clear, all of this is not glacier; it is lake, it is water.  The U.Geological Survey described what was going on as Grinnell Glacier lost 90 percent of its ice in this last century. Here is what the U.Geological Survey said:       Glacier recession is underway, and many glaciers have      already disappeared. The retreat of these small alpine      glaciers reflects changes in recent climate as glaciers      respond to altered temperature and precipitation. It has been      estimated that there were approximately 150 glaciers present      in 1850, and most glaciers were still present in 1910 when      the park was established. In 2010, we consider there to be      only 25 glaciers larger than 25 acres remaining in Glacier      National  There were 150 glaciers 100 years ago and 25 now. I wonder what they will call Glacier Park when all the glaciers are gone.  This was--is or was, depending on what you look at--Lillian Glacier up in the State of Washington in Olympic National On the top, we see the healthy glacier in 1905. In 2010, it is virtually all gone. There are just little bits of snow in exposed mountain.  Glacier loss is not just happening in our parks in the United States; it is happening all over the world. A man named Christian Aslund has been documenting this recently, and National Geographic has printed his work. What he did was go to the archives of the Norwegian Polar Institute, and he found pictures of glaciers in Svalbard, Norway, back from the 1920s--old black and white pictures. Then he went back to the exact same spot from which the old picture was taken, and he took a picture. Most of these are from 2003, so some time has gone by since he took the picture, and the situation has actually gotten worse.  You will see here that these two mountaintops that are sticking above this glacier are these two mountaintops right there, but, of course, the glacier is no longer there. You just see a bit of snow back there behind the shore.  Here you see this vast wall of ice and the glacier pushing back up into these mountains behind it.  Here the wall of ice is essentially gone. You see this whole mountain front that has opened up, and the glacier is now simply back up in the valley behind it.  You can see the glacier here from the 1920s filling up this valley and the streams coming off the base of it down there.  Here you see the glaciers completely gone. The rock is exposed, and there is a lake at the bottom, and you have to actually look over the top of the mountain to this faraway peak to even see any snow in the photograph.  It is the same story elsewhere in the The Greenland ice sheet is the world's second largest glacier landmass.  A study last year from the journal Science Advances found that we might have underestimated the current rate of mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet by about 20 billion tons per year.  As ``Science'' magazine recently highlighted, the accelerating surface melt of ice and snow off the Greenland ice sheet, since 2011, has doubled--Greenland's contribution to global sea level rise. It is a phenomenon that the Presiding Officer sees and hears about in his home State of Florida all the time. All told, the melting Greenland ice sheet holds the equivalent of more than 23 feet of sea level rise in its ice. That would be a lot in That would be a lot in That would change the map of the United States of  Why are these glaciers changing and shrinking? Obviously because the Earth is warming and ice melts. Over the last 150 years, industrial activities of modern civilization have caused the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. Their emissions have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and we have known since Abraham Lincoln was President that that traps heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.  What we are learning more and more is how much the warming of the planet accelerates at the The distribution of the warming is not even across the Things are warming much faster at the The Norwegian Polar Institute found that the rate of warming in the Arctic is about twice as high as the global average. For one thing, when snow and ice melt, they can expose darker surfaces underneath, whether it is water or Earth or rock, and a darker surface will absorb more solar energy than reflective snow and ice, and that warms the region even faster. So climate change has this compounding effect in the high latitudes.  Temperatures in the Arctic were the highest in recorded history for the period between December 2016 and February 2017. The World Meteorological Organization noted that ``at least three times so far this winter, the Arctic has witnessed the polar equivalent of a heat wave.'' What this means in layman's terms is that when the ice in the Arctic should have been freezing in the deep midwinter, it was actually melting. More warming and more melting mean more sea level rise.  Last year, researchers published in ``Nature'' an updated estimate of global sea level rise as this phenomenon accelerates. The prediction is not pretty. This new study doubles the previous estimate, putting global sea level rise over 6 feet by the end of this century.  This led to the January NOAA report that I discussed last week which updated global sea level rise region-specific assessments for our U.coastline. The report raised the previous upper range or extreme scenario for average global sea level rise in the year 2100 by 20 inches, to a total of 8.2 feet.  NOAA and its partners' findings were particularly harsh for the western Gulf of Mexico--the back side of Florida, if you will--and the northeast Atlantic coast; that is, Virginia through Maine, including my home State of Rhode Coastal managers, like Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council, or CRMC, are taking these new estimates very seriously and incorporating the ``high'' scenario into their planning, with the local high scenario now projected for Rhode Island by our CRMC at between 9 and 12 vertical feet of sea level rise. And, of course, when you go up 9 feet or 12 feet, you go back many hundreds of feet in many places. And all of this, whether it is happening in Florida or whether it is happening in Rhode Island or whether it is happening in other coastal States, it all starts with warming seas and melting glaciers.  When National Geographic caught up with Aslund a few weeks ago, he said something striking: ``What's happening in the Arctic is spreading around the whole globe.'' These pictures he had taken 14 years ago now--back in 2003--were just the beginning.  Kiribati, an island nation, has to face the real consequences of climate change and sea level rise. It is preparing to become a modern-day Atlantis--lost forever to the waves. Aslund describes a meeting with Kiribati's President: ``He knows climate change is just a fact . . . they're buying upland in Fiji so they can evacuate in the future.''  I will end with one final quote from Mr.When asked about the devastating effects of climate change that he had seen firsthand, he responded: ``It is the biggest challenge we face and we must act now before it is too late.''  Do one man's photographs stand any chance against the massive deception apparatus orchestrated by the fossil fuel industry, when they can call in a President of the United States for as ridiculous and preposterous an Executive order as he signed today? It is hard to know.  I hope this body will rise to its best traditions and meet the needs of its constituents, whether they are coastal constituents threatened by sea level rise or farm constituents threatened by[[Page S2054]]changes in weather or forest constituents who are seeing the pine beetle destroy western forests by the millions of acres. I hope we wake up before it becomes too late.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgS2052-2.txt,1823,CONGRATULATING HERMITAGE FFA FORESTRY TEAM,2017.0,28.0,January
1679,topic-id,321,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017. This is bipartisan legislation that will remove outdated barriers to capital formation and job creation imposed on the small businesses and startups that are driving America's innovation economy.  The SEC still hasn't updated a rule from 17 years ago that imposed an undue burden on entrepreneurs when they want to attract and retain talent through employee compensation plans. Startup ventures, by offering their employees a stake in the company through equity and other forms of deferred compensation, can reward hardworking employees by giving them direct ownership while their business continues to grow.  SEC rules governing these compensation plans haven't been updated since 1999, and they are imposing burdensome compliance and reporting requirements on the very entrepreneurs we should be encouraging to expand and create more good-paying, private sector jobs. We see the effects of this compliance tax placing a drain on our economy because it diverts the resources and human capital of entrepreneurs away from expansion and job creation.  In my district on Long Island and nationwide, entrepreneurs who have the next great invention or idea are struggling to gain access to capital. By regulating small startup ventures as if they are large, publicly traded companies, the SEC is imposing an unnecessary mound of paperwork on startups. A large corporation may have the lawyers and accountants to fill out the mountain of paperwork imposed on them by the SEC, but a small business can't compete, and that is why they need relief.  This Congress we have an opportunity through bipartisan reforms like this legislation to reverse that troubling trend by removing the regulatory burdens that harm the economy, consumers, and prospects for job growth.  In closing, Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from the Committee on Financial Services, Randy Hultgren, for his leadership on this issue.  I urge adoption of this commonsense bipartisan bill.
