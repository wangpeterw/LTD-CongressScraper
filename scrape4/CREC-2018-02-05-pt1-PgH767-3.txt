                             A BETTER DEAL

  (Mr. SWALWELL of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, in this Chamber last week, 
the President came and touted that the stock market was roaring and the 
unemployment rate was down. Today, he called us traitors for not 
applauding those numbers.
  A couple of days later, Speaker Ryan said a secretary at a public 
high school noticed that her pay had gone up $1.50 a week because of 
the GOP tax cuts.
  Mr. Speaker, the economy is not the stock market. It is not the 
unemployment rate. It is us. It is how we are doing. The stock market 
only matters if you are able to invest in it; and the unemployment rate 
only counts if you have a job you can count on, where your paycheck 
grows and you can plan for retirement and save for a better future.
  Mr. Speaker, the measurement of the economy is how we are doing. If 
you are only getting six quarters from a tax cut that gives millions to 
the richest among us, you are not doing very well. You deserve a much 
better deal.
