          HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS KILLED IN ORLANDO

  (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the lives of Master 
Sergeant Debra Clayton of the Orlando Police Department and Deputy Norm 
Lewis of the Orange County Sheriff's Office.
  As the former Orlando police chief, I had the honor of knowing both 
Sergeant Clayton and Deputy Lewis. Sergeant Clayton was violently 
murdered while responding to a call this morning. Deputy Lewis was 
killed while responding to a scene during the search for the suspect. 
As we recognize Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, we mourn the deaths 
of these two public servants.
  Sergeant Clayton was a fine officer, wife, and mother. She was 42 
years young, and had just celebrated her first anniversary with her 
husband.
  Deputy Lewis was deeply admired by all of his colleagues. He loved 
helping people, and it showed in his work. He was just 35.
  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask all Members to join me in observing a 
moment of silence to honor and remember these heroes during this 
difficult time.
