              ADVOCATING FOR PATIENT-CENTERED HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a practicing physician who 
believes that we must repeal the disaster that ObamaCare has brought us 
and return to a patient-centered system.
  My patients have dealt with skyrocketing premiums, unaffordable 
deductibles, and a formulary so restrictive it is an insult to call it 
a real treatment.
  Medicaid expansion is no better and gives only the illusion of sound 
coverage. These patients can't find doctors. They can't find 
specialists who will see them, which results in more hospital 
admissions, more unnecessary hospital referrals, more expensive trips 
to the emergency room, and higher costs to the program and to the 
taxpayers.
  There is nothing compassionate about cramming more people into a 
failed system just so politicians can score political points. All they 
have done is force a second-class insurance onto first-class people.
  All Americans deserve better than ObamaCare. We can provide a better 
healthcare delivery system for them where everyone has access to 
affordable care, and it starts with the passage of the American Health 
Care Act.
