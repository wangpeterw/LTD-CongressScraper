   SENATE RESOLUTION 260--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2017 AS ``SCHOOL BUS 
                             SAFETY MONTH''

  Mrs. FISCHER (for herself and Mr. Booker) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 260

       Whereas, every school day in the United States, 
     approximately 500,000 public and private school buses carry 
     more than 26,000,000 children to and from school;
       Whereas school buses comprise the largest mass 
     transportation fleet in the United States;
       Whereas 55 percent of all K-12 students ride a school bus, 
     totaling 260,000,000 miles for each of the 180 school days in 
     a year, or 46,800,000,000 miles driven annually;
       Whereas the Child Safety Network, celebrating 28 years of 
     national public service, supports the CSN Safe Bus campaign, 
     which is designed to provide the latest technology and free 
     safety and security resources to the school bus industry;
       Whereas the designation of School Bus Safety Month will 
     allow broadcast and digital media and social networking 
     industries to make commitments to disseminate public service 
     announcements that are produced in order to--
       (1) provide resources designed to safeguard children; and
       (2) recognize school bus drivers and professionals;

       Whereas key leaders who are deserving of recognition during 
     School Bus Safety Month and beyond have provided security 
     awareness training materials to more than 14,000 public and 
     private school districts, trained more than 80,000 school bus 
     operators, and provided more than 80,000 counterterrorism 
     guides to individuals who are key to providing both safety 
     and security for children in the United States; and
       Whereas School Bus Safety Month offers the Senate and the 
     people of the United States an opportunity to recognize and 
     thank all of the school bus drivers in the United States and 
     the professionals who are focused on school bus safety and 
     security: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate designates September 2017 as 
     ``School Bus Safety Month''.
