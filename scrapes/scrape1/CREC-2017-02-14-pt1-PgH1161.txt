                     PROVIDENCE COLLEGE CENTENNIAL

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, on February 14, 1917, the Diocese of 
Providence, the Dominican Friars of the Providence of St. Joseph, and 
the State of Rhode Island established Providence College.
  Like our great Nation, Providence College was founded on principles 
of tolerance and acceptance. Its charter states that no student shall 
be denied admission or honors due to religious opinion. One hundred 
years later, Americans would do well to follow this example.
  Led by Reverend Brian Shanley, the president of this outstanding 
academic institution, Providence College continues to enrich the lives 
of its students and the State of Rhode Island. It is a leader in 
research and academic excellence, and its scholars encourage young 
people to question the world around them and serve their communities.
  The Ocean State is fortunate to be home to such a venerable 
institution. As a lifelong Rhode Islander, I am so proud to celebrate 
its centennial and recognize its continued success today.
  Happy 100th anniversary, Providence College.
