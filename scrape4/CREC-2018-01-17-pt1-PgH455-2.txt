                            DIVERSITY VISAS

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, 8 years ago, a devastating earthquake in 
Haiti killed hundreds of thousands of people. Still today, our neighbor 
is suffering from the remnants of that disaster.
  But instead of extending American hospitality to Haitians, the 
President cursed them out, laying bare his racist intention to destroy 
the fundamental ideals of our immigration policy.
  Mr. Speaker, the American Dream must remain open to anyone from 
anywhere who wants to come here for any reason, especially if they are 
seeking refuge from disease, famine, or oppression, just as generations 
have come here in our history.
  The diversity visa program does just that. It helps people--
particularly the African diaspora--achieve the American Dream.
  We must protect the diversity visa program and not sacrifice 
ourselves to the false promise of America-first nationalism.
  Mr. Speaker, we are a nation of inclusion. We are a nation of open-
armed freedom for all people, not just Norwegians. The President may 
speak for the alt-right, but he does not speak for America.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Gianforte). Members are reminded to 
refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President.
