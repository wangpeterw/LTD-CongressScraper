            HONORING DR. DANIEL J. BRADLEY ON HIS RETIREMENT

  (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true champion for 
higher education, Dr. Daniel J. Bradley, the 11th president of Indiana 
State University.
  During his 9-year tenure at Indiana State, Dr. Bradley has led ISU to 
achieve the highest enrollment in school history, added new degree 
programs to meet the demands of the 21st century workforce, and 
completed more than $300 million in capital projects on the campus. 
Most importantly, Dr. Bradley has improved student success by 
increasing the student retention rate and increasing the student 
graduation rate.

[[Page H7928]]

  From his service to our country in the U.S. Army to his service to 
the students of Indiana State University, I urge my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Dr. Bradley on his retirement at the end of this 
year.
