                      BENEFITS OF RENEWABLE FUELS

  (Mr. YOUNG of Iowa asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about an issue of 
great importance to my district and the State of Iowa, renewable fuels.
  On January 31, a renewable fuels summit will allow Iowans to gather 
together and highlight the essential role Iowa plays when it comes to 
our energy needs.
  The renewable fuels industry boasts good-paying jobs for our economy, 
not only in my State of Iowa, but across the country. Renewable fuels 
increase choice for consumers and lower prices at the pump. A U.S. 
Department of Agriculture report also showed how the renewable fuels 
contribute to reducing emissions and our Nation's reliance on foreign 
fuels.
  This new Congress provides a lot of opportunity to both renewable 
fuels advocates and opponents. I look forward to engaging in meaningful 
discussions with my colleagues to inform them of the benefits of 
renewable fuels: energy independence, good-paying jobs, enhancing 
national security, environmental benefits, consumer choice with lower 
prices, and ensuring the strength and history of the family farm.
  I will also work with the Trump administration and anyone else to 
help protect the Renewable Fuels Standard and consumer access to 
conventional and advanced biofuels. The renewable fuels industry plays 
such a key role in so many of our Nation's needs.
