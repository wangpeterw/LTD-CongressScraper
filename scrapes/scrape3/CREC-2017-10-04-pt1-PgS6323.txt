     Collection Act of 1992 (44 U.S.C. 2107 note; Public Law 102-

       Whereas the Collection includes all Federal Government 
     records relating to the 1963 assassination of President John 
     F. Kennedy, including records of Presidential commissions, 
     congressional committees and investigations, executive branch 
     agencies, and the judiciary, in addition to a variety of 
     donated historical materials;
       Whereas NARA has compiled a JFK Master System database of 
     319,106 documents comprising 5,000,000 pages of 
     assassination-related records, photographs, motion pictures 
     and recordings, and artifacts; and

     Information Act staff, staff from the Office of Innovation, 
     and Public Affairs staff, have worked diligently to fully

     Kennedy: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate commends the National Archives

     Records Collection Act of 1992 and release all records
