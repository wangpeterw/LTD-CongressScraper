9225,topic-id,651,"Mr.President, over the past weeks, we have seen Democrats continue to use one delaying tactic after another on the floor of the They have tried to slow down the confirmation of many of the administration's most important nominees. We have seen it time and again. We have seen it in agencies all across the government, including right now the Environmental Protection Agency, the Democrats are just wasting time, and they are doing it intentionally. They are not protecting our environment, not one bit. They are not safeguarding the health of the American people, not at all.  Government agencies like the EPA and one after another need their leadership in place and they need it in place now. What they don't need, what the American people don't need, is more political theater from the Senate  We have heard a lot about Scott Pruitt's nomination to be Administrator of the Much of what we heard from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle has simply not been true.  I want to set the record straight. As head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt will protect the environment. During his 6 years as attorney general for the State of Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt has stood up to polluters, he has worked across State lines, and he has worked across party lines. He has done it to lower phosphorous levels in the Illinois He actually negotiated a water rights settlement with Oklahoma tribes. Why? Well, to preserve scenic lakes and rivers. He used commonsense policies. He used them to protect the environment in Oklahoma, and he will follow commonsense policies at the Environmental Protection  The delays we have seen by Democrats have never actually been about Mr.Pruitt or his record or the answers he has given to questions about his qualifications. He has answered over 1,200 questions. He has answered four rounds of questions in committee, went for 6\1/2\ hours. Members on the other side said these were very fair hearings. These delays are all about obstruction. They are all about denying President Trump his That is what this is all about. It is about pretending that their candidate Hillary Clinton did not lose the election in That is what this is all about.  We have seen them use the same tactics on one Cabinet nominee after another. As the Cabinet nominees were named, what we saw was a list of eight nominees come out who Senator Schumer had as his hit list of nominees he was going to oppose, slow down, obstruct, boycott. Democrats delayed. They delayed again. They delayed again. That is what we saw in one after another.  When Scott Pruitt is confirmed today, he will take office later than any incoming EPA Administrator for any new administration going back to the 1980s.  Our friends on the other side of the aisle need to recognize that the terrible precedent they are setting today with all of these relentless and needless delays will continue into the future. It is a precedent, just like the precedent that Harry Reid set when he changed[[Page S1390]]the rules of the Senate by breaking the rules. The Democrats need to see how their actions will continue to play forward, will affect the confirmation process for all future administrations, including Democratic administrations.  The American people want someone in place to run these important What we see from the Democrats is political theater on the floor of the  President Trump deserves to have his team in place. President Trump deserves to have his Cabinet in place. The Cabinet nominees deserve an up-or-down vote from the Senate on the floor of the That is what we are going to do today with Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who is qualified and who has been nominated to be the Administrator of the  Scott Pruitt will protect our environment, and he will protect the health of all He is the right person for the job.

9244,topic-id,298,"Mr.President, for the past 8 years, the Environmental Protection Agency, through its regulatory rampage, has hurt a lot of people in my home State of Wyoming and all across the country. The EPA's overreaching regulations have stunted job growth, hurt our economy, and failed to help the Agency meet its mission. The mission is to protect the environment and the health of all The EPA needs to be reformed and modernized.  Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt is the right person for the job. Mr.Pruitt is committed to protecting the environment, ensuring clean air, water, and land while also supporting a strong and healthy economy.

9084,topic-id,196,"Mr.Speaker, over 50 years ago, President John Kennedy signed into law the Equal Pay Act, landmark legislation which requires that men and women in the same workplace be given equal pay for equal work.  Unfortunately, equal pay for equal work has not become a reality. In fact, women are paid between 79 and 80 cents for every dollar that men are paid for doing the exact same job. In fact, it takes women until tomorrow, April 4, to earn what men were paid in the previous year.  For women of color, the gap is even wider. In 2015, African-American women made 65 cents for every dollar earned by their White male counterparts. For Hispanic women, it is even worse. They earn 58 cents for every dollar earned by their White male counterparts.  Women pay a huge price because of the wage gap. Today, families rely increasingly on women's wages to make ends meet; and with less take-home pay, women have less money to cover the everyday needs of their family.  Mr.Speaker, it is time for Congress to right the wrong.

9177,topic-id,1619,"Madam President, I speak in opposition to Scott Pruitt, and I thank Senator Carper for the good work he has done in leading the opposition to someone who is a climate change denier and will not release information that the public should see.  I want to say a few comments about the majority leader's comments. I am incredulous that he thinks this has been unfair to the Trump administration and Republicans; that we have not moved faster. We know a bunch of things. We know President Trump didn't begin his vetting process, as most Presidential candidates do, in  We then know right after the election he fired his person in charge of vetting and of the transition. We know then he appointed people without vetting them because he wanted to speed it up, and we also know that a number of people who President Trump nominated were billionaires and Wall Street bankers, and they had very complicated financial backgrounds and holdings, and because the Trump administration didn't do it, the Senate had to do it, and the media had to do it--to look at the backgrounds of some of these nominees.  Then, on top of that, we saw a level of corruption we had never seen in Presidential nominations. We saw a Secretary of Health and Human Services--passed by being voted for by every Republican--who bought and sold healthcare stocks while a Member of Congress, voting on and sponsoring healthcare amendments and bills.  We saw other nominees. We saw Secretary Mnuchin, and Senator Carper played a role in this, now-Secretary Mnuchin, who forgot to disclose a $100 million investment he had and then lied to the Senate committee, as pointed out by the Columbus Dispatch--the most conservative paper in my State--about robo-signing, sending hundreds of people in my State into foreclosure.  The ethics of these nominees are such, and then you have Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the EPA, and he will not disclose 2,600 emails that we know how--as Senator Carper has done such a good job on--we know how a number of these emails point to--I am not a lawyer--if not the word ``collusion,'' certainly doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry that he might occasionally want to regulate instead of the That is the story.  I want an Administrator of the EPA who wants to protect the country's great natural resources, not someone hell-bent on undermining the Agency he will lead. The environmental challenges we face in my State are too great to put the EPA in the hands of someone with a track record of putting polluters before public health, of choosing companies that pollute over communities that are victimized by that pollution, and too often he is doing the work of campaign donors instead of the public.  I know what the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts have meant to my I know what Lake Erie looks like. When I was a kid, I lived about an hour and a half away. Lake Erie was an environmental disaster. The counties of Cuyahoga, Erie, and Lorain couldn't clean it up. The State of Ohio didn't have the resources to clean it up.  It was only that terrible fire in Cleveland where bridge trestles on the Cuyahoga River caught on fire that got the Nixon administration to move and create the EPA, and then we cleaned up Lake That was one of the great accomplishments in our country's history--environmental and otherwise, one of the great accomplishments.  It was a Republican administration with the Democratic Congress, when good environmental policy was bipartisan, when Republicans as well as Democrats believed in being stewards of the Earth in following a number of the teachings of the New Testament about being stewards of the  It was a sustained effort by citizens and by their elected officials in both parties to protect our public health. The EPA affects the water that comes into our children's drinking fountains. It affects our small businesses that rely on tourists at our lakes and beaches. It affects farmers who feed the According to Aparna Bole--a pediatric specialist at Cleveland's University Hospital in Cleveland--asthma rates in my part of Ohio are above the national average because of the region's poor air quality.  Climate change is not some distant problem. We tend to think about wildfires in the West or devastation faced by coastal communities, like those affected by Hurricane The Midwest is affected too.  In August, 2014, a harmful algae bloom left 500,000 Ohioans in Greater Toledo, in Northwest Ohio, without safe drinking water for nearly 3 days. This is Lake This is more or less the natural color of Lake This is the algal bloom. It is a stunning, beautiful picture if you don't know what it is, but when you see a boat cutting through these algal blooms and seeing what this meant, as the algae chokes Lake Erie--Lake Erie right here is about 30 feet deep. Contrast that with Lake Superior, 600 feet, and you will see why Lake Erie is more vulnerable.  Lake Erie is 2 percent of the water in all the Great Lake Erie has 50 percent of the fish of all the Great The fish like shallower and warmer water, but they don't like these kinds of algal blooms and what they do to this community. Because it is the shallowest of the Great Lakes, and this is the shallowest part of this great lake, it is uniquely vulnerable to these harmful algal blooms.  We know these blooms are caused by excess nutrients in our water--untreated sewage, urban runoff, and runoff from farm fields. This Maumee River Basin going into the lake from the south, going into the lake just north of Toledo, drains the largest 2 million acres, the largest basin of any tributary going into any of the Great  On Wednesday, I met with David Spangler, a charter boat captain on Lake We talked about how the Great Lakes region has seen a 37-percent increase in heavy rain events. We have seen that hotter summers make the blooms worse. We talked about protecting the lake as one of the great environmental challenges, not just for Ohio or even the industrial Midwest but protecting Lake Erie and the Great Lakes, the greatest source of freshwater in the world, by most measurements--how important that is.  Dave has been fishing on this lake and its tributaries for decades. He bragged about the improvements we[[Page S1368]]have seen over the year--how water quality has improved, how walleye and yellow perch populations have rebounded, how he leads fishing expeditions on the Great Lakes, on Lake You know what, look at what these algal blooms have done. You can guess what they have done. Nobody will go fishing in these kinds of waters.  If the algal bloom is there too long, lots of fish die in addition to that. We need an EPA Administrator who understands that the contamination hurts everything from our children's health to our small businesses. He told me he doesn't think Scott Pruitt is the right person for this job. He believes that with Scott Pruitt at the helm of the EPA, we would likely lose the gains we made in the lake.  Of particular concern to both Mr.Spangler and me is that Mr.Pruitt said mercury does not cause a threat to human health. Really? Mercury doesn't cause a threat to human health? If Mr.Pruitt doesn't believe that, I would like him to explain to me why the Ohio EPA, the Ohio Department of Health--both with Republican administrators--have a statewide mercury advisory stating that women of childbearing age and children under 15 are advised to eat no more than one meal per week of fish from any Ohio water body. Think about that. You shouldn't eat more than one meal a week of fish taken out of any of the Ohio aqua system--limit the amount of fish eaten from our State's largest body. That means even though we worked for decades to reduce mercury emissions, apparently Mr.Pruitt doesn't think mercury exposure is a threat to public health.  Mr.Pruitt has solicited thousands of dollars of campaign contributions for himself, the Republican Attorneys General Association, all the Republican attorneys general. There are three dozen or so of them. They work together to raise lots of money to keep themselves in office so they can continue to do some of the work they do. Some of the work they do is stand in the way of good environmental policy.  He has refused, for years, as Senators Merkley and Carper have pointed out consistently, to disclose some 2,600 documents, showing correspondence between his office and the very companies he is supposed to ensure follow the law.  We know who some of those companies are. What is he hiding? Why won't he tell the Senate what is in those documents? Why does the Senate Republican leader not want us to see those documents? Because he is saying, no, we have to vote on this now. It just happens to be we will be looking at documents over the next few days, but apparently it is not going to be able to affect this vote.  It could be because in the past he submitted letters to the EPA that were written by the companies he is supposed to regulate. Think about that. An oil company writes a letter and then that letter remarkably ends up pretty much word for word to be sent to the  Allowing him to become EPA Administrator is like allowing an arsonist to become the fire chief--the goal of both is to burn things down.

9144,topic-id,6775,"Mr.President, I come to the floor this morning to join my colleagues to speak on the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the Like my colleagues who have been out here tonight, the great Senator from Illinois, Senator Duckworth, and my colleague from Hawaii who preceded her, we are here to talk about the importance of our environment and what a critical asset it is to each of our regions of the United  Certainly, you can say for the State of Washington that the environment is our economy--the beautiful aspects of our clean water, the resources of our beautiful mountains and wonderful streams, Puget Sound itself, our mountains that so many of my colleagues ask me about. These are all assets that make Washington State a great place to live, work, and recreate in.  Our companies would tell you that one of the great things they have in recruiting people to the State of Washington is that it is a competitive advantage to say their business is located in People understand what that means to the quality of life and to the opportunities for those workers. It is with that in mind that I rise in strong opposition to this nomination.  I had a chance yesterday to discuss Mr.Pruitt and to discuss some of the concerns that I have with his role as Administrator, and in Oklahoma in the attorney general slot, and also his nomination process. Many of my colleagues this morning have brought up his record, what that record represents, and their concerns about his answers to very important questions.  This is about stewardship. Stewardship is about how we are going to manage our resources and apply the laws of clean air and clean water to protect not just this generation of Americans, but future generations of  Mr.Pruitt's poor environmental record--in my opinion, he is choosing to side with those companies that have been polluters of clean water and failed to protect in an aggressive way the important public health issues that were before people in his  Obviously, there is a big discussion tonight. My colleagues have been out here discussing whether there is transparency in Oklahoma regarding his ability to discuss with them his failures or his successes, if you will, in a public process. That is why people have been demanding these emails. These important documents are things that, not only the people of Oklahoma, but people in the U.Senate have a right to have answers to as we consider his nomination.  I join my colleague from Hawaii in saying, What is the rush? What is the rush to push forward somebody as an administrator for something that is about the stewardship of our air and water--something that is going to be important, not just to our generation but future generations? We want an EPA Administrator who is going to protect that. That is what we want to know: Are you going to be an aggressive steward for future generations?  I had an opportunity a couple of years ago to hear one of the great authors who has written all these books about economics. He was talking about the great implosion of the economy in 2008, 2009. His point was that was going to cost future generations--not just this generation, but maybe three generations of Americans were going to be affected by that big great recession of our economy. It is the same issue tonight.  Our future environment is going to be impacted, not just for today, but for future generations by what the next EPA Administrator does. It is critical that we recognize the important need for clean air and clean water now and take steps to be aggressive about it.  This is something that is important to our State because it is affecting us economically. It is affecting us with water and ocean acidification, challenging our seafood industry and our food chain, and challenging us with wildfires. We want to make sure that we have an EPA Administrator who is going to do their job.  In my opinion, Mr.Pruitt has ignored big polluters and discharge in drinking water in In my opinion, he has not been strong enough with regards to the big oil and big mining companies who have attempted to undermine what is EPA law. As attorney general, he tried to undermine the laws that are already on the Federal books. It leaves my colleagues and I questioning, How could he ever stand up for those laws if he has spent so much time trying to undermine them?  He has helped organize strategies and discussions about how to aggressively stop the EPA from doing its job. Some of these discussions used the example of the Pebble The Pebble Mine is a mine that companies are proposing in Alaska at the headwaters of the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, one of the most important sockeye salmon runs in the world. So as EPA Administrator, when he is supposed to be protecting clean water, is he going to side with those mining companies? He spent a whole strategy session with them trying to figure out how to overrun Is he going to be the kind of person who is going to help us stand up for clean water so we can have salmon on the west coast? Or is he going to join with those who think that you can degrade the environment and still preserve these incredible resources?  I know that people think Mr.Pruitt and his statements about climate change are important. I agree because part of that stewardship on clean air is basically implementing and carrying forward strategies to make sure that polluters reduce pollution in our air and that we come up with a plan to diversify energy sources to reduce that pollution. I should say his job is not that, but it is clearly to call out what the Supreme Court has said is implementation of the Clean Air  My colleagues, I think, are failing to recognize that Mr.Pruitt's hesitancy on this issue is really going to cause problems or challenges for us here in the It is going to cause challenges for us to move ahead when we are seeing so much impact.  I know my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, and I have asked the GAO for an analysis of what climate change is costing us. What is the impact of climate change costing us? Why did we ask for that letter over a year ago? Because we are seeing devastating impacts in the shellfish industry, in the timber industry, in various aspects of our economy as it relates to that.[[Page S1329]]  In the Tulsa World Mr.Pruitt said: ``Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.''  That is what he said in the newspaper in  I know several of my colleagues and I have further discussed exactly this issue, but the United States has made great strides to reduce carbon dioxide, and we need to have someone who is going to be aggressive about doing more work on this. The consequences of increased carbon dioxide have been everything from extreme weather patterns to impacts on water quality, which causes impacts to our salmon, to drought conditions, which a lot of legislation--various committees have been discussing exactly what to do about the drought situation in Washington, Oregon and I am sure it is going to continue into many other It is impacting even the chemistry of Puget Sound--something I will get into in a minute with ocean acidification.  To have somebody who doesn't get how aggressive we have to be on addressing these issues is very problematic. It is an economic issue.  I would like to say, as I mentioned earlier, it is about good stewardship because it is about future generations and whether someone did their job in leaving this place to the next generation, but it is also about economic issues.  Mr.Pruitt failed to be accountable as attorney general in releasing emails, and that is so much of the discussion today about his nomination. During his confirmation hearing, he repeatedly failed to answer questions. And he told Senators: Submit an open records request to the attorney general's office--his own office. It is as if Mr.Pruitt is taunting our colleagues, not answering the questions about his policy, hoping that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and this side of the aisle will support him, even though he will not give us answers on his policies. And then he says: Well, if you want to know, you can submit an open records request. We have; people have. We want the answers, and a court today has said: Let's give people those answers.  We don't have those answers today, yet my colleagues want to rush to have his nomination pushed through when something as important as the environment is at stake.  On average, Oklahoma State government agencies complied with their open records request within 68 days. That was the average, yet Mr.Pruitt, as attorney general, has taken over 2 years. A few weeks ago when a lawsuit was filed against Mr.Pruitt on this very issue, the suit requested that he respond to 9 open records requests, asking for as many as 3,000 emails.  As I just said, yesterday, a judge said that he has to turn over those records, those documents, and he has to do so by It is not a long time to wait. It is not a long time to discuss the concerns that our colleagues have with this position. In fact, I would be happy to come back on Wednesday and make sure we have consideration then, giving people time until But people are pushing us to vote for this nomination tomorrow or, I should say today.  What do my colleagues not want to see in the Pruitt emails? What is it that they don't want to know? Attorney General Pruitt has been part of close to 30 anti-environmental legal actions. Is that what they don't want to see?  I know one of my colleagues has said he is going to make polluters pay. He is going to assure that these issues are implemented.  Scott Pruitt has sued the EPA 14 times. He fought the cross-state air pollution rule. He fought the regional haze rule. He fought the clean air standards for oil and gas production sites. He fought the clean water rule. He fought the mercury rule twice, and he fought the Clean Power Plan four times.  So are my colleagues interested in giving this job to someone who has fought the EPA and tried to stop them from making sure that polluters pay? This is what the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency is, to make sure that we have good stewardship.  In one case, Attorney General Pruitt failed to pursue a Phillips 66 refinery in an Oklahoma City, which the EPA found was one of the worst polluting refineries in the entire country. Phillips 66, in this case, impacted groundwater. That was the pollution in this case. Yet Scott Pruitt failed to enforce the environmental laws there.  As attorney general, Scott Pruitt has been absent in other cases. There was a groundwater case and pollution by Where was the attorney general in that case?  In another case, in Bethany, the city's water wells were impacted by a toxic plume of chemicals that impacted access to safe drinking water.  This case is still going on. But the attorney general failed to step in and protect those citizens.  So this is what we want to understand, given what Attorney General Pruitt said in his testimony: Ask for requests. Get the emails. See the positions.  That is what we have done. As we can see from his record, he knew very well it took a long time, that he had every tool to make this a very hard process for people to get the answers. Yet we are now within days of having those answers. My colleagues want to go ahead and vote.  During his confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt was asked to identify lawsuits he filed against private companies in Oklahoma for violation of pollution laws. Despite these examples I just mentioned, Mr.Pruitt could think of only one specific instance in which he filed a settlement after his predecessor completed an investigation into how a dozen or so poultry producers illegally disposed of animal waste. So let's take a closer look at that case.  The poultry companies in the northeast corner of Oklahoma were not properly disposing of 300,000 tons of animal waste per year. Attorney General Pruitt's predecessor had sued the companies for damages caused by pollution and forced the companies to change disposal practices. But Mr.Pruitt in this case, rather than advocating for the judge to make a ruling, negotiated an agreement with the company to do a study on the appropriate levels of phosphorus in the Illinois  So while some might say ``Well, isn't that a good step?'' he let the agreement expire that was already in place to reduce that waste and did not seek a formal extension. He shut down the environmental unit that helped start the lawsuit against those companies. This unit was in charge of making sure that agricultural waste cleanup and millions of dollars to clean up those toxic sites were in place. Yet he let that expire.  So I have grave concerns about whether he is going to be aggressive about these issues all across the United Is he going to work to make sure these laws that are on the books already continue to be enforced? Is he going to fight to make sure that clean air and clean water--the rights of the citizens here in our country--are preserved and preserved for future generations?  I noticed that in Oklahoma there was question 777, a ballot measure. On that ballot measure was Oklahoma's right-to-farm statute that was proposed by the Oklahoma If the voters in Oklahoma approved it, it would have created an amendment to the Oklahoma Constitution prohibiting the legislature from enacting laws restricting agricultural production unless laws were needed to advance a ``compelling State interest.''  I think this is a very interesting demonstration of how people are trying to use a process, just like the House colleagues are sending over regulatory reform bills. They are going to hide behind regulatory reform when in reality they are trying to curtail clean water and clean air rules.  Well, the people of Oklahoma were a little smarter than that. Right-to-farm laws are not uncommon, and there are currently variations in all 50 But many such statutes, including Oklahoma's current law, protect farmers and ranchers from nuisance claims as long as they operate in acceptable practices.  This question that was put on the ballot to Oklahomans went further than the typical right-to-farm law; it would have amended their State constitution. The State constitution holds a higher authority than these State statutes. So if that initiative was enacted, it would have guaranteed that[[Page S1330]]agriculture can engage in farming practices without interference from the legislature, and it would even have prohibited the public from suits. Can you imagine that? I know that that is what some of the proponents of these issues want; they want to do whatever they want on the land whether it impacts the neighbors or impacts clean air or clean water. They just want to keep moving it forward.  So Mr.Pruitt was in support of question 777. He talked about the ``intrusive rules from government regulators'' that often ``fail to achieve the stated health, safety and environmental goals.'' Well, we know we want to have a balance. We can have jobs, we can have agriculture, and we can have environmental stewardship. I think we, in Washington, work very hard to achieve that.  Drought issues like we are experiencing in the Yakima Basin got everybody to the table--farmers, Native Americans, fishermen, everybody. Instead of trying to pass initiatives like this--which, by the way, failed in Oklahoma--people said: We need to work together in these challenging times of a changing climate and work on preserving what is most important to all of us. They have done a good job in doing that.  So what we are looking for is an Administrator who is going to help in that process, who is going to continue to make sure we live up to these laws that are on the books and help in the challenging times of drought and environmental impact.  Of Attorney General Pruitt's 14 cases against EPA, 13 of those suits were joined by the fossil fuel industry. The attorney general has been known to send letters to Federal agencies that basically were identical to the fossil fuel industry letters; that is, as attorney general, he wasn't making his case, he was just making the case for the fossil fuel industry.  The CEO of Continental Resources, a top oil producer in the United States--their organizations basically were trying to push Mr.Pruitt during his time as attorney general, instead of standing up for clean air and clean water. And we want to know what he is going to do in this new job--work with Members here in the Senate on continuing to implement the law.  One of the best examples of what I would expect him to do is to continue the good work of the Federal Government in protecting salmon. Of particular importance, as I mentioned earlier, is the issue of Pebble During his time as attorney general, Scott Pruitt, as I said, planned the Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil That is a pretty interesting task to take if you are the attorney general of a State, the Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil That summit brought together energy executives with attorneys general to strategize against what they thought was so-called EPA overreach and how to defeat it.  One of the key examples they brought up was the Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to protect Bristol Bay, AK, from a proposed mine that is called Pebble Pebble Mine is a proposed large hard rock mine, as I mentioned earlier, in the headwaters of Bristol Each year nearly 40 million sockeye salmon return to Bristol In total, Bristol Bay supports 29 species of fish, including all 5 North American salmon species. That is why Bristol Bay is called one of the greatest fisheries on Bristol Bay supports a $1.5 billion sockeye salmon fishery, which provides 14,000 jobs throughout the Pacific  Even my colleague, the late Ted Stevens, was opposed to the Pebble I think he knew the great resource and the importance of Bristol  This fishery, and the people in that fishery, and the tribes of Bristol Bay, petitioned the EPA to evaluate the impact of the proposed Pebble Mine and what it could do to salmon.  In 2014, after years of research, EPA finalized a science-based assessment of the Pebble Mine called the Bristol Bay Watershed This assessment found that Pebble Mine posed a direct threat to Bristol Bay salmon.  I am not sure this is a picture of Bristol Bay salmon, but this is definitely an iconic symbol of what we are talking about here tonight, that thousands of jobs in our State rely on salmon, and the subsistence culture of many Native Americans also rely on Bristol Bay salmon. That is why so many people weighed in at meetings with EPA and agencies in various parts of the Northwest to talk about this issue, because so many jobs would be impacted. That mine would destroy up to 94 miles of salmon spawning streams, devastate up to 5,350 acres of wetlands, and create 10 billion tons of toxic mine waste.  So you can imagine my concern when the attorney general out of Oklahoma decided he was going to take a very lenient attitude on animal waste and hold the summit trying to basically figure out ways to disrupt EPA's questioning and assertions about Bristol How far he is going to go as EPA Administrator to basically have a negative impact on our salmon economy?  He could have said: It was just a session, and I support EPA's actions. But that is not the message we are receiving. The toxic mine waste that would exist at Bristol Bay would contaminate massive amounts of areas behind the second largest dam in the world, and that mine waste would be there in perpetuity in Bristol  So the science was very clear. The Pebble Mine was in the wrong place, and it was the wrong idea. Large mining companies have come to that same conclusion. Just a few weeks ago, an analyst issued a report that said Pebble Mine is ``not commercially viable.'' That is because of the tremendous costs that are associated with it and the risks associated with it.  After the EPA assessment found that salmon were at risk from the Pebble Mine, I definitely want to make sure that Bristol Bay salmon are protected forever. The EPA had the authority to basically use a section of the Clean Water Act to make sure those Bristol Bay salmon were protected. That is what I expect. That is what I expect after public hearings, an open process, using the authority. Why would it be a good idea to let a mine be located at the headwaters of one of the most important salmon runs in the world? Why would we do that? Yet Mr.Pruitt took time to join an effort to say: How can we overturn EPA's efforts here?  I need an EPA Administrator who is going to stand up for our environment in the Pacific Northwest and protect us on clean air and clean water. It is critical that those individuals who were proposing this mine continue to be thwarted.  While the EPA has been close to making sure there are permanent protections for Bristol Bay, I am very concerned that this EPA Administrator could start this process all over again. That is something we can't afford. We cannot have an EPA Administrator who is on the wrong side of the Pebble mine issue. They need to protect Northwest salmon.  I would also like to talk about another threat to our environment, to our fishing economy that is certainly happening today and why we need an EPA Administrator not to be spending their time joining forces with polluters, figuring out ways to avoid law, but figuring out ways to implement the Clean Air Act that the Supreme Court says we must follow through on.  Last year, Attorney General Pruitt stated that there is a disagreement about whether human activity has had an impact on climate. When he was pressed on this issue during his hearing, he continued to question scientific facts. He said he believed climate change is irrelevant to his role as EPA Well, I disagree. Climate change is not a future hypothetical issue. We are seeing it today, and we are seeing it in our  Our fishermen want to continue the great legacy that we have in our fishing traditions, and we are going to get to why this picture is affected by what I am going to talk about next, but we want to continue to have thriving Northwest fisheries. We want to continue to have a healthy environment and food chain that is going to allow us to have a robust fishery in the  I think our fisheries can be cited as some of the best managed fisheries in the entire world. That is how good we are at it. That is how scientific we are at it. That is how collaborative we are at it. That is how much hard work has been put into stewardship and managing the resources and making sure the jobs still exists. I would match that with any other part of the United States or this planet. The Northwest[[Page S1331]]fisheries are managed well, but they are being challenged. They are being challenged by the fact that our climate is changing and that the oceans absorb 25 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions, which resulted basically in a changing of the chemistry in our waterways. That is right; the oceans absorb 25 percent of carbon emissions. So basically they become this sink for the emissions.  We have scientists who are out on the Olympic Peninsula studying this very issue, not for us in the Northwest; they are studying it for the entire United It is part of our National Laboratory system. They are looking at this very important issue and the challenges we face from it.  The fact that the oceans have been the sinks for that carbon has made the rate of ocean acidification 10 times faster than anything we have seen on Earth in the last 50 million years. In Puget Sound, that means that ocean acidification has resulted in massive die-offs of young oysters. Juvenile shellfish cannot survive in these corrosive waters, and their shells actually dissolve.  So this economy for us is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the shellfish industry. A few years ago, we were successful in getting some very minor--I think it was in the definitely thousands of dollars--to help that industry figure out what was happening because the shells weren't forming. We were able to see that ocean acidification was having such a corrosive impact, we helped the industry figure out when a better time for seeding was and to get to a point where those extreme conditions weren't having their most devastating impact.  This die-off in 2005 caused a major plummeting of the shellfish industry. An industry that employs over 3,000 people in the State of I have met shellfish growers who are fourth-generation shellfish growers in our So this way of life around Puget Sound is important to us. You can go to probably a dozen restaurants here. I am sure you could have gone across the street to Johnny's Half Shell and ordered a product from Washington It would be one of the premier products on the menu.  We have to fight to keep this industry. We have to make smart decisions about our environment. We have to make good stewardship decisions or those four generations of shellfish growers are not going to be here anymore.  The pollution that is coming from carbon into our water is a big deal. How big a deal is it? Well, it is a big enough deal to put on the front page of the Seattle Times above the fold--and probably not just once, probably several times. Why? Because we live and have a huge population around the shores of something called Puget  Almost everyone, everyone there understands the importance of clean water and a healthy environment to protect this maritime economy and to make the right decisions moving forward.  We don't want to see what happened in 2005 and in 2006. We don't want to see that. We want to see more of our shellfish actually able to survive the seeding process, and we want to continue to be smart about this. This is where the science question comes in.  If we have an EPA Administrator who doesn't believe this impact is happening, if he is going to thwart the efforts to do the research and the science, if he is going to spend more time trying to thwart these laws than implement strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change, we are not going to be successful economically. We need technology like ocean acidification sensors.  Why were we successful at turning that situation around with the shellfish industry and making sure? It is because we were able to locate buoys in the water to give us data and information about these warming temperatures, what problems it was causing, and come up with a strategy to lessen the impact of acidification. They measured our waters and how to modify growing practices. That is basically what they did. If you are denying that climate change is even happening or that it is having this impact and you are not planning for it, you are not going to go out and help our growers strategize for the future.  They use that real-time information to increase the production from the 20 percent of historical levels that it was to 70 percent, but without that data in collaboration with places like NOAA, our shellfish industry would have continued to just decline.  I need an EPA Administrator who is going to support monitoring; that is going to understand this impact and do something about it.  Now why did I have the other picture of the salmon fisherman? Because ocean acidification, as I mentioned, basically dissolves the shells of important prey species we call pteropods, and they are the base of the food chain. So not only am I just talking about the thousands of jobs and millions of dollars associated with the shellfish industry, if you have so much carbon sinking into our waters that you are destroying this part of the food chain, it impacts the rest of the food chain. It impacts all the way up the species, including salmon, herring, mackerel, and other species. So this is why we have to have an EPA Administrator who is going to follow science and be aggressive at protecting these issues.  Last month, a new study published by scientists at the University of Washington and NOAA found that even Dungeness crabs are at risk because of these pteropods. I think that is what it says right there: ``Scientists fear ocean acidification will drive the collapse of Alaska's iconic crab fishery.'' Thank you, thank you, Seattle  That is what this is about, are we going to leave it up to the newspapers of America to describe the scientific impact of what is happening so we can force people whose job it is to be the stewards here to do their jobs?  They should be the leaders, the people we put in this position. They should be the ones who lead our Nation in protecting our most valuable natural resources and making sure these pristine areas that we need for our economy, for our quality of life, for our recreation are there, and we need an EPA Administrator who is going to be aggressive about that.  So that is a little preview of this issue and what it looks like in the State of Washington, but on this climate issue, as I mentioned, my colleague from Maine and I actually joined forces probably 6 or 7 years ago on this issue when the Senator from Maine was aggressive about pushing legislation, asking Federal agencies to make sure they had a response to climate change. I think the Senator from Maine probably saw then how important this issue was, and it was legislation we actually passed out of the Commerce I don't think it was actually implemented into law, but it was a very good directive at saying to agencies: This is going to impact us, and what is your mitigation plan.  We, in the Commerce Committee, held a hearing about this because what we were finding was that a huge part of the U.economy--it was definitely a high number, maybe as much as 50 percent--was driven by States with coastal economies. A report was issued about how all of these changes impacted sea level rising, impact in ocean acidification, all of these things were going to impact these coastal economies and thereby have a dramatic effect on the U.economy.  For example, just because it might not be front and center for somebody from Oklahoma, it was going to become very front and center for the U.economy if we didn't have a mitigation plan and did something about it, and this report was a heralding call for the United States to wake up to this issue.  I will never forget that hearing because the actress Sigourney Weaver was there to testify. She was there to testify because she really wanted to make the point about how important these issues were, as it related to our waters and the impact.  You would think a brilliant actress like Sigourney Weaver would steal the show. You would think her testimony before the Commerce Committee would be it. That would be the news of the day, and that is what would be written about, but it was actually a fisherman from a Southern coastal State who stole the show because he spoke about how his job was threatened, how fisheries were threatened, how, if we don't protect our oceans and our air, we are going to have devastating effects on our fisheries. This gentleman, whose family and livelihood was dependent[[Page S1332]]upon it, spoke in such an unbelievably meaningful way, he upstaged her.  So this isn't something we are coming at just because President Trump has nominated Scott Pruitt; this is something we are going to fight for every single day because it is important that our Nation have a response to it.  My colleague from Maine was on it a long time ago. She said: Let's make sure that every agency is going to have a plan for what we are going to do about mitigation and impact as a result of climate.  As I mentioned just recently, in the last year or so, she and I joined and sent a letter to GAO asking them to actually give us an estimate across the whole Federal What is going to be the cost and impact of these changes to climate on our economy and the Federal Government? This is a very important answer to have from the GAO because my guess is that they are going to show that it costs a lot of money. It is not surprising to me because I have seen it in my own State, with catastrophic wildfires that have burned up hundreds of thousands of acres of land at an unbelievable cost to the Federal  We are trying to come up with a better strategy for combatting these wildfires. We can't get our House colleagues to engage in a serious Energy bill process. Hopefully someday we will get them to understand that the Senate in a bipartisan fashion did its homework and had approval.  But these issues are not going away. Next summer there will be another part of the United States that will be in the hot spot again, and instead of making sure we are addressing that, some of our colleagues just want to ignore it, just like they are ignoring Mr.Pruitt's emails and his answers to these important questions.  That is the Let's look at other parts of the country on ocean acidification. Here is an example of a coral reef in the State of In 2016, the University of Miami published a study which found that Biscayne Bay coral reefs are already suffering the impacts of ocean acidification. I would expect that coral reefs in Florida are probably as important to their economy as salmon is to our economy. I say that because I know people go to visit those coral reefs. Actually, their reefs, according to economic analysis, are worth over $7.6 billion. That is what coral reefs are worth, apparently, due to their importance in recreational and commercial fisheries and tourism.  Everybody wants to stand up for the fossil fuel industry because they have jobs, but they forget the jobs that are related because of our environment and how important it is to our economy.  In this particular picture, we are seeing the devastating impact and changes of this coral reef in just a very short period of time.  This upper picture taken in 1976 shows a very vibrant coral reef. I think this is an area where there has been a lot of discussion. I am not exactly sure where Carysfort Reef is, but I think there has been a lot of discussion here in the Senate about making sure people have access to it or what ways the public can enjoy this particular site. But when I look at this picture and I look at the devastating impact we see on this coral reef, I question what our strategy is to preserve what is an important recreational and commercial asset to What is our strategy?  When I think about an EPA Administrator, are they going to act now in balancing this issue and making sure that things like the Clean Power Plan, which is saying to polluters: You must reduce pollution--are they going to do that for the fishermen and recreationists and those who believe in the beauty of these coral reefs in Florida? Just like the Washingtonians in my State who go out and recreate on Puget Sound and want to fish salmon and want to make sure our fishing economy stays strong--are they going to have an Administrator who is going to do this?  I can tell you that next summer I guarantee you there are going to be unbelievable discussions about fishing in the Why? Because there is going to be an impact on salmon, and everybody is going to want to fish--commercial fishermen, sports fishermen--everybody is going to want to fish, and unless we have an EPA Administrator and a NOAA Administrator and people who are implementing great conservation strategies, we are not going to be successful because this pollution is impacting our natural areas.  I can see here that it is impacting Florida's economy the same way.  During an interview, Scott Pruitt's predecessor, former Attorney General Drew Edmondson, who served as Oklahoma attorney general from 1995 to 2001, stated:       ``Under his tenure as attorney general, I don't think      environmental crimes have disappeared. It is just the filing      of cases alleging environmental crimes that has largely      disappeared.''  So I think that somebody knows something about this.  I have constituents who are also writing and communicating to me about these issues, about whether they think Mr.Pruitt is the right person to be EPA It is not surprising that we have a quote here from one of my constituents from Poulsbo, I just talked about the Puget Sound economy. I just talked about this economy. Puget Sound is town after town of communities with fishermen who go out and take advantage of that economy within our waters and also go as far away as Alaska to fish. So I am not surprised that somebody from Kitsap County has written to the Kitsap Sun and said: ``I voted for Trump, but I certainly did not vote for a government takedown of my State's most important asset, our water and our economy.''  It doesn't surprise me that that is what somebody in Kitsap County said--not somebody in You should just go look it up, people who are listening. People listening, anybody listening tonight from other parts of the United States, go look up Poulsbo, It is a beautiful community that is all about what Puget Sound can deliver for us, and they will be the first part of our State to tell you what ocean acidification is doing in Hood Canal to impact our fishermen. They will be the first people. They know because this has been part of their livelihood.  So I want to close tonight--this morning, I should say--by saying that I hope our colleagues will at least consider the fact that we are raising concerns, because we have great concerns about the economy of the future, and that economy of the future depends on clean air and clean water and an Administrator who is going to fight to implement the law.  We need an Administrator who is going to be there not on the side of the polluters but on the side of the people in dealing with some of the thorniest environmental problems because of the change in climate this country has seen. We want someone who is going to use that science and information to help provide the stewardship for future generations. I don't think that is Mr. I ask my colleagues to help turn down his nomination and to move forward--at least give us the chance to look at his emails so we know exactly what we are dealing with and to make sure that our country is going to continue to be committed to these men and women who work in this resource economy that depends so much on clean water and air.

9124,topic-id,789,"Mr.President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today, on behalf of Delaware's congressional delegation--Senator Chris Coons, Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, and myself--to honor the exemplary service of Delaware Supreme Court Justice Randy His talent and expertise is admired by both Republicans and Democrats alike. Justice Holland was the youngest person to serve on the Delaware Supreme Court when he was appointed and confirmed by Delaware Governor Mike Castle in 1986. I had the honor of reappointing him to a second 12-year term when I was Governor of Delaware in 1999. Then, in March 2011, he was reappointed again by Governor Markell and unanimously confirmed by the Senate for an unprecedented third 12-year term. His length on the Delaware Supreme Court--30 years and the longest in history--is a result of his broad knowledge of the law and of our State and the respect and professionalism he upholds on and off the bench.  Delaware's supreme court has a reputation for handling complex disputes in a knowledgeable, reliable, and expedient way. It is no doubt that Justice Holland was an integral part of making Delaware's highest court one of the[[Page S2422]]most respected in the Nation and highly regarded internationally. Over the course of three decades, Justice Holland has written more than 700 opinions and several thousand orders and gained the reputation as an expert in Delaware's constitutional law. He has done this all with a unique sense of humility and respect for others, something that fellow judges and attorneys have and will continue to emulate. He is the embodiment of the ``Golden Rule,'' always treating others the way he would like to be treated.  It is perhaps his homegrown knowledge of Delaware and his experience as a general practitioner of the law that allowed Justice Holland to make his mark in the Supreme He grew up in Milford, DE, and went on to graduate from Swarthmore College, University of Pennsylvania Law School, and the University of Virginia Law Before joining the bench at age 39, Justice Holland was a partner at Morris, Nichols, Arsht and Tunnell in Georgetown, DE, where he was known for his ability to draw clients from all over the State on issues ranging from corporate and contract law to zoning and real estate transactions. During this time, he had the opportunity to appear before almost every judge in every court of the It was this wide breadth of knowledge that made him an excellent choice for Delaware's supreme court, even though he had no judicial experience at all.  Justice Holland's colleagues describe him as a mentor and a role model and have relied on him throughout the years for his institutional knowledge of Delaware and the court. This especially came into practice during an unprecendeted turnover in the Delaware Supreme That turnover allowed Governor Jack Markell to appoint four justices, including the chief justice, to the five-officer court. Justice Holland's help and guidance to his colleagues throughout this transitional time proved vital as they became acclimated to their new roles.  When Justice Holland was not in his role as an officer of the court, he was writing. Regarded internationally as an author and historian, Justice Holland has written, coauthored, or edited nine books including ``Delaware Supreme Court Golden Anniversary,'' ``Delaware Constitution of 1897,'' ``The First One Hundred Years,'' ``Magna Carta: Muse & Mentor,'' ``Delaware's Destiny Determined By Lewes,'' and ``Delaware Corporation Law, Selected Cases.'' He has also published several law review articles, primarily dealing with judicial ethics and legal history.  Over his three decades on the Delaware Supreme Court, Justice Holland has received numerous awards, including the 2014 American Inns of Court Powell Award for Professionalism and Ethics, 2012 First State Distinguished Service Award, and the 2011 Dwight Opperman In 2004, he was elected to be an Honorable Master of the Bench by Lincoln's Inn in He was also recognized by members of our Nation's highest court--Chief Justices William Rehnquist and John Roberts--when they appointed him as the State judge member of the Federal Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Appellate  On behalf of Senator Coons and Congresswoman Blunt Rochester, let me express our heartfelt thanks to Justice Holland for his service to our State and judicial system. Today we are honored to be able to offer him our sincere congratulations on a job well done. It will be quite a change not to see him sitting on the second chair in from the left, but we look forward to him continuing to share his deep knowledge about the history and legacy of Delaware law. From our hearts, we wish him and his wife, Ilona, along with their son Ethan and daughter-in-law Jennifer and granddaughters Aurora and Chloe, many happy, healthy, and successful years to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt3-PgS2421-3.txt,179,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,4.0,February

9150,topic-id,2915,"Madam President, good morning to our pages and members of our staff, some of whom have been up all night.  I just walked over here from my office in the Hart Building and, along the way, I ran into the Capitol Police and others who are putting in a long day and a long night. I, on behalf of all of us, want to express my thanks to them.  I have said this on several occasions--that I take no joy in going through a chapter like we are going through tonight.  I come from a State on the east coast where we get along pretty well. Democrats and Republicans sort of like each other. They tend to be mainstream, both on the Democratic side and on the Republican side. We have something called the Delaware way, and it is sort of based on the three C's--communicate, compromise, and collaborate. This is what we do. We have done it for a long time, and it seems to work for us. Hopefully, when we get through this chapter--when we get through the nomination process--we will be able to get back to the three C's.  I have the privilege, as the Presiding Officer knows, that when I got out of the Navy I moved to Delaware, and I had an opportunity to serve in a couple of different roles--as the treasurer, as a Congressman, and then as the Governor for 8 years. In my time as Governor, according to laws and the constitution of Delaware, the Governor nominates people to serve as cabinet members, as members of the judiciary, and on a lot of boards and commissions.  During those 8 years that I was privileged to serve as Governor, the legislature was split--the House was Republican, and the Senate was When it came time to nominate members of my cabinet, my predecessor was Governor Mike Castle, as the Senator from Rhode Island knows. He was a moderate Republican, and he had been our Governor, and before that our Lieutenant He was a State legislator and a very successful attorney.

We were in the New Governor's School out in Colorado, the newly elected Governors of 1992--Democrats and Republicans, including people like George Bush, Tom Ridge, and the list goes on. If I had had more sleep, I could remember every one of them. It was just wonderful. Mike Levin, who later became the head of the EPA, was one of them.  We learned a lot at the New Governor's School about how to set up and establish an administration, how to put together an administration. Mike Castle, Delaware's Governor, was part of the faculty, if you will, of current Governors who mentored us in the New Governor's School, and it was a blessing in my life.  I asked Governor Castle, as we were going through that transition, to sort of walk me through his own cabinet and to suggest who might want to stay, who might be interested in staying on in a new administration--in my administration--and who, maybe, who would not. It ended up, when I nominated people to serve in my cabinet, that there were several there who had actually served in his. We had mostly I am a But there were some Republicans as well. Below the cabinet level, we had division directors, and we kept almost all--not all but almost all of the division directors we asked to stay, too.  For 8 years as Governor of Delaware, I would nominate people to serve in either cabinet positions or on the judiciary or at other posts; but, for 8 years, we batted 1,000. The State executive committee was terrific in approving people, confirming people to serve in these roles. It was not like I just rushed things--here is who we are nominating. Go pass them.  That is not the way they worked. I asked them for their ideas. We solicited their ideas, not just for the cabinet but, also, for the judiciary.  At the end of the day, it was my role to actually nominate people, and it was their role to provide advice and consent, and they did--a little bit before but, certainly, throughout the nominating process. It worked pretty well. It worked pretty well for our State, and I am proud of the 8 years that our administration worked with the legislature and with nonprofit communities, the faith community, and the business community with what we accomplished.  I was trained as a leader from the age of 12, and our Presiding Officer was trained as a leader, probably, from about the same age. We both served in the military. She is a retired lieutenant colonel, and I am a retired Navy captain. But I was trained that leaders[[Page S1343]]are humble, not haughty. I was trained that leaders should have the hearts of servants, as our job is to serve and not be served. I was trained that we basically call on people not to do what we say but to do what we do. I believe in leadership by example. I was taught that leaders don't hold their fingers up to the wind and see which way the wind is going, but that we should have the courage to stay out of step when everyone else is marching to the wrong tune. I was trained that leaders do not lead by dividing folks but by uniting people--by building bridges, not walls. I was trained that leaders should be purveyors of hope--that we should appeal to people's better angels. I was trained that leaders ought to focus on doing what is right, not what is easy or expedient, that we should embrace the Golden Rule--really, embody the Golden Rule--by treating people the way we want to be treated, that we should focus on excellence in everything we do and surround ourselves with the best people we can find. When the team that we lead does well, they get the credit, and when the team that we lead does not do so well, the leader takes the blame. I was trained as a leader with the idea that, when you know you are right, be sure you are right. You just never give up. You never give up.  Those are the leadership skills that were infused into me by my family and my faith. I was in the military for 23 years, plus 4 years as a midshipman, and it helped make me who I am. Those are, really, the leadership blocks that I bring to my job here.  We have had some great leaders in this body. We could use a leadership like I have just described at the top of the food chain in this country, in this administration. We could use that. I, thus far, after about one month into this administration, I haven't seen that kind of leadership that I had hoped for, that we had seen not that long ago.  I want to commend everyone who has come to the floor in the last almost 20 hours on our side--the Democratic side--and on the Republican side to explain our points of view with respect to the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be Administrator for the EPA in this country.  When Donald Trump was running for President, he said pretty consistently that part of what he wanted to do as President was to degrade and, essentially, destroy the Environmental Protection He didn't just say it once or twice but again and again. When he won the nomination, he said the same thing--that, if elected President, part of his goal would be to degrade and, essentially, destroy the Environmental Protection When he was elected President--a couple of days after being elected--he repeated that pledge.  Sometimes people may not believe what we say, but they will believe what we do. For me, the first clear indication that what he said with respect to the Environmental Protection Agency was something that he intended to do was the selection of a person to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, and he chose the attorney general of Oklahoma Scott  Scott was introduced at his confirmation hearing before the Environment and Public Works Committee by the two Senators from Oklahoma--James Lankford, with whom I serve on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee--he is a great member--and Jim Inhofe, who is our senior Republican on the Environment and Public Works  They have very high regard for Scott They have spoken here on the floor with regard to him and to his service. When someone whose service and friendship I value as much as I do--James Lankford and Jim Inhofe--speak so highly of a friend and a colleague from their State, it is not easy for me, and it is not easy for the rest of us to oppose that nominee--their friend. But we have done that. We have done that for weeks now, and we have done that now throughout this night.  I take no joy in doing this. Having said that, I take no joy in the fact that the levels of the seas around my little State of Delaware are rising, and we are the lowest lying State in America, and we see every day the vestiges of sea level rise.  I take no joy when I catch the train in the morning to come down here--I go back and forth every day--I take no joy in standing on the platform at the Wilmington train station and in looking at a beautiful riverfront, which we have worked on for 20 years so as to transform an industrial wasteland into something that is lovely, beautiful, and clean. Even now, with the fish that swim in the Christina River, we cannot eat them. In fact, from most of the bodies of water in my State, we cannot eat the fish, and that is because of the mercury that is contained in them. It is not just in my State, and it is not just in our neighbors' States--Maryland and New It is in the States all up and down the east coast.  We live in what is called the end of America's tailpipe. A lot of emissions that are put up into the air come from coal-fired plants to our west--from Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, which is my native State, and other They have, in many cases, really tall smokestacks, and they put their pollution--their air emissions--up through the smokestacks. They go up hundreds and hundreds of feet into the air. The air carries them out of their It carries the pollution out of their States, and where does it settle? It settles in ours. In States from Virginia on up into We live at the end of America's tailpipe.  I take no joy that, of the freshwater fish in our State and a lot of other places on the east coast and, frankly, in other places around the country, you cannot eat those fish anymore.  I want to take a few minutes and pivot from that as background to what we are going to look at--some charts--in a minute. Before we do, I want to talk about why we can't eat the fish in too many places around this country. And the reason why is because we get, I would say about 40 percent of our electricity from coal. Today it is maybe down to around 30, maybe 25 to 30 percent, and maybe 25 to 30 percent from natural gas. We get maybe 20 percent from nuclear, and the rest is from the renewable forms of energy, including wind and solar technology as it has gotten better and better and better.  One of the reasons my colleagues, particularly on this side, have great concerns about the nomination of Scott Pruitt has to do with mercury. As I have shared with the Senate, a review of Mr.Pruitt's record yields some troubling information about how he managed the unit within his own office in Oklahoma charged with responding to environmental matters. Upon taking office, Mr.Pruitt essentially gutted his own Environmental Protection Unit within the attorney general's office. It appears he abandoned his responsibilities to use his office to protect the public health of Oklahomans and declined to use his authority to hold polluters and bad actors accountable.  A review of Mr.Pruitt's record yields nothing that shows how he will change this behavior if he is confirmed to be EPA In fact, the New York Times reported earlier this month, on February 5, that Mr.Pruitt is drawing up plans to move forward on the President's campaign promise to ``get rid of'' the  Just remember, the EPA does not just involve clean air and clean water and the cleanup of hazardous waste sites. The implementation of the Toxic Substances Control Act deals with hazardous materials and the products we use every day. The Environmental Protection Agency is a huge player in the public health of our country for not just adults like us but for young people like these pages, like my children, our grandchildren--all of us--our parents, grandparents. The EPA is in large part responsible for our being a healthier nation.  I am a big believer in going after root causes for illness and sickness, and if you have mercury in your fish, if you have bad stuff in your air, it degrades your health, and that is a big problem. It is a big problem for us in Delaware because we spend a whole lot of money. Ninety percent of the air pollution in my State doesn't come from It isn't generated in It is bad stuff. It is air emissions that come from other They are able to burn coal, get cheap electricity, and because they put stuff in the air in tall smokestacks, they send it over to us. They end up with cheap electricity, lower healthcare costs, and we end up with having to clean up our emissions dramatically, more so than we otherwise would. It is expensive. So we end[[Page S1344]]up with expensive electricity and also healthcare costs that are higher than the places where the pollution is coming from. That is just not right.  I said earlier that I get no joy from going through this nomination battle for Mr.Pruitt with my friends on the other side, but believe me I get no joy from the idea that we end up with expensive electricity in my State and higher health costs because other people in other parts of our country don't embrace the Golden Rule, to treat other people the way you want to be treated.  Going back to the New York Times article on February 5 that indicated that Mr.Pruitt is drawing up plans to move forward on the President's campaign promise to get rid of the EPA, they had these landing teams in the course of the transition to go through each of the agencies. The person who apparently was leading the administration's landing team into the EPA called for reducing the head count at They didn't say we are going to have a hiring freeze at the They didn't say we are going to have a 1- or 2- or 3-percent reduction. They didn't say we were going to reduce it by 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 percent. They said we are going to reduce the head count at the Environmental Protection Agency by two-thirds.  I guess it is possible that whoever this person is that heads up the landing team of the EPA, maybe they don't have pollution in their Maybe the air is pristine, and they can get all the fish they want from all the other rivers, lakes, and streams. They don't have to worry about toxic waste sites or any of that stuff. I doubt it.  I think part of our job is to make sure the EPA can do their job better, but the kind of draconian changes President Trump has talked about--and when you look at the record of the fellow they nominated to lead the EPA, you get the feeling that maybe they are not just talking.  There is an old saying that sometimes people may not believe what we say, they believe what we do so let's just take a look to see what Mr.Pruitt has done in his own State of I would say there are two sides to every story, and we are hearing two sides to every story. What I am going to do here is just draw on his own words.  The New York Times story goes on to say that Mr.Pruitt ``has a blueprint to repeal climate change rules, cut staffing levels, close regional offices and permanently weaken the agency's regulatory authority.''  It continues:       As much as anyone, Mr.Pruitt knows the legal intricacies      of environmental regulation--and deregulation.

States need to treat other States the way they would want to be treated.  He also understands a very valuable principle: that it is actually possible to have cleaner air, cleaner water, and strengthen our economy.  When I was an undergrad at Ohio State, a midshipman there, I remember a time up north of us in Cleveland, OH, when the Cuyahoga River caught on fire. The kind of smog we have now in parts of the country, running in places in California, when I was stationed in California in the Navy for a while--there are days when I ran that I knew I wasn't doing a good thing for my lungs.  We have done a lot better than that. While we cleaned up rivers like the Cuyahoga River and we cleaned up the air in a lot of places in the country, we still have work to do. We have made those changes and those improvements and developed technology that we have been able to sell all over the world. That is a good thing.  I thank my friend for getting up at this hour of the day and joining us here and for his leadership, not just in Indiana but here in the It has been a joy. Thank you.  I want to go back to what I was talking about earlier--Scott Pruitt's views. I think they are extreme, uninformed views on mercury regulation. Mr.Pruitt's views on core clean air and clean water laws and the somewhat misleading and oftentimes evasive answers he has given to Members of this body, including myself, ought to be reason enough for Members of this body to reject his nomination.  Two months prior to his confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt filed his third major legal action against the EPA's mercury and air toxics rule. This case is still pending before the courts.  For those who don't know the EPA's mercury and air toxics rule, it requires our Nation's largest source of mercury pollution--coal-fired plants--to reduce mercury in a wider range of air toxins.  The EPA issued this rule in 2012, and because of the low cost of compliance, most utilities are already meeting the standards. We made more progress at a faster time, at a lower cost than was actually anticipated. The same thing is true with the elimination of acid rain in New The deal that was worked out was a cap-and-trade approach, but the idea was developed when George Herbert Walker Bush was We ended up with better results for less money and faster time than was anticipated. We can do this.  Mr.Pruitt filed his latest lawsuit alongside with one of the Nation's largest coal companies, Murray Energy Corporation, arguing that the benefits of cleaning up powerplant and mercury and air toxic emissions are ``too speculative'' and not necessary.  Mr.Pruitt goes on to argue that there are only ``hypothetically exposed persons'' from mercury and air toxic emissions from powerplants. Imagine that--``hypothetically exposed persons.'' Again, I would say: Really?  Finally, Mr.Pruitt argues: ``The EPA cannot properly conclude it is appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutants under Section 112.''  His boiled-down arguments before the U.Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit is basically this: If the EPA cannot quantify benefits in dollars, then those benefits don't count. Never mind that we know the real-world health threats to people this kind of air pollution poses.  The idea of looking at public health protection only through the lens of dollars and cents is not a new one, but it can be a dangerous one. The tools we have for projecting costs and putting a dollar value on the health benefits are not gospel and are not the only way of analyzing the economic impacts of reducing pollution on a community. With toxic substances, such as lead, arsenic, and mercury, health benefits are sometimes difficult to quantify.[[Page S1347]]  Meanwhile, the EPA is chock-full of examples where benefits are underestimated and costs overestimated once programs are implemented and businesses find efficient ways of cutting pollution. In my part of the country, we call that Yankee intuition.  Mr.Pruitt's argument ignores that it is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the loss of IQ, increased risk of cancer, or other long-term health effects known to occur when exposed to mercury and air toxic emissions.  In Mr.Pruitt's world, if we can't accurately translate loss of IQ into dollars lost, the benefits of cleaning up mercury for other children is ``too speculative'' for it to be ``necessary and appropriate'' for EPA to act. As a father of three sons, I find this way of thinking alarming.  I have a poster here with a message from a woman in Wilmington, Wilmington is in the northern part of the State, where our congressional delegation and Governor and his family live.  This is from I would ask Mr.Pruitt this: How much does it cost to lose an organ like I have, to lose a parent or child from cancer? How much do sick days and inhalers cost? Families are struggling to make ends meet. Many of these costs are not in dollars alone.  Thank you,  Sarah is a mother and a registered nurse. She wrote to me earlier this month to express her concerns regarding Mr.Pruitt's nomination. In her letter, she explained to me that she was born in 1978, in Western New York It is miles away from the Love Canal neighborhood. It is the site of one of the most appalling environmental disasters in American history.  For those who don't know or don't recall, Love Canal was a planned community that eventually had to be evacuated after 22,000 barrels of toxic waste were dumped into the nearby canal--22,000 barrels. Families whose homes were contaminated with chemicals and toxic waste had to leave. Many faced serious health challenges later in their lives. These were the real threats we faced before we had the EPA or laws on the books that held polluters accountable for dumping hazardous chemicals in our waters.  Sarah's mother was pregnant with her while Love Canal was being evacuated, just 7 miles away from their home. Fast forward a few decades. When Sarah was 30, she found out that she had thyroid cancer. Doctors told her that exposure to radiation, perhaps from the radioactive hotspots near her hometown, is a proven risk factor for thyroid cancer.  Sarah now has a daughter of her own who, unfortunately, suffers from reactive airway disease that causes her trouble breathing, and symptoms can last anywhere from a few minutes to hours at a time.  Sarah, in her letter, said to me:       Mr.Pruitt believes that the EPA places economic hardships      on businesses through unnecessary regulation. True economic      hardship is experienced by those who are often least      protected by environmental laws.  She went on to say:       I would ask Mr.Pruitt: How much does it ``cost'' to lose      an organ like I have? To lose a parent or child to cancer?      How much do sick days and inhalers cost families already      struggling to make ends meet? What is the life path of a      person who starts out with compromised lungs? Many of these      costs are not in dollars alone.  Sarah couldn't be more right. An EPA Administrator must be able to understand the true human cost of rolling back or eliminating critical environmental regulations.  Mr.Pruitt's persistent and extreme views--or at least extreme views in my mind--on the mercury and air toxics rule are some of the reasons I have grave concerns about his nomination to be EPA  I can't help but wonder if Mr.Pruitt will continue to fight this rule--not from outside the Agency, but from inside the  I wonder if Mr.Pruitt would uphold the clean air protection that has bipartisan support or if he would kill the rule and take his extreme views of cost-benefit analysis broader, to other issues such as cleaning up lead in our water or addressing climate change.  That is why I asked him not once, not twice, but three times about his views on the mercury and air toxics rule. I asked him directly three times if EPA should move forward with the rule and if EPA should be regulating mercury and air toxic emissions from powerplants. Each time I asked, the more evasive and misleading the answers became.  In our three exchanges, I was very clear that I was asking about EPA's regulations and the authority to address mercury emissions from powerplants.  However, in Mr.Pruitt's answers, he was very careful to mention that mercury pollution should be regulated under the Clean Air Act but never said that mercury and other air toxic emissions from powerplants should be or must be regulated.  Mercury, as it turns out, is emitted by many sources. Coal-fired powerplants happen to be the largest emitter in this country. Under section 112 of the Clean Air Act, Congress listed mercury as a hazardous air pollutant and required the EPA to regulate all major emissions sources.  It seems that Mr.Pruitt tried to avoid the questions I asked him about controlling mercury and air toxic powerplant emissions. He, instead, answered about regulating mercury more broadly.  While he was trying to evade the questions, what he did say was very misleading to the committee.  In our second exchange, I mentioned his three lawsuits against the mercury and air toxics rule. I asked Mr.Pruitt if he believed the EPA should not move forward with this rule and, if there were no rule, how would States clean up mercury?  Mr.Pruitt answered: ``I actually have not stated that I believe the EPA should not move forward on regulating mercury or adopting rulemaking in that regard.''  He went on to say: ``There is not a statement--or belief--that I have that mercury is something that shouldn't be regulated under Section 112 as a Hazardous Air Pollutant.''  Well, anyone who supports the mercury and air toxics rule and heard that might be very encouraged by these comments.  Sadly, Mr.Pruitt is on record many times stating that the EPA should not move forward regulating mercury and air toxic powerplant emissions.  Here are a few quotes from the legal briefs that Mr.Pruitt filed in his many lawsuits against this rule that directly contradict his statements in our hearing.  In his first lawsuit against the mercury and air toxics rule, called White Stallion v. EPA, Mr.Pruitt argued: ``Finally, the record does not support EPA's findings that mercury, non-mercury Hazardous Air Pollutant metals, and acid gas Hazardous Air Pollutants pose public health hazards.''  In his most recent case with Murray Energy, he argues that, with respect to powerplant mercury emissions, the ``EPA cannot properly conclude that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate Hazardous Air Pollutants under Section 112.''  These statements go well beyond questioning the ``process.'' Instead, they suggest the EPA should not be regulating mercury and toxic air emissions from powerplants.  This is not what even Trump voters voted for in They did not go to the polls hoping that the new President would make their air dirtier or their water more polluted.  This is another case of this nominee trying to mislead, or at least obscure, the truth before It is a troublesome pattern that I fear will only get worse if Mr.Pruitt is confirmed as EPA  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.

We know Mr.Pruitt abandoned his responsibilities to[[Page S1348]]protect Oklahomans from harmful pollution. Instead of holding polluters and bad actors in the State accountable, Mr.Pruitt spent a lot of his time as attorney general in Oklahoma suing the Environmental Protection  These days, going after the EPA public health protection seems like a popular thing to do. In fact, the EPA is often a target of nasty tweets from our current  Without the burning rivers or thick smog and soot in the air, which used to be all too common, some may presume that there is not much more for the EPA to do to protect the public health of our country from pollution. People may presume that our environmental protection problems are behind us, and States can take care of themselves when it comes to clean air and clean water, as Mr.Pruitt has suggested time and again.  I am a recovering Governor, a former Governor for 8 years. I have huge regard for what Governors can do, States can do. There is a lot we can do, but not everything. That is not the idea--that States can simply take care of themselves when it comes to clean air and water, and there is no need for Federal oversight. It is just wrong. I think it is untrue. The EPA continues to play a critical role in protecting our health, especially for the most vulnerable, including the very young and the elderly. The environmental threats we face today are real and do not respect State borders.  One such threat is ozone, known to some as smog pollution. Five times, Mr.Pruitt has sued the EPA over regulations to require new ozone, smog protections. Several of these lawsuits are still pending before the courts.  Mr.Pruitt's actions against ozone health protection are deeply concerning to me, as I represent a State at the end of what many of us on the east coast call America's tailpipe. Emissions come up from the Midwest, largely, and blow from west to east and end up in our air and in our water. Ninety percent of the smog and air pollution in Delaware comes from outside of our State, partly from hundreds of miles away--places like Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and across the  I said many times as Governor of Delaware that I could have eliminated every source of pollution within my State--shut down the factories, cleared every car off the road, stopped trains and transit or boats. Delaware would still face the deadly doses of air pollution, not from our own emissions, but from those blowing in our State from hundreds of miles away.  We have a chart here to my left that we call the Ozone Report Ozone is smog pollution. It deals not with quality of air pollution in Delaware, but it is a report card for Cross-state ozone air pollution continues to be a major problem for our State, but it also is for many States across the country.  In Mr.Pruitt's own home State of Oklahoma, every county with an air quality monitor--16 counties; they have more than 16 counties, but 16 have air quality monitors--has an unhealthy level of ozone pollution, according to the American Lung The American Lung Association assigns grades in subjects, just as for our pages here in school. My home State has A's and B's. The Oklahoma Lung Association assigns a grade for ozone pollution. In these 16 counties, they assigned a grade of F, not just in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10--all 16.  For decades, we have known that air pollution is linked to serious health problems like asthma attacks, strokes, heart attacks, and other respiratory illnesses. Most recently, ozone has been linked to early deaths.  We have another chart that refers to Oklahoma's asthma rate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 6.3 million children in this country have been diagnosed with asthma--6.3 million children diagnosed with asthma. In Mr.Pruitt's home State of Oklahoma, 1 in 10 children have asthma, which is higher than the national average. That is 6.3 million children nationwide, and more than 112,000 in Oklahoma who have to worry, during the high ozone days, if they are going to have an asthma attack.  Recognizing the very real dangers of ozone pollution, Congress passed the EPA to provide our country with the ozone air quality standards based on the best science available, and they review that standard every 5 years. After reviewing more than 1,000 medical and scientific studies, the EPA concluded about 2 years ago, in 2015, that the 2008 ozone health standard was too weak and no longer adequately protected public health.  The EPA's 2015 rule was purely a statement of fact to protect our health. To protect the 6.3 million children with asthma, we need less ozone pollution in our air. To protect 112,000 children with asthma in Oklahoma, we need a stronger air quality standard.  Fortunately, many of today's biggest emitters of ozone pollution, such as older coal plants, are already scheduled to be cleaned up. This means the costs of compliance are not as high as they might have been 2, 4, or 6 years ago.  As attorney general, Mr.Pruitt had a choice between two paths. If he had taken the first path, Mr.Pruitt could have worked with his Department of Environmental Quality and the business community to ensure ozone polluters in his own State cleaned up. He could have worked with the EPA, not against it. By doing so, he would have protected Oklahomans and citizens living in downwind States from ozone pollution and helped economic growth and the State at the same time. It is important to note that many attorneys general in this country decided to take this path, including our own attorney general, Matt Denn, in  Instead, Mr.Pruitt took a second path, the one that led to suing the Agency, the EPA, in an attempt to weaken protections. It is no surprise that Mr.Pruitt chose to sue the EPA, based on his clear record.  I have a poster here with some of his own words. After all, it was Mr.Pruitt who just last summer explicitly said it bothers him that Congress and the EPA work together to ensure Americans have clean air to breathe--or appears to say that. Specifically, here is what he said:       Legislation should not be ``we like clean air, so go make      clean air.'' That's something that bothers me, that then      Congress gives to EPA this general grant of authority.  That was at Hillsdale College in July of 2016. I would just ask, What then does Mr.Pruitt think the role of EPA is? It is hardly some kind of extreme overreach to keep deadly pollutants out of the air we breathe. I think most people think that. Mr.Pruitt chose to sue the EPA over the science used to justify in writing the regulations, citing the polluters over the medical and scientific experts who have published over 1,000 scientific studies that the EPA has reviewed.  Mr.Pruitt did not stop there. He also sued the EPA over protections for downwind Delaware is one of them. Let me repeat that. Mr.Pruitt not only sued the EPA over science used in the 2015 ozone rule, but he also sued the EPA over the good neighbor rule to make sure all States do their fair share to clean up the air. Without the good neighbor rule, Delawareans, and all Americans living in downwind States, will be forced to live with the consequences of decisions made by polluters hundreds or thousands of miles from them. Mr.Pruitt took the stance that every citizen in this country does not have the right to breathe clean air. Mr.Pruitt took the stance that the lawyers and polluters know better than scientists and medical experts when it comes to ozone pollution and health.  The President is asking us in this body to confirm Mr.Pruitt as our EPA As Senators, we can also choose between two paths. The first path is protecting public health and ensuring that those who elected us have clean air to breathe. The second path is protecting polluters. I will be taking the path that protects the health of my constituents. I urge my colleagues to do the same for theirs.  In just a moment, I am going to pause. Before I do, I mention this good neighbor rule. Some people call it the cross-border rule. The idea behind it is that we ought to treat one another as neighbors.  Where does the good neighbor rule come from? It actually comes from the And it comes not just from the Bible, it comes from almost every major religion in the world--the idea that we ought to treat other people the way we want to be treated. If you look at every major religion in the world, it pretty much says that.  In the New Testament, some will recall, there is a passage where the Pharisees were after this young Rabbi,[[Page S1349]]a couple thousand years ago, trying to put Him on the spot. They said: You are so smart, young Rabbi, why don't You tell us what is the greatest rule of law, the greatest commandment of all? He said: Not one, there are two. He mentioned the first. Then He said: The second is love thy neighbor as thyself.  One of the pharisees said to Him: Who is our neighbor? And He went on to tell them the parable of the good A man traveling through the country was attacked, left for dead in a ditch. Later in the day, three people walked by, one from a part of the country where this guy was sort of his neighbor. He walked on by. Next, a person of the cloth, a rabbi, walked on by. He didn't stop. The third guy that came through was from a place called They are like at enmity, at odds with one another. They are not friendly; they are at odds with one another.  He saw the fellow had been beaten and left for dead. He ministered to him and put him on his animal and took him to an inn. For a day and a night, he tried to help him get better. After the second day, the guy from Samaria had to leave and had to go someplace else. He said to the innkeeper: This fellow still isn't well enough to travel, but here is some money to help pay for his care here for another day or two. When I come back through, if you need more money or it costs more, I will even up with you. He left, but he left the guy who had been beaten in a lot better shape.  After telling His story, the young Rabbi turned to the pharisee and he said: Who was the good neighbor?  Well, there was the one--the first fellow who came by who took pity on the guy who had been beaten and left for dead and treated him the way he would have wanted to be treated.  That is really the foundation of the good neighbor rule that the EPA has promulgated. It is the foundation of the idea that pollution does cross borders and because of that, we need to have--if we can't pass a law, we need some kind of rule or regulation to ensure that everybody is being a good neighbor because it is not fair that my State--that we can pretty much close down my State's economy, transportation systems, powerplants, and still have a problem with air quality. That is just not fair.  I think next we are going to look at some editorial statements that are in opposition to Mr.I know there are editorial statements that support him. I don't have any of those today, not surprisingly. But I do want to go through a couple from newspapers around the country: New York Times, Bangor News up in Maine, L.Times, Denver Post, Chicago Sun Times, Dallas Morning  I have received a number of letters from Delawareans about the nomination of Mr.Pruitt to lead the For the record, as of I guess last night, my office had received a total of seven letters, emails, or faxes supporting Mr.Pruitt's nomination. I guess this is from all sources, not just But we have gotten seven letters supporting Mr.Pruitt's nomination. I received 1,880 letters opposing his nomination. That is pretty amazing. We don't get this kind of volume of letters, emails, or faxes, but 1,880 opposed, 7 letters supporting.  But it is not just Delawareans who are worried about the idea of Mr.Pruitt at the helm of EPA; over the past 3 months, editorial boards across our country have expressed their own serious concerns about this nominee as well.  I want to share a few of those with my colleagues and the world this morning. Back in December, the New York Times wrote these words. I will read them. This is from December, a couple of months ago:       Had Donald Trump spent an entire year scouring the country      for someone to weaken clean air and clean water laws and      repudiate America's leadership role in the global battle      against climate change, he could not have found a more      suitable candidate than Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma Attorney       That is a pretty bold charge. The editorial describes Mr.Pruitt's nomination--it goes on to say ``an aggressively bad choice''; ``a poke in the eye to a long history of bipartisan cooperation on environmental issues.''  Again, the EPA was not created in a law signed by a Democrat, it was by a  The Times goes on to say ``bad choice''; ``a poke in the eye . . . to a nation that has come to depend on an agency for healthy air and drinkable water.''  And to the 195 countries that agreed in Paris last year to reduce their emissions, climate-changing greenhouse gas, in the belief that the United States should show the way, the Times concludes with these words: ``Mr.Pruitt is the wrong person to lead an agency charged with the custody of the nation's environment.''  The Senate cares about public good and needs to send his nomination to the dustbin.  But I know that not everyone is a huge fan of the New York Times these days, so let's move a little further north. Let's go up to They have a paper up there called the Bangor Daily I have a poster from them as well. Last month, the Bangor Daily News Editorial Board wrote these words. Again, this is last month:       As attorney general of Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt has been openly      hostile to the EPA's mission of protecting human health by      regulating dangerous pollutants, such as mercury and carbon      dioxide. Someone who has repeatedly tried to prevent the EPA      from doing its job surely should be disqualified from      overseeing the agency.  You know, we generally believe that Presidents have wide latitude in choosing the members of their I think Governors should have wide latitude. As a former Governor, I said to our Delaware Legislature: I have been elected; give me the opportunity to put together my own team and judge us on our performance.  However, some nominees of some Presidents are so--probably Democrats and Republicans, but especially in this case, with this President--some nominees are so unqualified or philosophically unfit that Senators should use their constitutional powers to reject them. Scott Pruitt, President Donald Trump's pick to head the EPA, is one of those nominees.  I voted for more of the nominees of this President than against. Several of them are quite good. I serve on a committee called Homeland Security and Governmental To succeed Secretary Jeh Johnson, the President nominated retired Marine general John Francis Kelly, who was a terrific soldier, marine, leader for our country, and will be a great I wish they were all of his caliber. I wish they were.  The Bangor paper went on to write:       Critics of the EPA tend to focus on rules and laws that the      agency is involved in writing that protect little-known      animals or landscapes, such as wetlands. But, the agency's      primary mission is to safeguard the health of Americans      through landmark laws such as Clean Water Act and Clean Air       Finally at the Bangor paper, they got to what is really at stake with Scott Pruitt at the head of EPA when we have a President who has repeatedly said he would like to get rid of the EPA in almost every forum. This is what they said at the Bangor News:       We are under no illusions that Mr.Trump is suddenly going      to become a champion of environmental protection, even if      that is synonymous with protecting human life. But Pruitt is      so hostile to the EPA's core mission that putting him in      charge would move the United States dangerously backwards.  But it is not just the east coast editorial boards that are worried about Scott Pruitt's nomination. Let's go to the west coast, the L.Times in California, the State that has led the way in environmental protection. The L.Times Editorial Board wrote--let's see if we have a date. It is February 4, this month. This is what they wrote:       Yes, Trump won the election, and as president, he's      entitled to appoint people who reflect his political views.      But when the president's policies and appointees pose such a      fundamental threat to the nation, even a Senate controlled by      his fellow Republicans--whose first loyalty should be to the      people of the United States--must put the nation's best      interests ahead of party loyalty.  They continue at the L.Times and say:       Pruitt wouldn't run the agency as just another small-     government Republican interested in paring excessive      limitations on business. He actually disagrees with the      fundamental mission of the He has argued that the      federal government should play a lesser role in environmental      protection, and that primary control should be given to the      states.  That is wrongheaded. Putting West Virginia, my native State, in charge of[[Page S1350]]its coal industry or Texas in charge of its oil industry would lead to horrific environmental damage, not just there but in the neighboring States downwind and downstream, according to the L.Times Editorial  The L.Times Editorial concludes by saying:       Putting Pruitt in charge of the EPA, however, poses an      irreversible risk to the planet, and the Senate needs to      ensure that doesn't happen.  It is not just the coastal editorial boards that have opposed Mr.The Denver Post noted that--these are their words from 2 months ago, December 8, 2016:       It looks like Trump truly does wish to dismantle the      His pick of Scott Pruitt to lead it strikes us as      unnecessarily reckless, and we urge the Senate to deny      confirmation and to demand a better way forward.  It is not on the poster, but the Denver paper went on to add: Does the Nation really want a Big Oil mouthpiece running the agency that's charged with the laudable task of keeping our air and water safe?  Let's head up to Chicago, where the Sun Times was editorializing in the great State of The Chicago Sun Times Editorial Board--let's see what we have for a date. It looks like December 8, a couple of months ago. This is what they said:       We are living in a time that calls for stepping up efforts      across the board to protect our environment for future      generations.       Unfortunately, President-elect Donald Trump has appointed      Scott Pruitt, an open foe of environmental initiatives, to      head the U.Environmental Protection That      demonstrates a callous disregard for the health of our nation      and planet just as rapid technological advances hold out hope      for avoiding the worst effects of climate change.  It went on to say:       During his campaign, Trump said he would dismantle      President Barrack Obama's environmental policies and pull the      United States out of the 195-nation Paris accord to reduce      greenhouse gases and climate change. After the election,      Trump moderated his tone, saying he has an open mind about      climate change. His appointment of Pruitt, however, suggests      that if he's open to anything, it's strictly more pollution.  They concluded with these words:       At a time when serious scientists worry about cataclysmic      disasters threatened by climate change, we can't afford to      put our future in the hands of an apologist for the fossil      fuel industry. America needs an EPA chief who understands the      value of environmental successes we have achieved and the      critical importance of building on them.  But perhaps these aren't convincing enough. Travel with me down to Texas because they have a problem even in Texas, in the Lone Star One of the newspapers there, the Dallas Morning News, wrote just last week:       Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a veteran of a      years-long courthouse campaign to undermine the Environmental      Protection Agency, is the wrong choice to lead the agency      under President Donald It's hard to imagine a worse      choice.  They highlighted the long-term impact of putting Mr.Pruitt in charge of the Here is what they said:       The post of EPA administrator is a critical one, and      nowhere is that more tangible than here in energy-rich  Again, this is the Dallas Morning News:       Many industry voices have already raised toasts to Pruitt's      nomination, concluding that his plans to eviscerate the EPA's      regulatory oversight of oil and gas companies, and other      polluters, will strengthen the state's economic fortunes.  The Morning News went on to write that the Senators from Texas must ``look beyond the short-sighted calculus and vote in the long-term interests of Put simply, Texas' economy will be stronger over time if its environment is cleaner and if its people are healthier.''  This is just one of a handful of the editorial boards that have raised serious and substantive objections to Mr.Pruitt's nomination, and for very good reason. They don't just come from the Northeast or from the east coast, they don't just come from the Southeast or the Midwest; they come from the west coast and even Texas itself. We ought to listen to them. We ought to listen to them. They are not all wrong. In fact, I fear they are right.  With that, I see we have been joined on the floor by a young man from Connecticut who came to share some of his own thoughts with us on these important topics.  I just want to thank him for the good work he does in so many areas. He and I have been partners together on trying to make sure the people of this country have access to affordable healthcare, and we get better results for less money, and I applaud him for those efforts, as he knows probably better than I, to try to ensure that people are healthy. It is not enough just to provide healthcare for them when they get sick. We call that sick care. We try to make sure we are doing things up front to prevent people from getting sick, to enable them to stay healthy. A lot of that really leads right to the work of the Environmental Protection  Leadership is so important in everything we do. It is the most critical factor in everything. Leadership is the key to the success of any organization, large or small, that I have ever been a part of or observed. I don't care if it is a business, I don't care if it is a church, I don't care if it is a school, I don't care if it is a military unit, a sports team, or the U.Senate, leadership is key. The EPA is key.  Show me enlightened, well-qualified leadership, and I will show you a successful operation. We need to be real careful in making sure the EPA has the kind of leadership that will lead them and our Nation well into the future.  With that, I yield the floor.

The Presiding Officer is a pretty good friend of mine, and I don't know if he is a big baseball fan. I am. I love sports. I am a huge Detroit Tigers fan. You are a Giants fan. The leadership in baseball is critically important. It is important to have good infielders, good outfielders, good pitchers, catchers, and so forth. What is really important is to have great leadership and great leadership in terms of the coaching staff. Leadership is always the most important ingredient in every organization I have ever been a part of.  The Tigers just lost their owner, Mike He was a legendary figure in Detroit in baseball. He passed away earlier this week at the tender age of 86. It is a big loss for Motown and, frankly, for baseball.  In terms of leadership, we wouldn't want to hire somebody to coach a baseball team who was a football coach or someone who is great with a basketball team. I don't doubt that Scott Pruitt a skillful lawyer. I met his family. I like him. I think he is arguably a good dad and a good husband. But it is a little bit like asking a pacifist to lead something like the Department of Defense--may be a skillful person but maybe just not the right person to do a particular job.

The Republican nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, 278 letters against; Mr.Pruitt, 1,880 letters and emails against. Delawareans are clearly paying attention, and they are clearly concerned by the idea of Mr.Pruitt being charged with safeguarding our environment and our health.  I want to take a moment to read a letter sent to me--I have gotten a lot of letters--a letter sent to me last week from a woman named Danielle D., a new mother and small business owner who lives in Wilmington with her infant son. Danielle wrote to me because her concerns go beyond politics and to the core values of giving our children the best lives possible. Danielle writes:       Dear Senator Carper, I am reaching out to you today as both      a new mother and a small business owner urging you to oppose      Scott Pruitt's nomination as Administrator of the U.     Environmental Protection       As a business owner, I support a number of President      Trump's cabinet nominations and many of his pro-business      policies. But there are very few policy decisions that touch      every facet of our lives like environmental policies do. Our      environment affects our health, our economy and our everyday      lives. The decisions we now make will affect Americans for      generations to come.  She goes on to say:       My son is 5 months old. Like any parent, I can only hope I      am able to advance my son's life by leaps and bounds, as my      parents did for me.       However, I am extremely concerned that, should Mr.Pruitt      be chosen as the next Administrator of the EPA, the decisions      we make today will make it nearly impossible for me to leave      my son a better environment than the one I brought him into.       In short, we need an EPA Administrator who will work to      prove America is the best when it comes to environmental      policy. Mr.Pruitt is not that person.  I share this letter today so that our colleagues know that my constituents and, indeed, Americans across the country do care deeply about the person who will lead the EPA, although they may support other nominees of President Those who have contacted us want to know that the individual leading the EPA is on their side and that the first question that person will ask is, How will this affect the environment and how will this affect the health of the least of these, like Danielle's 5-month-old son?

We have a Bible study group that meets every We met yesterday in Jim Inhofe's hideaway. Every time we meet, almost without exception, Chaplain Black reminds us, Democrats and Republicans--those of us who need the most help--he reminds us that of all the times the Scripture is invoked, we should ask for wisdom.  Well, I ask for wisdom every night for myself, my colleagues in the Senate, over in the House, the President, the Vice President, their spouses, every night, that we have the opportunity to gain some wisdom.  When Scott Pruitt was nominated to be the Administrator for EPA, I sent him a letter December 28, asking 52 questions, asking for responses by January 10. They didn't come by January 10. We had a hearing January 18. I got some answers, not all. One thing I also asked for, also asked for by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, was access to what the folks had been asking for from the Center for Media and Democracy for 2 years; that is, access to thousands of emails in the AG's office, and their back and forth with the fossil fuel industry, oil, natural gas, coal, a variety of others. We would like to have access to those emails.  When Mr.Pruitt went before our committee for his hearing on January 18, he was asked the question: Do you promise to provide information reasonably requested by committees here in the United States Senate and the Congress, including in electronic form? He said, yes, but he didn't do it. In fact, for 2 years, the AG's office fought off efforts to try to gain access to that information, electronic media. It took a judge calling an emergency meeting yesterday in Oklahoma to say to the attorney general's office: You have to turn this information over. Normally, you know how long a 4-year request takes in Oklahoma to get results like this? We are talking maybe 2 months. This was over 2 years.  Finally, we are going to get access to those emails. There may be a reason why they were so reluctant to share those emails with us. We are going to find out starting next Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, when we get them. If we don't vote to support Senator Merkley's proposal, to put off the vote until the Monday after we come back from recess, we will not have the opportunity to take advantage of what the judge--I don't know if it is by Divine intervention, but this judge has given us the opportunity to gain wisdom, to make a smarter decision, to make a better informed decision. If we vote up or down on Mr.Pruitt's nomination today, we pass up a great opportunity to get a fuller picture.  Now, my Republican friends will say: He sat through the longest hearing of any EPA Administrator in the history of our country. He has answered 1,000 questions.  Let me just say that Gina McCarthy answered more when she was the last EPA She answered more--quite a few more, actually. She took a little extra time to actually answer the questions.[[Page S1389]]  So many of the responses we got to the thousands of questions for the record asked of this nominee--the answers were evasive, they were incomplete, and sometimes they were just totally nonresponsive. You can say he answered all the questions, but how well? How thoroughly? How responsively? Not so good. Not so good.  Friends, I want to put up here on the board--I have a board here.

9224,topic-id,873,"We have heard from a lot of folks, different views on what we ought to be doing. One of them was from a fellow whose name is Kyle Meyaard-Who is Mr.Schaap? Good question. Mr.Schaap is the leader or one of the spokespersons from a group--if I can find it here; here we go--spokesperson for Young Evangelicals for Climate  He wrote us about Mr.Pruitt's nomination. Here is what he had to say:       If Scott Pruitt embraces his own self-described pro-life      stance, he should fight to protect vulnerable lives from      birth to natural death--the lives of children born and      unborn, the elderly, people of color--from environmental      pollution. He should work tirelessly to ensure that everyone      has clean water and air. He should strengthen, not      eviscerate, an agency equipped to honor God's mandate to      steward and care for the creation.  Mr.Meyaard-Schaap goes on to say:       As Oklahoma attorney general, however, [Mr.Pruitt] has      done just the opposite. He has had the chance to protect      people from pollution and the harms of climate change.      Instead, he has brought multiple lawsuits against the EPA to      overturn measures that would safeguard clean water and air.      He had the chance to defend policies that cut the power plant      pollution that fuels climate change and pollutes our air.      Instead, he cast doubt on climate change and downplayed the      moral imperative to safeguard our climate and environment. He      had a chance to assist EPA in its mission to protect public      health. Instead, he questioned its mission entirely and      sought to defend industry from regulation.  We all have an obligation to protect the health of our children, families, and the world in which we live. For me, this is not only my responsibility as a parent and official elected to serve the people of Delaware, it is a moral calling.  I sat for 8 years as a member of the National Governors For 7 years, this lady sat right next to me. She was the Governor of New She went on to become the Administrator of the EPA--the very position to which Scott Pruitt has been nominated. She is not a She is not a progressive. She is not a knee-jerk liberal. She is a She was not only the Governor of her State for 7 years, but she was the head of EPA for a number of years under George Here is what she basically said about Scott Pruitt, her words, not mine. She said: ``[I] can't recall ever having seen an appointment of someone who was so disdainful of the agency and the science behind what the agency does.'' That bears repeating. ``[I] can't recall ever having seen an appointment of someone who is so disdainful of the agency and the science behind what the agency does.'' Those are powerful words.  Just as I think that the idea of waiting another week or so to get the wisdom that those thousands of emails might contain--we don't have to wait for the wisdom from this woman who has walked in these shoes, serving her State as Governor and serving this country as the leader of the Agency that protects our public health for all of us. My hope is that our colleagues will not ignore this wisdom.  Lastly, I will say this: Come next Thursday, Friday, we are going to start getting the information from these emails. We will find out if there is fire where there is smoke or not. If there is nothing there, then there is nothing there, but if there is something there, I just want to say to my Republican friends, if you are ready to vote for this nominee without this complete information that we could have here to be put to use in a positive way within 10 days from now, you pass up a big opportunity.  We are in a sense, by voting on this nomination without this information, flying blind. I am an old naval flight officer, 23 years as a naval flight officer, retired Navy captain. In Southeast Asia, you flew into monsoons and really bad weather sometimes. We never wanted to fly blind. We always wanted to have a good weather forecast. We want to avoid the places we ought to avoid. We wanted to fly at altitudes that were safe. We wanted to use our radars to be able to find the pockets to go through to be safe. We never wanted to fly blind.  If we basically, before we close up shop, vote for this nominee with incomplete information, we are flying blind. It wasn't a very smart thing to do in naval aviation, and it would not be a smart thing for us to do here.  This is not a warning; this is just friendly advice from one colleague to another: It is worth waiting an extra week to get this information rather than voting today without it. Again, the words of our Chaplain Barry Black always invoking us to ask for wisdom--I have asked for it. The wisdom that I would impart to all of us today: Hit the pause button. Get the information next week. Make our decision then.  I yield back my time. Thanks so much.  The PRESIDING The Senator's time has expired.

I come from a little State like Senator Coons, where we get along pretty well. We believe in the three Cs--communicate, collaborate, compromise.  But you know what else gives me no joy? I get no joy from rising sea levels from New England to Miami that threatens our way of life. It threatens our way of life. I get no joy from fish advisories that keep us from eating fish in every State in this country. I get no joy being one of the States at the end of America's tailpipe, where we get all this pollution from other States and end up with higher costs and worse healthcare. I get no joy from the millions of kids who go to school this week with their inhalers because they have asthma. I get no joy from people who appear before us as nominees, take 1,000 questions for the Record, and give us answers that in too many cases are evasive, indirect, or incomplete. I get no joy from nominees who appear before us who pledge to provide information requested by us responsibly, including electronic media, and never give it to us, who fight for 2 years to make sure we never get it. I get no joy from those circumstances.  Thomas Jefferson used to say: If the people know the truth, they will not make a mistake. We are prepared to vote here with incomplete information, without the kind of wisdom we could have and vote with if we would wait 10 days--10 days. That is what it would cost. Is that a long time? Ask Gina She waited 132 days to get a vote. If you think 1,000 questions are too many to answer, ask Gina She answered a lot more. Finally, the Republicans got their answers, and we got our vote. She won and, I think, did an admirable job.  We need the truth. We are seeking the truth. I have no interest in obstruction. I want the truth.  Vote no.

9370,topic-id,451,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment to H.26 would exempt rules concerning public health or safety from the burdensome requirements of this legislation.  Simply put, when a rule is necessary to protect the health and safety of the public, it is critical that the rule be put into effect without unnecessary delay.  If this legislation is enacted without this amendment, it will create an untenable regulatory environment that will make it nearly impossible for agencies to safeguard the public welfare.  This legislation could bring to a grinding halt critical rulemaking such as rules relating to the transportation of hazardous materials by the Department of Transportation, clean air regulations by the EPA, and worker-protection standards by  For example, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration implemented an economically significant rule that, by May 2018, all new vehicles must have rearview cameras. This regulation will help drivers have better visibility behind their car, greatly reducing the likelihood of backover crashes which largely involves small children.  But under the REINS Act, this rule would require a joint congressional resolution with an unrealistic timeline for implementation. For every year this rule would be delayed, the Traffic Safety Administration estimates that there would be, on average, 15,000 injuries and 267 fatalities resulting from backover crashes.  Proponents of this legislation may argue that H.26 contains an emergency exemption which allows a major rule to temporarily take effect following an executive order stating that there is an imminent threat to public health and safety. Even when the threat is not imminent, the danger to the public health and welfare may be great and the fundamental responsibility to protect the public remains.                              {time}  1615  This legislation would substantially hinder the ability of agencies to fulfill this obligation, placing Americans at greater risk for the benefit of powerful corporate interests. In its present form, the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards and the alliance of more than 150 consumer, labor, faith, and other public interest groups predict that, by allowing Congress to even veto uncontroversial rules that protect public health and safety, the REINS Act ``would make the dysfunction and obstructionism that plague our political process even worse.''  In echoing this sentiment, the American Sustainable Business Council, which represents over 200,000 businesses, opposes H.26 because it would recklessly place the burden of proof on the taxpayers in order to protect themselves on environmental, health, and safety issues and would shift responsibility away from powerful corporate interests.  While my amendment will not cure all that ails this legislation--and there is a lot--it will address one of its most glaring flaws and preserve the ability of agencies to protect public health and safety. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH124.txt,2055,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,5.0,February

It prevents the implementation of rules which, in fact, protect public health and safety.  If my amendment were to pass, that statement would be true--it would do nothing to frustrate it--but without this amendment, it prevents the implementation of a rule that would, in fact, protect public health and safety.

9328,topic-id,822,"Mr.Chairman, I don't know if I can live up to those words, but I certainly appreciate them.  I was the ranking member on this committee, and I was chair at one point. We have had this bill over the years. It is indeed a monkey wrench or a monkey in the wrench, as John McCain might have said. It will mess up the entire system that we have of Congress passing laws, delegating, giving the executive the ability to enact them in ways that make them functional and appropriate and come up with the details that the Congress does not have enough expertise to do.  The other side refers constantly to people that prepare these rules--which take many, many years and have much, much input--as bureaucrats, as if it is some type of pejorative. Bureaucrats are government employees who have expertise in certain areas and who study an area and become so much more expert than we are on the subject that they can come up with fine-tuned laws that are checked and balanced to make sure that the laws are implemented in the way that Congress intends. If Congress doesn't like it, Congress can pass a bill by both House and Senate to repeal it. We have already got that possibility.  Under this unique approach, either one of the houses of Congress can stop a regulation, a rule from going into effect because both Houses would have to approve a rule and the President would have to sign it before it could go into effect. That gives one House the ability to veto, basically, an executive action.  It is the executive in our system that has the power to veto acts of the legislature and not vice versa. We can pass laws in a bicameral spirit, which is what our Constitution has, when the House and the Senate agree. But neither House, independently, is given any power to veto laws or legislation. This would break that and, I believe, be unconstitutional. That is why I oppose H.26, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2017.  Indeed, the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act is most appropriate this year as we start, because in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, we are, indeed, going to have an executive in need of scrutiny. So I thank the Republicans for naming this bill appropriately because we are, indeed, in the times of an Executive in need of scrutiny.  We need scrutiny over income tax returns that have been hidden from the public that might disclose conflicts of interest or loans from characters that might be considered oligarchs and have some type of an influence over our foreign policy and our domestic.  We need an Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act that deals with these conflicts, with income taxes that haven't been released, with businesses in the District where people could go to hotels and curry favor with the  Indeed, we do have an Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, so I appreciate the well-named bill that the Republicans have brought us and the awareness that, through this bill, they have seen that we need some concern about the Executive coming because he certainly needs scrutiny.                              {time}  1500  This bill, though, is the worst of corporate special interest because it will give corporate special interests the opportunity to override rules that take effect unless both Houses pass them. It is difficult enough for this House and the Senate to get legislation passed in the days that we often give to legislation, but to have both Houses have to agree, in which case if you can't, it is, in essence, a pocket veto, and it doesn't even have to be scheduled for a[[Page H127]]vote because the House would have to positively pass and the Senate positively pass. So if the Speaker doesn't want to do it, the Speaker can pocket veto the regulation. It doesn't even have to be scheduled.  This is not draining the swamp. It will heighten the influence of corporate lobbyists in Congress where they can come to the Speaker and ask that agency rules they don't like that might protect the lives of children because they are regulations dealing with toys that seem to possibly be defective, or automobiles where they need safety devices, or other consumer protections that interfere with business interests--business is good and important, but sometimes businesses do things that are injurious to the public.  To give this opportunity to stop rules and regulations from going into effect that protect the public is wrong. It was suggested maybe it will help the economy, but at what cost? What is one life worth--or several lives--if lives are lost because safety regulations are not approved by this House and the Senate, or one or the other, and then don't go into effect? As I mentioned, this is seriously constitutionally defective.  The The time of the gentleman has expired.  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH124.txt,,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,5.0,February

9349,topic-id,4620,"Mr.Chair, H.26, the ``Regulations from the Executive in Need of[[Page H132]]Scrutiny Act of 2017,'' otherwise known as the REINS Act, would amend the Congressional Review Act to require that both Houses of Congress pass and the President sign a joint resolution of approval within 70 legislative days before any major rule issued by an agency can take effect.  Simply put, H.26 would impose unworkable deadlines for the enactment of a major rule under procedures that could charitably be referred to as convoluted.  Under this bill, the House may only consider a resolution for a major rule on the second and fourth Thursday of each month. Keep in mind that typically 80 major rules are promulgated annually. Yet, there may be as little as just 15 days available to consider such measures based on the majority's legislative calendar for the current year.  Furthermore, Congress may only consider such resolutions within 70 legislative days of receiving a major rule. This process would constructively end rulemaking as we know it.  Now, Mr.Chair, the reason why my friends on the other side of the aisle say we need this kind of gumming-the-works legislation--is because they claim regulations stifle economic growth.  For example, they point to the outgoing administration and say that regulations promulgated during its tenure have hurt our Nation's economy.  What they fail to tell the American people is that it was the Republican George Bush's administration's economic policies that caused the Great  Without question, it was the lack of regulatory controls that facilitated rampant predatory lending, which nearly destroyed our Nation's economy.  It led to millions of home foreclosures and devastated neighborhoods across In fact, it nearly caused a global economic meltdown.  Nevertheless, as a consequence of strong regulatory policies implemented by President Obama through such measures as the Dodd-Frank Act, our Nation has recovered to a point where the unemployment has been cut nearly in half to less than 5 percent.  Yet, the REINS Act would reverse these gains by empowering Congress to control and override the rulemaking process, even in the absence of any substantive expertise.  More than 80 of the Nation's leading professors on environmental and administrative law have warned in connection with substantively identical legislation considered in the last Congress, that without this expertise, any congressional disapproval is more likely to reflect the political power of special interests.  Lastly, by upending the process for agency rulemaking so that Congress can simply void major rules through inaction, the REINS Act likely violates the presentment and bicameralism requirements of Article I of the  As a leading expert on administrative law states: ``The reality is that the act is intended to enable a single House of Congress to control the implementation of the laws through the rulemaking process. Such a scheme transgresses the very idea of separation of powers, under which the Constitution entrusts the writing of the laws to the legislative branch and the implementation of the laws to the executive branch.''  The REINS Act will further encourage corporate giants to hold our country hostage through a deregulatory, profits-first agenda and facilitate a political influence process rivaling the destructive industrial monopolies from the past century.  In sum, H.26, like the ``Midnight Rules Relief Act'' we considered yesterday on the House floor, is yet another blatant gift to big business to weaken the critical regulatory protections that ensure the safety of the air we breathe, the cars we drive, the toys we give our children, and the food we eat.  Accordingly, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this ill-conceived bill.  The All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.  The text of the bill is as follows:                                H.26       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the      Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2017''.     2.       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for      and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1      of article I of the United States Constitution grants all      legislative powers to Over time, Congress has      excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing      to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability      for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in      Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted      and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and      a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the      American people for the laws imposed upon them.     3.

9377,topic-id,354,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would exempt from H.26, the REINS Act, rules issued to reduce the amount of lead in public drinking water.  The ingestion of lead, of course, causes serious harmful effects on human health, even at low exposure levels. That is why the Environmental Protection Agency has set the maximum contaminant level for this toxic metal in drinking water at zero.  According to the EPA, young children, infants, and fetuses are particularly vulnerable to lead because the physical and behavioral effects of lead occur at lower exposure levels in children than in adults. The Agency reports that, in children, low levels of exposure have been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing, and the impaired formation and function of blood cells.  Take, for example, the Flint water crisis, which I have a little experience with, which was a preventable public health disaster. While much blame for the Flint water crisis lies with unelected officials who prioritize saving money over saving lives, the presence of lead in drinking water is, unfortunately, not unique to In fact, the drinking water of, potentially, millions of Americans may be contaminated by lead.  My amendment highlights one of the most problematic aspects of H.26: that it could slow down or completely block urgent rulemakings that protect health and safety. This is because Members simply lack the requisite scientific or technical knowledge to independently assess the bona fides of most regulations, which are often the product of extensive research and analysis by agencies as well as input from effective entities and the public.

Agriculture is our largest industry, adding about $16 billion to our economy every year. But even those members--big as they are--can't give you a full appreciation of just how important the land is to our people. Sure, they make a living off it, but farming isn't just an ``industry'' to us--it is not just another statistical category like ``nondurable goods manufacturing.'' It is a way of life. The people of Arkansas cultivate the land. They nurture it. They teach their children how to care for it. These are people who get up at 5 a.m. to milk the cows. They have had these farms in their families for generations. They pass on the land--and the values they have learned along with it. They believe in the EPA's mission of preserving a healthy environment just as much as anyone.  Yes, they are stewards of the earth, these men and women, yet the EPA too often treats them as criminals. In the last 8 years alone, the EPA has been treating their property rights more like a form of parole. It has passed sweeping regulations that presume to tell farmers when they can plant and how often they can run a tractor. It has declared something as tiny as a mud puddle on a family farm as a ``navigable water''--thus under the EPA's jurisdiction it has put on a show of soliciting ``feedback'' from the people who have to live under its rules, while cavalierly dismissing most of their concerns, and all the while pursuing an activist agenda, whether through the Clean Power Plan or the waters of the United States rule, it has failed to fulfill its core mission: keeping our people safe. Just remember, the EPA helped bring criminal charges and a $15,000 fine against a North Carolina farm owner who accidentally spilled cow dung into a river; yet when it caused the wastewater spill into the Animas River, it stalled and withheld important information from investigators. If a company had acted like the EPA, it would likely have faced criminal charges--brought about by the  It is this state of affairs that our next EPA Administrator will inherit, and I want to take this opportunity to say President's Trump nominee, Scott Pruitt, has my support.  I think he is especially qualified to lead the Agency at this time because he comes from rural America himself. As the attorney general of Oklahoma, he fought the EPA's overreach in court more than half a dozen times. I believe he understands that Arkansas farmers and the American people know the needs of their land far better than Washington bureaucrats do. When I met with him a few weeks ago, we discussed the impact EPA regulations are having on Arkansas farms, businesses, and energy companies. We also talked about Fort Smith's issues with an inflexible EPA consent decree. It was clear from our conversation he knew environmental law backwards and forwards, but he also had something else: a real-world appreciation of the burden that heavy-handed regulations put on our farmers and on rural  I believe Scott Pruitt understands we can have both a robust economy and a healthy environment. I believe he will pull back the EPA's excesses and focus on its core mission. I believe, under his leadership, the EPA can begin to rebuild the trust it has lost with rural America, the trust that is necessary for it to achieve its goals. And so, for all of these reasons, I will be voting to confirm.  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,2098,REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN NEED OF SCRUTINY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,16.0,March

This is a practice which the pipe suppliers, Siemens, GE, and others have issued serious warning is an unsafe practice. Unfortunately, it wasn't followed that day, so six men lost their lives. One of them was Ronnie Crabb, who was a dear friend of mine.

We are here today. We are going to get it done in a couple of hours. That is good news.  As they say about Montana, we are a unique blend of Merle Haggard and John Denver, and mastering that melody is always a challenge. When you do, it results in a commonsense approach to environmental stewardship, and I can tell you Scott Pruitt is the guy to do it.  I literally left my office to come here and make these remarks, and guess who I was meeting with in my office. It was Scott  You know what we talked about?  He came into my office.

In fact, he asked to me: Do you know where Cooke City, MT, is?  I said: Scott, Cooke City, MT? Let me show you. I have a map of the Beartooth in my office with pins in all the lakes that I have blown to. In fact, I spent 65 miles in the Beartooth Wilderness in August on horseback and on foot, above 10,000 feet, with an elk hair caddis and my fly rod, chasing golden trout and cutthroat trout. We spent a lot of time talking about that. We talked about elk hunting and deer hunting in  Scott Pruitt understands the important role that States play, especially in a State like I am confident he is going to restore this balanced focus, this Merle Haggard and John Denver balance that Montanans are pleading for. He will bring that back to the EPA, rather than this heavy-handed Gina McCarthy out-of-touch Federal approach.  Let me tell you a couple of stories of what is going on in Montana and why Scott Pruitt is exactly the right guy for the job. Today in the small town of Colstrip, MT, they face a real struggle to survive. Colstrip is a generating station and neighboring mine and the lifeblood of this small town.  Over the years, the Colstrip plant has continued to develop. They have adopted new technologies, and they made remarkable reductions in emissions and pollution. Yet it has been met with an onslaught of new environmental regulations that are having drastic compliance costs on our  Let me share some of those. Under this EPA power plan that was launched by Gina McCarthy, Montana needs to cut its emissions by 47 percent--the largest reduction in the Nation, leading almost inevitably to the entire shutdown of  In fact, according to a study conducted by the University of Montana, they said this plan will cost our State 7,000 jobs, $500 million in lost revenues, and $1.5 billion in gross sales for our And Montana moves from being an energy exporter to being an energy importer. That is outrageous, and the people of Montana know it.  For what? For what the Obama administration had projected to have a 0.02-degree impact on global temperature in the next 100 years--negligible. In fact, I confronted Gina McCarthy on that in a hearing, and she did not refute my data.  Similarly, the waters of the United States serves yet another example of the detrimental effects of Gina McCarthy's and President Obama's EPA, which has harmed Montana's farmers and ranchers. As I mentioned, one of my favorite things to do is get into the fresh air of Montana, the clean waters of Montana, up in wilderness country with my fly rod in my hand. We all want clean water. We all want clean air. I have yet to meet a single Montanan who says I don't want clean air; I don't want clean water.  The WOTUS rule was a clear effort by the Obama administration to gain control over Montana's livelihoods. It was a private property taking, seeking to regulate virtually every ditch and pond that could be occasionally wet across the State of  While, thankfully, this incredible overreach by the EPA and the Obama administration has been stopped by the courts, I am looking forward to working with Scott Pruitt to defend Montana farmers and ranchers and to defend Montana property owners from this unnecessary and harmful rule.  Scott Pruitt understands the important role our States play and not to levy unnecessary and overreaching Federal regulations--regulations that could decimate a State's economy. That is unacceptable.  I will tell what you else I talked to Scott Pruitt about; that is, the importance of cleaning up our Superfund sites. This is a critical responsibility of the We need to unleash American innovation, American cooperation--not cut off affordable energy sources at its heels.  Regarding Superfund cleanup, as Scott and I concluded our meeting, we talked about the Berkeley Pit in He has committed to getting that environmental disaster cleaned up. He assured me he will address these issues head-on.  The largest Superfund site in the United States is right there in Butte, We had snow geese that came across our State migrating. They landed in the toxic waters in the Berkeley Pit, and thousands of snow geese died just by landing in the water. Scott is committed to getting that fixed. It has been on the list for over 20 years. It is time to fix it, and Scott is committed, saying: Let's get this done.  That is why he is going to be a great Administrator, to protect the environment in  That is the good news.

Just this morning, Leader McConnell came here to move Congressman Zinke's nomination to be the next Secretary of Interior and debate that on the floor. Let's have unanimous consent; let's get that done.  Guess what. The Democrats objected. Why?  Ryan Zinke and I went to Boise State in 1979. He will be the first Cabinet appointee in the history of the State of Montana going back to statehood of 1889, and the Democrats are blocking us from getting that done today for no good reason.  He passed with a bipartisan vote of 16 to 6 in the Energy and Natural Resources He is going to be an outstanding addition to President Trump's I don't understand why it is being blocked.  We can get that done this afternoon--done. Let's get it done now. Instead, Ryan Zinke is being stopped from assuming his position as Secretary of the Guess what. We have a long list of things to do in  I am the chairman of the National Park We have a backlog of maintenance. We have to get Zinke in place now to start strengthening our national parks. He is going to be a great addition.  I am pleading with my colleagues. I am asking why. Give me a good reason why you are objecting to moving Congressman Zinke's nomination forward now? Why are you holding up this historic vote for Montana?  This will be the longest a President has waited for his team to be in place since George It is ridiculous. We need a Secretary of the Interior who will be a westerner, one who understands that Montana is that balance between Merle Haggard and John Denver; a Secretary who understands that, in Montana, our largest neighbor is the Federal Government; and a Secretary who understands how important our national parks are for us and for the 6 million folks who visit them every year. Ryan Zinke is a great guy for that job, but we can't even have a vote. So we wait.  We wait on the Democrats' political games to unfold. We wait on Democrats' political posturing. We wait on the Democrats' next delay tactic.  Montanans are saying: You know what, we are tired of these reindeer games. Let's put the President's team in place.

9151,topic-id,781,"Madam President, it is an honor and a privilege to be here with my colleague from I wish to take a few moments to talk about the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection  I have expressed my fair share of constructive criticism of the EPA over the years. I wish the Agency would work more effectively with States and stakeholders. Collaborative partnerships are the best way to ensure that our environmental policies meet our fundamental responsibility to be good stewards of the environment, while also being narrowly tailored to avoid overburdening Hoosier families and businesses.  Teamwork is what will give us the best chance at responding effectively to emergencies like the ones facing my friends in the East Chicago neighborhood of West Cooperation with farmers, not overregulation, is how we keep nutrients and inputs in the field and improve water quality.  If confirmed, I hope Scott Pruitt will focus on improving the EPA's working relationship with State partners and all stakeholders as the Agency engages in its mission to protect our environment. That is an issue I have been working on for years, and I will continue to do so. I cannot, however, support Scott Pruitt's nomination to lead the  When I think of who should lead the EPA, given all the Hoosiers who are impacted by the rules and policies developed by this Agency, I think of how we are all dependent on clean air and water, but I also think of the last time an EPA Administrator visited my home It was in 2013, in a cold barn in Whiteland, IN, when then-Administrator Gina McCarthy visited with me and a number of my good friends--Hoosier farmers from across the It was the morning after the EPA had announced drastic cuts to the renewable fuel standard--not an ideal time to be Administrator of the EPA in a barn with a group of Hoosier farmers.  That morning, farmers told the story of how important the renewable fuel[[Page S1346]]standard is to rural economies and our national security. They told Administrator McCarthy how her Agency's decision had eliminated market opportunities for their products, for all of the things they had been growing, and it meant that we were putting our energy security at risk as well because less ethanol and biodiesel being used meant importing more foreign oil instead of growing our fuel on Hoosier farms.  A few days later, Scott Pruitt sent out a press release calling those RFS cuts ``good news'' and highlighting his earlier efforts suing the EPA in an attempt to block the regulatory approval of I cannot support an EPA nominee who has sued the EPA to stop the sale of E15 and who praised the erosion of a policy designed to strengthen our energy security and to promote homegrown Hoosier biofuels.  If confirmed, however, I look forward to working with Scott Pruitt to develop a better and more collaborative approach to regulation by the We have very, very important work to do, including cleaning up environmental dangers in our communities, like those in East Chicago; ensuring the safety of drinking water systems; developing a better WOTUS rule; and finding a workable solution to address climate change.  That work in East Chicago is going to prevent me from being able to be here to vote against the Pruitt nomination. The Governor of our State has called a working meeting today in East Chicago with the mayor, State and local elected officials, representatives from HUD and EPA, and other neighborhood stakeholders. It is of utmost importance for me to be on the ground with the community to let them know we are listening and we are working to get the resolution they deserve and to protect their health and safety.

9139,topic-id,7052,"Mr.President, I would like to take this time to share with my colleagues why Scott Pruitt is unqualified to be Administrator of the EPA and why I oppose his nomination.  I just got a new job here in the Senate when the people of Illinois elected me last November, and I have a little advice for Mr.Pruitt on how to succeed in an interview. 1, don't go to a job interview and spend the entire time dodging questions. You don't tell the people interviewing you to go file document requests, which Mr.Pruitt can[[Page S1321]]reject as attorney general, and you don't oppose policies that strengthen our energy security like the renewable fuel standard. I am concerned that the RFS will be gutted under a Scott Pruitt-led  As someone who fought to defend this great Nation, I see firsthand the price we pay for our dependence on oil imported from our adversaries. I already fought a war over oil, and I would rather run my car on American-grown corn and soybeans than oil from the Middle During Operation Iraqi Freedom, 50 percent of all casualties occurred during convoy operations, and 80 percent of all convoy operations were conducted to transport diesel fuel. I think it is high time we invest more energy and more money and more support into development of biofuels like ethanol.  In addition to risking lives, we are wasting resources. Annually, we spend approximately $67.5 billion protecting global oil supplies. At home, Americans are using more gas than ever before. Yet OPEC has made it clear they are controlling the price we pay at the pump.  For example, in November of 2016, OPEC decided to cut its oil production to increase prices, and it caused a 10-percent increase in prices that very day. By December 12, prices had reached an 18-month high. We should not be risking lives and wasting money when we can use energy grown right here at home in States like mine. When we are producing more oil at home than ever before, that doesn't mean we can gut policies that are helping our Nation become energy independent. We need an EPA Administrator who will work with Congress to help us find ways to cut, not increase, our use of oil.  Scott Pruitt called the RFS unworkable. He clearly doesn't know that the renewable fuel standard is delivering triple bottom-line benefits. It is good for our security, it is good for our economy, and it is good for our climate. In my State of Illinois alone, the RFS employs more than 4,000 people and generates more than $5 billion in economic impact. Nationwide it is supporting 86,000 direct jobs. Those are good jobs with good wages. Those are people who are going home and paying their mortgages, sending their kids to school, and saving money toward retirement. It has helped to generate $8.7 billion in tax revenues that go to schools, roads, and first responders.  Mr.Pruitt's failure to support the RFS is not the only reason I oppose his nomination.  During his confirmation hearing before the Environment and Public Works Committee, which I sit on, Mr.Pruitt gave vague, hollow, and evasive answers. It was clear that he either doesn't support or understand the mission of the very Agency he would like to lead.  Mr.Pruitt, the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency is to protect the basic ingredients that people need for a good life. It is to protect our air and our water. These issues, public health issues, are what he has spent his career in helping Big Oil to dismantle.  Take the issue of lead poisoning. One of the responsibilities of the EPA is to enforce our lead contamination laws that keep lead out of our air and water. When questioned at his confirmation hearing, I was shocked that Mr.Pruitt was unaware that there was no safe level of lead for children.  As a mom, this terrifies me. I remember sitting in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee when we had hearings on the Flint water crisis. I am a mom of a 2-year-old, and at the time my baby was just 1 year old. I remember being pregnant and having my daughter. I looked out into that audience, and I saw a mom holding a baby bottle that looked exactly like one my daughter drank out of--a little bottle with a pink top on it. The water in her baby bottle that she had to make her formula with was brown. It was brown. I thought about what it would have been like for me to have been drinking that water while I was pregnant and to have fed that water to my child and to have had the choice of: Could I have afforded bottled water or would I have to feed my daughter that water? It is not acceptable, not in the greatest country on the face of the  Mr.Pruitt doesn't know there is no safe level of lead allowed in the drinking water for children? Even low levels of lead can cause permanent brain damage in kids, lower IQs, and inflict other cognitive damage. There is no excuse for our Nation's EPA Administrator to not know that basic fact. That is a serious oversight, especially in the aftermath of the Flint water crisis. Lead in schools and in public waterways is a serious problem for Illinois children as well as for the children of It is a problem for families. It is a problem for families and for children all across this  The EPA should work proactively to prevent crises like in Flint and to protect America's water supplies, but Mr.Pruitt's record of filing lawsuit after lawsuit that challenge the EPA's authority to carry out its mission doesn't inspire much confidence that his goals are the same as the Agency's that he seeks to lead. The American people simply cannot afford to have someone with a well-documented history of putting corporate polluters' profits before our clean air and water leading the Agency that is meant to safeguard them--the  We are only starting to learn the extent of Mr.Pruitt's conflicts of interest, and we have an opportunity to learn more about these conflicts now that a State judge in Oklahoma has ordered Mr.Pruitt to release by Tuesday potentially thousands of emails he exchanged with fossil fuel interests in his job as the Oklahoma attorney general. Senate Republicans are forcing us to vote on Mr.Pruitt before Tuesday because they know the American people will be alarmed and shocked by what his correspondence will reveal.  Mr.Pruitt has shown he is unwilling and unable to do this job. I remember, during questioning in committee, he was asked what was the role of the He spent the majority of his answer talking about the Federal Government not infringing on States' rights and talking about pulling the Federal Government and the EPA out of the States' business. Only at the very end did he add, almost as an afterthought--oh, yes--``and to safeguard the water and the air.'' The name of the Agency is the Environmental Protection That should have been the first thing he said, not the last.  He doesn't understand the central public health and environmental challenges that face us. Instead of siding with people, he has chosen to side with corporate polluters. He doesn't have a single environmental accomplishment to his name. He is unqualified, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing his nomination.  As someone who represents a farming State, I remember when President Trump came out to the Midwest and promised the American farmers that he would support the renewable fuel standard. I am deeply disappointed he has nominated someone to head the EPA who is clearly opposed to the renewable fuel standard.  I asked Mr.Pruitt several times in committee, in several different ways, if he would stand by the American farmer. I even told him what the right answer was--side with, stand with, protect the producers, and he refused to answer. He gave vague, evasive answers and refused to commit and refused to support the American farmer.  It is a no-brainer. Support the American farmer. Don't break the President's promise. Don't back away from the  Mr.Pruitt is continuing his administration's tradition of using alternative facts. The alternative to facts is fiction, and we cannot afford to have an Administrator who questions climate change. Climate change is an urgent threat to our Increasing temperatures are causing extreme weather events at alarming rates. We are witnessing more intense droughts, wildfires, and extreme weather across this country. If we put our heads in the sand and fail to curb the pollution that drives climate change, the effects will be devastating as our air quality will worsen, which will trigger more asthma attacks and other respiratory issues for our children; our coastal communities will be threatened by sea level rise; our national security will be threatened as climate change creates instability around the world.  ADM Mike Mullen, who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the Bush and Obama administrations, had this to say about climate change:[[Page S1322]]         Whatever the cause, climate change's potential impacts are      sobering and far-reaching. Glaciers are melting at a faster      rate, causing water supplies to diminish in Asia; rising sea      levels could lead to a mass migration and displacement      similar to what we saw in Pakistan's 2010 floods.  The National Intelligence Council's report, ``Global Trends 2030,'' made similar observations.  Their report states: ``Many developing and fragile states, such as in Sub-Saharan Africa, face increasing strain from resource constraints and climate change, pitting different tribal and ethnic groups against one another and accentuating the separation of various identities.''  Climate change, clean air, clean water, and fighting lead contamination are not partisan issues. We don't only have these issues in red States or blue States--they are universal--and the American people expect us to make sure the head of the Agency that is charged with safeguarding these vital health priorities will be able and willing to do the job.  Since Mr.Pruitt was nominated, I have heard concerns from thousands of my constituents. Let me share a few words that I have received from my home  This letter is from one of my constituents from  He writes:       I am asking you to vote ``no'' on Scott Pruitt's nomination      as Administrator of the Environmental Protection      America's clean water and air are a shining example for much      of the world, and the EPA is their defender. Mr.Pruitt      demonstrates no understanding of ocean acidification and the      urgent risk it poses to American marine life, fishermen, and      the communities that depend on them. Americans must protect      our water and air from further pollution while we work      collaboratively toward win-win solutions to challenges like      ocean acidification. Mr.Pruitt ignores established science,      and he is the wrong choice to lead the As my Senator,      please vote ``no'' on my behalf.  I hear you, and I share your concerns, and I will be voting no on Mr.Pruitt as Administrator of the  As you may know, EPA region 5 is based in my State, in I have heard from a number of EPA employees as well as from constituents--employees, both past and present--who are worried about the Agency they have served and loved. Here are some words from a former region 5 employee.  He writes:       Dear Senator Duckworth, I and many other former employees      of the Environmental Protection Agency want to share our      concern about Attorney General Scott Pruitt's qualifications      to serve as the next Administrator of the Our      perspective is not partisan. Having served under both      Republican and Democratic Presidents, we recognize the right      of a new administration to pursue new policies that protect      our environment, but the EPA's Administrator must act in the      public's interest and not simply advance the agendas of the      industries that it regulates.       Decisions that affect the public's health or natural      resources should respect the law and reflect the best      scientific evidence available. Mr.Pruitt's record and public      statements suggest that he does not share these values. As      Oklahoma's attorney general, Mr.Pruitt issued more than 50      press releases celebrating lawsuits to overturn EPA standards      to limit mercury emissions from powerplants, reduce smog      levels in cities and regional haze in parks, clean up the      Chesapeake Bay, or control greenhouse gas emissions. In      contrast, none of Mr.Pruitt's press releases refer to any      action he has taken to enforce environmental laws or to      actually reduce pollution.       Of even greater concern, his statements frequently ignore      or misrepresent EPA's authority to regulate or its obligation      to do so under the Clean Air or Clean Water Mr.Pruitt      has shown little interest in the kind of scientific and      factual evidence that must guide EPA decisions. Mr.Pruitt      has said that humanity's contribution to global warming is      subject to considerable debate. That statement is at odds      with the consensus among scientists. Mr.Pruitt fails to      understand the difference between the public interest and the      private interest.  It is just amazing to me that we are even here, that this man was even nominated--someone who has sued the EPA, someone who has so clearly been in partnership with the fossil fuel industry and who has not put the interests of families and children first as opposed to the interests of the fossil fuel industry, which have been guiding him all the way.  I, in fact, was shocked to learn that Mr.Pruitt closed the Oklahoma Environmental Enforcement Unit established by his predecessor. Instead, he established a new litigation team to challenge the EPA and other Federal agencies. Let me say that again. When he became the Oklahoma attorney general, he closed the Oklahoma Environmental Enforcement Instead, he chose to start a new litigation team to challenge the EPA and other Federal agencies.  I did not see any indication from him, in his confirmation hearing, that he would not do the same once he gets to the Federal Perhaps that is the intent of the Trump administration, to bring someone in who will dismantle the That is why I am here tonight. That is why I am opposing him--because I put the needs of our children, the needs of our environment, and the needs of our national security in front of the needs of the biofuel industry. We need an Administrator who has the patience, skill, and commitment to public service in order to steer the EPA through challenges that are associated with protecting our public health.  I, too, cannot believe Mr.Pruitt has demonstrated that he has the qualities needed to lead the Environmental Protection I hope you will be happy to know that is why I am opposing his nomination.  A constituent from Deerfield, IL, wrote to me:       I am writing to ask that you raise your voice in Washington      against Scott Pruitt as President Trump's nominee for EPA            The EPA is an organization driven by science and dedicated      to protecting the climate and environment, not just for      Americans but for all citizens of the Mr.Pruitt, on      the other hand, disagrees with a vast majority of the      scientific establishment as to the extent of climate change      and humanity's role in it. He has made a name for himself by      opposing EPA's policies and missions in the past.       It is beyond me that anyone believes Mr.Pruitt could      effectively head the EPA and lead it further in its mission      to ensure we are responsible stewards of this planet's      environment and resources. I ask that you do your duty as a      citizen of this planet and vote ``no'' on Mr.Pruitt for this      position.       The EPA is an organization driven by science and dedicated      to protecting the climate and environment, not just for      Americans, but for all nations of the Mr.Pruitt, on      the other hand, disagrees with the vast majority of the      scientific establishment. Vote no on Mr.Pruitt for this      position.       I hope you all do your duty as representatives of the      American people by vocalizing our concerns with Mr.Pruitt to      your fellow Senators, urging them to see the fault in      President Trump's nomination.       Respectfully, Ethan, Deerfield,  Well, Ethan, I am doing exactly that. That is why I am here today--to make sure that our colleagues understand how poorly suited Mr.Pruitt is to this job of Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Here is a letter from a Ph.student from Northwestern       As a Northwestern University doctorate student, I have      chosen to devote my life to the pursuit of scientific      knowledge. I am deeply troubled by the nomination of Scott      Pruitt, and I am really concerned about the upcoming Senate      vote.       The head of the EPA must uphold basic science and should      not be colluding with the polluters they are required to      regulate. Scott Pruitt cannot be trusted to head the EPA, an      agency that is charged with protecting all Americans from      threats to their water, air, and health.       Pruitt is also out of step with the vast majority of      scientists, not only those working in the field of climate      change, but also those who have dedicated their lives to      protecting our air and water. As a scientific agency charged      with protecting the public's health according to the best and      most recent science, the EPA deserves to be headed by someone      with a scientific background, or at least an appreciation for      scientific truth.       I strongly urge you as my Senator to stand up for me and my      neighbors, and I oppose this nomination.       Thank you so much, Amanda Cook, from North Lakeview Avenue      in  Well, Amanda, I get it. I am with you. I, of course, did not pursue a Ph.in a scientific field, but it doesn't take a Ph.in a scientific field to know that a man who has sued the EPA over a dozen times is not someone suitable to lead the EPA; that a man who said that he doesn't know whether climate change truly is scientific fact should not be the man who is going to head the Agency enforced with dealing with the effects of global warming. He should not be the person who is in charge of the Agency that will be protecting our air and our water supply.  We have not even touched on what the costs will be to this Nation if we continue to neglect the well-being of our environment. Rising rates of asthma of our children will mean higher[[Page S1323]]medical costs. Lead in the water supply causing cognitive damage to our children will mean that additional resources must be spent in our schools in order to provide those children with the best opportunities that they can have to grow and thrive and will also result in greater medical bills to treat those children for the rest of their lives.  If you don't believe me, just ask the people of Flint, They are dealing with it every single day--every single day--those parents of children who have now been affected by the lead in that water supply. And Mr.Pruitt chooses to defend and protect the needs of the biofuels industry over the needs of our children. That is not someone worthy of representing the American people. That is not someone worthy of heading this  Let's just stick to Mr.Pruitt's own words, not the words of others, not the words of my constituents, but his own words. This is what he said about the Agency that he has been chosen to lead. Mr.Pruitt describes himself as ``a leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.'' He said this on his LinkedIn page. We accessed this in January of 2016.  On the role of the EPA he says:       I believe the EPA has a role to play in our Republican form      of government. Air and water quality issues can cross State      lines and can sometimes require Federal intervention. At the      same time, the EPA was never intended to be our Nation's      frontline environmental regulator.  This was his testimony before the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in May of 2016.  I disagree with you. I disagree with you, Mr.Pruitt, because I was there at that hearing where there were both State EPA officials as well as Federal EPA officials trying to explain why they allowed Detroit's children to be poisoned. And the Federal EPA official knew about the lead in the water supply--in fact, had discovered it--and they were so timid about pursuing it that they waited too long and allowed the State to continue to move forward. Those Federal EPA officials were indeed on the frontline.  I asked the Regional Administrator, Would you not rather be in front of this committee today explaining why you acted too quickly to save the health and the future well-being of the children of Flint than to be here in front of us today explaining why you allowed them to be poisoned, and not exercise your right as the Federal EPA to step in when the health and well-being of American citizens were at stake?  So Mr.Pruitt, I disagree with you. The EPA was indeed intended to be one of our Nation's frontline environmental regulators.  On climate change, Mr.Pruitt has said:       Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates      of our time. That debate is far from settled. Scientists      continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global      warming and its connections to the actions of mankind. That      debate should be encouraged in classrooms, public forums, and      the halls of  He is actually arguing that we should be teaching false science and should be encouraging it in classrooms and public forums. I can't think of something that would be a greater disservice to America than for the EPA Administrator to be someone who actually looks at scientific data--proven scientific data, facts--and rejects them. Yet, we know why he does. We know from his history. We know from his record in He does it because the fossil fuel industry tells him so.  This is what he said about the Clean Power Plan:       The President could announce the most ``state friendly''      plan possible, but it would not change the fact that the      administration does not have the legal authority under the      Clean Air Act to regulate carbon emissions.  Yes, it does. Yes, it does, Mr. He just said that in August of 2015.  Here is what he said on methane regulation:       My concern is that EPA is employing its flawed methodology      in order to rationalize new and unjustified Federal      regulations to solve a methane emissions problem that simply      does not exist.  This man does not believe in global warming. This man does not believe in scientific data.  If you don't believe the scientists, at least look at what is happening with the storm systems, with what is happening to the climate that is changing and affecting this Nation with increased drought, increased flooding, more severe weather, and erosion. We had the first climate change refugees of Louisiana where people who have lived for generations in the gulf have now seen their islands washed away and have to be resettled.  Even if you don't believe in the data, believe your eyes and believe the facts.  Mr.Pruitt also said:       The record does not support EPA's finding that mercury      poses public health hazards. Human exposure to methylmercury      resulting from coal-fired EGUs is exceedingly small.  That is simply untrue.  On legislating, he has said:       Legislation should not be ``we like clean air, so go make      clean air.'' That is what bothers me, that Congress gives      this general authority to  On Oklahoma's race to the bottom on environmental regulations--this has to do with the Federal regional haze standards--Mr.Pruitt said:       These standards threaten the competitive edge Oklahoma has      enjoyed for years with low cost and reliable electric      generation. This low-cost energy not only benefits Oklahoma      manufacturers but gives us a considerable edge in recruiting      new jobs.  He would rather increase the haze and the pollution in the environment. He would rather have an economic edge at the expense of the people of Oklahoma who must live and breathe more polluted air.  This is what he said on the renewable fuels standard:       The evidence is clear that the current ethanol fuel mandate      is unworkable. The decision by the EPA to lower that standard      is good news for Oklahoma consumers.  What he means is that it is good news for Oklahoma's fossil fuel producers. In fact, the renewable fuel standards have been a success and we should be adhering to them and we should be keeping the renewable fuel standards and supporting the producers.  I will bet on the American farmer any day of the week. Our farmers work hard. Our farmers produce the corn for ethanol right here in the United I would rather invest in them than in foreign oil. I would rather invest in them and in a fuel that is clean-burning versus a fuel that pollutes the environment for the next generation of our  Even if you don't believe in the science, believe in the dollars.

It is a fact that Scott Pruitt is simply too extreme to lead the He once wrote an entire op-ed questioning the science of climate change. He said:       Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates      of our time. That debate is far from settled. Scientists      continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global      warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.  This is according to an op-ed written by Scott Pruitt in the Tulsa  He goes on:       Healthy debate is the lifeblood of American democracy, and      global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates      of our time. That debate is far from settled.  I agree that healthy debate is important to democracy, but when that debate is over and becomes an item of fact, it is just simply silly, and in the case of clean air and clean water and climate change, it gets to be dangerous.  His climate denial goes against the scientific community. Ninety-seven percent of scientists, including those at NASA, agree that human activities are causing climate change.  The 18 major national scientific organizations issued a joint statement with the following conclusion:       Observations throughout the world make it clear that      climate change is occurring and rigorous scientific research      demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human      activities are the primary driver.  Mr.Pruitt's climate denial is also against the will of the American people. In fact, a New York Times/Stanford poll from 2015 showed that 77 percent of Americans support government action to combat climate change. This poll found that 83 percent of Americans, including 61 percent of Republicans, say that if nothing is done to[[Page S1324]]reduce emissions, global warming will be a serious problem in the future. Seventy-seven percent of Americans, according to this poll, say that the Federal Government should be doing a substantial amount to combat climate change.  In a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll from 2009, 67 percent of Americans stated that they supported EPA action to curb carbon pollution from powerplants, while only 29 percent opposed them. In that same poll, 57 percent supported requiring companies to cut emissions even if it means higher power bills. This was an increase from 48 percent in October of 2009 to the poll that was conducted in June of 2014.  Mr.Pruitt's blatantly anti-environment agenda threatens public health. He is unfit to lead an Agency that he sued at every turn to block protections for clean air and water. He sued the EPA over the legality of the Clean Power He claims that the EPA does not have the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.  Since becoming Oklahoma's top legal officer in 2011, Mr.Pruitt has unsuccessfully attempted to stop vital protections of public health--unsuccessfully. This includes standards for reducing soot and smog pollution that crosses interstate lines; protections against emissions of mercury, arsenic, acid gases, and other toxic pollutants from powerplants; and standards to improve air quality in national parks and wilderness areas. Each time he has done this, he has failed. Yet he continues to file suit.  He did many of these suits in conjunction with the fossil fuel industry. Some of those suits are still outstanding. Yet he has said--he has refused to commit to recusing himself from any of these lawsuits that may come in front of the EPA while he is the Administrator of the That is a conflict of interest. He will simply become the plaintiff, the judge, and the jury if he does not recuse himself. But of course that is his goal. His goal is to dismantle the His goal is to dismantle the Clean Water His goal is to take away the authority of the EPA to regulate and protect those activities that affect our environment.  Mr.Pruitt launched three separate failed lawsuits against EPA's clean air rules, the regional haze cross-state air pollution rule, and the mercury and air toxics protections, otherwise known as The Supreme Court flat-out rejected Mr.Pruitt's challenges to the EPA's mercury standards. Thank God, because it protects millions of children from the effects of mercury, arsenic, and other dangers neurotoxins from coal plants.  Mr.Pruitt wants to block the EPA's clean water rule, which will protect the drinking water for over 117 million--that is one in three--One in three Americans gets drinking water from streams that lacked clear protections before the clean water rule.  According to analysis of over 1,200 peer-reviewed scientific reports, small streams and wetlands play a critical role in the health of larger downstream bodies, such as rivers, lakes, bays, and coastal waters.  Mr.Pruitt doesn't even want the EPA to study fracking's potential links to water contamination. As recently as 2014, he sent a letter to the EPA Office of Inspector General warning against preliminary research into threats to water resources posed by hydraulic fracturing. He said he believed EPA's efforts to study whether fracking was linked to groundwater contamination was politically motivated. He is even afraid of a study. Not only is he trying to block the EPA's ability to regulate, he doesn't even want the EPA to study it. He doesn't even want it to have the chance to develop the data to show that our water supply is under danger from fracking.  This man doesn't believe in scientific data, but he is afraid of it. If he weren't afraid of it, he would support these studies because they would show that he was right. But here is the problem: He is not right. He is wrong. The scientific data shows that such activities pollute our water supply.  Mr.Pruitt has repeatedly failed to act to protect the people of Oklahoma from increasingly powerful earthquakes caused by fossil fuel extraction through the process of fracking as well. We have had a string of level 5 magnitude earthquakes hit the State of Scientists have indicated that they are being caused by a dramatic rise in the use of hydraulic fracturing--fracking--to produce oil and gas. The problem lies in the massive volumes of wastewater unearthed in the process of unlocking oil and gas. Operators typically dump salty wastewater, injecting high volumes of fluid into the disposal wells dug thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, but the pressure from wastewater is wreaking havoc on Oklahoma's fault lines.  The Oklahoma Geological Survey bluntly concluded last year that it was very likely that the majority of earthquakes that ripped through the central and northern regions of the State were caused by this process of injecting wastewater into disposal wells. This was reported by NBC News in November of 2016.  In 2016, the National Review reported that Mr.Pruitt compared taking on Big Oil to offenses committed by the British leading to the American It said:       The United States was born out of a revolution against, in      the words of the Declaration of Independence, an ``arbitrary      government'' that put men on trial for ``pretended offenses''      and ``abolish[ed] the Free System of English laws.'' Brave      men and women stood up to that oppressive government, and      this, the greatest democracy of them all, one that is      governed by the rule of law and not by men, is the product.  Some of our States have forgotten this founding principle and are acting less like Jefferson and Adams and more like George  A group of Democratic attorneys general has announced it intends to criminally investigate oil and gas companies that have disputed the science behind manmade global warming. Backed by green energy interests and environmental lobbying groups, the coalition has promised to use intrusive investigations, costly litigations, and criminal prosecutions to silence critics of its climate change agenda. This is from the National  He is comparing the efforts to take on Big Oil to offenses committed by the British leading to the American I will take on Big Oil any day. I think it is important for our Nation's future.  As we have heard during the course of this debate, those of us who are troubled by the prospect of Mr.Pruitt becoming EPA Administrator believe that the process to this point has been marred by his failure to provide us with the information we feel we need to evaluate his suitability to serve in this critical role. Meanwhile, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that Mr.Pruitt has been fully forthcoming. So let's put this dispute aside and turn our attention to a question Mr.Pruitt did answer. It may be among the most revealing of his responses. Unfortunately, what his answer reveals is the precise reason so many of us and so many of the people we represent are opposed to his confirmation and convinced he is absolutely the wrong person to head the agency.  Senator Carper asked Mr.Pruitt: Are there any other EPA regulations that are on the books today that you do support?  Mr.Pruitt declined to name a single one. Not one. He has many that he could choose from. In fact, the question should have been something of a softball, in my view, giving him a chance to embrace the EPA's core mission as a public health He couldn't find a single regulation that he could support within the The man who is supposed to be heading the EPA could not think of a single regulation of this Agency that he could support.  Instead, what Mr.Pruitt does not seem to grasp is that EPA regulations are not simply policies to be litigated. In reality, they are lifesaving protections for so many Americans, and they create millions of dollars of net benefits.  Let's take a look at some of the public health environmental protections Mr.Pruitt cannot bring himself to support.  The mercury and air toxic standards have been projected to save up to 11,000 lives annually from premature deaths--11,000 lives annually from premature deaths, saved because of these regulations. They also prevent heart attacks and avoid 5,700 emergency room visits. That translates into over $80 billion in net benefits in a single year. That is a lot of lives saved, illnesses avoided, and economic benefits created that a[[Page S1325]]would-be EPA Administrator can't bring himself to support.  Of course, we should have expected Mr.Pruitt to name that rule since he has sued to block it twice, the second time being after EPA modified the rule to address concerns raised by the Supreme Perhaps the number of rules we could expect Mr.Pruitt to support is a bit smaller than we might have thought since he blocked so many of them. In case after case after case, he has sued to block the EPA from working to save lives, prevent illnesses, and create economic benefits.  He has sued on behalf of Oklahoma to block the cross-state air pollution rule, otherwise known as the good neighbor rule. That rule cuts the pollution that leads to dangerous, sometimes deadly, urban smog and soot. When he sued, he was suing to block the American public from enjoying the following benefits: up to 34,000 lives saved per year, along with some $280 billion in health benefits.  When Mr.Pruitt brought an action against EPA's health-based standards for ground-level ozone, he was standing in opposition to the protections that would help avoid 660 premature deaths and over 230,000 asthma attacks, while creating $4.5 billion in health benefits net of cost. Even if you don't believe in the science, you should at least believe in the dollars and cents of the lives saved. Yet he continues to sue the EPA to oppose these regulations.  Although Mr.Pruitt has been a tireless litigator, he has not challenged every one of EPA's public health protections. But still, when asked, the man who wants to become the Administrator of the EPA could not name a single regulation of the Agency that he is about to take charge of that he supported. That means, for example, Mr.Pruitt probably doesn't support a rule that reduces the sulfur in gasoline so that emission control devices on cars can work more effectively. Don't we all want cars to work effectively? I guess he doesn't. This particular rule stands to create net benefits of up to $17.5 billion by 2030. Those dollar figures include the benefit of saving up to 2,000 lives and preventing 2,220 hospital admissions and asthma-related emergency room visits.  In 2015, the EPA set standards for the emissions of toxic air pollutants at refineries. As a result, 1.4 million fewer people will be exposed to cancer risks, yielding a 15- to 20-percent reduction in cancer incidents linked to refinery air pollution. According to his answer, Mr.Pruitt--who is seeking to be the EPA Administrator--doesn't support those advancements in public health.  He also doesn't support rules that are protecting the brain development of our children from exposure to lead in both gasoline and paint. Otherwise, he may have answered my colleague Mr.Carper by saying that he supported the highly successful gasoline lead phaseout that dates all the way back to 1988. That regulation produced health benefits to the tune of over $6 billion. He didn't even indicate that he supports a rule addressing childhood lead exposure and renovation repair and painting.  Mr.Pruitt didn't even tell us that he supports rules that put or keep money in the pockets of families and businesses along with the environmental benefits they deliver.  EPA's greenhouse gas and fuel efficiency standards for cars and light-duty trucks are calculated to save families $1.7 trillion--that is a ``t''--in fuel costs.  The EPA's 2012 rule limiting the emissions of volatile organic compounds in natural gas production were calculated to create up to $19 million in cost savings in 2015 alone because of the value of the material recovered in the process of controlling emissions. Those benefits, however, did not inspire Mr.Pruitt to support them.  The list of health protections Mr.Pruitt does not support goes on and on. It includes health-based standards for fine particles or soot which will achieve between $3.7 billion and $9 billion in health benefits net of cost.  All of the rules I have mentioned are just a representative sample, nowhere near an exhaustive list.  When Mr.Pruitt declined to name a single environmental regulation he supported, he showed us how little he supports the central mission of the EPA, which is not to produce rules and regulations but to take action that creates health, environmental, and economic benefits for the American people.  Clearly, along with much of the rest of his record, Mr.Pruitt is declining to tell us he does support the health and environment protection EPA has established. It shows why he is not a suitable candidate to lead this He has shown throughout his career that he has a blatantly anti-environmental agenda, and this agenda threatens public health. He is not fit to lead this Agency--an Agency that he has sued every single chance he has gotten to block protections for clean air and water. I wonder why he does that. I wonder why.  Well, this might be a reason why. According to the National Institute on Money and State Politics--we accessed this in December of last year, just a few months ago--it appears that Mr.Pruitt has received over $314,000 from fossil fuel industries since 2002. According to them, Scott Pruitt has received a total of $314,996. He received $8,201 in 2002, $76,970 in 2006, $112,150 in 2010, and $117,775 in 2014.  It keeps growing and growing. I guess he is being rewarded by the fossil fuel industry for suing the EPA over and over. I can't imagine why they would continue to give him more money, other than the fact that he keeps suing the  He has used letters written by Devon Energy lawyers to send to the According to the New York Times, he sent a letter to the EPA from his own office that was written by lawyers of Devon Energy, one of Oklahoma's big oil and gas companies, and was brought to him by their chief lobbyist. Their chief lobbyist, Mr.William Whitsitt, at the time directed government relations for the company, and had presented a note to Mr.Pruitt's office. Mr.Pruitt had taken Devon's draft, copied it onto State government stationery with only a few word changes and sent it to Washington with the attorney general's signature.  I don't think that is acceptable, and I certainly don't think that it is a suitable way for someone who is going to head the EPA to conduct himself.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a January 17 letter from the African American environmental justice community leaders.

In December, the      National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a coalition of 40 of the      leading Latino organizations nationwide, voiced their      opposition to Mr.Pruitt's nomination.       Putting the EPA in Mr.Pruitt's hands will threaten our      children's health, turn back the clock on landmark efforts to      clean up our air, water and climate, and imperil the United      States' position as a global lead energy leader.  I am also deeply concerned that we are holding this vote so quickly, when not all of the evidence of Mr.Pruitt's activities has been brought to light.  The fact of the matter is that we are still waiting for almost 2,000 emails to be released from his time as the Oklahoma State attorney general. Only on Thursday afternoon was there a ruling that said those emails must be released. Yet we are going to hold a vote, and my colleagues will be forced to make a decision on behalf of the constituents of their great States based on incomplete information.  I don't understand the need to rush this. I don't understand why we would hold this vote so soon, so quickly, when there are other nominees for other positions in the President's Cabinet whom we could vote on, who do not have 2,000 hidden emails waiting to be released, waiting to be reviewed.  I served on the Benghazi Committee in the I have to tell you that one of the refrains I heard over and over from my Republican colleagues, Republican voices, was that they just wanted to pursue transparency, and they wanted to see all the emails, and yet the very same people who were so dogged not too long ago now don't care to look at any emails when it comes to Mr. Why is that? Why are we so eager to have this vote? Do you just want him to start dismantling the EPA that much sooner? Can't we wait a week? I think we are doing a disservice to the gentlemen and women who serve in this body. They deserve to have complete information before we hold this vote. I think those emails that would be disclosed deserve to be looked at. They deserve the light of day--transparency--so that we can continue to evaluate and truly have more complete information on Mr.Pruitt and his time as the Oklahoma State attorney general before we pass this vote.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a February 6 letter from nearly 500 former employees of the EPA to Leader  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 February 6, 2017.     Subject: Concerns about Scott Pruitt's qualifications to          serve as EPA     Mitch McConnell,     Washington,       Dear Senator McConnell and the U.Senate: We write as      former employees of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)      to share our concerns about Oklahoma Attorney General Scott      Pruitt's qualifications to serve as the next EPA      Administrator in light of his record in Our      perspective is not partisan. Having served under both      Republican and Democratic presidents, we recognize each new      Administration's right to pursue different policies within      the parameters of existing law and to ask Congress to change      the laws that protect public health and the environment as it      sees fit.       However, every EPA Administrator has a fundamental      obligation to act in the public's interest based on current      law and the best available science. Mr.Pruitt's record      raises serious questions about whose interests he has served      to date and whether he agrees with the longstanding tenets of      U.environmental law.       Our nation has made tremendous progress in ensuring that      every American has clean air to breathe, clean water to drink      and uncontaminated land on which to live, work and play.      Anyone who visits Beijing is reminded of what some cities in      the U.once looked like before we went to work as a people      to combat pollution. Much of EPA's work involves preserving      those gains, which should not be taken for granted. There are      also emerging new threats as well as serious gaps in our      environmental safety net, as the drinking water crisis in      Flint, Michigan, painfully demonstrates.       Our environmental laws are based on a partnership that      requires EPA to set national standards and gives states      latitude when implementing them so long as certain minimum      criteria are satisfied. This approach recognizes that      Americans have an equal right to clean air and water, no      matter where they live, and allows states to compete for      business without having to sacrifice public health or      environmental quality.       Our environmental laws include provisions directing EPA to      allow for a ``margin of safety'' when assessing risks, which      is intended to limit exposure to pollutants when it is      reasonable to expect they may harm the public health, even      when all the scientific evidence is not yet in. For example,      EPA's first Administrator, Bill Ruckelshaus, chose to limit      the amount of lead in gasoline before all doubt about its      harmfulness to public health was erased. His action spared      much of the harm that some countries still face as result of      the devastating effects of lead on human health. Similarly,      early action to reduce exposure to fine particle pollution      helped avoid thousands of premature deaths from heart and      lung disease. The magnitude and severity of those risks did      not become apparent until much later.       Mr.Pruitt's record and public statements strongly suggest      that he does not share the vision or agree with the      underlying principles of our environmental laws. Mr.Pruitt      has shown no interest in enforcing environmental laws, a      critically important function for While serving as      Oklahoma's top law enforcement officer, Mr.Pruitt issued      more than 50 press releases celebrating lawsuits to overturn      EPA standards to limit mercury emissions from power plants,      reduce smog levels in cities and regional haze in parks,      clean up the Chesapeake Bay and control greenhouse gas      emissions. In contrast, none of Mr.Pruitt's many press      releases refer to any action he has taken to enforce      environmental laws or to actually reduce pollution. This      track record likely reflects his disturbing decision to close      the environmental enforcement unit in his office while      establishing a new litigation team to challenge EPA and other      federal agencies.       He has claimed credit for an agreement to protect the      Illinois River that did little more than confirm phosphorus      limits established much earlier, while delaying their      enforcement another three years.       In a similar vein, Mr.Pruitt has gone to disturbing      lengths to advance the views and interests of business. For      example, he signed and sent a letter as Oklahoma Attorney      General criticizing EPA estimates of emissions from oil and      gas wells, without disclosing that it had been drafted in its      entirety by Devon He filed suit on behalf of Oklahoma      to block a California law requiring humane treatment of      poultry. The federal court dismissed the case after finding      that the lawsuit was brought not to benefit the citizens of      Oklahoma but a handful of large egg producers perfectly      capable of representing their own interests. To mount his      challenge to EPA's rule to reduce carbon pollution from power      plants, he took the unusual step of accepting free help from      a private law firm. By contrast, there is little or no      evidence of Mr.Pruitt taking initiative to protect and      advance public health and environmental protection in his      state. Mr.Pruitt's office has apparently acknowledged 3,000      emails and other documents reflecting communications with      certain oil and gas companies, but has yet to make any of      these available in response to a Freedom of Information Act      request filed more than two years ago.       Contrary to the cooperative federalism that he promotes,      Mr.Pruitt has suggested that EPA should refrain from trying      to control pollution that crosses state lines. For example,      he intervened to support a Farm Bureau lawsuit that would      have overturned a cooperative agreement between five states      and EPA to clean up the Chesapeake Bay (the court rejected      the challenge). When asked how a state can protect its      citizens from pollution that originates outside its borders,      Mr.Pruitt said in his Senate testimony that states should      resolve these disputes on their own, with EPA providing      ``informational'' support once an agreement is reached. But      the 1972 Clean Water Act directs EPA to review state water      quality plans, require any improvements needed to make waters      ``fishable and swimmable,'' and to review and approve plans      to limit pollutant loads to protect water quality. EPA's      power to set standards and limit pollution that crosses state      lines is exactly what ensures every American clean air and      water, and gives states the incentive to negotiate and      resolve transboundary disputes.       We are most concerned about Mr.Pruitt's reluctance to      accept and act on the strong scientific consensus on climate      change. Our country's own National Research Council, the      principal operating arm of the National Academies of Science      and Engineering, concluded in a 2010 report requested by      Congress that human activity is altering the climate to an      extent that poses grave risks to Americans' health and      welfare. More recent scientific data and analyses have only      confirmed the Council's conclusion and added to the urgency      of addressing the problem.       Despite this and other authoritative warnings about the      dangers of climate change, Mr.Pruitt persists in pointing to      uncertainty about the precise extent of humanity's      contribution to the problem as a basis for resisting taking      any regulatory action to help solve it. At his Senate      confirmation hearing, he stated that that ``science tells us      that the climate is changing, and that human activity in some      manner impacts[[Page S1328]]     that change. The ability to measure with precision the degree      and extent of that impact, and what to do about it, are      subject to continuing debate and dialogue, and well it should      be.'' This is a familiar dodge--emphasizing uncertainty about      the precise amount of humanity's contribution while ignoring      the broad scientific consensus that human activities are      largely responsible for dangerous warming of our planet and      that action is urgently needed before it is too late.       Mr.Pruitt's indulgence in this dodge raises the      fundamental question of whether he agrees with the      precautionary principle reflected in our nation's      environmental statutes. Faithful execution of our      environmental laws requires effectively combating climate      change to minimize its potentially catastrophic impacts      before it is too late.       The American people have been served by EPA Administrators,      Republicans and Democrats, who have embraced their      responsibility to protect public health and the environment.

I understand that what you said is what I read, that it was the fault of some government employee--perhaps of the I don't dispute that fact. If that is the case, then we have a responsibility to your State to make it whole again. And whoever the EPA Administrator is should face that responsibility. I will join you in that effort.  But to go from there to say Scott Pruitt is the man to head the EPA because he is going to acknowledge this one fact, is to ignore his record, to ignore his position on the environment.  The Senator from Colorado, I know has to leave the floor, but I want to continue on this vein. Yesterday, the President of the United States decided to sign a resolution. He had a big gathering. He had Senator McConnell, the Republican leader and other Members of the Senate and the It was a big celebration. Representatives of mining companies, coal companies, even mine workers were there celebrating the repeal of an EPA rule. What was the repeal of that rule? The repeal of that rule related to what the mining companies could dump into rivers and streams from their mining operations. What was the fear? The debris in toxic waste that they would dump in the rivers would end up killing rivers, just like the river that the Senator from Colorado has given a speech on.  I might add that he voted to repeal that rule. So now we have the President of the United States saying we are going to revitalize the mining economy by eliminating a rule that restricts mining companies from dumping debris and toxic waste into rivers and streams. Now, that doesn't follow.  If you are dedicated to keeping our rivers and streams healthy and pure and reliable sources for safe drinking water, you don't do what President Trump did yesterday. You don't do what the Republicans in the Senate did just a few days ago and remove this rule. I struggled to understand.  I see my friend from Delaware is here. The Senator and I have been in this business for a long time together. I won't say how many years.  He knows, I know, and some others know, but most people would be surprised of the following: Which President of the United States created the Environmental Protection Agency? Richard Milhous Nixon, 1970. A Republican President created this Agency which has become the bete noire for the Republicans--the most hated Federal agency, created by a Republican  Why? Because at that moment in time, America was awakening to Rachel Carson's ``Silent Spring'' and to so many other factors, when we finally concluded there was something we were doing to the environment that was harmful, not just to the environment but to the Earth, which we hoped to leave our children.  We joined together on a bipartisan basis--this is before I was in Congress--to create this Agency which Scott Pruitt seeks to lead. Now, what has happened? What has happened is there has been a role reversal here. The Republicans, who used to be part of environmental protection and safety, have now abandoned it.  In fact, that is the drum they beat on most often, when they talk about overregulation, the Environmental Protection Yesterday, this President--28 days into his Presidency--could not wait to sign a rule that allows mining companies to dump toxic waste and debris into rivers and streams. You know the argument: It is just too expensive not to. If we are going to make a profit, if we are going to employ people, then you have to let us dump this into the rivers and streams.  I don't buy it. The reason I don't buy it is that I can remember many years ago, the first time I went across my State of Illinois and took a look at abandoned mine lands. These were lands that were strip mined, which means they brought in bulldozers and really just found the coal deposits, not just that for below the surface of the land. They ripped out the coal and left the mess behind for future generations.  It was horrible--a horrible environmental disaster. They walked away from them after they made the money. They went out of business and left that mess behind for the next generation or the one beyond it.  I am all in favor of mining. Fundamentally, there is nothing wrong with it at all. But responsible mining means that you are responsible when it comes to the environment. You just don't make your money and leave, you accept the responsibility to leave behind something that is as good as or better than the way you found it. It is known as stewardship. It is  This is kind of a moral responsibility which we accept on this Earth that we live on, to leave it better than we found it. The Environmental Protection Agency is there for that purpose.  I would say to the Senator from Delaware, they did a survey in Chicago a few years ago. They asked the people of Chicago: What is the one thing unique and defining about that city? Overwhelmingly, the response was Lake Michigan, as it should be--this magnificent great lake which borders the city of  It is a source of so much fun and joy and aesthetic beauty. We look at it and thank the good Lord that we have the good fortune of living, as many of us do, part time, full time, right there on the banks of Lake  It was about 5 or 6 years ago that I heard a story about a ship on Lake It was an auto ferry. It took passengers and automobiles across that beautiful great lake. It moved them from Wisconsin to The name of the ship was the SS It had been around for decades. It was kind of an institution.  Come the summer months when people would cross that lake to head over to Michigan or back over to Wisconsin, they would pile on and bring on their automobiles and families. It was a great excursion. But we came to learn that there was another side to the story. The SS Badger was the last coal-fired auto ferry on the Great It burned coal to run the engine to move the ship across Lake  That, in and of itself, raises some interesting questions about pollution coming off the smokestack of the SS It turned out that wasn't the worst part. The worst part is that for decades, as the SS Badger trekked across Lake Michigan, it not only burned coal, it dumped the coal ash overboard while it was going across the lake.  This potentially dangerous and toxic coal ash was being dumped into Lake Michigan day after day after day. The Environmental Protection Agency came in and gave us the facts. It turned out that the auto ferry, that one ship, was the dirtiest ship on the Great It created more pollution, more damage to the Great Lakes and[[Page S1359]]its environment, than any other ship. Believe me, there are plenty of ships that traverse the Great This was the filthiest, dirtiest ship.  The EPA said to the SS Badger: We know you employ people. We know you perform an important function. But clean up your act. So what did the SS Badger do, in light of this EPA finding? Well, they fought them all the way. They came to Congress and asked that Congress designate the SS Badger as a historical monument. A historical monument? Well, it was an old ship. There is no doubt about it. But the notion that came from the Congressmen from Michigan and Wisconsin was, by designating it a historical monument, it would be exempt from environmental protection laws.  So the dirtiest ship--the SS Badger--on the Great Lakes would somehow have historical status and continue to pollute Lake I thought it was outrageous. A number of us joined in stopping that effort. Instead, we said to the EPA: You have given them years to clean it up. Now do something about it.  Next thing, surprisingly, the owner of the SS Badger asked to meet with me in my office. I said sure. He came in and he said: Senator, we employ 100 people. We have been doing this for years. We cannot technologically clean up the SS It just can't be done. We would lose too much money.  I said: I am sorry, but that is unacceptable. You cannot tell me that because of profitability you need to continue to create a bigger mess in the Great Lakes than any other ship on the Great  So he went back and lawyered up and decided he would fight the I stood with the EPA, the regional office out of We had a battle on our hands. A rule was issued by the  I hear so many Republicans come to the floor bemoaning rules and regulations. Let me join that chorus. Are there too many rules and regs in some areas? Are there some rules and regs which I could never explain or even try to defend?  But the rules and regulations of the EPA many times are critically important. In this case, that was exactly what we found. So the EPA issued a rule and regulation that said to the SS Badger: You have been given years to clean up, and you will not do it. So now the clock is ticking. There will come a moment when you will be subject to a substantial fine if you don't clean up your act.  Do you know what happened because of this onerous EPA regulation? Do you know what happened to the SS Badger, whose owner said that it was technologically impossible for them to clean up this mess? They came up with the most basic, simple solution. You wonder why they waited so long. They now hold the coal ash on the SS Badger as they go back and forth across Lake They remove it once they get to shore and put it into an environmentally acceptable waste disposal.  This was an obvious answer for decades, but they would not do it. It took the Environmental Protection Agency to step up and threaten it with a rule and a fine. Now they are finally doing it.  So I say to those who loathe government rules and regulations: This was a good one. For the health of the Great lakes, for God's gift to us of that beautiful body of water, we did the right thing and the EPA was there to do it.  Yesterday, when President Trump signed this new resolution that repealed the rule, he was reversing what I just described to you. He was saying to mining companies across the United States: Be my guest. Dump toxic waste and debris in our rivers and streams.  He did it in the name of job creation. We all want to create jobs, but if we are creating jobs at the expense of the health of rivers and lakes, if we are creating jobs at the expense of safe drinking water, that is a bargain I will not be part of.  Many times I have had a conversation with my wife and friends. I guess it reflects the fact that we have been on this Earth a little longer than some. You wonder out loud. You say: Why in the world do we have more autism today than we once had? Why do we have more cancers than we once had? People have a lot of theories. Some of them are wild and unfounded. But many times people say: Could it possibly be the chemicals in our drinking water? I do not know.  I am a liberal arts lawyer. Don't get me near a laboratory; I would not know what to do with it. But it is a legitimate question, whether there is some contamination in our drinking water, which has a public health impact. Someday we may discover that.  Isn't it best for us to err on the side of keeping our drinking water as safe and clean as possible? I think so. I don't want to turn on the tap and drink the water and think that I am making myself sicker or more susceptible to a disease. I sure as heck don't want to do it for my kids and grandkids. What Agency is responsible for that? It turns out to be the Environmental Protection That is the Agency that Scott Pruitt seeks to head.  He is a terrible choice. I am sorry to say that. I shook hands with him once. I don't know him very well. But when you look at what he has done--I think of a letter I received from Dale Bryson in I don't know him personally. He wrote to me and he said:       Having served under both Republican and Democratic      Presidents, we recognize each new administration's right to      pursue different policies or ask that Congress change the      laws that protect our environment. But EPA's administrator      must act in the public's interest and not simply advance the      agenda of any specific industry that EPA regulates.  Mr.Bryson goes on to say:       The agency is lucky to have had EPA administrators,      Republicans and Democrats, with the patience, skill and      commitment to public service that is needed to steer through      these challenges and deliver the clean and healthy      environment that Americans want at a price they are willing      to pay. We do not believe Scott Pruitt has demonstrated that      he has the qualities needed to lead the Environmental      Protection  He was not the only one who wrote to me. I have heard from constituents who believe that sensible environmental regulation is critical for us to have a clean planet to live on and leave to our kids.

He wrote to me and said:       I note our city, State and county have made some major      advances toward better infrastructure and policy for clean      water. However, we are still not meeting our obligations to      our neighbors and future generations by rising to the best      standards of water stewardship.

9171,topic-id,1100,"Mr.President, yesterday the President of the United States had a long and eventful press conference--77 minutes--talking about the issues before us in this country and his administration. He referred to his administration as ``a fine tuned machine.'' That was his 28th day in office.  I will observe the following: This so-called fine-tuned machine was forced to dismiss the Acting Attorney General of the United States in the first 3 weeks. This fine-tuned machine was reprimanded by three different Federal courts for an Executive order on immigration and refugees which they found to be inconsistent with the law and the Constitution of the United This so-called fine-tuned machine had to accept the resignation in the first 24 days of the National Security Advisor to the President of the United Mr.Trump is making history. No President has been through those experiences. I wouldn't say it is a fine-tuned machine; I would say it is a history-making machine. And sadly this fine-tuned machine, as he calls it, has had some rough spots. That is not all.  This issue about the Russian connection in President Trump's campaign is not going away. Seventeen different intelligence agencies have verified the fact that Vladimir Putin and the Russians expressly tried to invade on a cyber basis the United States of America and to influence the outcome of an election. And it wasn't an equal opportunity effort--they were there to elect Donald Trump and defeat Hillary  To make the record perfectly clear, as they say, there is no evidence that the Russians had any actual impact on the actual casting or counting of votes, but they did everything else they could dream of. They tried to invade and hack sources of files and information and to disclose and release them in a timely fashion.  There was that horrible episode involving ``Entertainment Weekly,'' or whatever the name of that operation was, where they had a recording of then-candidate Donald Trump saying some awful things. It was no coincidence that 2 hours after that recording was released, they started releasing John Podesta's emails and files--the Russians did--to try to resurrect the Trump campaign that hit some pretty[[Page S1362]]rocky shoals. So we know that happened.  We also know there was contact with General Flynn, the National Security Advisor to Donald Trump, prior to the President being sworn in. The extent of the contact, we don't know. The number of people in the Trump campaign who may or may not have had contact with the Russians, we don't know, but we do know this: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has an investigation underway into this very question because it raises some big issues.  This is the first time we know in the history of the United States that a foreign power has tried to invade our electoral process. And it isn't just a benign invasion; this is one of our major enemies when it comes to national security, and the reason is obvious. Travel to the Baltics, travel to Poland, travel to Ukraine, and talk to them about Vladimir He isn't this great hero, as President Trump has characterized him, from their point of view; he is a threat to their existence. They know what happened when the Soviet Union had the power. It controlled the It controlled It controlled They don't want to see that day return. They want the United States and NATO to stand up and help make sure they have a way to continue their democracy and continue making their own sovereign decisions. Meanwhile, our President of the United States, Donald Trump, is tossing political bouquets and sweet little kisses to Vladimir Putin and his Russian regime. Is this worth looking into? You bet it is.  This week we made a leap of faith right here in the We have decided to give to the Intelligence Committee of the Senate the authority to move forward on this investigation. I reluctantly agreed to that approach. I am skeptical. I will tell you why I am skeptical. I served on the Intelligence It is a critically important committee, but the Intelligence Committee, 95 percent of the time, meets behind closed doors in a secret space without a sign on the door, and the proceedings of the Intelligence Committee necessarily are secret. This is not an issue that should be kept secret. We need to make sure the American public understands in an independent and transparent way exactly what happened when it came to the Russian involvement in America's election, who was involved in the Trump campaign, if anyone. We need names, and we need people to be held responsible.  The second thing is, the Intelligence Committee--if and when it finally issues a report, that report is going to be classified to some extent. We have seen pages, I am sure, of redacted materials, big black lines and maybe one or two words emerging from a single page. Who decides to take away the black lines and tell the American people exactly what they found? The ultimate decision on declassifying documents in the Intelligence Committee is made by the White  So here is the White House, President Trump and his people under investigation by the Intelligence Committee, and they have the last word about what the American people will see. Isn't it interesting--when it came to the investigation of Benghazi with Hillary Clinton, when it came to the investigation of emails with Hillary Clinton, the Republicans couldn't wait to have week after week and month after month of public hearings. Now they want a secret hearing in the Senate Intelligence Committee and no hearing in the House Intelligence It is a big ``shrug your shoulders; boys will be boys'' moment for the Republicans in control of the It shouldn't be for the American people. The American people have a right to know what the Russians did, and they have a right to know if and when members of the Trump campaign or his close associates were engaged and involved in what he has dismissed as a ruse. Seventeen intelligence agencies don't dismiss it.  We need an independent, transparent investigation of what happened. The American people have a right to know. And we ought to say to this President: You may conceal your income tax returns, unlike any other Presidential candidate in modern memory, but you cannot conceal from the American people the facts as to whether the Russians were attempting a cyber attack on the United States during the course of our last election. That is too critical a question to ignore.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

9331,topic-id,441,"Mr.Chairman, our Founding Fathers intended for us to have a limited government. If they saw what we have today, they would be appalled. Our government has gotten huge. It is out of control, and an alphabet soup of government agencies and unelected bureaucrats are writing the laws. They call them regulations, but they have the effect of laws.  I am going to disagree with my friend and colleague from Tennessee, any power these agencies have to write regulations was delegated to We are pulling some of that power back, back to Congress, back to people elected by the people; in fact, to where the Founding Fathers put it in Article I of the  That is why I am here today, to support the REINS It says that if an agency enacts a regulation that has an economic impact of more than $100 million, that has to come back before Congress for a positive vote before it takes effect.  Now, quite frankly, because the Constitution vests all of the legislative power in Congress, I think every single regulation that one of these agencies does should have to come back before Congress, but the REINS Act is a great start.  Throughout President Obama's administration, a flood of regulations has put extreme pressure and burdens on American job creators and American families. Take, for example, the EPA's waters of the U.rule. It is a power grab by the EPA attempting to regulate any body of water on a private land basically that is any bigger than a bathtub. It goes way beyond what the Clean Water Act says they can do.  Using its new interpretation of WOTUS, the EPA has full authority to bully land-owning American citizens like Wyoming rancher Andy Johnson who got a permit from the State and local government to build a stock pond so his cattle could have something to drink. Well, guess what, the EPA said, nope. They came in after the fact and said: if you don't take that out, we are going to hit you with $37,500 a day in fines. Finally, after drawn-out litigation, the EPA was slapped back and Johnson's $16 million in fines was erased.  This is just one of the many examples of the huge power grab these Federal agencies are doing.  We need people who are elected and answerable to the American people writing the laws, not unelected bureaucrats. That is why we need the REINS Act, and that is why we need to restore the constitutional power granted to this body in Article The REINS Act is a great start, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

9179,topic-id,983,"Madam President, I rise today to voice my concerns about the nomination of Scott Pruitt for Administrator of the Environmental Protection  More than 74,000 Californians have contacted my office expressing serious concerns about Mr.Pruitt's nomination.  Californians want an EPA Administrator with a demonstrated commitment to protecting public health and the environment. Unfortunately, Mr.Pruitt's record shows the opposite: a clear hostility to public health and environmental protections at both the Federal and State level.  Californians rightfully fear that Mr.Pruitt's only plan for the EPA is to dismantle the Agency from within and give polluters free rein.  The EPA is the lead enforcement agency for bedrock environmental laws like the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Safe Drinking Water The EPA works with States, local communities and tribes to provide funding and expertise for fulfilling these environmental laws that keep our communities healthy and safe.  Based on his record as Attorney General of Oklahoma and his past statements, including in his confirmation hearing, Scott Pruitt is not the right man for this very important job.  As the Oklahoma Attorney General, Mr.Pruitt eliminated the State's environmental protection unit, which enforces State environmental laws, including suing polluters for criminal negligence.  Meanwhile, he's led or participated in over 14 partisan lawsuits against the EPA, challenging the Agency's ability to implement Federal environmental protections, lawsuits that challenged protections against mercury pollution, ``polluter pays'' clean-up requirements, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water  And his rhetoric matches his record. Mr.Pruitt has repeatedly questioned the validity of widely accepted science that undergirds EPA action. He routinely treats the scientific consensus on climate change as merely a debate. In an interview with Exploring Energy, Pruitt stated: ``There are scientists that agree, there are scientists that don't agree, to the extent of man's contribution and whether it is even harmful at this point.''[[Page S1370]]  He dismissed the dangers of mercury pollution, arguing in one of his lawsuits: ``The record does not support EPA's finding that mercury . . . poses public health hazards. . .''  At his confirmation hearing, when asked whether there is any level of lead exposure that is safe for children, he could only reply ``that is something that I have not reviewed nor know about.''  Even on his public profile, he described himself as ``a leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.''  We are supposed to trust someone to enforce our environmental laws who considers himself the primary foe of the EPA? That record is troubling enough, but Mr.Pruitt also faces many conflict of interest issues that he has refused to commit to recusing himself from as EPA Administrator, including: conflicts that would exist over ongoing lawsuits that he brought against the EPA as Oklahoma's Attorney General or matters or cases under the EPA's authority that involve organizations from which Pruitt has solicited campaign funding.  During his hearing, Mr.Pruitt deflected questions over potential conflicts of interest by stating the ``EPA ethics counsel will evaluate that if a matter or case comes up in the future.'' This is an inadequate protection against conflicts of interest.  The Environmental Protection Agency is very important to the health and well-being of the people of  For example, California received over $100 million in loans from the EPA last year to maintain and improve our water infrastructure, including wastewater treatment systems, drinking water systems, and water recycling facilities. Those funds were vital as our State grappled with an historic drought.  The EPA has also been a vital partner with California in developing stronger motor vehicle efficiency standards. One of my proudest accomplishments was enacting landmark fuel economy legislation, the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, which raised fuel economy standards to the maximum achievable rate. This law marked the largest increase in fuel efficiency in more than two decades and led to an administrative program expected to raise average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.  This program is the greatest tool we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, and it is working. An important technical review concluded this July that automakers are already exceeding Federal benchmarks for improved fuel economy by 1.4 miles per gallon.  A large part of its success is the cooperation between the Federal Government and California to establish a single, coordinated, national program that is strong enough to satisfy all parties and stable enough to guide investment decisions by the auto makers.  During his confirmation hearing, my colleague Senator Harris asked Mr.Pruitt directly if he would commit to upholding California's right to issue its own regulations, which is the way we participate in creating the national program. He declined, committing only to review the issue, which is not acceptable.  We in California know that climate change is real and is happening now. It is contributing to more volatile weather, including longer, stronger droughts and harsher bursts of rain.  We have a limited amount of time left to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of our transportation and energy systems. If we allow the world to warm by more than 2 degrees C, we will be locking in a future of unacceptable disasters for our children and grandchildren.  Now, more than ever, we need strong leadership as other major countries like China and India have begun to engage on the issue, and we cannot allow the EPA to reverse course and go backward after the progress we have made.  In his words and actions, Scott Pruitt has demonstrated more interest in fighting against the mission of the EPA than in fighting for it.  Mr.Pruitt has done little to nothing to protect the people of Oklahoma from the dangers and health problems caused by pollution, preferring to sue on behalf of corporate interests. There is nothing to suggest he would do anything different for the American people as EPA  For this reason and many more, I will vote against Scott Pruitt's confirmation to head the  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,1332,REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN NEED OF SCRUTINY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,16.0,February

9162,topic-id,1548,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to speak on the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, whom I intend to support.  Over the past several weeks, we heard a number of Senators come to the floor hour after hour, 24-hour sessions through the night--1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock--in the morning and beyond, to complain about this nominee or that nominee, to express their concern about this nominee or that nominee. In fact, many times I think the only reason there is opposition to a nominee is that they disagree with a nominee because it wasn't Hillary Clinton who made the nomination.  We have heard countless people come to the floor today to talk about their opposition to the Trump administration I have a picture on the floor that shows the Obama This is a river in Colorado, enjoyed by thousands of people each and every summer. This is a picture of that same river under the Obama This was caused by 800,000 pounds of mineral and other waste going into the river because of a mishandled EPA project. This wasn't Scott This wasn't Donald This was the Obama EPA that did this. I only wish that my colleagues who have come to the floor for the past several hours had shown similar outrage when the Obama EPA did this to Colorado--inflicted this kind of damage on people in Southwestern Colorado in the Gold King[[Page S1357]]Mine spill. You want to talk about protecting States? Why didn't we stand up and protect this river?  On August 5, 2015, the EPA caused this spill. They admit they caused this spill, dumping 3 million gallons of toxic waste into Cement Creek and into the Animas Most Americans remember seeing this river. Most Americans remember seeing pictures of what this river looked like across newspapers, across television stations in August of 2015. When I visited South Korea, the President of South Korea asked me: How is the river in Colorado that the EPA dumped toxic sludge into?  In fact, I saw this picture on the news just a couple of days ago. Somebody was using it to complain about the Trump EPA administration. Somebody was using it to attack Scott This picture had nothing to do with Scott This was the EPA led by Gina My response to the spill was that the EPA should be held accountable to the same level at which the EPA holds private businesses accountable. I think that is a pretty good standard. But if the EPA is going to make sure that somebody lives up to a standard, then the EPA should live up to the same standard--that basic standard for the EPA, because the Agency caused this spill, and it simply must apply the same requirements to itself that it does to a private company.  So it was with great disappointment, but very little surprise, that, when the EPA decided to not subject itself to those same standards, they walked away from the promises they made. Sure, the EPA had standards under Barack They were double standards. The Obama administration EPA's refusal to not receive and process the personal injury or economic loss claims arising out of this spill of the Gold King Mine in Southwest Colorado is appalling. I simply wish the outrage was there when the EPA walked away from the people that it had injured in We haven't heard talk about it here.  We have heard a lot of complaints here, but nobody is saying they should be paying for the damage in Colorado they created. After all, we are discussing the EPA, which with the strike of a pen, and oftentimes with very little input from those people who would be affected, uses overly burdensome regulations and a heavyhanded enforcement to punish private businesses.  Despite the assurances and promises of the then-EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy that the Agency takes full responsibility of the Gold King Mine spill, the Agency in 2017--weeks ago--turned its back on the promises it made and denied paying claims for the harm they caused Promises were broken to our neighbors downstream in New Mexico and Utah, including the Southern Ute Indian Tribe, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, and the Navajo  Administrator McCarthy called me last month, just before the news broke that the EPA would not be processing the claims of dozens of individuals and businesses in Southwest Colorado under the Federal Tort Claims Act against the Federal The spill occurred in August 2015. Over a year later, and in the waning days of the Obama administration, they turned their backs on their promises they made to Colorado and notified us in the waning hours of an administration saying: I am sorry. We are not going to help the individuals who are harmed. This refusal to compensate for the spill is unacceptable and wholly inconsistent with the EPA's commitment to take full responsibility with the States, local and tribal governments and communities.  This past election, voters said they wanted something different from the last 8 years in Washington because what they experienced was not working for the people--broken promise after broken promise. A year and a half ago, the EPA caused the Gold King Mine spill, and the past administration refused to make it right for The status quo at the EPA is not acceptable because broken promises are the status quo.  I have had earnest conversations with Mr.Pruitt over the past several weeks about my sincere disappointment about those broken promises, what we had to go through in Colorado, and what businesses had to go through in Colorado as a result of the EPA spill.  You can imagine that in an area that is reliant on tourism, what photographs of this in headlines across the country and in nightly news stories can do to a tourism-based economy. Those kayakers we saw in this chart had to shut the river down. Outfitters weren't allowed to be on the river. Dollars were lost because guides couldn't get out there. Booked trips that had already been paid for had been canceled. People didn't go because of the EPA's spill. The EPA's refusal to pay for lost property, lost economic opportunity, and lost business opportunity is simply unacceptable.  In the earnest conversations I have had with Scott Pruitt, he has promised to make it right. He has promised to stand up for the people in He has promised that he will make amends and pay for the damages that the Obama administration refused to pay for. He assured me that he is going to make it right, that he is going to work with the people the EPA injured and those who experienced economic losses and make sure that they are fully compensated. He agreed to come to Colorado shortly after his confirmation to make sure that the people of Colorado know that he will fulfill the promises that were failed under the Obama administration.  I would also like to talk about another top legislative priority of mine--passing Good Samaritan legislation. Good Samaritan legislation would allow Good Samaritans, like the mining industry, State agencies, local governments, nonprofits, and other groups the ability to clean up the environment and improve water quality conditions around abandoned mines. According to the Government Accountability Office, or the GAO, it is estimated that there are more than 160,000 abandoned hard-rock mines that exist across the United States, and at least 33,000 of these mines pose environmental or safety concerns.  One of the immediate actions we can do in Congress to address this toxic waste and improve our environment is to pass Good Samaritan legislation. It has been decades that this Congress has tried. It has been decades that this Congress has failed. It is time to start succeeding and time to start cleaning up the environment.  The last time the Environment and Public Works Committee was able to advance legislation on Good Samaritan was in 2006, from my predecessors, Senators Wayne Allard and Ken Unfortunately, since 2006, this concept has been unsuccessful and caught in partisan politics.  It is time to take steps forward for facilitating cleanup of the Nation's abandoned mines to prevent more spills like the Gold King  I have secured the commitment from Scott Pruitt to work with me on this legislation at the EPA to get this done, to work with both sides of the aisle to accomplish something, so that we can prevent this from happening. I am not going to stop working until our constituents are made whole from the EPA-caused spill at the Gold King I am not going to stop working until we pass--and we have to continue working to pass--the Good Samaritan legislation.  The 33,000 mines that pose a risk to the West is unacceptable. Our citizens, our pristine environment, our waterways, our children--this wasn't Scott This wasn't Donald This was an EPA under the previous administration, led by Gina McCarthy and President Obama, that walked away from the people of Colorado and the promises made. And it heartens me greatly to know, at least, that we have an administration that will move away from every promise abandoned to fulfilling the promises of protecting our environment.

9344,topic-id,480,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of the REINS Act, H.26, for any number of reasons.  I can't help but point out that I have heard my esteemed colleagues in opposition to this bill refer on multiple occasions to the Federal bureaucracy as a well-oiled machine. Mr.Chairman, there are, indeed, well-oiled machines that undergird this institution, but I would submit the Federal bureaucracy is not one of those.  We have heard that the regulatory burden, as it relates to the loss of jobs, is equal to a listeria outbreak. What I would submit is that if we could avoid a listeria outbreak, would we not choose to do just that?[[Page H130]]                                {time}  1530  While looking at the loss of jobs as related to Federal regulation, we overstep the argument by avoiding the jobs not created as a result of Federal regulations. Should these things also not be amongst the items that we consider?  A wise man once said that the bureaucracy will continue to expand to meet the expanding needs of the bureaucracy. In 2017, in the United States, indeed, it seems we find ourselves in that very situation.  Arguments that the REINS Act is contrary to the Constitution, I would submit, are actually 180 degrees from the truth. In fact, Article I of the Constitution gives the power to make law to this legislative branch of our government and gives the power to generate revenue, here, as well as spend.  The definition of ``law,'' according to the Oxford Dictionary, is: ``The system of rules which a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and which it may enforce by the imposition of penalties.''  I will submit that the very regulatory overreach that we consider here today is, in fact, tantamount to law and extraconstitutional in and of itself.  My esteemed colleague from Pennsylvania suggested, and I agree, that the REINS Act is but a good start. The power to spend is Article The power to make laws is Article  REINS is a rudder on the ship of constitutionality that will right that ship and move it only in the correct direction. Regulations that have the power to take liberty or property rights or the wealth of those earned by their own labor are tantamount to law and, indeed, extraordinary constitutionally as it relates to an executive branch entity, and they should not be exercised.  Mr.Chairman, we hear that the people's House is responsible for this and the people's House is responsible for that. Well, the people's House is to ensure that the people have a voice in the matters of spending and lawmaking that our Founders who laid out Article I of the Constitution envisioned, and currently, that is simply not the case. H.26 is simply a step back towards that right direction of constitutionality.  With that in mind, I strongly support the legislation.

9325,topic-id,606,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, regulatory reform plays a critical role in ensuring that our Nation finally achieves a full economic recovery and retains its competitive edge in the global marketplace. Congress must advance pro-growth policies that create jobs and restore economic prosperity for families and businesses across the Nation and make sure that any administration and its regulatory apparatus is held accountable to the American people.  America's small-business owners are suffocating under mountains of endlessly growing, bureaucratic red tape; and the uncertainty about the cost of upcoming regulations discourages employers from hiring new employees and expanding their businesses. Excessive regulation means higher prices, lower wages, fewer jobs, less economic growth, and a less competitive  Today, Americans face a burden of over $3 trillion per year from Federal taxation and regulation. In fact, our Federal regulatory burden is larger than the 2014 gross domestic product of all but the top eight countries in the world. That burden adds up to about $15,000 per American household--nearly 30 percent of average household income in 2015.  Everyone knows it has been this way for far too long; but the Obama administration, instead of fixing the problem, has known only one response: increase taxes, increase spending, and increase regulation. The results have painfully demonstrated a simple truth: America cannot tax, spend, and regulate its way to economic recovery, economic growth, and durable prosperity for the American people.  Consider just a few facts that reveal the economic weakness the Obama administration has produced. In the December 2016 jobs report, the number of unemployed workers, workers who can only find part-time jobs, and workers who are now only marginally attached to the labor force stood at 9.3 percent. They number 15 million America's labor force participation rate remains at lows not seen since the Carter administration, and median household income is still below the level achieved before the financial crisis, which is after the entirety of the Obama administration.  The contrast between America's current condition and the recovery Ronald Reagan achieved as President is particularly stark in that, 4\1/2\ years after a recession began in 1981, the Reagan administration, through policies opposite to those of the Obama administration's, had achieved a recovery that created 7.8 million more jobs than when the recession began. Real per capita gross domestic product rose by $3,091, and real median household income rose by 7.7 percent.  To truly fix America's problems, the REINS Act is one of the simplest, clearest, and most powerful measures we can adopt. The level of new major regulation from the Obama administration is without modern precedent. Testimony before the Judiciary Committee during recent Congresses has[[Page H125]]plainly shown the connection between skyrocketing levels of regulation and declining levels of jobs and growth.  The REINS Act responds by requiring an up-or-down vote by the people's representatives in Congress before any new major regulation, which is defined in the bill generally as a rule that has an effect on the economy of at least $100 million, can be imposed on our economy. It does not prohibit new major regulation. It simply establishes the principle: ``no major regulation without representation.''  The REINS Act provides Congress and, ultimately, the people with a much-needed tool to check the one-way cost ratchet that Washington's regulatory bureaucrats too often turn. During the 114th, 113th, and 112th Congresses, the REINS Act was passed multiple times by the full House of Representatives, each time with bipartisan support.

Doug Collins,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Collins: Serious regulatory reform is      needed to revitalize entrepreneurship, small business growth,      our economy, and quality job creation. Therefore, the Small      Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) strongly      supports the Regulations from the Executive In Need of      Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017.       U.entrepreneurship and startup activity are in a frail      state. While economic uncertainty and difficulties accessing      capital present barriers to new business formation, excessive      government regulation drives uncertainty and creates new      obstacles. When the policy ecosystem becomes noxious for      startups and small businesses, our entire economy suffers.      For existing businesses, overregulation is driving costs      higher and undermining confidence, investment and growth. The      system is out-of-control, and common sense tools and      solutions are needed to rein in the explosive growth of      federal red tape.       The REINS Act requires that Congress take an up-or-down      vote on every new major rule--defined as having an economic      impact of $100 million or more--before such a rule could be      enforced. This substantive regulatory reform measure would      serve as an important check on the regulatory system, and      have a positive effect in terms of how regulation affects      small businesses, and therefore, consumers, America's      workforce and the economy.       The REINS Act will bring needed accountability to our      nation's regulatory system, and SBE Council thanks you for      your leadership in spearheading this important legislative      effort.

To All Members of the House of       Dear Representative, The National Roofing Contractors      Association (NRCA) strongly supports the Regulations from the      Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act and urges you to      support this legislation when it comes to the House floor for      a vote.       Established in 1886, NRCA is one of the nation's oldest      trade associations and the voice of professional roofing      contractors worldwide. NRCA has about 3,500 contractors in      all 50 states who are typically small, privately held      companies with the average member employing 45 people and      attaining sales of about $4.5 million per year.       The roofing industry has faced an avalanche of new      regulations from numerous government agencies in recent      years. The cumulative burden of often counterproductive      regulations is highly disruptive to entrepreneurs who seek to      start or grow businesses that provide high-quality jobs. Most      important, federal agencies have failed to work with industry      representatives to provide greater flexibility for employers      in achieving regulatory goals and minimizing adverse impacts      on economic growth and job creation.       NRCA strongly supports regulatory reform to provide small      and midsized businesses with much-needed relief from      burdensome regulations, and the REINS Act is a key component      of regulatory relief. It would require Congress to approve,      with an up-or-down vote, any new major regulation issued by a      federal agency before the regulation would become effective.      Under the REINS Act, a major regulation is defined as any      rule that is estimated to have an economic impact of at least      $100 million on the private sector; would result in a major      increase in costs or prices; and would have significant      adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,      productivity or U.competitiveness.       NRCA believes the REINS Act, by requiring major regulations      undergo a vote in Congress to become effective, would      substantially increase accountability among federal agencies      seeking to issue new regulations. This legislation would help      provide employers in the roofing industry with the certainty      they need to invest in their businesses and create more jobs.       NRCA supports the REINS Act and urges you to vote for this      legislation in the If you have any questions or need      more information, please contact NRCA's Washington, D.C.,      office.                                                Dennis Conway,                               Commercial Roofers Inc., Las Vegas,     NRCA Chairman of the                                  ____                                               Associated Builders                                        and Contractors, Inc.,                                  Washington, DC, January 4, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of Associated Builders and      Contractors (ABC), a national construction industry trade      association with 70 chapters representing nearly 21,000      chapter members, I am writing in regard to the Regulations      from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017      (H.26) introduced by Doug Collins (R-GA) as well as      the Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2017 (H.21) introduced by      Darrell Issa (R-CA).       From 2009 to present, the federal government imposed nearly      $900 billion in regulatory costs on the American people which      requires billions of hours of paperwork. Many of these      regulations have been or will be imposed on the construction      industry. ABC is committed to reforming the broken federal      regulatory process and ensuring industry stakeholders' voices      are heard and rights are protected. ABC supports increased      transparency and opportunities for regulatory oversight by      Congress and ultimately, the American people.       The Obama administration issued numerous rulemakings that      detrimentally impact the construction industry. In some      cases, these regulations are based on conjecture and      speculation, lacking foundation in sound scientific analysis.      For the construction industry, unjustified and unnecessary      regulations translate to higher costs, which are then passed      along to the consumer or lead to construction projects being      priced out of the market. This chain reaction ultimately      results in fewer projects, and hinders businesses' ability to      hire and expand.       ABC members understand the value of standards and      regulations when they are based on solid evidence, with      appropriate consideration paid to implementation costs and      input from the business community. Federal agencies must be      held accountable for full compliance with existing rulemaking      statutes and requirements when promulgating regulations to      ensure they are necessary, current and cost-effective for      businesses to implement.       ABC opposes unnecessary, burdensome and costly regulations      resulting from the efforts of Washington bureaucrats who have      little accountability for their actions. H.26 will help to      bring greater accountability to the rulemaking process as it      would require any executive branch rule or regulation with an      annual economic impact of $100 million or more to come before      Congress for an up-or-down vote before being enacted.      Moreover, H.21 will further enhance congressional      oversight of the overreaching regulations often issued during      the final months of a president's term and help to revive the      division of powers.       Thank you for your attention on this important matter and      we urge the House to pass the Regulations from the Executive      in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2017 and Midnight Rules      Relief Act of 2017 when they come to the floor for a vote.

I offer this manager's amendment to assure that, just as the REINS Act strengthens Congress' check on rules that impose major new costs on the economy, it does not unduly delay the effectiveness of major new deregulatory actions, those that alleviate regulatory burdens of $100 million or more.  When first introduced in the 112th Congress, the REINS Act incorporated the definition of major rule in the underlying Congressional Review Act--generally, a rule that has ``an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more.''  This was done in the interest of consistency with prior terminology, and it[[Page H135]]swept in both actions that imposed costs and actions that lifted costs. But, especially after the regulatory onslaught we have witnessed during the Obama administration, it is time to revise that definition.  We should assure that the REINS Act focuses Congress' highest attention on the rules that hurt the economy the most: those that impose $100 million or more in costs per year. We should likewise make sure that the REINS Act does not impose additional hurdles in the way of the most important and desperately needed deregulatory actions: those that free the economy of $100 million or more in annual regulatory burdens. A deregulatory action with that level of economic effect is one that Congress should be encouraging, not slowing down.  This refinement of the REINS Act's major rule definition is also needed to assure consistency with the major Administrative Procedure Act reform legislation the House is due to consider next week, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. That measure already modernizes the major rule standard for APA purposes to $100 million or more in annual costs imposed on the economy. The REINS Act should mirror it.

9359,topic-id,524,"Mr.Chairman, for years my Republican friends have been trying to convince everyone that Federal agencies are scary and unpopular. In reality, Americans support Federal rules that protect them from injuries, diseases, and death. They always have and they always will. The people we represent don't want those rules to go away. They want stronger rules to protect their jobs, their pay, their health, and their fair treatment in the workplace.  Let's remember that it takes years to finalize most rules. Before an agency makes a rule, it considers science, costs, benefits, public stakeholder input, and public comments. Republicans have invented stories about surprise regulations that appear out of nowhere. These stories sound interesting until you realize they were invented to help their corporate friends get where they want. We know where this will lead us. Big banks got away with robbing us and creating a major recession because they weren't regulated strongly enough. Republicans think the answer is making it harder to regulate them.  If this bill passes, it won't be the nameless, faceless, unelected corporate CEOs who feel the pain. It will be the Americans from big cities and small towns who need Federal standards to keep their environment clean, to keep their workplace safe, and to make sure the products they buy won't hurt their families.  My Democratic colleagues are offering amendments today that exempt certain kinds of rules from the unrealistic burdens this bill creates. I support these amendments.  My amendment is a little different. It is not nearly enough to save this terrible bill, but it takes a big step in the right direction. It acknowledges that doing nothing carries a major cost.                              {time}  1600  It acknowledges human-caused climate change and requires agencies that propose regulations to report on how a rule impacts greenhouse gas emissions. If we require reporting a rule's costs, we should also report its impacts to our planet and to our way of life.  It also requires an analysis of a rule's impacts on low-income and rural communities. My Republican friends are deeply concerned about whether new regulations make big business and Wall Street investors happy. I think it is time we assess the impacts of regulations on the urban poor, the rural poor, or on coastal Native American tribes already fleeing the impacts of climate change, or the farmers in the West and South struggling to cope with drought, flooding, and extreme weather.[[Page H137]]  Finally, my amendment requires congressional approval of any regulation that would increase carbon pollution by 25,000 metric tons or more, or could increase cancer, birth defects, kidney disease, or cardiovascular or respiratory illness.  If House Republicans are so eager to rewrite the regulatory process, they should be willing to cast recorded votes allowing the release of tens of thousands of metric tons of pollution into our air. They should publicly vote to increase the rates of these terrible diseases among their constituents.  Passing this amendment is the very least we can do to make sure the bill doesn't put Americans at risk of injury and death.  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgH124.txt,1708,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,5.0,February

With that sweeping deregulation process that is being proposed by the majority, we have an exposure on issues of public health, clean air, clean water, and the regulations that are in place to protect the public health and the well-being of the American people.

9160,topic-id,3469,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to convey my wholehearted opposition to the nomination of Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the U.Environmental Protection Agency, the  The EPA, at its core, is an Agency established to protect the environment and the public health of our This Agency looks to establish policies and guidelines that would benefit all Americans--and in essence is not an Agency of partisanship. In fact, the EPA was created through legislation led by a Republican President, Richard Nixon, and enacted by a bipartisan Congress in 1970.  The EPA has a duty to protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the environment we hope to pass on to future generations. In accomplishing this mission, it enforces some of our most valued laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, which have been in effect for more than 30 years.  Unfortunately, this President asked the U.Senate to confirm a nominee who has dedicated his career to undermining the very Agency he is asked to lead. Mr.Pruitt's record and consistent failure to commit to being a fair Administrator of the EPA further demonstrates that the Trump administration's agenda is to weaken protections that guarantee every American access to clean air and clean water. From his actions as attorney general of Oklahoma up to his testimony at his hearing before the Environment and Public Works Committee, it is clear Mr.Pruitt is simply unqualified.  I express my strong concerns, as a Senator from California, a global leader in environmental protections that allow our 39 million residents to live healthy lives. It is my hope that with similar smart Federal regulations, which are led by the EPA, our Nation can enjoy these same benefits that I have seen Californians experience firsthand.  Californians have always been and will continue to be proud of our environmental leadership. In 1977, California passed the first energy efficiency standards in the country. Our friends from the States of Florida, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York quickly followed suit. This set a precedent. Federal officials agreed that having responsible renewable energy guidelines should be a priority.  Ten years later, the EPA implemented national standards across the United States, saving a tremendous amount of energy, sustaining our precious environment and resources for future generations, and providing financial benefits for families and households across the country.  To put it into perspective, one of the national energy standards for refrigerators--that was the result of a policy initially enacted in California--has saved more than 130,000 megawatts of electricity to date. This is equivalent to the production of energy that roughly 250 powerplants might produce. This example is not a rare occurrence. Energy policies have continued to be adopted from smart initiatives started in various  Starting as early as 1978, California passed an energy efficiency standard for newly constructed buildings. This standard is now adopted not only in our Nation but worldwide. The State legislature listened to the objective and factual data from scientists on the dangers of climate change and, as a result, passed the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which requires California to reduce its total greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. We created the California Cap-and-Trade Program, which implemented an innovative, market-based system to allow companies to continue to produce while also helping to reduce emissions; instituted a low-carbon fuel standard, which reduced the carbon intensity of all transportation fuels in We passed the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008, which urged local transportation planning agencies to consider the statewide greenhouse reduction standards and goals in their long-term transportation plan, and we set a renewable portfolio standard, which implored retail sellers of electricity to provide 33 percent of their electricity from renewable resources by 2020 and 50 percent by 2030.  We are proud indeed of what we have accomplished in California, but the importance of this issue goes beyond just the environment. It is an economic issue, and it has been undeniable in helping California grow to be the sixth largest economy in the world. California shows that a healthy environment and a healthy economy and the choice between the two is a false choice. We can have both. From 1990 to 2014, California's population and economy grew while achieving a 36-percent drop in emissions per gross domestic product. This clearly demonstrates that you can successfully have economic growth and reduce carbon intensity. The State has done a great job of creating employment through the promotion of clean energy technology and green economies. A report by the University of California Labor Center found that the California renewable portfolio standards contributed to the creation of 25,500 hours for what was referred to as ``blue-collar'' job opportunities and 7,200 hours of what was referred to as ``white-collar'' jobs.  Most importantly, the environmental laws that the EPA enforces protects the health of future generations. Science has shown that children living in communities with a higher concentration of particulate matter developed respiratory difficulties and those children living in regions with higher ozone levels were more likely to develop asthma and miss school.  This is only a small part of the impact that ignoring the protections of our environment can cause to the ones we love most. On that point, of children missing school because of health concerns, there is a significance to this because of a connection between what we need to do to educate our population and also what we see in the criminal justice system.  For example, it is well known and established the significance of a third grade reading level. By the end of the third grade, if the child is not at the third grade reading level, they literally drop off because, when we think about it, we know before third grade a child is learning how to read, and then comprehension kicks in, and they are reading to learn. If they have not learned how to read, they cannot read to learn and they drop off.  What is the connection between that and the concern we have about pollution in the air and water? Well, there is a connection between pollution in the air and asthma rates. Asthma causes children to miss school. What we know is that we have seen that an elementary school truant is three to four times more likely to be a high school dropout; 82 percent of the prisoners in the United States are high school dropouts; African-American men between the ages of 30 and 34, if he is a high school dropout, is two-thirds likely to be in jail, have been in jail, or dead. There is a real connection between elementary school truancy and what we see in public safety systems. What we also know is that it costs money when children miss school. It costs us money in terms of the money that schools miss out on because they are not being reimbursed for attendance every day. All of these issues are connected.  As a former attorney general, I have worked to enforce California's cutting-edge environmental laws. This is what an attorney general should do and is obligated to do as a representative of her Without reservation, I can say I am proud of the work of my office--of my former office, the California Department of Justice, and the work that is happening and has happened throughout the years doing the right thing for the people of the State and for the environment.[[Page S1355]]  In February of 2011, I filed an amicus brief in the Ninth Circuit Court to support the efforts of the Port of Los Angeles to reduce air pollution through its Clean Trucks In 2011, I had the pleasure of being a voice to protect an area of Southern California known as Mira Loma Village, a town of hard-working people, by representing them in a lawsuit to assure that a project would not significantly deteriorate the air quality in their community.  I had been hearing stories of the grandmothers in that community for years asking that they would be heard. I had been hearing for years, before I visited Mira Loma, about the fact that studies showed the children of that community had the lowest rate of lung development of any region in that part of There was a serious concern about the pollution in the air and the children of that community and their ability to be healthy.  So this is what we did and what I was able to do as the attorney general of the State that year. We met them with the developers in that community, we sat down, and we had some tough discussions, but we agreed that there had to be mitigation. They had to reduce the emissions in that community that resulted in the public health problems for that community. Two years later, that resulted in the city and the developer moving forward with the project while implementing measures to protect the residents from being exposed to diesel contamination. Litigation was critical. The role of the attorney general to be able to intervene and be a voice for that community and so many voiceless and vulnerable people was critical.  In June of 2014, as attorney general of California, I publicly opposed the lack of environmental review for the expansion of a Chevron refinery project in a place called Richmond, CA, and demanded they consider the public health of the nearby residents.  These are examples of the role and responsibility of a State attorney general to take seriously their oath in terms of protecting the health and welfare of the residents of their I offer these examples to further support the concerns we have that this nominee--when he has held such an important position and has taken an oath to represent the people--has failed to perform his duties. I would suggest that his past is prologue for the future. His past is an indication of what he will do if he is confirmed as the next head of the  I would hope that instead we would have a nominee--someone who would head these most important agencies in our government--who could say the same thing about their record as I am proud to say about the record of the California Department of  In my opinion, our current nominee cannot in good conscience speak to the same type of record. Instead, Mr.Pruitt has talked about how he wants to protect States from what he believes is ``overreach'' of the Federal His commitment to what he would call States' rights is so strident that a December 6, 2014, New York Times article reported that Mr.Pruitt has a painting in his office ``that shows local authorities with rifles at the ready confronting outsiders during the land rush era.'' He also established what he described and named as a Federalism Unit in the Oklahoma attorney general's office that was committed to fighting against Federal regulations. When he came before the Environment and Public Works Committee for his confirmation hearing, of which I am a Member, Mr.Pruitt stated that ``it is our state regulators who oftentimes best understand the local needs and uniqueness of our environmental challenges.'' He then went on to speak about how States ``possess the resources and the uniqueness of our environmental challenges.''  These statements might lead one to believe that Mr.Pruitt would be in support of any opportunity possible to give power back to the States to create environmental regulations. However, when I asked Mr.Pruitt at the committee, when he came before us, if he would commit then to upholding California's right to set its own vehicle emission standards, he would not commit to doing so.  I will remind this body that the EPA has a long tradition of respecting California's and other States' ability to set higher standards where they can control the emissions and the greenhouse gas emissions that as we have mentioned before, directly have an impact on the health and well-being of the residents of our State and particularly the children and the elderly of our  Under the Clean Air Act, California has set its own standards for how it wants to regulate vehicle emissions. We have done this for decades now, and previous EPA Administrators have upheld California's right to set them.  Although there is precedence for doing so, Mr.Pruitt would not commit to granting California the waiver to allow my State to continue to set its own vehicle emissions standards. This is simply unacceptable.  This is a blatant double standard for someone who claims to be committed to breaking down regulations at the Federal level and giving power back to the In fact, it makes me wonder how truly committed Mr.Pruitt is to States' rights or if States' rights are just a convenient argument for him in order to pursue actions that are beneficial to industries that pollute instead of the residents and the people of his State and, by extension, our country.  Just look at his record as attorney general of Oklahoma, a position he used to challenge the laws of other As attorney general, he challenged a California law when he joined a lawsuit that targeted a referendum that California's voters approved in 2008 to require more space in cages for egg-laying hens. That measure, California proposition 2, prohibited the confinement of hens used to produce eggs in California in any manner that does not allow them to turn around freely, lie down, stand up, and fully extend their limbs. The law is popular, and it was passed by the voters in my State by 63.5 percent. In 2010, the California Legislature expanded that law to make it so that it applied to all eggs sold in  Mr.Pruitt joined a lawsuit suing California over this law, presumably because he did not like that a regulation approved by our voters and affirmed by our State legislature would do a good job. He just didn't like it. Mr.Pruitt's case was ultimately rejected by the Federal appellate court because his lawsuit failed to demonstrate how the California law presented a harm to his You would think that a States' rights proponent would appreciate that one State passes a law and it should be respected, especially when it doesn't create any harm to his own State, but that was not the case.  Mr.Pruitt has filed seven lawsuits against the EPA that have since been settled. In those lawsuits, he opposed the Clean Power Plan and the Clean Water He sued over regulations to make electricity-generating powerplants install technology to curb air pollution. He sued over a plan to reduce pollution from coal-fired powerplants and a regulation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. He sued and filed a lawsuit that claimed that the EPA encourages environmental nonprofits to bring lawsuits.  It is important to know that Mr.Pruitt lost six out of those seven lawsuits. Mr.Pruitt is a baseball fan, as am I love my I find it hard to believe that my San Francisco Giants would look at a hitter who slogged through spring training with a .142 batting average and have no concerns whatsoever calling him up to the big league roster. Why does the U.Senate have a lower standard for reviewing a nominee who would be charged with safeguarding human health and our environment?  What about the opportunities Mr.Pruitt has had to defend the interests of the people he was elected to represent? What about issues that directly impact the people of Oklahoma?  In 2011, 49 States signed on to a $25 billion mortgage settlement. There was only one State's attorney general who decided not to sign on. I think you know where I am heading. That one attorney general was Scott Mr.Pruitt said he didn't think it was the appropriate role of the State attorney general to advocate for the homeowners of their States but wanted to be sure to protect the banks instead.  As a former State's attorney general, I am here to say that the role of an attorney general is to represent the people of your When an injustice is committed to one person, an injustice is committed to all of the residents of[[Page S1356]]your In fact, after doing the work of an attorney general over the course of 7 years in California, I will tell you that every time we filed a suit, that document, that complaint never read the name of the victim versus the name of the offender. It always read the people versus the offender because in our system of democracy and in our system of justice as a country, we have rightly said that a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. Mr.Pruitt has failed to appreciate the significance of that point.  He has developed a long list of lawsuits filed. Through all of that litigation, he has delivered very little for the people of Oklahoma--the very people who elected him to represent them. Why should we expect that he will protect the interests of all Americans and the environment we all share?  During his 6-year tenure as attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt stated only in one instance--a lawsuit against Mahard Egg Farm--could he recall initiating an independent lawsuit as attorney general against private air polluters. It was later revealed that even this claim was misleading, and it turned out it was his predecessor who had done the legwork and initiated the proceedings, along with the assistance of the  In the 2014 New York Times article, it was reported that Mr.Pruitt used his official position as Oklahoma attorney general to protect the interests of a private gas and petroleum company, Devon Energy, not the people of Using his official government position, Mr.Pruitt sent a three-page letter to the EPA stating that Devon Energy did not cause as much air pollution as was calculated by Federal regulators.  In open records of exchanged emails between Devon Energy and the Oklahoma attorney general's office, it was discovered that the lawyers at Devon Energy were the ones who actually drafted the letter and that Mr.Pruitt used a nearly identical letter to express it as his State's position. Following the letter, Devon Energy wrote to his office:       Outstanding! The timing of this letter is great given our      meeting with both the EPA and the White  ``Outstanding,'' the energy company said--not the people of the State of  It is also unclear how far this abuse of power has gone. A lawsuit by the Center for Media and Democracy has been filed in an Oklahoma district court to release information on Mr.Pruitt's dealings as attorney general. It is with great concern that we would try to rush this nomination without these records coming to light. Senators should have all the facts before us before we vote.  Should Mr.Pruitt be confirmed as EPA Administrator, I am deeply concerned that he has refused to use his discretion to recuse himself from litigation he was involved with in his role as Oklahoma attorney general unless required to do so by the Ethics  I asked him about this during our hearing at the Environment and Public Works I asked him if he would be willing to recuse himself notwithstanding a finding by the Ethics Commission but based on what is right and an appearance of conflict. He agreed, after many questions, that he has the discretion--regardless of action, regardless of waiting until the Ethics Commission rules--to recuse himself from those lawsuits that he as attorney general of Oklahoma brought against the Agency he wants to lead. He agreed he had the discretion and yet failed to agree that he would exercise that discretion and recuse himself because of an appearance of a conflict. That is simply unacceptable.  It is so important that in our government, the public has confidence in us, that they trust we will do the right thing, that they trust we will use our discretion in an appropriate way. But this is a nominee who has asked us to trust him to lead the EPA, the people's Agency that has been charged with protecting the resources that are vital for all human life. A nominee who has failed to represent his own constituents' interests by making a career of partisanship is not the right nominee for this office, period. He is a nominee who has lobbied for corporations instead of the people he was charged with representing. He is a nominee who has a clear record of using his position in a way that has not been in the best interest of the people he serves.  There is evidence, unfortunately, of his record that is before us as a body. We should take heed of this evidence. We should pay attention to it, and we should not confirm this nominee to be the next head of the  I yield the floor.

9275,topic-id,618,"Mr.Speaker, it may be Valentine's Day, but I rise today to share a story of a Christmas miracle.  Now, this is little Gracie, and she was born on Christmas Day in 2015. Unfortunately, not too long after she was born, she was diagnosed with a respiratory virus. It is a very bad thing for little people because they have little lungs and little respiratory airways. Frankly, it can be extremely dangerous.  To make matters worse, she was snowed in at the hospital where she was born. She had to spend 5 days at the NICU before they could transport her to a children's hospital. When she finally did arrive at Seattle Children's Hospital, she had pneumonia, coli, and a collapsed lung. But, fortunately, little Gracie is a fighter, as was her medical team, and she made a complete and full recovery.  With coverage through Medicaid, her parents were able to focus on her care and her future. The financial stress of hospital bills that come with intensive care, a cardiac catheter, a life flight, and numerous medications was daunting, but it was not devastating.  Gracie's story is just one example of the difference Medicaid expansion through the ACA has made for millions of children throughout our  Mr.Speaker, when I am home, I hear these stories all day long about how the ACA has made a real difference in the lives of people. The ACA in my State expanded coverage to more than 750,000 people. In fact, this January, we hit record enrollment of 225,000 sign-ups. That is a 13 percent jump from last year.  The ACA is working for many people across America; but let's be honest: we have also heard the other stories from people who aren't seeing these gains. Instead, they are seeing higher premiums and increased medical costs in general, with little improvement in coverage. Those are legitimate concerns that Congress needs to address.  But whenever Congress makes major changes, such as Social Security or Medicare, or enacts big ideas, there will always be unexpected results in parts of the program that don't function as anticipated or designed. Our job is to follow up, see what works, and adapt accordingly going forward. Even the best laws are going to require some adjustment.  Let's do that. Let's do it the smart way, the American way, and work together to fix the parts of the ACA that need fixing while maintaining that which works. Repeal and replace is not the answer. It is not the answer. Working together to fix it is the answer.  As we continue--or begin--to work together, I hope we will remember Gracie and know that health care is not a miracle.

9212,topic-id,1077,"Madam President, on August 5, 2015, 3 million gallons of acid mine drainage laden with heavy metals and other contaminants were released into Cement Creek by an Environmental Protection Agency contractor investigating contamination at the Gold King Mine in San Juan County,  Contaminated water flowed down Cement Creek, down the Animas River, and into the San Juan River, resulting in water use restrictions and emergency responses in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, the Southern Ute Reservation, and the Navajo We need only look at the photos of the bright orange water streaming through these various drainages to see how terrible this spill was for the affected communities and for water users. The Gold King Mine spill placed a heavy burden on States, tribes, local governments, and communities, and the spill hurt businesses, farmers, and ranchers throughout the region.  Since the spill, I have visited impacted residents and communities and worked closely with local, State, and tribal leaders to make sure water is monitored for contaminants, and costs from the spill are repaid.  Last year, I was proud to help pass a measure in Congress which will ensure that State and local and tribal governments will be fully reimbursed for their emergency response costs and which establishes a long-term water quality monitoring program in cooperation with local stakeholders.  However, on January 13 of this year, the EPA and Department of Justice issued an outrageous decision that the EPA is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for damages to water users caused by this Gold King Mine spill. This decision represents a broken promise from the EPA that it would fully address this environmental disaster.  Now, while the agency has taken steps is to clean up the mine, no farmer in New Mexico or on the Navajo Nation has received a dime of compensation, and distrust of the government has understandably deepened across the Four Corners region.  During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works last month, President Trump's nominee to run the EPA, Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt, said that he would review the Agency's decision not to make payments to claimants affected by this spill.  If he is confirmed as EPA Administrator, Mr.Pruitt must take immediate steps to restore trust among the people of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, the Southern Ute Tribe, and the Navajo Nation, who have already waited far too long for the EPA to keep its promise and compensate them for the harm that has been caused.  I will hold Mr.Pruitt accountable for cleaning up toxic, abandoned hard-rock mines in the West, such as Gold King, and I will hold him accountable for making sure the water that New Mexico communities and farmers rely on is safe.  We shouldn't wait for more disasters to strike. New Mexico communities deserve full and complete protection for their land, their water, and their livelihoods.  Unfortunately, I have real reason to doubt Mr.Pruitt will take this responsibility and core mission of the EPA seriously in his new role. As the attorney general of Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt has built a long track record that is antithetical to the EPA's core mission to keep our Nation's land, water, and air clean. Mr.Pruitt repeatedly fought against the EPA as it implemented measures to safeguard our clean air and clean water.  Rather than protecting the health of Oklahoma families, he has filed lawsuits against the EPA to stop rules that would have reduced smog and soot crossing State lines, protected against emissions of mercury, arsenic, acid gases, and other toxic pollutants from power plants, and improved air quality in national parks and wilderness areas.  Mr.Pruitt has shown little regard for the safety of our drinking water, filing a lawsuit to stop the EPA's clean water rule, which would protect the natural filtering system that supplies drinking water to one out of every three  Mr.Pruitt sent a letter to the EPA opposing even preliminary research into the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on our water resources. Mr.Pruitt has been a friend to polluters, helping them to use his office as a conduit for their special interests. He has sent letters on official letterhead to the EPA, the Department of the Interior, the Office of Management and Budget, and even to the President of the United States, copied and pasted nearly verbatim from language written by industry lobbyists.  Perhaps most damning of all, Mr.Pruitt has repeatedly denied the scientific consensus on the human influence on climate change, including in an op-ed recently published in May of last year. It takes a willful disregard for data-driven science to ignore the increase in extreme weather events that we are now seeing on a regular basis, thanks to climate change.  Just last Saturday in Mangum, OK, an all-time record of 99 degrees Fahrenheit was set on February 11. Imagine that; 99 degrees in the heart of winter. Folks, I wish I were making this up, but no snowball on the floor of the Senate can erase these facts.  It was Mr.Pruitt, the Attorney General of Oklahoma, who sued the EPA to prevent measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions, the very cause of climate change. Americans need a leader at the EPA who will take action on climate change, and we need someone who is guided in their decisions by the best available science.  I have heard from thousands of New Mexicans who have made a strong case that Mr.Pruitt is not the right person for this job. I will not vote to confirm Scott But I will say that if my colleagues move forward with this nomination, they can be sure that we will hold Mr.Pruitt accountable for decisions that hurt the health of New Mexico families. That includes making sure Mr.Pruitt rights the wrongs inflicted on communities in the Four Corners region by the Gold King Mine spill. It is going to take many years to clean up the legacy of 100 years of hard rock mining and the impacts on our watersheds in northwestern New Mexico and on the Navajo  In New Mexico, we have a saying: ``Water is life.'' The water we drink and the air we breathe are not negotiable.  My constituents in New Mexico cannot afford to see the EPA stop working to protect us from air pollution, to conserve our water resources, and to work to reverse the damaging effects of climate change.  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,1937,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,16.0,February
9189,topic-id,1110,"Madam President, no one wants to live on a dirty planet. Before we created the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, nearly 50 years ago, rivers actually caught fire from pollution, smog covered our cities, and powerplants spewed arsenic[[Page S1378]]and mercury into the sky with impunity.  In the years since, the EPA has been at the vanguard of the effort to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.  This work is not easy, and the person who leads the EPA has a tough job. It requires toughness and fortitude to fight back against polluters and special interests.  In all the years the EPA has been around, we would be hard-pressed to find someone more hostile to the Agency's fundamental mission or as less suited to leading it than Scott Pruitt is.  As Oklahoma's attorney general, Mr.Pruitt organized, led, or participated in virtually every challenge to the EPA's work during his time in office. His lawsuits have, among other things, sought to prevent the EPA from enforcing rules that keep our water safe, protect our air from harmful pollutants, like mercury and arsenic, and limit the carbon pollution that causes climate change.  These lawsuits beg the question: Does Scott Pruitt believe the EPA should even exist? In the weeks and months since he was nominated, Mr.Pruitt has gone out of his way to try and smooth over his record and say what he thinks we want to hear, but we can't fall for it.  Instead of listening to what he is saying now, let's examine more closely what he has done as Oklahoma's attorney general.  His record is troubling. Throughout his term of office, Mr.Pruitt has been very cozy with fossil fuel companies and affiliated interest groups.  A 2014 investigation by the New York Times revealed that energy lobbyists drafted letters for Mr.Pruitt to send on State stationary to the EPA against the Obama administration's environmental regulations.  The CEO of Continental Energy--an oil and gas company based in Oklahoma--served as the campaign chairman for his reelection bid. We just got word yesterday that a State district judge in Oklahoma ordered the attorney general's office to turn over as many as 3,000 documents related to Mr.Pruitt's communications with oil, gas, and coal groups during his time in office. Unfortunately, we will not get a chance to see what these documents reveal before voting on his confirmation.  Based on his record and associations, however, I think we can make an educated guess that these documents will reveal the extent of Mr.Pruitt's ties to fossil fuel interests, and we have no reason to believe he will renounce these connections if confirmed to serve as EPA  He also fought relentlessly against the EPA's efforts to establish basic limits on smog, arsenic, mercury, and other dangerous air pollutants.  Mr.Pruitt, for example, sued the EPA not once but twice to overturn the Mercury and Air Toxics These standards would prevent 40,000 pounds of mercury emissions every year and would help keep our food supply safe from contamination.  Mr.Pruitt has also repeatedly questioned whether climate change is real.  In an op-ed in the Washington Times, Mr.Pruitt refused to accept settled science that humans contribute to climate change. He said there are ``a wide range of viewpoints regarding the extent to which man contributes to climate change.''  In the National Review, Mr.Pruitt said ``scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming.''  The fact is, 97 percent of scientists agree that climate change is real and that human beings contribute to it. I hardly think 97 percent of scientists agreeing constitutes a wide range of viewpoints on climate change and the extent to which man contributes to it.  From his perch as Oklahoma's attorney general, Mr.Pruitt sued to prevent President Obama's Clean Power Plan to cut carbon emissions from taking effect. He argued that the Federal Government doesn't have the authority to regulate carbon emissions. This is wrong.  The Supreme Court ruled twice--first in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007 and again in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA in 2014--that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon emissions as pollution under the Clean Air  If confirmed, Mr.Pruitt has promised to kill the Clean Power Plan and undo much of the positive work that President Obama did to address climate change.  Mr.Pruitt also has a track record of undermining enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. Shortly after becoming Oklahoma's attorney general in 2010, Mr.Pruitt gave us a taste of what is to come at the EPA when he eliminated the Environmental Protection Unit within the Oklahoma attorney general's office.  For years, this unit investigated water contamination from refineries, lead paint waste, and illegal dumping. In its place, he created the innocuous sounding Federalism Unlike the unit he eliminated, whose mission was to protect the health and safety of Oklahomans, the Federalism Unit's job is to handle all of Mr.Pruitt's legal challenges against the Over the past 3 years, Mr.Pruitt has increased the budget of the Federalism Unit by over 700 percent, and the taxpayers of Oklahoma get to foot that bill.  Mr.Pruitt's record paints a clear picture: His priorities directly conflict with the EPA's mission to protect public health and the environment. He is much more concerned about protecting corporate interests than keeping our communities healthy and safe from pollution.  Over the past few months, I have heard from thousands of my constituents who have urged me to oppose Mr.Pruitt's nomination. I would like to read two of the letters I have received. Georgia is a Ph.student at the University of She wrote:       I strongly oppose Scott Pruitt's confirmation as EPA      Mr.Pruitt is a climate change denier who has      actively worked against the mission of the agency.  As a Ph.student in science, I know we need an EPA administrator that respects science and supports clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment. Pruitt is the wrong choice for our nation and must be rejected.  Keiko from Kaneohe also wrote to explain what this fight means to her.       This is not a bipartisan issue, but it is as much an      American issue as it is a Hawaiian issue, a human issue, and      an issue of all inhabitants of Papa, mother earth. I ask that      you continue to be vigilant and `onipa'a in the face of      climate change deniers . . . Mahalo for looking out for      everyone living today and going to be born tomorrow.

9425,topic-id,1406,"Mr.Speaker, the Republicans released a bill last night. That bill deals with every American's welfare--every American's welfare--every child's welfare in this country. None of them were able to testify before the committee, before the committee marks it up on None of them were able to come to that committee and say how it will affect them or their families or their fellow citizens. None of them were able to testify as to the benefits of the Affordable Care Act for them, their families, their children, and their neighbors. None of them will have been able to read and digest the bill.  Mr.Speaker, last night, after locking it away in a basement for days, and just as reporters were leaving to go home, Republicans released the text of their legislation to repeal the Affordable Care The country has been waiting for 7 years for the Republican replacement, for the Republican alternative, for the Republicans to redeem their promise of a better plan, a better way to ensure the security of having health care that is affordable and available to each American and to their families and their children.  Republicans have been promising, since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, that they would repeal it entirely and enact something better. They don't repeal it entirely, and they don't offer something better, something that covers more Americans and lowers costs to consumers. For 7 years, they have said we have a better plan. Last night, they revealed the inaccuracy of that representation; the bait-and-switch, if you will, of that representation; the pretense to their conservatives who have voted some 65 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act that they were not going to offer a bill that did that, notwithstanding the fact that they said that is what they are going to do.  The legislation they introduced would repeal, of course, some parts of the Affordable Care Act and replace them with policies that will take health coverage away, take health care away from millions of Americans and make millions of others pay more for less.  President Trump, just the other day from that rostrum, promised the American people that the Republican plan would ``have insurance for everybody.'' That was not true. Neither the House Republicans nor the Senate Republicans nor President Trump have offered such a plan, and the plan that was revealed last night does not fulfill that representation.  Mr.Speaker, it should not surprise us, however, that our President says things that prove to be not accurate. He also said from that rostrum that the policies would be far less expensive and far better than they are now. This bill does not do that, and the President has offered no bill that does that.  This plan fails that representation miserably. It increases healthcare costs for middle class families in order to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest, who don't need them to afford health care. We should not penalize people for becoming wealthy. We applaud their success. But we should not subsidize health care for those of us who can afford our health care while those who cannot are left to fend for themselves. In other words, the Republicans are once again saying you are on your own.  Their bill also raids the Medicare trust fund, threatening its long-term solvency. In fact, the affordable care added to the life expectancy of The bill that the Republicans have put forward imposes severe cuts to Medicaid as well. It forces States and healthcare providers to carry the burden of the uninsured while taking away funding for expanded  Their bill requires States to ration care by throwing those with preexisting conditions into ``sick pools,'' with higher premiums, higher deductibles, and waiting periods for coverage. And what services would be available under Medicaid?  Their plan replaces the individual responsibility requirement which, by the way, Mr.Speaker, as you may well know, was the proposal of The Heritage The Heritage Action for America, which is the political arm of the foundation, opposes the Republican bill. Not for the same reason I do, but because they believe it continues much of what ACA tried to do in protecting Americans in a plan that was initially proposed by The Heritage Foundation and adopted by Governor Romney in  Unbelievably, Mr.Speaker, Republicans won't even tell the American people how much this legislation will cost and what its impact will be on consumers' wallets and on our insurance markets. How do you do that? You have hearings, you listen to people, you listen to their experiences now, you listen to what their needs are, and you listen to those who have the greatest experience on their view of what the impact of this legislation will be. There have been no such hearings and none are planned.  Republicans know that millions of Americans will lose coverage under their legislation: those covered under Medicaid, the health insurance exchanges, and even those with employer-based insurance. That is why, Mr.Speaker, in my opinion, they are rushing to see this bill put in force before it is illuminated by the light of day and before the American people find out how they will be impacted.  Thankfully, Mr.Speaker, it will be difficult for House Republicans to enact their bill into law, not only because of the extreme opposition to those proposals by the American people, as we have seen in townhall meeting after townhall meeting after townhall meeting across this country, but also because the House and Senate Republicans are already rejecting it. It is not certain that House Republicans can even reach a majority in this House on their legislation.  The head of the Republican Study Committee, the largest group of Republicans, has said this bill is not acceptable. The gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.Meadows), the head of the Freedom Caucus, has said this bill does not repeal the Affordable Care Act, which is his objective and the objective of the Freedom Senator Cruz has said that as well. Senator Paul has said that as well. Senator Lee has said that as well.  One thing is clear, however, Mr.Speaker, House Republicans are going to have to find the votes on their own to dismantle the protections incorporated in the Affordable Care Act that the American people now have.  Is the Affordable Care Act perfect? It is not. Should we have spent the last 6[[Page H1544]]years trying to make it work as well as it possibly can? Yes, we should have. Were we able to do that? The only alternative the Republican Party offered to the American people and to this House was to repeal. Not to replace, not to repair, not to fix, not to make sure it was more affordable and more available to the American people so that we would be a healthier and stronger nation. Their only option was to repeal.                              {time}  1245  Mr.Speaker, I urge Republican leaders to withdraw this bill. Let us work together to ensure what almost every Member says they want, and that is a healthcare program in America that is affordable by all, available to all, and enjoyed by all. That is what President Trump said at that rostrum just days ago.  This bill that the Republicans are going to mark up on Wednesday does not do what they say or what President Trump said. The American people will oppose it, and we will reflect their opposition in this But we are available to our Republican colleagues in good faith to work together to ensure that what the President said--available to all, at a lower price, with everybody having access--we will support that bill, if it exists, and we will work with our Republican colleagues to pass it and give that protection and security to the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I note that there have not been many Republicans to speak this morning. I understand that one Republican spoke about this bill. I am amazed if they think this is a better way. I am amazed if they think this will do a better job than the Affordable Care I am amazed if they think they are going to bring costs down and care up, and that we don't have a lot of Republicans, Mr.Speaker, coming to this floor and claiming victory. They are not here because they can't claim that victory.  Let's reject this bill, Mr.Let's work together. We can do better. The American people expect us to do better.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-07-pt1-PgH1543-2.txt,566,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,7.0,March

While central New York happily celebrated Coach Boeheim's 1,000th win this past weekend, the occasion was not recognized by the NCAA due to arbitrarily harsh sanctions that followed an 8-year investigation that eliminated scholarship opportunities for students and that vacated Coach Boeheim of 108 wins.  While we cannot stand for impropriety in collegiate athletics, we must have transparency, consistency, and fairness from the NCAA--an organization that is charged with promoting higher education opportunities and protecting the welfare of students.

9172,topic-id,3938,"Madam President, I rise today in one sense as a former In looking at nominations of Cabinet members by the Executive, I start with a position of deference to the Executive because I think he or she should be able to choose the people who surround them and give them advice. I understand that. I did that as a Governor, and I understand that principle. Indeed, in the proceedings before this body thus far, I think I voted for 7 or 8 or perhaps 10 of the nominees for Cabinet members who advise the  But today we are considering a nominee who is hostile to the fundamental purpose of the Agency to which he is being appointed. We are appointing a person to be the head of an Agency that is called the Environmental Protection All you need to know about the mission of that Agency is contained in the name, the Environmental Protection Agency, and we are considering a nominee who has no record that I have been able to discover of protection of the environment. No history of actions on behalf of the environment, on behalf of the health and welfare and well-being of the citizens of his State or of the United  It is bizarre, to me, to be appointing people to an office where they are hostile to the mission of the office to which they are being appointed. In fact, not only has he no record of positive environment activity, his record is completely to the contrary where he has opposed activities of the Environmental Protection  As everybody knows, as attorney general of Oklahoma and leading other attorneys general around the country, he sued the Environmental Protection Agency numerous times; I think something like 20 times. And some of those rules--all of those rules were put into place to protect the health and well-being of the American people. There are several of them that I am particularly sensitive to.  When I was the Governor of Maine, we had an issue of air quality. We still do. The reason we have an air quality issue in Maine is because of the air that is coming in on the prevailing westerly winds from the rest of the country. At one point, we had a time where we did the calculations, and we could have taken every car off our highways, closed every one of our factories, and we still would have had air quality violations on the coast of Pollution doesn't respect borders. It doesn't respect State borders, and it doesn't respect international borders. That is why it has to be a national responsibility.  Of course, each State can also have, as we do in Maine, its own department of environmental quality, its own department of environmental protection. Each State could and should and will do that and has done that, but we also need to have national standards because otherwise the States will race to the bottom: How friendly are you to business? Come on in; we have no rules. This was realized almost 50 years ago by a Senator from Maine, a Senator whose seat I occupy, a Senator whose desk I have in my office, Edmund Edmund Muskie was the father of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, and he came from a State where this was not politically easy. The rivers in Maine had been grossly polluted by industrial waste. Yet he took the lead on this important issue.  Here is something extraordinary: The Clean Air Act, one of the most important environmental laws of the 20th century and very controversial, widespread impact around the country, passed this body unanimously. It is unbelievable looking back to that day. We couldn't pass the time of day unanimously in this body today, but there was bipartisan consensus that protecting the environment for ourselves and for the future of our citizens was not a political issue. It was an issue of responsibility. It was an ethical issue. And Ed Muskie, a giant in this body, created the groundwork and the legislative basis for the work we are still doing today.  In Muskie's time, the pollution was obvious. You could see it, and you could breathe it. I live on the Androscoggin River in Brunswick, and when I first went there 35 years ago,[[Page S1363]]you could smell the river in the spring. You could smell it. You knew it was spring; you could smell the foam and waste that was coming down the river. That is gone today because of the work of people like Ed  By the way, people like Howard Baker, Republicans--and in our State of Maine, the environmental movement was led by Republicans in those days. Hoddy Hildreth, David Huber, Ken McCloud, Harry Richardson--those are all prominent Republican leaders in our State who also led the environmental protection movement in our  As I said, it was easy. You could smell it; you could see it. The smog in Los Angeles was so bad that it was ridiculous, and it was unhealthful, so we took some steps that dealt with that.  We are facing an environmental threat today that is somewhat less visible--although I will argue that it is actually quite visible--but it is no less profound. In fact, I believe it is more dangerous, more threatening, more important to the future of this planet and our country and our people than those obvious threats that were faced back in 1970 and beyond.  Environmental protection, in my view, is a moral and an ethical issue; it is an intergenerational ethical issue; and it can all be summarized by what I call the main rototiller rule. The main rototiller rule goes like this: If you borrow your neighbor's rototiller in the spring in order to plow up your garden and get ready to plant, you have an obligation to return it to him in as good of shape as you got it and with a good tank of gas. That is all you need to know about environmental stewardship, because we have the planet on loan. We don't own it. We own it temporarily. We own plots of land temporarily, but we don't own the planet. We have it on loan from future generations--from our children and our grandchildren and seven generations hence. Yet our age, our generation, is acting like it is all ours, like everything is ours.  It took millions of years, for example, to create the fossil fuels that are underneath the The word ``fossil'' has a meaning. They are there because they are from fossils. It goes back literally millions of years for the Earth to distill the plant and animal matter into this miraculous substance called oil--millions of years. Yet we are using it up. Forget about the pollution for a moment; just think about the idea that we are using an asset that the Earth produced over millions of years, and in a matter of--I don't know--200 to 300 years, we are going to use it all. It is as if on Thanksgiving the turkey comes to the table, all of the family is sitting around, and Dad says: OK, I am going to eat this whole turkey. You don't get any.  What do we tell people when they look back on us in 20, 50, 100, 200 years? What are they going to think of our generation? What is our defense going to be?  We know it is not infinite. There is argument about how much is there, but it is not infinite. There is no machine in the center of the Earth that is creating these substances; therefore, we have a responsibility to future generations, as my friends in Maine would say, not to pig out on what we have and just forget about who comes next. Of course, as it becomes more rare, it will become more expensive, so we are passing those costs off as well. Beyond that is the environmental cost.  I mentioned the obvious environmental problems back in the seventies and eighties of when you could see the air, when you could smell the rivers, but today the problem is what we are doing to the planet, which is climate.  What bothers me about this nominee is he basically says: Well, it is a controversial issue. The sciences differ.  The science is clear.  Before I get to that, I have one more point about the ethical and moral responsibility.  Last year, we had Pope Francis here. Pope Francis has talked a great deal about this issue and the ethical and moral and, indeed, religious obligation we have to be good stewards of our environment and of our planet. People criticized the They said: Let the Pope stick to religion and stay away from science.  It turns out that the Pope is a chemist. That is an unfortunate fact.  When the Pope was here, I did a little act of Jesus in the Good Book and found a number of references to the responsibility we have to protect the environment and the land. Indeed, in the Old Testament--and we all know about the Sabbath, that on the seventh day, He rested. There is a provision in the Old Testament whereby every 7 years the people were instructed to let the land lie fallow for a year--a Sabbath for the land in order to preserve its productivity.  I believe this is fundamentally an ethical issue. What do we owe our children--to just forge ahead in the face of overwhelming science and all of the predictions? What is happening in the world around us is selfishness. It is unethical. It is wrong. It is unfair.  As I said, we are talking about a nominee for this body who says the debate about climate change is just that--it is a debate.       There are scientists that agree, and there are scientists      that don't agree to the extent of man's contribution and      whether it is even harmful at this point.  Give me a break. The scientific community is virtually unanimous, and, indeed, the data is unanimous.  I carry a little card around with me. This is a blowup of it. I am a visual person--I like to see things, and I understand them better. To me, this is what you need to know about what is going on.  By the way, what this is, is CO2 in the atmosphere, parts per million, for 800,000 years. People say: Well, it has varied over time. It goes up and down. It is just a natural cycle.  It does vary over time. Here is 850,000 years, and you can see that it varies from a low of about 180 parts per million up close to 300 parts per million, and that is the variation. Absolutely true. That is the variation until you get to about 1860, and that is when it starts to go up. Now we are at 400 parts per million, which is 25 percent higher than it has been in 5 million years. Was it a coincidence that it started to happen when we started to burn fossil fuels in such vast quantities? Of course not. Was there a big outburst of volcanos in the mid-1800s? Of course not.  This is not debatable. These are measurements. These are scientific measurements. Debating this is like debating that water boils at 212 degrees: Oh, no. I think it boils at 214 degrees.  It is 210.  It is 212.  Light travels at 186,000 miles a second. That is not debatable. Neither is this.  We are in a very dangerous place. Scott Pruitt calls it an argument and doesn't want to do anything about it. Not only does he not want to do anything about it, he wants to undo the things that have been done to try to protect us.  You can look at this chart and say CO2 is going up. It is invisible gas. You cannot taste it. You cannot smell it. It does not poison us. It is in the atmosphere anyway. Who cares? What difference does it make?  Here is what difference it makes. This is the other side of my little card. This is the correlation of over 800,000 years between temperature and Of what you can see, the blue is the CO2, and the temperature is red, and what you see is an almost exact correlation. It is beyond coincidence. When CO2 goes up, the temperature goes up. When CO2 goes down, the temperature goes down. You can see it over the time. Do you know where we are now in CO2? The correlation is unmistakable, it is powerful, and it is dangerous.  The nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency denies this. He says it is a debate. Just for a moment, let's take him at his word. Let's say it is a debate. Let's say it is not entirely settled. If the risk is so catastrophic, wouldn't it be prudent to try to take some measures to prevent it even if you are not sure? By the time we are sure--by the way, we are sure now. By the time Scott Pruitt is sure, it will be too late. It may already be too late. We may be beyond the tipping point, and all we can do is mitigate the danger, not stop it altogether, because we have been heedless of the consequences of the results that will impact the next generation of Americans and of people around the world.  What are the consequences going to be? What if it gets a little bit warmer? We will be able to play golf longer in Maine--hey, not bad--but the consequences in many cases are going to[[Page S1364]]be catastrophic. There are many already affecting Maine in terms of where our lobster population is moving.  I had a sea farmer in my office 2 days ago, a fellow who has a great business. He has grown it for years. It is really a serious business of growing oysters, and he has always grown them in the Damariscotta In fact, if you go to a fancy restaurant and ask for Damariscotta River oysters there, they are the top-level oysters in the world. He has always grown them in the river. He puts in the little seed. They start in little, tiny shells, and then they grow out. He can no longer grow them initially in the river because the water is so acidic from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is absorbed by the ocean, that the shells don't grow. He had to move the incubation part of his business onshore and treat the water to lower the acidity so that the shells will grow, and then when they get a certain size, he puts them back in the river.  This is a real, direct, obvious, observable effect of global climate change and of too much CO2 in the atmosphere. It is not theoretical. It is not debatable. It is not that scientists differ. This guy is trying to make a living, and he can only do it by treating the water because the acid that has been created by the ocean in its absorbing the CO2 is making it impossible for the oysters to develop. That is a direct impact. Probably the most direct impact we are going to be able to see and identify and not avoid is sea level rise.  Last summer--as a matter of fact, in August--I went to Let me just put that in context. It is the continent of The ice on Greenland, if and when it melts--and I think it is when, not if--will add 61 feet to the ocean depth. The ice in Antarctica has 212 feet of sea level rise contained in it. Just think about that for a minute. Greenland is melting at a rate no one has seen before. I saw it with my own eyes. I saw these big things in the ice. We helicoptered out over the ice sheet, and you could see these big holes in the ice called moulins. Into those moulins are flowing, rushing rivers of meltwater. You can see them. They are blue, and they run across the ice and down into the hole, and they go all the way down to the bottom, 2 miles thick, where they lubricate the space between the ice and the land and accelerate the ice in its moving toward the ocean. ``Accelerate.'' That is an important term. That is a term I heard at the University of Maine from their climate scientists. That is a term I have heard from scientists in other parts of the country. ``Accelerate.'' ``Abrupt.''  We all think of things changing very slowly; as a matter of fact, the very term glacial means ``moving slowly.'' Not anymore. We went to the Jakobshavn Glacier, the largest glacier that is draining the ice sheet of Greenland, and it has retreated as much in the past 10 years as in the prior 100 years. It has retreated as much in the past 10 years as in the prior 100 years. Do the math, and that is 10 times the rate that the ice is flowing off the Greenland ice sheet into the ocean and raising sea levels.  One of the problems with what is going on now is the process of acceleration. For example, everybody knows that the ice in the Arctic Ocean is disappearing at an unprecedented rate. A cruise ship went through the Arctic Ocean last summer. The Arctic Ocean has been closed throughout human history. It has been unavailable for commerce. You couldn't get through. It was always covered with ice. In the summer it would clear a little bit. Now we are talking about international trade through the Arctic  What happens, though, scientifically, when the sun's rays hit the ice and the snow, 85 percent of the energy of the sun is bounced back. That is science. When the ice is gone and the dark ocean is available, 85 percent of the sun's energy is absorbed into the ocean. That is called a feedback loop. That accelerates. The more it melts, the more it gets melted, and that is the kind of thing that is happening in Greenland, in Antarctica, and, indeed, all over the world.  Here is something I learned on my trip to Greenland that I really hadn't absorbed. If there is anything we think of as a constant, it is the ocean. You walk down to the beach in Maine or on to the dock in Portland, you look out, and you see it. There it is. It is the way it has always been. It turns out it has always been that way for only 8,000 years. It happens to have always been that way when people have been around and keeping records and taking pictures, but it hasn't always been that way.  Here is an amazing bit of science that, frankly, I wasn't aware of. This is the ocean depth 24,000 years ago. This is the ocean depth today. So 24,000 years ago, it was 390 feet shallower than it is today. It was 390 feet shallower 24,000 years ago. Why 24,000 years ago? Because all the water was locked up in the glaciers. In one sense, Greenland and Antarctica are the last remnants of the glaciers, and they are now melting.  This period, 24,000 years up to today, is how the oceans have risen. You can see coincidentally, it has been pretty fixed for 8,000 years, and that is why we think it is going to always be that way. I used to teach about the recency effect. All human beings tend to think that what happened last week is going to happen next week. But this tells us that the ocean level is variable.  Here is the amazing spot, right here. It is called the meltwater pulse 1A; all geologists know about this. And if you do the calculation on this period, the ocean gained about a foot a decade. It got deeper. The sea level rose about a foot a decade during this period, and this is what we are facing right now.  The best estimates I have been able to obtain are that we are facing about a foot to a foot and a half of sea level rise in the next 15 years, and a foot a decade thereafter for the rest of the century. If you do the math, that is an additional 6 to 8 feet.  In fact, there was an estimate just released last week that says it is more like 9 feet, 3 meters. Nine feet? Miami is gone; New Orleans, gone; New York, under deep threat; Bangladesh--we are talking about national security here because the people who are going to be pressed into migration because of this are going to create a national security and a migration crisis, the likes of which this country and the world has never seen. We are talking about 1 million or 2 million people out of Syria, and it has caused great uproar here and in The estimates are for the migration from climate change in the reasonably foreseeable future to be 200 million to 500 million people. Think of the national security implications of that.  And here we are debating a nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency who says: Well, it is debatable; maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  It is not debatable. This is happening. And for us to ignore it and to approve this nominee who is hostile, who has sued the Agency, and who has never done a thing in his life to protect the environment, is just outrageous. It is a dereliction of our responsibility, and we are going to look back on this moment and say: What were we thinking?  I understand that the President won. Elections have results. He can move in the direction he wants to on policy, but this is beyond policy. This is just fundamentally irresponsible to our children, to their children, and the future of this country.  So I hope, after this debate and after this discussion, the people of this body will come together--just as they did with the Secretary of Labor nominee, who really wasn't appropriate--and say the same thing.  Plus, finally--I will just note this as a parenthetical--there is the issue of the emails in and out of this fellow's office when he was attorney general that they have been hiding for 2\1/2\ years or 3 years that may well become available in a week. If I were someone contemplating voting for this fellow, I sure as heck would want to wait until I saw these emails because there may be things there that are going to be profoundly embarrassing, if not worse.  So there is no reason to move this nomination today, and there is no reason, in my view, to move this nomination at all.  I understand that the EPA can overreach--any agency can overreach--and there should be control on regulations. I have worked on regulatory reform since I have been here, but there is a difference between regulatory reform and a wrecking ball to the fundamental protections that have made so much difference to the people of this country.  So I hope we will consider the future in our vote today--not just ourselves,[[Page S1365]]not just the regulations, not just a few people who may be profiting by the exploitation of these resources, but think about our kids, our grandchildren, and our ultimate responsibility to this country.

9340,topic-id,268,"Mr.Chairman, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for his fine work on this important issue.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the REINS Act because it fulfills a promise Congress made to American businessowners to get onerous regulations off the backs of job creators.  It sets a very reasonable standard. If a new regulation has an economic impact of $100 million or more, it needs to come to Congress for an up-or-down vote. Congress will then have a say. We will debate the merits, and then we will decide.  The Obama administration handed down a record-breaking 600 major new regulations imposing hundreds of billions of dollars in costs on the U.economy and millions of hours of compliance busywork on the employers and employees across the country.  All of that excessive red tape places a huge burden on small- and medium-sized businesses that create jobs in New Jersey, the State I represent, and across the I have toured quite a few businesses, and the consensus is clear: let American workers innovate, build, and create, and not spend time complying with regulations that are impractical and often a waste of time and money.

Also, a joint resolution satisfies the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the  The REINS Act will bring an important check against out-of-control Federal regulations and foster stronger economic growth.

9178,topic-id,1884,"Madam President, today I must vote to oppose the confirmation of Scott Pruitt as the President's nominee for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, While I believe that the President enjoys some privilege of selecting administration officials, the views that Mr.Pruitt and I hold on a wide range of key environmental issues are completely irreconcilable. I was deeply disturbed by Mr.Pruitt's lack of specificity and his evasiveness during his hearing and in response to written questions.  While no one would expect Mr.Pruitt to detail the new Trump administration's policies on these complex issues, we do expect the nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency to share with us his own views on important matters, including whether there are any EPA regulations he supports, or whether he would fully recuse himself from making decisions in all legal cases in which he was an original party--but no. Instead, he testified that he had not conducted a comprehensive review of existing EPA regulations. With respect to recusals, he asserts that he would simply follow the recommendations of the EPA's ethics office. That is not good enough.  I am deeply disturbed by Mr.Pruitt's evasive responses. This does not bode well for his future interactions with Congress where he will certainly be required to appear before committees and provide testimony, briefing materials, and other information in a timely manner. Under oath before the Environment and Public Works Committee, he told the committee members, U.Senators, to go to the back of the line, to make records requests to his home State if they wanted information. This is information that Mr.Pruitt could and should have provided to the committee. As a result, information needed by the Senate to judge his fitness for this position has yet to be revealed.  Committee members were told 19 separate times to get the information they were requesting from his own office, the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office, an office that has more than a 2-year backlog for such requests. That is not the spirit of openness and transparency we expect and must demand from witnesses, let alone from nominees who come before the U.How can the Senate adequately fulfill its responsibility of advice and consent if nominees will not cooperate? Mr.Pruitt has stonewalled the committee and the entire Senate on answers to basic questions about possible conflicts of interest. He has refused to provide relevant emails and other documents. This is unacceptable. It is also unacceptable to advance and approve this nominee without a clear and complete view of his record and his close relationships with the very companies he will be tasked with regulating.  With respect to the Agency that he has been nominated to lead, it is imperative that we not reverse or halt the tremendous progress that has been made in achieving strong, scientifically based environmental protection goals. The EPA itself was born out of an environmental crisis in this country, in the wake of elevated awareness of and concern about pollution. This came after our Nation watched in horror as the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, OH, burst into flames again as it was so saturated with sewage and industrial waste that it oozed rather than flowed. That pollution was a byproduct of unchecked pollution from industrial wastes.  Over its 46 years, the EPA has made enormous progress and become one of the world's most successful protectors of public health and the environment. Americans now expect clean air and clean water, where, before the EPA was created, we expected nothing more than burning rivers and polluted air. While cleaning up the environment, we have also grown jobs and strengthened our economy. However, we continue to face an environmental crisis of our own making with climate change, and EPA's mission to protect public health and the environment reminds us that the tasks of this Agency are essential to every single Americans care about having clean air to breath, safe drinking water, and swimmable and fishable rivers and streams. They want their food to be free of pesticides and their workplaces to be healthy and safe. They want their children to have a future that is free of the dangers of climate change.  Sadly, Mr.Pruitt refuses to accept the scientific community's overwhelming consensus that unchecked increases in greenhouse gas emissions will have catastrophic effects. The science is crystal clear that the impacts of climate change will increase in frequency and scale. Even the Department of Defense recognizes that climate change will impact the complexity of future missions, including defense support to civil authorities, while at the same time undermining the capacity of our domestic installations to support training activities.  Climate change cannot be dismissed as merely a political issue. We need to address the unfettered release of carbon and other greenhouse gases and have a strong resilience strategy to address the plight of future generations and the hazards already plaguing this one; yet we continue to have political claims thrown about that the EPA's work to address climate change and limit carbon emissions is to blame for the decline in the coal industry. At their base, these are more ``alternative facts.'' This was confirmed yet again[[Page S1369]]this week as the owners of the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant in Arizona, voted to close the facility at the end of 2019. It was not EPA regulations or the Clean Power Plan that were cited as the reason for the closure of the coal-fired plant. No, it was the fact that, in a market that is saturated by cheap natural gas prices, the plant was no longer economical to operate. Attempts by the President and this nominee to spread alternative facts and to misleadingly promise to prop up an industry, by blaming action on climate change, is not the way to move our country forward and stimulate innovation that will create good, new American jobs that cannot be shipped overseas.  For the benefit of the Senate record on this nominee, I would like to take this opportunity to share some of the messages that I have received from thousands of Vermonters over the past few weeks about this nominee. One Vermonter from Norwich, VT, a student studying sustainability and environmental management, said she is fearful of Mr.Pruitt's focus on eliminating and defunding any programs that could help to stop climate change. She went on to describe the importance of peer-reviewed scientific research on climate change and how Federal support for our leading academic institutions to complete this research is in our national interest as we monitor the Earth's vital signs.  I also heard from a constituent from Essex Junction, Vermont, who shared with me how he has seen firsthand at his technology company how the Federal promotion of research and development has directly promoted innovation and technological change. This innovation and these technical advances have led to new technologies that have radically changed many aspects of our lives and have transformed our economy, creating jobs, and invigorating our entrepreneurial spirit. He was concerned that Mr.Pruitt would seek to dismantle work that the EPA has done to find better ways to solve environmental problems, from research and technology to regulation, community programs, and external partnerships as they work to find creative ways to achieve results.  I also heard from Vermont farmers like one in Bristol, VT, who shared with me how her family farm has experienced the firsthand chaotic effects of climate change and has responded to the call to be more resilient. She voiced her willingness to cooperate with government regulations to protect our air, water, and soil and that we ``need the EPA to use science and enforcement to lead the charge.'' She went on to say that the head of the EPA should be working to ensure that our air is clean to breathe and our water is safe to drink, not to ensure that polluters get a free pass. I agree wholeheartedly with her.  From rural Hartland, I heard from one Vermonter who said that ``the health and wellbeing of Americans must be a priority--not the wealth of a few corporations and the individuals that benefit from that wealth. America must be a global leader when it comes to addressing climate change if all nations are to take appropriate measures.''  As Vermont's ski resorts have enjoyed over ample snow in the last week, I have heard from hundreds of snow sport enthusiasts who are deeply worried about Mr.Pruitt leading the They know that climate change is a threat to our planet and to our economy. In recent years, we have seen abnormally high temperatures that severely hurt our ski and tourism industries in Many ski areas saw business down 20 percent, and some saw a drop of as much as 40 percent. This does not just affect our ski areas and our mountains, but also our restaurants, our local hotels, contractors, and countless other businesses that are driven by the vitality of our ski industry. For the State of Vermont, the revenue from ski slopes is an important part of our economy, and we need an EPA Administrator ready to tackle the problems of climate change, not one whose primary goal is supporting business as usual for the worst polluters.  I agree with the thousands of Vermonters who have contacted me concerned about this nominee. I believe that Mr.Pruitt's nomination sends exactly the wrong signal to the country and to the world as we are combatting the global impacts and causes of climate change. His nomination represents a massive shift away from putting public health and the environment first, and towards ``Polluters `R' Us''--the industries that directly benefit from being given free rein to pollute. His past conduct suggests that he will do everything he can to support those polluters and put their profits ahead of the public good.  The decisions made by the Administrator of the EPA affect the air we breathe, our scenic rivers, our precious resources, the water that our children drink, and the rate at which the United States contributes to the rapidly changing global climate. This appointee's work will have a long-term global impact and a major impact on all of our children and grandchildren and on our shared heritage and our natural legacy as  In my years in the U.Senate, I have evaluated many nominees and I have supported nominations from both Republican and Democratic Presidents, despite my reservations on some views they held. I have also opposed some nominees because their records were so clearly contrary to the public interest. Rarely have I seen a nominee so totally unqualified and so profoundly a threat to our environment. The views Mr.Pruitt and I hold on protecting Americans' health and our environment and addressing climate change are far too conflicting to allow me to support his nomination.  The Senate will confirm Mr.Of this, there is no question. But then we will begin our duty to provide dogged oversight of his actions at the Public trust and confidence demand the highest level of accountability to ensure the stewardship of our federal funds, to safeguard the integrity of the EPA, to base decisions on rigorous, fact-based, peer-reviewed science, for the protection of both public health and our environment.  I worry that confirming Mr.Pruitt will turn the Environmental Protection Agency into the ``Polluters Protection Agency.'' I cannot support his confirmation.

Places such as Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, where significant battles of America's Civil War took place, allow us to look back in time to get a glimpse of the events that shaped our It is extremely important that we understand our history; otherwise, we will be destined to repeat the mistakes of our past.  This bill, which passed the House unanimously last Congress, welcomes our next generation to engage in the eye-opening stories of our past. A recent study of American history education revealed that only 23 percent of college seniors could identify James Madison as the father of our Constitution; however, 98 percent of college graduates knew that Snoop Dogg was a rapper.  Mr.Speaker, it is now more important than ever to ensure that the generations following us have access to these historic sites and the educational opportunities they provide or we risk losing touch with our history. My bill simply allows Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park to acquire two pieces of property, through donation, that will add to the historic and educational value of this historic battlefield.  One of the properties this bill will preserve is a home that was built in 1853 by Mr.Josiah Mr.Wallis built this home for his family, but it was eventually used as a hospital by the Confederate Army during the Civil In 1864, the Wallis House fell into the hands of General William Sherman of the Union Army during his campaign to take  The house served as Sherman's headquarters during the Battle of Kolb's Farm, which was a resounding victory for the Union Army, but the victory was not without cost. When the smoke cleared, over 350 Union soldiers and over 1,000 Confederate soldiers lay dead.  Five days later, Union General Oliver Howard used the Wallis House as his headquarters and communications center during the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, one of the bloodiest 1-day battles of the entire war. This was also the last major battle before Atlanta fell to Union forces.  While the assault by General Sherman was a tactical failure costing the lives of over 3,000 of his men, the battle also inflicted heavy losses on the Having lost another 1,000 men, the Confederate Army could not stop General Sherman on his march to  Adjacent to the Wallis House is 8 acres of land known as Harriston This property offers a sweeping view of the valley leading to the Confederate line on top of Kennesaw Mountain and was used by the Union as signaling positions during the battle. This location is essential for park visitors to understand the strategic positions taken by the Union and Confederate flag Armies during the battle.  In addition to being critical sites in Civil War history, the Wallis House and Harriston Hill are two of the few original locations remaining from the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain associated with the Union Most of the park's current attractions correspond with Confederate history, and these additions will prove to be major historical acquisitions that will enhance the value of the park and provide insight into the Union's side of the story.  In 2002, the Cobb County Government purchased the Wallis House and Harriston Hill to prevent the house from being demolished. Since then, the county has been seeking to transfer the property to the park. My bill simply modifies the boundary of Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park to include the house and the hill and authorizes the park to acquire the property by donation.  Along with the Cobb County Government, this land transfer is supported by the National Park Service, Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, and several park volunteer organizations and historical societies in my district.  This legislation is an essential step toward preserving our Nation's heritage and a valuable part of Civil War history. The Wallis House and Harriston Hill will provide tremendous educational and historical value to Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, and it is my hope that the park will quickly acquire this property and restore it to its original condition for visitors to enjoy for generations to come.

9327,topic-id,505,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the REINS I would like to thank my colleague from Georgia (Mr.Collins) for taking charge of this bill in the 115th Congress and Judiciary Chairman Goodlatte for quickly bringing it to the floor.  This week and next, the primary focus of debate here in the House is the stranglehold of regulation on the economy and its intrusion into the everyday lives of These onerous burdens are well-known to Members of Congress on both sides.  Over the past several years, I have spent countless hours traveling across the nearly 6,600 square miles of my district. I have met with my constituents in their homes, in their workplaces and social halls. They have pleaded with me for release from the regulations that limit their ability to prosper, innovate, and grow.  Unlike the nameless, faceless, ever-growing bureaucracy here in Washington, we have listened to the people's concerns. We have made regulatory reform a priority and the focal point for jump-starting our economy. By placing final approval of major regulations in the hands of Congress, the REINS Act is an important launch point in our efforts to dismantle the administrative state and make government more accountable to the American people.  Our Founders vested in Congress--and Congress alone--the power to write the laws. Unfortunately, over our history, we have delegated much of that power away. The Founders could not have imagined our current scenario where the complaints of many fall on the deaf ears of an unelected few in  Thinking over the past 8 years, the REINS Act could have prevented numerous regulations that the American people knew were threats to their very way of life. Perhaps a trillion dollars in costs could have been avoided. I cannot even imagine how many jobs might have been saved or created if we avoided the regulatory barrage brought on by the Obama administration.  For example, we could have prevented the waters of the United States regulation that impacts the farmers near my home in rural The FCC's net neutrality rule might have been overturned, a classic rulemaking bait and switch where the FCC ignored the mountains of public comment to achieve its own political ends. An unaccountable sum of environmental regulations might have been avoided before destroying large swaths of our industry and imposing huge costs on taxpayers.  Our prime takeaway from these instances and others is that the runaway regulators issued wide-ranging and economy-destroying regulations with complete disregard for the hardworking American citizens whose livelihoods were at stake.  Today we take an important step to reassert the voice of the American people in our government. The REINS Act reestablishes the Congress as the final judge of whether or not any particular regulation actually does what the Congress meant it to do.  Returning this responsibility to the branch of government most attentive and accountable to the people adheres to the principles of our Nation's founding. It is an effort that all elected to Congress should support.

But do not be fooled. This amendment is not about reducing these maladies. It is about transferring the power to decide how best to do so from elected representatives to unaccountable bureaucrats.  For example, government could substantially reduce teenage mortality by barring teenage drivers off the road. Of course, there would be a substantial cost to that policy, and there are surely less burdensome ways to achieve the same reductions in mortality. The right decision requires a delicate balancing of interest. Agencies can provide valuable expertise, but, when there is a lot at stake, the ultimate decision on how best to strike that balance is properly made by elected officials accountable to the people.  That is the intuition behind the REINS Act and the fundamental point that is lost on those who oppose it.  Reducing the incidence of mortality and serious disease is a goal that all Members share.

9389,topic-id,320,"Mr.Chair, the amendment carves out of the REINS Act's congressional approval procedures regulations that attempt to improve employment, retention, and earnings, particularly for those with significant barriers to employment.  The danger in the amendment is the strong incentive it gives agencies to manipulate their analysis of a major regulation's jobs and wages impacts. Far too often, agencies will be tempted to shade the analysis to skirt the bill's congressional approval requirement.  In addition, regulations alleged to create new job prospects often do so by destroying real, existing jobs and creating new, hoped-for jobs associated with regulatory compliance. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act rules have shut down existing power plants all over the country, throwing myriads of workers out of work. EPA and OMB attempt to justify that with claims that more new green jobs have been created as a result.  In the end, this is just another way in which government picks the jobs winners and the jobs losers, and there is no guarantee that all of the new green jobs will ever actually exist.  The REINS Act is not intended to force any particular outcome. It does not choose between clean air and dirty air. It does not choose between new jobs and old jobs.  Instead, the REINS Act chooses between two ways of making laws. It chooses the way the Framers intended in which accountability for laws with major economic impact rests with It rejects the way Washington has operated for too long in which there is no accountability because decisions are made by unelected agency officials.

REINS Act supporters believe in nuclear safety. We want to guarantee that regulatory decisions that pertain to nuclear reactor safety are the best decisions that can be made.  That is precisely why I oppose the amendment.

All major regulations pertaining to nuclear reactor safety standards, whether they raise or lower standards, should fall within the REINS That way agencies with authority over nuclear reactor safety would know that Congress must approve their major regulations before they go into effect.

We all support pipeline safety and the prevention of harm from pipeline spills, but there is no assurance that the amendment would guarantee the achievement of those goals. On the contrary, the amendment would shield from congressional accountability procedures, regulations, that actually threaten to decrease safety. They also would shield from the bill's congressional approval requirements new, ideologically driven regulations intended to impede America's access to new sources of cheap, clean, and plentiful natural gas.

What we are talking about is public safety. I think what we need to do is look at what is going to benefit the public safety and what is going to protect people, lives, property, and the environment.

But please do not be fooled. This amendment is not about reducing these maladies. It is about transferring the power to decide how best to do so from elected Representatives, being House Members and Senators, to unaccountable bureaucrats.  Arriving at the right decision requires a delicate balancing of interests. Agencies can provide valuable expertise, but when there is a lot at stake, the ultimate decision on how best to strike that balance is properly made by elected officials accountable to the people. That is the intuition behind the REINS Act and the fundamental point that is lost on its opponents.  Preventing workplace injury is a goal all Members share. This bill does not frustrate that goal.

9182,topic-id,2069,"Madam President, I rise today in strong opposition to the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be the Admininstrator of the Environmental Protection  When looking at Mr.Pruitt's record on environmental issues, it is almost hard to know where to start.  You could examine his history of climate denial, in which he has repeatedly rejected the scientific consensus on the threat of climate change.  You could look at his cozy relationship with the oil and gas industry during his tenure as attorney general of  You could argue that Scott Pruitt represents the same corporate interests and crony capitalism that have long prevailed inside the  You could discuss his refusal to answer basic questions from the Environment and Public Works Committee, even as he asks those same Senators to vote for his confirmation.  Any one of these items should be disqualifying for a candidate tasked with leading the EPA, but the list of problems with Mr.Pruitt's nomination goes even beyond those concerns.  His nomination threatens the very foundations of the department he has been tasked with leading--whether you are talking about the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Superfund Program, or any of the other cornerstone environmental protections Americans have long enjoyed.  Scott Pruitt has made a career out of characterizing these environmental protections as red-tape, as job-killers, and as government overreach.  That might be good rhetoric when you are arguing on the side of corporate polluters, as Mr.Pruitt has spent his career doing.  It might be good rhetoric when you are trying to mask the significant benefits of the laws you are fighting to unravel.  It might be good rhetoric, but it is not reality. The reality is that our Nation's environmental laws are designed to provide basic protections for human health and quality of life.[[Page S1373]]  But that fact is often obscured by the rhetoric that Mr.Pruitt peddles. And since the EPA and many of its foundational laws were created decades ago, it can be easy to forget what the world looked like before we had strong environmental protections.  So before we confirm an EPA Administrator intent on dismantling every one of those protections, let's do a quick history lesson.  Democrat, Republican, or Independent, one thing that Americans agree on is the need for clean water. In fact, according to a 2016 Gallup poll, 61 percent of all Americans are ``a great deal'' worried--not a little worried, but a great deal worried--about pollution of drinking water, and 56 percent of all Americans are ``a great deal'' worried--again, a great deal worried--about the pollution of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs.  Among hunters and anglers, a group that many of my friends across the aisle claim to champion, those numbers are even more dramatic. A 2015 poll found that nearly 90 percent thought that the Clean Water Act was a good thing, and 75 percent supported the application of the Clean Water Act to headwater streams and wetlands.  Now, at a time when a strong majority of Americans are so concerned about the quality of their drinking water and the cleanliness of waterways across the country and support the application and enforcement of the Clean Water Act, it seems that we should be working to strengthen the protections that keep our water clean.  But that is not what Scott Pruitt has done, and it is not what he will do if we allow him to become the Administrator of the No, instead Scott Pruitt has worked tirelessly to gut the Clean Water  His lawsuits have sought to undermine the fundamental protections afforded to our waterways to the detriment of the health of our families and our environment.  He has sued to prevent the Clean Water Rule, a court-ordered clarification of the protections of the Clean Water Act, from going into effect.  He has joined lawsuits and filed briefs to make it easier for mining companies to dump waste and fill material anywhere they want, destroying mountain streams and negatively impacting water quality.  Scott Pruitt didn't feel that the EPA should even have the authority to conduct a survey about industrial farming practices that can generate toxic runoff that could find its way into our rivers and streams and drinking water resources.  He has even joined big polluters in a lawsuit against a collaborative effort by Chesapeake Bay States and the EPA to clean up the bay, despite the fact that it had nothing to do with  I think that Mr.Pruitt's views can best be summed up in his own words. He claims that, ``the EPA was never intended to be our Nation's frontline environmental regulator.''  Well, I have news for Scott When the EPA doesn't lead, cost-cutting measures undertaken by a State can lead to thousands of Americans being poisoned by lead in their water. When the EPA doesn't lead, polluters, blinded by the pursuit of profit above all else, can dump unlimited and unregulated amounts of pollution into our water.  This isn't speculation. We have seen it before. The Clean Water Act was passed in 1972 in large part due to public outrage after the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969. Yes, the river caught fire. This sounds outlandish and incredible to us today, but perhaps even more astounding is the fact that this was not necessarily abnormal. It wasn't the result of some single incident or accidental spill. This was the result of years of pollution and unsound practices employed by many different industries across the economic spectrum.  The Washington Post notes that the Cuyahoga burned at least 13 times, and that is just one river. River fires were recorded in Maryland, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, and other States as well. So it becomes clear that this was a pervasive problem, and a national problem, and a problem that had to be addressed on the national level. And we did address it largely through the Clean Water Act, but we have to continue that progress, not roll it back. Even now, in places like China, where strong federal clean water laws don't exist, these river fires still occur.  Scott Pruitt calls himself an ``advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.''  If fighting for clean water is an activist agenda; if enforcing sound environmental practices that safeguard public health is an activist agenda; if protecting wetlands that not only provide critical wildlife habitat, but also act as vital buffers that protect our communities from flooding, is an activist agenda; well, then I guess you can call me an activist, and his record has shown that Scott Pruitt is anything but. And his attacks on the Clean Water Act aren't unique. Mr.Pruitt has sued the EPA time and again in an effort to dismantle the Clean Air  The Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970, at a time that many of our Nation's cities and industrial regions were blanketed in smog. In the 47 years since the passage of the law, the Clean Air Act has proven to be one of the most effective public health measures ever taken in this country. Under the Clean Air Act, we have achieved 70 percent reductions in the levels of six of the most dangerous air pollutants.  Under the Clean Air Act, new heavy-duty trucks and buses became 99 percent cleaner than those vehicles were in the 1970s. Under the Clean Air Act, lead was banned from gasoline, ending a significant health risk--one that was particularly dangerous for children. It was the Clean Air Act that gave us the tools to drastically cut the pollutants that cause acid rain. The Clean Air Act helps to protect downwind States like New Jersey from pollution emitted by power plants in other The Clean Air Act has been used to phase out pollutants that destroy the ozone layer, yielding significant health benefits including a reduction in skin cancer. The Clean Air Act has been used to reduce mercury from power plants, preventing tens of thousands of premature deaths, heart attacks, and asthma attacks. The Clean Air Act has helped reduce pollution at our National Parks, supporting tourism and local economies across the country. And in 2007, the Supreme Court affirmed the Clean Air Act's role in the environmental crisis of our time, the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect against the threat of climate change.  It is worth noting that, since the Clean Air Act became law, the Nation's gross domestic product grew by 246 percent--so much for job-killing regulations.  But in spite of these benefits, benefits that accrue to every American and benefits that save lives and reduce disease, Scott Pruitt has a record a mile long trying to dismantle the Clean Air  He sued the EPA over cross-state air pollution rules. He sued the EPA over mercury and air toxin limits. He sued the EPA when they tried to reduce smog. He sued the EPA when they limited pollution in national parks. And he sued the EPA when they proposed limiting carbon pollution from power plants.  Mr.Pruitt's record has repeatedly demonstrated that he has no interest in maintaining basic environmental standards. I have no reason to believe that he would behave any differently if confirmed as EPA But Scott Pruitt's disdain for the EPA goes beyond even the lawsuits he filed.  In questions for the record for the Environment and Public Works Committee, Mr.Pruitt was asked to name even one EPA regulation he supported and he couldn't name even one.  He wasn't put on the spot. These were written questions, which Mr.Pruitt had ample time to consider and answer. And yet he couldn't produce a single example of an EPA standard he supported.  An EPA standard that immediately comes to my mind is Superfund--a bipartisan program committed to ensuring that polluters pay to clean up their toxic dump sites.  New Jersey has the most Superfund sites of any State in the Nation--114 total. These sites threaten public health, stifle economic opportunity, and undermine quality of life.  They are a toxic legacy from a time when we had no watchdog to prevent corporations from dumping their waste into our soil or our water.  Today there are over 1,300 Superfund sites throughout the Nation--13 sites in[[Page S1374]]Alabama, 37 sites in Wisconsin, 53 sites in Florida, and even 7 sites in Oklahoma, Mr.Pruitt's home  This is a problem that transcends geographic and partisan divides. It is a challenge we should be united in our commitment to fixing. Yet Mr.Pruitt wouldn't even cite Superfund as an example of an EPA regulation he supported. If he doesn't support the program, how can we trust him to implement it?  EPA is absolutely critical in bringing the companies responsible for pollution to the table, creating strategies for cleaning up these sites, and overseeing the clean-ups themselves.  How can we trust Mr.Pruitt to negotiate on behalf of our communities if he can't even bring himself to admit the value of the law?  The fact that a program as basic and bipartisan as Superfund didn't garner Scott Pruitt's support should be of concern to us all.  The U.has many environmental challenges left to confront, but we have also made a lot of progress since the days before we had strong environmental protections.  We can't turn back the clock to the days when rivers caught on fire, when smog choked our cities, and when corporations were free to dump unlimited chemicals into the soil and water. Yet, that is exactly what Scott Pruitt has spent his career doing. His tenure as Oklahoma Attorney General provides example after example of legal actions taken on behalf of moneyed corporate polluters, but he failed to provide even one real example of action he took against polluters on behalf of the people of  I take my responsibility to provide advice and consent to the President on his nominees very seriously, and as I have looked into Mr.Pruitt's record, one thing has become abundantly clear. Scott Pruitt doesn't work for you. He works for the polluting industries that have bankrolled his political career. His nomination to head the EPA poses significant risk to our Nation's most basic environmental protections.  Protections like the Superfund program, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act have provided a legacy of health and wellness for millions of And time and time again, Mr.Pruitt has proven untrustworthy as a protector of that legacy.  For that reason, I oppose his nomination as Administrator of the EPA and urge my colleagues to do the same.

Two years ago, the Center for Media and Democracy requested these emails through the Oklahoma Open Records Who is the person who decides whether to release those records? The attorney general of Who is the nominee before us? The attorney general of  When Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee requested these records from Mr.Pruitt during the confirmation process, the answer we got back was this: ``I would direct you to make a request of the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office under the Oklahoma Open Records Act.'' Now, when he encouraged us to make that request, he knew--and we shortly knew--that he had no intention of actually granting access. He was telling us to get in line behind more than 50 other requests for that information, and that request has not yet been answered. In fact, Senator Whitehouse did put in a request directly to the Oklahoma attorney general's office using the Oklahoma Open Records Imagine what the result was. Did the attorney general of Oklahoma immediately release these records? He did not. Have we those records today? We do not.  But yesterday, Oklahoma County District Judge Aletia Haynes Timmons ruled on whether or not the public deserves access to these emails and deserves access to these records, and she ordered the attorney general to do his job--to release the records so that we here in the Chamber will have that information, so that the American public will have that information. Judge Timmons said there was ``an abject failure to provide prompt and reasonable access to documents requested.''  On Tuesday, the first batch of emails is going to be released to the public. That is just a few days from now. But if we vote today, we won't have that information before us. It will be too late for us to have all the facts and information we need to make a qualified decision on whether Mr.Pruitt is a fit character or unfit character to be a member of the President's That is exactly what the Founders of our Nation charged us with doing in the advice and consent responsibility--to determine whether a nominee is a fit character or unfit character.  So we here in the Senate are not doing our job.

That is a pretty powerful commitment. That is the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency--to rescue our natural environment and keep our planet--our world, our Earth--as habitable and hospitable to humankind.  For more than 46 years, the Environmental Protection Agency has been the top cop on the beat, safeguarding our natural environment while also protecting critical aspects of public health--controlling toxic and poisonous chemicals, improving air and water quality, enhancing vehicle efficiency and emissions controls. The lists of the Environmental Protection Agency's accomplishments go on and on.  Today, we are considering President Trump's nominee for the Environmental Protection The appropriate question for us to ask is, Does this nominee hold in his heart the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency? Does he have a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment, a profound commitment to the preservation of the Earth to keep it habitable by humankind, hospitable to humankind?  This individual is Oklahoma Attorney General Scott We would like to have the full set of information about his work as attorney general that has been very relevant to this question, because the limited information we have shows that he has very deep connections and very close allegiance to the fossil fuel industry. And rather than displaying during his time as AG a profound commitment to our natural environment, to preserve it and keep it hospitable and habitable, he has instead weighed in time and time again on behalf of the polluters.  So for us to have a full sense of these connections, we need to have access to the emails and correspondence that he has generated over the last 2 years tied to the fossil fuel industry.  There are some 3,000 emails and associated pieces of correspondence--we are not sure of the exact total, but that is a substantial body of information that has been identified--and for 2 years, the attorney general, Scott Pruitt, has stonewalled the efforts to obtain these documents. There have been repeated requests time and time again filed with his office, and his office has failed to produce the information requested under the Public Information Act of Time and time again, he said no, no, no.  So then he comes to this body as a nominee to be the steward-in-chief of the responsibilities for our environment. So here in the Senate, we asked for those emails to help understand[[Page S1382]]whether he has served the public or whether he has served the polluters. That is the question before us. He said: Well, apply to the attorney general's office of Oklahoma for those emails and information.  This is rather unique. I don't know if this has ever happened in the history of the United States, the nominee saying: Yes, you can acquire that information by applying to me, back in my role as attorney general, knowing full well that he had absolutely no intention of actually providing that information.  Then yesterday a court stepped forward and said: Yes, this information must be provided. This is not the type of information that can be compiled overnight, so they gave Attorney General Scott Pruitt a couple of days--until next Tuesday--to be able to compile this information and provide it. And when it is provided, it will simply be the equivalent of PDF documents--scanned copies, if you will--of the printed copies of the emails and correspondence. Then it has to be shipped out to the group that applied for the information, and then they have to digitize it and send it out for us to have it here. It is still not searchable. Then we need time to go through it.  Well, it is convenient that we delay this vote until after we have this information because we are not going to be here next week. So whether we hold the vote at this moment, scheduled for 1 p.m., as we are leaving for a week or we hold it until when we return, on the Monday we return, it doesn't have any impact on slowing down this body. It would cost nothing in terms of the processing of the President's nominees to delay this vote until we return, at which time we will have the emails, and we will have had time to examine them, and the public will have had time to examine them, and that would honor our responsibility.  The Constitution was laid out in a fashion to put full responsibility on the individuals staffing the key agencies and Cabinet departments with the The Founders, the writers of the Constitution, wrestled with who should have that responsibility. They thought perhaps the appropriate check would be to have the Congress--they refer to it as ``Assembly'' in their dialogues--the Assembly decide who would be the folks staffing the executive branch at the highest levels of management. They said that was a problem because there wouldn't be full transparency. The public wouldn't be able to determine why one person was chosen or another person was chosen. There might be all kinds of trades taking place between the One might say: If you give me my choice for this Cabinet post, I will give you your choice for another, and the public wouldn't even know how those deals were being struck.  So the public accountability was honored by our Founders by saying the President will nominate, but in case the President goes off track and starts to nominate people of unfit character--unfit character--the Senate will have the responsibility to review the person's record and stop that nomination. That is our responsibility. That is the deterrence that Hamilton used, that we would take the process of this Chamber to ensure we do not confirm someone of unfit character. But to make that determination, we must have access to those emails, which are going to be distributed next  Madam President, I yield the floor to my colleague.  The PRESIDING The Democratic leader.

9354,topic-id,360,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his help on this amendment as well. It is an amendment designed to take an already very good bill and make it just a little better.  A good friend of mine, former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, used to say ``you'd be amazed how much government you'll never miss'' when talking about reducing the size of government bureaucracy.  So much of government's excess is created by unelected officials who wield enormous influence over our everyday lives. Last year, Federal agencies issued 18 rules and regulations for every one law that passed That is a grand total of 3,853 regulations in 2016 alone. In 2015, Federal regulations cost the American economy nearly $1.9 trillion--T, trillion dollars--in lost growth and productivity.  Think about that for a second. A $1.9 trillion tax, a government burden on the American people. That means lost jobs, stagnant wages, and decreasing benefits for workers.  My amendment looks to help change all that. Very simply, my amendment requires every agency issuing a new rule to first identify, then repeal or amend at least one existing rule to offset any annual costs the new rule would have on the U.economy. This isn't some new radical idea. President-[[Page H136]]elect Trump announced his administration will implement a new practice that for every new regulation, two would have to be repealed.  Governments in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands have all implemented similar versions of one-in/one-out when addressing new rules and regulations. In fact, in Canada, bureaucrats used the new direction to find and cut more red tape than was even required by the law. My amendment gives the new administration that same flexibility.  Mr.Chair, it is past time we stop bureaucratic abuse and shift the balance of power from government back to the people, where it belongs. That can start today by passing the REINS Act and putting our government on a path to reduce the amount of red tape that our businesses and the American people deal with every day.

9186,topic-id,1478,"Madam President, the Natural Resources Conservation Service is one of the best opportunities we have--and some of the best stewards we have for caring for lands in Kansas are our farmers and ranchers. What a great combination in the public-private partnership when we work together to improve our water quality and quantity, work to make sure our air is cleaner, make certain, as best we can, that the dust doesn't blow in  While we talk about environmental issues, I want to mention the work that goes on in my home State and places across the country with a partnership that occurs by the Department of Agriculture--USDA--its agency, the NRCS, and landowners in my  I want to highlight the circumstances those farmers and ranchers find themselves in today. In 2016, the price of wheat hit a decade low. Wheat prices fell from a high of $7.60 a bushel in 2013 to $4.11 per bushel in 2016, from $7.60 to $4.11 in just a short period of time.  Unfortunately, those prices have continued to stay low. Often in Kansas, when commodity prices are a challenge for those who raise crops, we are able to supplement our income by the price of cattle--our ability to raise quality beef and to sell that in markets and to compensate for the challenges that occur on the crop side of agriculture.  Unfortunately, the same thing has happened in the livestock market as well. Live cattle prices dropped from $166 per hundredweight in January of 2015 to $132 per hundredweight in January of 2016; again, a fall from $166 to $132.  Those things combined, low commodity prices, low price for wheat, low prices for cattle, mean that agriculture in rural America is hurting greatly. This is a tremendous challenge and appearing to be perhaps the most difficult time that agriculture producers, farmers, and ranchers face in the Midwest since the thirties.  I have come to speak about this today. Senator Roberts, the chairman who chairs the Agriculture Committee, is having a hearing of the Agriculture Committee in Kansas during the next few days. I appreciate the opportunity he is providing Kansans to have input as the process begins for a new farm bill. I congratulate him and welcome the input that everyday folks who earn a living in agriculture will have as a result of his efforts.  What I want to highlight today is that with the circumstances so challenging, we need to do things that reduce the input cost associated with production agriculture. But the focus I want to make today is that we need every market possible for our farmers and ranchers to sell into. Ninety-five percent of the mouths to feed, 95 percent of the consumers are outside the United States, and our ability to survive in agriculture in Kansas and this country is related to our ability to export those agriculture commodities, as well as food products, around the globe.  In the confirmation hearings that I have been involved in based upon my committee assignments and in addition to conversations with the nominee to be the Secretary of Agriculture, Governor Perdue, I have highlighted time and time again the importance of exports.  If we face this struggle--a struggle we do absolutely face today--a way we can help improve that circumstance is to sell more grains, more meat products, more beef, more pork into foreign country markets. It is not happening the way it needs to happen to lift the prices and therefore increase the chances that farmers and ranchers will survive the difficult and challenging economic circumstances.  I almost said ``as an aside.'' Let me mention another challenge. It really isn't an aside, it is so important. We have difficult times in agriculture. It is a cyclical world, and prices are up and prices are down based upon the laws of supply and demand. But in difficult times, we have always in the past been able to count upon a lender, a banker who is willing to help that farmer, that rancher get through difficult times.  The regulatory environment our bankers now face, particularly in rural communities where there is a relationship--we often operate in banks in my State, and certainly in rural communities across Kansas, as a result of a relationship. So our bankers--those who lend money to farmers--know those farmers. They know their families. They know their parents, their grandparents. They were the financier. They were the ones able to lend working capital to farmers in good times and bad.  Our regulators and I have visited with the Officer of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the state banking commissioner in our State, all with the message that in these difficult times, we can't let the consequences of Dodd-Frank overwhelm the ability for a banker to continue to make decisions about lending money to agriculture producers. We can't let the authority of making that decision, based upon long generations of relationships between those in agriculture and those in financing agriculture, be overcome by the rules and regulations that followed the passage of Dodd-Frank, particularly as it relates to those relationships with community banks and lenders.  So while it is challenging in agriculture due to the prices, one of the reasons we have been able to survive over the years in low-price times is because of that relationship and understanding.  I know this farm family--this is the banker talking--I know this farm family, and I have lent money to them for a long time. I lent money to their father or their grandfather, their mother[[Page S1375]]or their grandmother. They have the integrity, the character, and the ability to repay.  If the lending in rural America becomes nothing more than a computer program in which you punch in the numbers and character becomes something that is irrelevant--there is not a computer program to measure character. If we lose the opportunity for a relationship developed between a lender and a farmer, we lose the ability to make things work in difficult times. Those times are with us.  The primary point I would like to make today is that we need exports and we need them now. And while there is always a debate about the value of a particular trade agreement--and that debate is useful--we ought never lose sight that there is no real debate about the value of exports. So we need to put in place the mechanisms that allow farmers and ranchers and others in my State to be able to export a product around the globe.  I would encourage the administration and I would encourage Members of Congress, as we develop our policies in this new session, to make certain that exports are front and center in our economic policy because the survival of the folks I represent in Kansas and the communities in which they live is in jeopardy if we don't get those markets back and if we don't retain those markets.  Exports are important to us. We can't afford not to pursue each and every one of them. If we are not going to have multilateral trade agreements, we need to have bilateral trade agreements, and we can't wait very long for those agreements to take place.  Again, 95 percent of the consumers live outside the United States, and our ability in Kansas to have a bright future is determined by the ability to connect with those consumers outside the United  If I can take just one more moment to also point out that I have requested USAID and the Department of Agriculture in our food and hunger programs around the globe to increase the role that wheat and other commodities play in feeding a hungry world. We want to sell commodities in the export market, but as we develop our programs to combat hunger, we can get something that is very noble and something very valuable--helping people around the globe be able to go to bed with a full stomach is a desirable and noble goal, and the utilization of an increasing amount of agriculture or commodities grown in the United States in that effort would benefit farmers in our country, as well. It is the proverbial win/win. The noble accomplishment of helping people fight back food insecurity and at the same time creating an additional opportunity for the export of wheat, for example, which, because of significant amounts of harvest, is in an overabundant supply--is in abundant supply here in the United  Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to visit with my colleagues here on the Senate floor today and to express the desire to work with each of them as we develop the efforts to make certain that exports are front and center, particularly as they relate to agricultural interest of the United  Madam President, I yield my time.

9158,topic-id,5069,"Thank you, Mr. Once again, let me extend my gratitude to all of the staff who are pulling yet another overnight. I know this isn't easy, and I feel like every time we have done one of these I have been on the floor during the late night or very early morning hours to express my gratitude to those who are making this possible.  While I am grateful for those who are here, I think it is also incredibly important and vital that we are here. This is exceptional to have so many late nights, to have pushed through the evenings, to stay in session 24 hours and 48 hours at a time. I understand that last week we engaged in the longest session--second longest continuous session in the history of the Chamber, and I think we are doing so because we are living through truly exceptional times today.  We are living through a moment where this administration is simply not prepared to govern, and many of the individuals who are being appointed to Cabinet positions, being selected to serve in this administration simply aren't ready to get the job done.  We saw that with respect to Michael Flynn, who was named to quite possibly the most important position in the national security The National Security Advisor is, on most days, the first person and the last person the President talks to about national security, about protecting the Many of us raised alarm bells when Mr.Flynn was selected for the job because of his radical statements on Islam, his questionable connections to Russia, having sat next to Vladimir Putin in a celebration of Russian propaganda didn't seem right to us, something didn't smell right to many of us. We expressed those objections when Mr.Flynn was chosen. Our objections did not prevail, and within 30 days Mr.Flynn was fired from his position. It is still unclear as to why he was fired. The President was out in front of the cameras, bizarrely defending Mr.Flynn to the cameras having just fired him 30 days into the job, but it seems that it was some combination of undermining a sitting President by attempting to coordinate with the Russian Ambassador right after President Obama had levied sanctions on Russia, potentially making some promises to the Russians that they didn't have to worry about it because once the Trump administration got into office, they would modify or lift those sanctions or perhaps it was lying to the Vice President and others in the White House about what the substance of those conversations were.  Regardless, within 30 days, maybe the most important person in the security Cabinet, who many of us thought[[Page S1351]]was unqualified, was fired from his position in the shortest tenure that anybody could discover for National Security  More news in the last 48 hours is that there were a host of other White House officials who were unceremoniously ushered out of the White House because they couldn't pass their criminal background checks. Why on earth they were in the White House working in positions if they hadn't already taken criminal background checks, that is a very important question we should get answers to, but yet another example of selection of people to serve in sensitive posts who weren't ready for the job.  Betsy DeVos wasn't ready for her confirmation hearing. She came to the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and didn't know the basic facts about Federal education law. She couldn't tell the difference between measuring proficiency and measuring growth, and maybe for most people you don't know the difference either, but if you are going to be the Secretary of Education, you have to know the difference between measuring for proficiency and measuring for growth. She was confused about the Federal law that guarantees children with disabilities an equal education. She told Senator Kaine and Senator Hassan it would be OK for States to ignore that law or ignore that protection. That actually is not the case. Every State has to observe the individuals with disabilities law as it pertains to students.  Just this week, we had a nominee withdraw after a drip, drip, drip of allegations regarding his personal conduct and his business practices made it pretty clear that somebody whose restaurants are half the time in violation of Federal labor laws, somebody who has employed undocumented workers probably isn't suitable to be the chief protector of workers in this country as the Secretary of the Department of It just doesn't seem that a lot of thought has been put into some of these selections.  So we are taking our time. We are using our prerogative as Members of the minority party to make sure there is a full, complete debate on all these nominees to make sure, at the very least, the American public knows what they are getting.  Our worry is not just that these nominees are often woefully unprepared for the job, it is that many of them appear to be fatally compromised. I listened to a lot of what President Trump said on the campaign trail, and I heard him spending a lot of time attacking the way business had historically been done in Washington, Maybe some of us privately cheered him on when we heard him say that because we have watched corporate America own this town for a long time.  I watched the drug industry essentially have veto power over health policy in this town. I have watched the oil and gas industry run the show. From a personal basis, nothing aggrieves me more than seeing the gun industry get whatever they want from this If you have a couple hundred million dollars of market capitalization and a good lobbyist and a political action committee you can get a lot done in  So maybe when I tried to think of that silver lining to the election of Donald Trump to the Presidency of the United States, something that was deeply morally objectionable to me, it was that maybe there is a possibility to take on some of these special interests, to say enough is enough, the size of your wallet shouldn't have anything to do with the amount of influence you command here, but then those hopes were dashed as we watched who President Trump decided to nominate for the  Over and over again, billionaires, sometimes millionaires, but more often than not billionaires were selected for this Cabinet, many of whom had ties to the very special interests or were members of the very special interests that Donald Trump told people he was going to take on when he became President of the United  So we had one of the biggest fast food operators being installed in the Department of Labor--somebody who attacked workers and said that break time was a nuisance, that robots should replace his employees, we had an oil executive nominated to serve as our chief diplomat, and now we have an individual who has very publicly and unapologetically done the bidding of big energy companies being enlisted to be the chief environmental protector in this country.  So we are here tonight because the nomination and selection of Scott Pruitt to be the next Administrator of the EPA fits neatly into a pattern of behavior by this administration in which very, very rich people or people who have very close ties to powerful interests are being put in the government, and our worry is that they are being put there not to serve the American people but to serve those interests.  Scott Pruitt has a very interesting history of defending the oil and gas industry, which I admit is important to his State of Oklahoma--more important than it is in my State of Connecticut--but he has a very interesting history of defending that industry against the Scott Pruitt has sued the EPA to overturn standards to curb mercury and other toxic air pollutants, standards that would prevent 11,000 premature deaths and up to 130,000 asthma attacks per year.  He sued to void standards to reduce soot and smog pollution, projecting to prevent up to 15,000 nonfatal heart attacks, to prevent 34,000 premature deaths, and almost 400,000 asthma attacks every year.  He sued unsuccessfully to overturn the EPA's scientific danger determination that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping air pollutants are harmful, and he even sued to block water pollution into the Chesapeake Bay which has no connection to  Scott Pruitt has been a crusader. He has been a crusader on behalf of the energy industry against environmental protection, and he would probably tell you there is a choice to be made between protecting our environment and protecting our economy. That is ridiculous. That is patently ridiculous.  If we don't protect our planet, if we don't protect the quality of our air and the quality of our water, there will be no planet for businesses to grow in, and every kid who suffers through a lifetime of asthma is a fundamentally less productive worker to be able to add value to the American economy. When you are attacking health standards that would reduce asthma attacks by over 500,000 a year, you are attacking the economy, not just the environment.  It is really hard for a kid to learn and become an entrepreneur or a business creator if they are not healthy. Frankly, it is really hard for a family to be able to manage their own economic affairs when they have kids who are that unhealthy. So Scott Pruitt, in continuing to attack the EPA, continuing to stand up for the oil and gas industry, is weakening our economy.  Maybe even more importantly, when you are standing up for only one segment of the energy industry, you are ignoring all the potential jobs that come through a true energy transformation. I get it that today there are a lot of oil jobs in Oklahoma, but there could also be a lot of wind and solar and advanced battery and fuel cell jobs in his State as well. Frankly, as you look at the jobs that will be created over the next 50 to 100 years, not just in this country but across the globe, the real job growth in the energy sector is not just going to be in the oil and gas sector, it is going to be in this broader renewable energy sector.  I don't know if these statistics are up to date, but a few years ago, I read that, of the top 10 solar companies in the world, the United States has one of them; of the top 10 wind turbine companies in the world, the United States has one; and of the top 10 advanced battery companies in the world, the United States has two. There are going to be millions and millions of jobs to be had all across the world in the renewable energy economy.  So long as our energy policy is only about protecting oil and gas and coal and not about truly advancing renewable energy, we are hurting our economy; we are preventing massive job creation from happening; and we are letting other countries eat our lunch because 9 out of those 10 top wind turbine companies and top solar companies and 8 out of those top 10 advanced battery companies are in other countries--other countries that have decided to have policies that create internal markets for those new renewable technologies, unlike here in the United States.[[Page S1352]]  Germany is pumping out wind turbines and is selling them all over the globe, not because Germany has any more wind than the United States but because they have decided to pursue a policy in which they give advantage to those renewable energy companies. The United States has decided to pursue policies, by and large, through giving advantage to fossil fuel companies.  In making his name as a crusader against the EPA, not only is Scott Pruitt endangering the health of our kids, but he is endangering the health of our economy as well. It is not guesswork when it comes to the connection of Scott Pruitt to the industry. If he had really studied the facts and if he had sat down and sort of weighed the benefits of the industry's claims against the benefits of the claims of 99 percent of the scientists in this country, it would be worth a listen.  But, as attorney general of Oklahoma, he sent a letter to the EPA, skewering its efforts to limit methane leaks from oil and gas companies. He didn't write the letter. Nobody on his staff wrote the letter. Oklahoma's Devon Energy Corporation wrote the letter. Pruitt's office changed a few words and sent it on to the EPA on the attorney general's stationery. That is how close the relationship is between Scott Pruitt and these energy companies. He just takes what they write--what they say--and forwards it on under his own signature. If you were to do that in a classroom, that would be plagiarism, and you would get kicked out of school; but if you were to do that as the attorney general of Oklahoma, you would get nominated to be the Administrator of the  It might get a lot worse. You might find out that it is a lot worse on Tuesday of next week because, for some reason, Scott Pruitt has been hiding email correspondence between his office and these energy companies. He has put up roadblock after roadblock to try to stop freedom of information requests to get these emails, this correspondence.  Finally, yesterday, a judge ruled that you cannot stop that information from coming out--they are public documents--and on Tuesday of next week, they are going to be made public. I don't know what they were going to say, but as I suspect with Donald Trump's tax returns, when you are expending great effort to hide something from the American public, there is probably a reason you are hiding those things. There is something incredibly damaging, embarrassing, or illegal in those tax returns, and there is, probably, something very damaging, embarrassing, or illegal in those emails.  So we are rushing through a nomination of Scott Pruitt tomorrow, which will not allow us to see this email correspondence that is going to come out next week. That is a shame because it, likely, will show us how close that connection has been between the next Administrator of the EPA and the energy companies that he has been regulating and will be charged to regulate.  I get really concerned about Scott Pruitt when I think about the kids in my I will tell you about one very specific way in which I think about it, and then I will talk a little bit more broadly.  We have talked a lot about lead, mostly in the context of this tragedy that has played out in Flint, MI, but, in Connecticut, the tragedy of lead poisoning plays out every single day. Why? Because we have really old housing stock; we have old infrastructure; we have lead that is in paint; we have lead that is in pipes; we have lead that is in fixtures that exist in old homes.  While our State has been just plugging along, trying to do better to remediate these old homes and clean up lead and test kids earlier, lead poisoning has been a reality for us in Connecticut for a very, very long time. Boy, there are a lot of awful things that can happen to you as a kid in this country, but lead poisoning is at the top of the list. Watching a family go through the horror of serious lead poisoning is nothing that you want to witness because, once lead gets into your system--once it gets trapped inside your brain--it is impossible to reverse.  In his confirmation hearing, Mr.Pruitt was asked whether there was any safe level of lead in drinking water. If you are going to be the Administrator of the EPA, you should probably know the answer to that question. The answer is, no, there is no safe level of lead in drinking water. Given all of the tumult and attention over what happened in Flint, you would think that would be something he would be prepared for. His response was: ``That's something I have not reviewed nor know about.''  Lead is a neurotoxin that can have devastating, long-term effects on the lives of children. The correct answer, of course, is that there is no level of lead that is safe in drinking water.  I don't want to be too tough on him because I don't expect somebody who hasn't spent his lifetime in the field to know every answer about environmental standards, but this one was a pretty important one. For those of us who do think he is, ultimately, going to do the bidding of industry rather than the bidding of kids, not having an awareness about something as simple as acceptable lead levels in water makes us wonder whether he is really prepared to do his homework because on the other side of the lead fight are special interests. This is one that has special interests too. Whether it be the home builders or other folks who might have to pay a little bit of money out of their pockets to fix up old homes, there are people who are not always with us on this.  More broadly, I worry about my kids. My kids are not going to suffer from lead poisoning, but if we don't get serious about the pace of climate change now--in the next 5 to 10 years--the problem may not be available to solve for my kids. It may be too late, once they become of age, to try to do something about it as a public servant, as a scientist, as an activist. Any scientist can explain the reason for that.  The reason is that, for many greenhouse pollutants--carbon dioxide, in particular--as they get released into the atmosphere, they stay, and they continue to warm--heat up--as time goes on. There are some pollutants that don't act that way. There are these things called fast-acting climate pollutants, like methane, frankly, that are released into the atmosphere, that are powerful heaters for a short period of time, but then they dissipate. Carbon dioxide is different. That one sticks around forever and ever--a long, long time--and continues to heat and continues to heat and continues to heat. So, if you don't reverse the trajectory of the human contribution to climate change soon, it may be too late.  As folks have read, just in the last 60 days, that phenomenon is playing out in parts of the globe that are already at a pace that was unimaginable just 5 years ago. In the Arctic, we are seeing just unthinkable warming.  I don't make policy by anecdote, but about a year ago, I was in the I was on a submarine, doing an exploration under the ice--a truly amazing thing to be a part of. I was on the USS Hartford, which was a ship that was made in Connecticut, and the port is in We were up there as part of an exercise called ICEX, which was an exercise to try to understand what is happening in the Arctic so as to try to understand what the implications are for humans of this massive melting of arctic ice.  There were supposed to be two weekends of exercises in which there was a camp on a very stable piece of ice. Experiments were happening at the camp, and a submarine was helping to engage in those experiments. We were part of the first weekend's exercise. Then, the next weekend, another group of Congressmen was going up to witness that second weekend's exercise. The second group of Congressmen did not make it. They were literally on a van to the plane when they were told there was an emergency evacuation of the camp because the ice was melting underneath the camp. This was a spot that was picked because of how stable they thought it was. In the short period of time in which the camp had existed on the ice that March, it had started to break up and melt underneath them, and they had to engage in an emergency evacuation.  That is just one story. I understand we don't legislate or regulate by anecdote, but when you piece it together with all of the other evidence that tells you that every single year is the warmest on record, that shows you this massive trend line of melting in the Even scientists who were of that 1 percent, who were sort of judged or deemed to be climate skeptics, are now[[Page S1353]]saying: Whoa, there is clearly something nonnatural happening in the Arctic, resulting in this massive melt that happens season after season.  If that melt that is being mirrored in Antarctica continues at this pace, it will be too late for my kids to do something about it. In my State of Connecticut, a coastal State--a State in which the majority of our economic assets are buffered right up against the water of the Long Island Sound--we cannot survive in a world in which sea level rise doubles compared to what it has been over the last 1,000 years.  We cannot survive in a world in which, by the end of this century, the average temperatures will be 8 degrees higher than they are today. When I came to Congress in 2007, the worst case estimates were that, by the end of this century, the global temperature rise would be 6 to 8 degrees beyond what it is today. Those are now mainstream estimates. It is not politicians, and it is not activists. Those are scientists--mainstream scientists--who are making those estimates. Yet, we are going to put somebody into the EPA who proudly has been a mouthpiece for the idea that climate change is a hoax--a hoax.  There is this tiny group of scientists who say: Well, it is not really clear whether human activity is leading to climate change. There is a tiny group of scientists who say that. Ninety percent of scientists agree that humans are contributing to climate change.  But Scott Pruitt goes further than that. Scott Pruitt has said that climate change--he has said it over and over again--that climate change is a hoax. What does that mean? Does that mean it is an intentional campaign by people to try to fool people into believing that climate change is happening? That is an extreme position. I don't even know how you explain what the genesis of the hoax is. What benefit do people get from trying to create this fiction? And of all the people out there who could possibly be the EPA Administrator, President Trump chose someone who calls climate change a hoax.  He had a confirmation conversion. He backtracked on that and said something before the committee about not being completely sure about the human contribution to climate change, but acknowledging that it probably exists. It is not the first confirmation conversion we have had. The Presiding Officer and I were at a very interesting hearing yesterday in which the nominee to be Ambassador to Israel essentially recanted everything he had ever said that was strong in tone about people he disagreed with on the position of U.S.-Israel relations.  So Scott Pruitt has changed his rhetoric in order to get confirmed. But he said that climate change is a hoax enough times to understand that likely, in his gut, that is what he still believes. It was a convenient position to have if you were an attorney general concerned with doing the bidding of big energy companies and special interests, which fed into their narrative as well.  These are exceptional times. I am sorry that we are back on the floor overnight again. But we are deeply concerned that this special interest Cabinet--this billionaire Cabinet--is not being put in place to do right for the American people. It is being put in place to do right for big corporations that don't need any more allies here in For all the rhetoric about upsetting the way things are done in Washington, President Trump is doubling down on special interest influence by handing them the keys to the Secretary's offices and major Departments, now including the Environmental Protection  That was not a President at that press conference yesterday. That was hard to watch, I imagine for both Democrats and It was not a higher calling to public service for anybody in this country. Maybe there was 20 percent of the President's base that the press conference played to, but that was not an advertisement for  These are exceptional times, and they do command those of us who are worried about the direction of this country to use all the power we have to try to get the facts out there and on the record.  I was standing next to Senator Angus King at a press conference shortly after we were sworn in, talking about this issue of climate change and our responsibility as public servants to protect the quality of our air and the quality of our water. We were recalling how this wasn't as partisan an issue 40 years ago as it is today.  The EPA was established under a Republican The Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act had bipartisan support. There was a time in which Republicans were for environmental protection, and now we are nominating somebody to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who made his name fighting environmental protection, who made his name suing the Agency that was established by a Republican President, who has called the global climate change phenomenon, supported by 99 percent of scientists, a hoax.  It is disturbing to many of us how deeply politicized this issue is because it used to be relatively nonpartisan. It used to be that for all of the things we disagreed on, we at least recognized that one of our responsibilities as stewards of this sphere that we live on is to make sure that it exists in the same shape that it is today for our kids.  What Angus King said that day in that press conference, as always, stayed with me. Senator King said that in Maine they have the rototiller rule. If you borrow a rototiller or, frankly, any piece of equipment from your neighbor, you have an obligation when you are done with it to return that piece of equipment to your neighbor, or return that rototiller to your neighbor, in at least as good a condition as you found it. That makes sense. You borrowed the rototiller. If you break it you probably should fix it before you hand it back or you just use it in a way so that you are careful with it so that you don't break it, so that when you give it back to your neighbor, it is in that same condition. Senator King applied that standard to the standard that we should hold ourselves to when it comes to protecting this planet.  My kids are going to inherit this planet. My grandkids, hopefully, will inherent it from them. Our charge should be to hand this planet to our kids in at least as good a shape as we found it. If we break it, if we damage it, we should fix it before we hand it over.  We are breaking this planet right now. We are releasing so much pollution into the atmosphere to have compromised its integrity for the next generation. We have broken the rototiller, and the rototiller rule tells you that before you give it back to your neighbor, you should fix it. And we have it in our power to do it.  When we damaged the ozone layer through the release of CFCs, we got together and fixed that problem. We engaged in a global conversation to regulate CFCs through something called the Montreal protocol. We were able to attack that problem, fix it at no significant cost to the economy, and show that if we really do care about the quality of this globe, there is nothing that is outside of our power. There is no choice to be made between observing the rototiller rule--protecting our planet--and growing our economy.  But if Scott Pruitt becomes the next Administrator of EPA and the oil companies and the gas companies essentially get whatever they want, well, their bottom lines probably will be improved, shareholders in those companies will probably do a little bit better, but our kids' health, our larger economy's future will be compromised.  So that is why we are here on the floor objecting to Mr.Pruitt's nomination. That is why we have asked for this nomination to be delayed until later next week so that we can see what is in these emails, where we already have some pretty concerning evidence of this deep connection between Mr.Pruitt and the companies he will regulate at EPA--a letter that they wrote for him that he sent under his name. What if there is more information like that in this correspondence?  What if there is more evidence that he, as attorney general, was just a mouthpiece for industry rather than a mouthpiece for consumers? What if that is predictive of his behavior at EPA? I think that would be something that both Democrats and Republicans would be concerned with because I think I know my colleagues, and while my colleagues have certainly been more protective of industries' interests than Democrats have been, we both agree that the industry shouldn't have[[Page S1354]]an unnatural advantage in these agencies above the public interest. I am pretty sure we agree on that. And in just 4 short days, we will get a better understanding as to whether that is definitively the case for Scott  So I would urge my colleagues to either delay this vote that is happening later today or to vote against the nomination.

9391,topic-id,723,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would exempt from the bill any regulations that pertain to nuclear reactor safety. In other words, my amendment would allow the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the NRC to continue to issue rules under the current system, thereby making it easier to protect Americans from potential nuclear disaster.  The underlying legislation, the REINS Act, would grind the gears of rulemaking to a halt by requiring all major rules to be affirmatively approved in advance by A regulation would be blocked from being implemented if even one Chamber declines to pass an approval resolution. The goal of this legislation, quite simply, is to stop the regulatory process in its tracks, regardless of the impact on public health and safety.  One example that highlights the risks and dangers of this legislation is[[Page H142]]the subject of this amendment: Nuclear power.  The world watched in horror when an earthquake and resulting tsunami devastated the area around Fukushima, Japan, a few years ago. That disaster then caused its own disaster--the meltdown of three reactors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The meltdown led to the release of radioactive isotopes, the creation of a 20-kilometer exclusion zone around the power plant, and the displacement, consequently, of 156,000 people. Just last month, seaborne radiation from Fukushima was even detected on the West Coast of the United  The same year as the Fukushima meltdown, Virginia was struck by a relatively rare but strong earthquake, felt up and down the eastern seaboard. While the region was spared a similar disaster, the earthquake required a nuclear power plant near the epicenter to go offline as a precaution and served as a wake-up call that our nuclear reactors needed additional safety protocols.  For me, this concern hits close to home. A nuclear power plant, Indian Point, which has suffered numerous malfunctions in recent years, lies just less than 40 miles away from my New York City district, about 30 miles away from the city. Twenty million people live within a 50-mile radius around the plant, the same radius used by the NRC as the basis for the evacuation zone recommended after the Fukushima disaster.                              {time}  1645  Indian Point also sits near two earthquake fault lines and, according to the NRC, is the most likely nuclear power plant in the country to experience core damage because of an earthquake.  Because of the catastrophes that can result from disasters, be they natural or manmade at nuclear power plants, prevention of meltdowns is absolutely vital. Since Fukushima, the NRC has issued new rules designed to upgrade power plants to withstand severe events like earthquakes, and to have enough backup power so as to avoid a meltdown for a significant length of time.  The NRC must retain the ability to issue new regulations to safeguard the health and well-being of all However, this bill is intentionally designed so that new and important regulations, including those to prevent a nuclear power plant meltdown which could affect millions of American, will likely never be put in place, thwarted by either chamber of  Congress delegates authority to executive agencies because we do not have the expertise or time to craft all technical regulations ourselves. We should defer to the engineers and scientists at the NRC who determine, after careful study, that a particular regulation is critical to our safety and to the safe operation of a nuclear power plant. This bill, however, would all too easily allow Members of Congress to substitute their own judgment or, most likely, the wishes of a narrow group of special interests.  This week we began a new Later this month we will have a new administration, all controlled by Between this bill and the Midnight Rules bill we passed yesterday, they have chosen to make their first order of business the dismantling and destruction of the regulatory process, regardless of the impact on public health and safety. This gives us a good idea of the priorities we should expect to see in the next 2 years.  The least we can do is to try to ensure that the antiregulatory agenda of the Republicans does not have devastating consequences such as a nuclear meltdown.

The Acting Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentleman[[Page H143]]from California (Mr.McNerney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Mr.Mr.Chairman, recent pipeline incidents have raised serious concerns about the condition of the Nation's pipelines that threaten the safety and health of American citizens. This amendment will ensure that any rule intended to guarantee the safety of natural gas or hazardous material pipelines is not considered a major rule under this bill and would, therefore, be easier to create.  Pipeline safety is a bipartisan issue. Congress has shown that issuing regulations related to pipelines is a priority, as evident with the enactment of the PIPES Act last year.  However, the bill before us today, H.26, contradicts this historic precedent and would have the effect of delaying or preventing any rule on pipeline safety from going forward. Pipeline accidents cause major property damage, serious injuries or deaths, and harms the environment.  There are approximately 2.9 million miles of pipeline in the United They travel through rural and urban areas, Republican and Democratic districts, coastlines, inland areas. Everyone is impacted. Quality control measures, new infrastructure, and oversight are paramount.  Unfortunately, we have seen the devastating impact of pipeline incidents throughout the country, including several accidents and spills in California in recent years, such as the spill in Santa Barbara that released more than 100,000 gallons of crude oil.  We have also seen how liquid spills can devastate the people and economies in places like Michigan, and the irreplaceable natural resources like the Yellowstone River in Montana, or the precious coastline of Santa Additionally, these explosions and spills cause shortages and price increases that impact Americans far from the site of the accident.  A Colonial Pipeline accident this past September in Alabama leaked roughly 8,000 barrels of gasoline and saw prices increase by up to 31 cents a gallon in metropolitan areas in the Southeastern  I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that we want effective and efficient government. But, in reality, pipeline safety regulations are already subject to duplicative and time-consuming analyses, including a rigorous risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis required by the pipeline safety statute. These already duplicative review requirements are among the top reasons why the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration increasingly lags behind the congressional mandate to issue rules that protect Americans from dangerous pipeline incidents.  In fact, this was the subject of a great deal of discussion when the Energy and Commerce Committee marked up the pipeline safety reauthorization bill last year. I worked with Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone to address this issue, as both sides of the aisle agreed that the duplicative reviews currently required are already slowing down these critical safety laws to a degree that is frustrating and dangerous.  While we make progress in the PIPES Act, I believe we can and should do more. The last thing we need is one more layer of bureaucracy to further slow down implementation of these critical protections for public health, safety, and the environment. We should work together to prevent spills and work to minimize impacts when spills or other incidents do occur. This includes automatic shut-off valves, leak detection, and technologies to reduce clogging and rupture.  A vote for this amendment is a vote for the safety of the public and the environment. It is a vote to protect the land and water that are threatened by oil spills. It is a vote for industry that wants certainty and clarity and doesn't want to--or benefit from--wait years for rules to be finalized. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

9303,topic-id,582,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend from Texas (Mr.Sessions), the chairman of the Committee on Rules, for yielding me this time.  I am certainly in favor of the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, which I think will provide necessary transparency in the regulatory process by requiring agencies to post all public comments issued during a proposed rulemaking, which sounds simple enough. I cosponsored this legislation because I strongly believe, and I firmly believe, the public comment process is critical to ensure Federal regulations are drafted to protect the American people and not to punish them.  Unfortunately, far too often, agencies either ignore or fail to incorporate the public's input and suggestions when proposing and finalizing these important rules. Many regulatory actions impose billions of dollars in compliance and other costs on industries, on consumers, on small businesses, on farmers, and on families while bureaucrats ignore the meaningful input, suggested improvements, and the real concerns being voiced by the very people that will be most affected by their actions.  Mr.Speaker, this measure requires more transparency and accountability of Federal agency communications about proposed and pending regulations. Agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency have continually violated Federal laws and appropriations restrictions that prohibit the use of Federal funds for lobbying, advocacy, and propaganda efforts.  I know many are aware of the EPA's unlawful social media campaign advocating for the waters of the United States rule, the WOTUS rule; however, an even more egregious example recently occurred in my own home State of The EPA-funded What's Upstream campaign used grant awards to fund a website, radio ads, and billboards depicting dead fish and polluted water, alleging that farmers and the agriculture industry were responsible. The website helped visitors email their State legislators to advocate for 100-foot stream buffer zones around farms and other agricultural operations, despite prohibitions against such advocacy.  As a lifelong farmer, I have got to tell you, Mr.Speaker, I was insulted by the blatant lies this campaign had spread about farmers; and as a Member of Congress, I am outraged that the EPA continues to award grant funding to the entities responsible for this, I think, despicable and deceitful antifarmer campaign. I believe Congress must ensure Federal agencies follow the law to prevent future libelous campaigns like What's Upstream from ever receiving another cent of taxpayer dollars.  H.1004 prohibits lobbying in support of proposed rules and requires agencies to track the details of all public communications about pending regulatory actions, while establishing clear standards for prohibited activities. This will guarantee that both the public and Congress understand how Federal agencies communicate with the public about pending regulations, and these reasonable restrictions will support transparency and accountability across the Federal  Mr.Speaker, agencies should consider comments from the public and incorporate reasonable changes so that proposed Federal regulations can be revised and refined using that valuable public feedback before they are finalized. However, too often, Federal bureaucrats simply go through the motions and end up ignoring the public's input while they happily flout Federal law and create campaigns designed to garner support for their preferred proposals. Federal agencies must not treat their proposed regulations as final. By doing so, they are ignoring the voice and the will of the American people.  I urge my colleagues to support this important rule and the underlying bill; then, together, we can return transparency, we can return accountability, and we can return public input to the Federal rulemaking process once and for all.                              {time}  1300  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1403-5.txt,2275,"HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN CAMBODIA",2017.0,1.0,February

9222,topic-id,321,"Mr.President, I stand today to express my opposition to the nomination of Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Mr.Pruitt's track record does not demonstrate a commitment to addressing critical natural resource issues.  As Oklahoma's attorney general, he joined forces with polluters to sue the Environmental Protection Agency again and again, to undermine the safeguards for clean air and for clean water.  I am also dismayed he has not yet committed to recusing himself on those pending lawsuits, if confirmed. Not once, not one single time has he pressed the EPA for more action to protect public health or the environment. He has defined his career by undermining laws that prevent people from getting sick and safeguard the environment from degradation.  In addition, Mr.Pruitt refuses to release thousands of emails related to his ties to special interests, including corporations that may have donated to his political campaigns. These connections to very big energy interests are relevant, given Mr.Pruitt's history of copying and pasting industry requests directly onto his attorney general office's letterhead.  It is very difficult to fully evaluate his record without these emails made public. Just yesterday, an Oklahoma State district judge ruled that Mr.Pruitt's office will have until Tuesday to turn over these emails.  Unfortunately, the Senate will vote on his nomination in just a moment, before these documents are released, and give the American people an opportunity to see what they contain.  I would strongly urge that the nomination vote be postponed until these emails are released, and they can be fully considered.

9301,topic-id,1611,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise in opposition to the rule and both underlying bills, H.1009, the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act; and H.1004, the Regulatory Integrity  These two bills that would be debated under this rule were both reported out of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform without a single Democratic vote. So these are not bipartisan bills. They were reported out of committee only by The bills threaten transparency, undermine the independent authority of government agencies, and weaken the separation of powers between our three branches of government at a time in our history when we need it the most.  I sat in this Chamber last night as President Trump spoke about fixing healthcare and immigration systems, but we haven't seen those plans yet. Instead, all we have seen are these kinds of not-bipartisan bills that don't accomplish a lot.  Now, these two bills claim to offer accountability and integrity in the rulemaking process, but when you look past their title, you see what they really are is just another backdoor attack on American workers, an attack on our environment and protecting our public health.  First with regard to H.1009, much has been said since the start of this Congress about the importance of our checks and balances in our system. We have a new President who isn't shy about blurring the lines of separation between the executive, legislative, and even the judicial branches of government. He publicly condemned a judge based on his ethnicity in a private case. He also attacked a judge who struck down his order on immigration. I find it troubling to be debating a bill that would make government agencies even more dependent on the judgment of the White House when many of us question the judgment of the gentleman currently occupying the Oval  Under current law, independent agencies, like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, and many others don't need approval from the administration to move forward with a new rule or regulation. Misleadingly characterized as simplifying the existing executive order, what this bill would actually do is require all rules made by independent government agencies to be sent to the White House, centralizing the power of the White House and the power of the                              {time}  1245  This bill effectively mandates improper influence by the White  In addition, the bill repeals language that exempts rules considered to be lifesaving from having to undergo a full review process.  If those reasons weren't enough to dissuade my colleagues from voting in favor of this rule, let me briefly discuss the unlimited review window this bill would create to derail and delay important rules. Frankly, important provisions like this are the reasons why the American people, often rightfully, accuse the government of waste, fraud, and abuse.  By giving the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs unlimited time to review rules, Congress would effectively allow the White House to bury rules in red tape and paperwork, the very red tape and paperwork and bureaucracy that the American people are frustrated with. This bill is a recipe to make government less efficient rather than more efficient. It would grind the rulemaking process to a halt by burying the very limited staff of the White House under a whole array of rules from independent agencies that, with no timeline, would simply sit in the White House either going nowhere or being studied by committee after committee after committee. Perhaps, after several years, they will see the light of day after even more bureaucrats have had the chance, at your taxpayer expense, to read those rules.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that this bill makes the[[Page H1406]]Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs somehow more accountable by Congress by authorizing the statute, but that is not the case. This bill, like many other bills we have seen in this Congress, frankly, is a solution in search of a problem.  I don't disagree that the rulemaking process should be simplified, but there is a collaborative, bipartisan way to do that. This bill does not represent that idea. If passed, H.1009 would reduce the ability of independent government agencies to work effectively, create additional paperwork and bureaucracy, and transfer significant power and authority to the White House and the  Frankly, this bill is a serious threat on our checks and balances at a time we need it the most. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take that into account when voting on the rule and the bill today.  The second bill under this rule is H.1004, the so-called Regulatory Integrity It is another example of Republican attacks on health and safety protections.  The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017 requires executive agencies to provide extensive and, often, gratuitous information on their websites related to any pending regulatory action they are seeking to make. Again, it is difficult to find a Member of this body who doesn't believe that we want more transparency, more accountability, and more streamlining of regulations. Of course, those are priorities for the country. This bill does not do that.  I don't believe an outright attack on our rulemaking process meant to protect our health, meant to protect people from fraud and abuse, and giving yet more hoops for agency officials to jump through in doing the job that Congress has asked them to do, in no way is that the correct way to go about increasing transparency in government. This bill makes it more difficult for all of the agencies that we have set up, that we have directed, to do their job: to protect the American public.  The new reporting requirements that are included in this bill will distract agencies from their core missions of keeping Americans safe and, again, bury them under mounds and mounds of additional paperwork requirements. Many of these agencies have seen their budgets cut by the Republicans, and the reporting requirements will take up even more of their very limited capacity that they have under the budget constraints they operate at.  As many of us know, this bill was born out of a 2015 GAO study that determined that the Environmental Protection Agency had violated certain restrictions during the rulemaking process for waters of the U.To me, the fact that that determination was made by an independent government agency is proof that our oversight process works. If there is a bipartisan bill we can do to implement best practices, I think that we could have strong Democratic support for that. This bill does not do that.  Republicans are ignoring the fact that the GAO also concluded that ``the agency complied with the applicable requirements,'' and were so concerned with providing the public with opportunities to comment that the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers conducted over 400 meetings across the country. If this bill passes the House, the ability of agencies to do those kinds of outreach efforts and stakeholder involvement efforts would be limited. It would be limited by vast and unnecessary additional work, red tape, and bureaucratic reporting requirements that would be mandated under this bill with the same limited resources they have today. I think that it would be better use of their limited resources to do those kinds of field opportunities across the country, giving American stakeholders and people involved the opportunity to testify about how those rules affect them.  The most immediate and certain effect of this bill would be to virtually prohibit agencies from disclosing to the public any benefits that agency actions would have in protecting the American people. If an agency is no longer allowed to explain how the rulemaking process would benefit and protect the American people, the public, of course, would view this as some sort of burdensome regulation. Perhaps that is the goal of this bill from a propaganda perspective.  Finally, this bill will ban agencies from soliciting support for their regulations, seemingly forgetting that current law already does this. If there is need to clarify it again, we can certainly do so in a bipartisan way.  This unsettling trend of trying to, in fact, regulate regulations actually leads to additional bureaucracy and paperwork. It is a disservice to American workers and families, to our environment, and to many Americans who don't know if they can make their rent or have health insurance at the end of the month. It is a disservice to the thousands of military and civilian workers no longer able to seek employment in the Federal Government and a disservice to so many American children and adults.  The fact that we are even considering these bills illustrates that the priorities in Congress are not in line with the priorities of the people that we represent. I have not heard an outcry from my constituents on any of these issues. I hear about health care. I hear about immigration reform, improving our schools, making college more affordable, not that we need more administrative hurdles to the rulemaking process. I haven't heard it once from a single constituent at 51 townhalls I had last session.  The passage of this bill will put a significant administrative burden on government agencies that issue rules to protect It would limit the ability of the agencies that we set up under our authorizing statutes to do their job: to protect the health and safety of the American people.  I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and reject these bills.  I reserve the balance of my time.

That is because it puts Americans back in charge of the laws being imposed upon them.  How does the legislation do that?  Under our Constitution, we have three branches. The executive branch is supposed to enforce the law. The judicial branch is supposed to resolve disputes arising under the law. The legislature--this House and the Senate, the branch directly elected by the people--is supposed to make the law.  Over the last decades, we have seen more and more of the lawmaking in this country migrate to the unelected bureaucrats in the executive branch. Those bureaucrats churn out regulation after regulation that have the full force and effect of law. The problem with this setup is that the people of this country are supposed to consent to laws being imposed upon them. They do that through their elected representatives in In short, this legislation goes to the heart of what self-rule is all about.  Let me be clear: this legislation does not end regulation. It is the beginning of accountability for regulation.

If the people that Member represents disagree, they get to hold him or her accountable at the ballot box.

9137,topic-id,6893,"Mr.President, in late October, people who lived in a place called Donora shrugged off the thick, yellow smog that had covered their small town. It was 1948. It wasn't unusual to see a smog blanket the town, thanks to the zinc plant and the steel mill that smoked endlessly into the Pennsylvania sky. It wasn't unusual to see people coughing as they went about their day. As one reporter put it, ``People are always coughing in Donora.''  What was unusual is that the smog did not clear as the day went on. It lingered, hanging around the town, wreaking havoc for the next 5 days. At first, life seemed to go on. The Halloween parade went on as planned, even though no one could really see the people marching. The high school football game went on as planned, although the quarterbacks avoided passing plays since the wide receivers couldn't see the ball. But then someone died. People couldn't breathe. As the local hospital started to fill, the town hotel set up beds for overflow patients. By the fourth day, the hotel had to set up another emergency section--this time, a temporary morgue. The town's three funeral homes were overwhelmed. On the fifth day, the stacks of a zinc plant stopped their endless streams of smoke, and the smog that would become known as the Donora death fog finally lifted but not before nearly 7,000 people fell ill and 20 died.  This is one of the many stories that show us what life was like in the United States of America before the EPA was created. In the early 1960s, millions of freshwater fish and rivers around the country were poisoned by insecticides--hurting consumer trust and the countless fishermen and their families who relied on the fish to make a living. Pollution was so bad that debris floating in the Cuyahoga River actually caught on fire, causing thousands of dollars in property damage. The water in Lake Superior, one of the most beautiful lakes in the United States, became so toxic from companies dumping asbestos-laden waste that local communities had to start filtering their water. Think about that. People could drink the water from local reservoirs, unfiltered, until pollution came along. This was the path our country was on.  Pollution was destroying some of the most beautiful places in this country--on the planet, in fact--putting the health of the public and the health of our economy at grave risk.  There was another event in the early 1960s that helped our country to see clearly that the path we were on would only lead to destruction. Rachel Carson, scientist, public servant, and author, published a book called ``Silent Spring.'' This book laid out in simple, beautiful prose the threats that pesticides and pollution posed to our environment or what Carson called a ``Fable for Tomorrow.'' She wrote: ``The most alarming of all man's assaults upon the environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers and sea, with dangerous and even lethal materials.''  Carson's book made clear that we were contaminating the environment and that this could not go on. Her book sounded a call for change, as millions of Americans began demanding that the government take action, but there was also a backlash. Here is what one industry spokesman said as public opinion began to coalesce around addressing pollution:       The major claims of Miss Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring      are gross distortions of the actual facts, completely      unsupported by scientific experimental evidence and general,      practical experience in the field. Her suggestion that      pesticides are in fact biocides destroying all life is      obviously absurd in the light of the fact that without      selective biologicals, these compounds would be completely      useless.  This is how the controversy went on for the next few years. The public, the science, and the reality all pointed toward the truth, but a few loud voices persisted. They did not want the movement to go forward. This continued even after Rachel Carson passed away, tragically and prematurely, of cancer in the year 1964.  Here is what the New York Times published in her obituary:       The most recent flare-up in the continuing pesticide      controversy occurred early this month when the Public Health      Service announced that the periodic huge-scale deaths of fish      on the lower Mississippi River had been traced over the last      4 years to toxic ingredients and three kinds of pesticides.      Some persons believe that the pesticides drained into the      river from neighboring farm lands.       A hearing by the Agriculture Department of the Public      Health Service's charges ended a week ago with a spokesman      for one of the pesticide manufacturers saying that any      judgment should be delayed until more information was      obtained.  The line of argument captured in the New York Times is familiar to anyone who has watched our Nation struggle to come to a shared set of facts around a number of difficult issues, but even in the face of so much controversy, the country did the right thing. In addressing the threats to our environment, the U.Government--with substantial and commendable support from Republicans--began to lay the foundation for a new America, one that would preserve and protect our country and its resources for the next generation.  I would like to highlight three of the critical cornerstones in the foundation: the EPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water  Let's start with the EPA itself. It was established in 1970 by President He united several offices and bureaus already in the Federal Government into a single agency--one that[[Page S1316]]would oversee all of the laws, protections, research, and policies about the Nation's environment. The mission of the EPA was clear from the start, to protect human health and the environment. Almost immediately, something really exciting happened. There was a feeling of hope and anticipation for what this Agency could do for the country. Within the first few months, tens of thousands of resumes came flooding in from across the country as people clamored to work for the  Here is how one man who worked for the Agency described it:       There was a palpable sense of excitement that we were about      to do something big. We had to do things big because the      newspapers and news magazines were filled with stories about      Lake Erie dying. I think it was a year or two before that the      Cuyahoga had indeed caught on fire. I believe the Houston      Ship Channel had the same issue. We knew we were there to      really deal with substantial problems, and we were going to      meet with immediate pushback.  For the next 40 years, the EPA would build a legacy of preserving and protecting the country's air, water, and natural resources, working to make our country a better place to live.  I just want to say that whatever the final disposition of this nomination ends up being--and I know we will push as hard as we possibly can for the delay of this decision, until we are able to see the contents of Mr.Pruitt's emails as directed by the court this afternoon--but whatever the decision is of the Senate under advice and consent, it is really important that this be said: EPA employees still have an obligation under Federal law to do their job, to protect air and water, to administer the Clean Air and Clean Water Act, to enforce the Endangered Species We are confirming a head of an Agency, but this new head of an Agency is not the Emperor of the  This new head of an Agency has obligations under the statute to enforce the laws on the books, and he has a current role as the lead of the Republican Attorneys General Association and as a plaintiff in multiple lawsuits against the EPA, and that is a reason many of us object to his confirmation. If he is confirmed, every EPA employee has rights. They have whistleblower rights, they have protections, and they have obligations under the statute so that if this EPA tries to do anything unlawful, anything that contravenes the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, then all of the EPA employees are dutybound under the law to follow the law.  No one in the Federal Government should be forced to do anything unlawful, and we support the EPA employees, in particular, who we know work so hard and are so dedicated to such an important cause. We know they are under intense scrutiny and pressure, and I think it is worth saying that we support them but also that the law supports them.  One of the first actions of the Agency was to ban DDT, a pesticide used in World War At first, DDT seemed like a dream chemical. It was used to protect soldiers from pests and then to protect crops like cotton, but soon it became clear--thanks to Rachel Carson and others--that this chemical was creating far more harm than good. Public health was really in danger. The bald eagle and other wildlife were being poisoned, and the pests that were supposed to be put off from bothering the crops were adapting, becoming more resistant, even as the chemicals became more potent and ultimately more dangerous.  Thanks to the EPA, the use of DDT came to an end. The health of children, families, and wildlife immediately improved. The bald eagle slowly recovered, to the point where it is no longer a threatened or an endangered species.  The Agency also found a solution to acid rain, which was a major problem that killed fish, hurt American farmers, and caused damage to forests and infrastructure alike. After studies showed how high concentrations of lead were hurting our kids, the EPA took action to remove it from gasoline and from the air. Because of that action, lead levels in both kids and adults have dropped by more than 80 percent since the late 1970s. We have a lot more work to do on lead, but that is one of the many EPA success stories.  The EPA then took on secondhand smoke, banning smoking in indoor public places. It pushed the auto industry to design technology that would reduce the amount of pollution created by cars, a step that would reduce the amount of pollution per mile emitted by cars by up to 90 percent. It provides technical assistance to State and local governments that otherwise don't have the resources or the know-how to tackle problems on their own.  The Agency has also empowered the public through right-to-know laws that give people access to information about chemicals, toxic substances, and pollution in their own communities. After studies show how low-income and minority communities face greater environmental risks, the EPA formed an Office of Environmental Justice, dedicated to making these communities as safe as any other in the country. As is so often the case, this Federal Agency set the bar for the rest of the world on how governments can protect and preserve the environment.  One leader of the EPA who served under President George H.Bush recalled that the Agency worked with countries as varied as Morocco and Mexico to battle fires or spills. After the EPA sent people to help with a Russian spill that was impacting Estonia, the Prime Minister wrote the EPA a letter, saying their visit was the most important visit of any American's since Charles Lindbergh had flown from Russia to Estonia in 1933.  So the EPA has had incredibly important impacts, from boosting diplomacy around the world to protecting the lungs of little ones right here at home.  The second cornerstone of our efforts to protect the environment is the Clean Air Before the EPA opened its doors, States set their own standards for clean air, and most States had weak standards because they were in a race to the bottom to attract companies that didn't want to have to deal with the damage they caused. Imagine you are in a State and have three or four adjacent States and someone wants to cite a factory. Well, it is very difficult to have a strong environmental standard because that factory is no doubt going to find the place where they are allowed to pollute the most, which is why you have Federal standards. Not surprisingly, these low standards were fueling air pollution.  Every day, the average American takes between 17,000 and 23,000 breaths. If the air we are breathing is filled with toxic chemicals, we are at risk for cancer, birth defects, and damage to our lungs, our brain, and our nerves. That risk is even higher for people with asthma and for senior citizens.  Remember, humans are not the only ones that rely on clean air. Trees, crops, wildlife, lakes, fish are all at risk of damage when we have dirty air. So eventually the American public demanded that something be done to clean up our air.  In 1970, Congress on a bipartisan basis, passed the Clean Air This law, along with later amendments, makes up the complete Federal response to air pollution. It is a beautifully written law. It gives the EPA the authority to limit air pollutants and emissions from industry plants. It empowers the Agency to research and fund different approaches to keeping the air clean. It creates partnerships between Federal, State, and local governments to reduce air pollution. Who could argue with that?  As soon as it was passed, people knew that this law was a game changer. President Nixon said: ``I think that 1970 will be known as the year of the beginning, in which we really began to move on the problems of clean air and clean water and open spaces for the future generations of America.''  That is exactly what happened. The impact was actually felt very quickly, starting with the auto industry. The Clean Air Act called on the auto industry to drastically reduce the amount of nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, and other harmful chemicals that came out of the tailpipes across the country within 5 years.  Consider that today there are more than three times the amount of cars on the road than they were in the 1970s. Now imagine that the chemicals coming out of each of those car's tailpipes were 90 percent more harmful. That is where we would be without the Clean Air  It was not so long ago that communities would cancel high school for kids because the air pollution was so bad, not in Beijing but in That is no longer the case, not for numerous[[Page S1317]]reasons, not for a dozen or so causes but because of the Clean Air This law has literally saved millions of lives. It has improved the health of millions of others.  Because the EPA has been there to enforce it, air pollution has fallen by 70 percent since 1970. Smog levels in Los Angeles have fallen from their peak by two-thirds. Nationwide, lead in our cars is down 98 percent, carbon monoxide is down 85 percent, sulphur dioxide is down 80 percent, acid rain is down 50 percent, and all at a fraction of anticipated costs.  Let me make two points here. First of all, it is actually rare that a law works this well. I mean, it is hard to make a good law. Everybody talks about it as a sausage-making process; you don't want to see what goes into it. But not all laws work over time.  This law actually worked. This law actually cleaned up our air. That is a really important thing to remember. If you undermine this law, if you undermine the agency that enforces it, the air does not clean up itself. This is not an automatic thing. The air is clean because the government protects the air.  I understand that, including the Presiding Officer and many Members of the Republican Party, we have tough debates about how big the government should be, what its responsibility should be. But if you go from Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, to Rand Paul, the sort of Republican libertarian--and I am not sure if you just sat down and had a cup of coffee with either of them or everybody in between on the political spectrum, in terms of their view of what the Federal Government ought to do, gosh, I can't imagine that anybody--if you kind of get them in a private moment--does not think that it is a Federal role to keep the air clean.  There are moments where I see a program within a Federal agency and I might love it, right, because of my political persuasion. But I can understand how a Ben Sasse or a Rand Paul or a Marco Rubio might object to it because they might say: Well, that sounds like a good idea, but my goodness, if that is so important, why don't we let communities decide whether or not to do that?  This is not one of those issues. Go and talk to your constituents about whether they want clean air. I don't know that you are going to find too many Republicans out there--I mean voters, not elected officials--voters, who think clean air is, take it or leave it, not a Federal role.  The truth is, that first of all, clean air is important enough to make a Federal law about in the first place. But there is also a technical reason, not a very complicated technical reason, but a technical reason that you need a Federal law that is about clean air as opposed to a State-by-State patchwork, and that is because the air travels. You cannot pollute in one State and expect that it will not impact the other  So one State having tough clean air standards doesn't really function in terms of the ecology because pollution knows no boundaries. The same study that I referred to found that air pollution has improved in the United States, thanks to environmental protection. But our work is not done. Nearly 90,000 people every year in the United States are at risk of a premature death because of air pollution. That number will rise if we chip away at this basic foundation.  The third and final cornerstone of that foundation is the Clean Water It is really important to remember how bad things were before the Clean Water I mean, we are not where we need to be in terms of protecting our water resources. But it is kind of unfathomable how bad it was before this law was passed.  Water in communities across the country was dirty. You could not swim or fish in two-thirds of the lakes, rivers, and coastal waters in the country. You couldn't swim or fish in two-thirds of the lakes, rivers, and coastal waters in the country. That is a data point that you would expect in a country that is still industrializing, that just doesn't have the pollution controls.  When you go to certain parts of the planet and you see essentially a very dirty environment, you would assume two-thirds, maybe more, of those lakes and streams and waterways are too polluted to fish or swim. But this is the United It was allowable to dump untreated sewage into open water. You could dump untreated sewage into open water before the Clean Water  But that changed in 1972, when what is now known as the Clean Water Act became law and cleared the way for the Federal Government to restore and protect the health of our water.  According to a study by the Aspen Institute, the Clean Water Act stopped billions of pounds of pollution from fouling the water and dramatically increased the number of waterways that are safe for swimming and fishing. Twenty years ago, you would have had to have a death wish to go swimming in Boston Today, you don't have to think twice. That is because of the Clean Water  But this is not just about enjoying the beauty of the water that it provides to so many communities, although not is not a small thing. Look, a lot of people--left, right, and center--people who are not political, people on the progressive side, people on the conservative side, people like lakes. People like the beach. People like the ocean.  It is not unreasonable, whoever you voted for, to think that there are a few things that government should do: They should probably have some kind of transportation infrastructure. There should probably be a law enforcement function. Make sure that the water is clean, the air is clean, and we have some national defense. Right? That is some basic stuff. Even if you are a libertarian, if you are not nuts, you think that the government should do a couple of very basic things, and among them is to keep the water clean.  I wanted to share some interactions I have had with the craft beer industry. They wrote a letter this week about how important clean water is to them. Here is a section of it:       Beer is about 90 percent water, making local water supply      quality and its characteristics such as pH and mineral      content, critical to beer brewing and the flavor of many      classic brews.       Changes to our water supply--whether we draw directly from      a water source or from a municipal supply--threaten our      ability to consistently produce our great-tasting beer, and      thus, our bottom line.       Protecting clean water is central to our business and our      long-term success. Not only does great-tasting beer we brew      depend on it, but so do the communities in which we operate.  Some of the largest and best craft breweries in the country signed onto this letter, from the Allagash Brewing Company in Maine to the New Belgium Brewing Company in They are right to be concerned because it will not take much for our water to go back to where it was in the 1970s. So it is in the interest of many industries for our country to have clean water, but not all of them.  Publicly traded companies will do the minimum. In a lot of ways, the way these companies are set up, they are actually obligated under the law to do the minimum. They have to maximize shareholder profit. They have boards of directors, they have earnings reports, they have quarterly obligations. Whether you like it or not, that is the way our system works. So, if you have a fiduciary obligation to maximize profits, then you may give short shrift to environmental concerns.  Compliance costs money. So most companies will comply only if they have to. If they are good companies, they feel that their obligation is to sit down with their lawyers and have the lawyers explain to them what they must do to comply.  But it is a rare company that says: Hey, I want to do much more than that. I mean Patagonia is great. There are other companies that do good work in the environmental space. But let's be very clear: There are a handful of companies that are so motivated, either as a brand strategy or a mission-driven approach, that they are going to exceed their obligations under the law. Most companies are going to do what is required under the law and not much more.  We can count on someone saying on a board of directors in some corner office or someplace on Wall Street: Hey, we can save 3 percent here if we don't clean the water. That is why we need a Clean Water That is why we need the It is not a matter of left or right; this is a matter of right or wrong. This is a matter of clean or dirty.[[Page S1318]]  This is especially important because our work is not done. We still have a ways to go. We still can't swim or fish in about one-third of our waterways. So these three cornerstones--this foundation of more than 40 years of progress--have prepared us to tackle what is the challenge of our lifetime, climate change. There was a time when this was primarily the concern of the conservation minded among us, people like me: hikers, swimmers, surfers green groups, bird and butterfly people. Right? I understand that.  There was a time where this was mostly an ecological concern. You had science people, you had hiking types who said: Hey, this thing is happening. I read Al Gore's book. This is a big deal. They were 10 years ahead of the curve. But climate change is no longer just an ecological issue; it is an economic issue. It is a quality of life issue. It is an American way of life issue. It is causing real harm to people and costing us billions of dollars now--not in the future, but now.  In recent years, the United States has experienced a record number of devastating storms, extreme temperatures, severe floods and lasting droughts. It is not a coincidence. As the climate changes, normal weather patterns are altered, and this affects our environment, our health, and our economy by influencing everything from the price of produce at the grocery store to our home insurance rates.  So we know that climate change is real. The science makes that clear. In fact, our own personal experience makes that real. A lot of people fish or hunt or hike or surf or snorkel or go to the lake or just go outside and experience something that seems to be changing.  There is a difference between weather and climate. The weather is tomorrow morning's temperature and whether it is raining or not and whether it is windy or not. The climate is the conditions that create the weather. It is not arguable anymore by anybody credible that the climate has changed and, therefore, the weather is getting absolutely more volatile.  Now we can, unfortunately, rely on our own experience and our own eyes to confirm that the climate and the weather are getting weirder--in some cases, more dangerous and certainly more unpredictable. Make no mistake, this is caused by humans, and that means we can do something about it.  Climate change deniers need to know that they are on the wrong side of history. They can't just cite the cost of transitioning to a clean energy economy--a cost that continues to decline, I should point out--while ignoring the cost of doing nothing, because the cost of doing nothing on climate change is absolutely astronomical, whether in storm aid, infrastructure mitigation, private property loss, or disruption in financial and insurance markets. It is much less expensive to move toward a clean energy economy than to allow severe weather to drain our economy as a whole.  As a Senator from the State of Hawaii who has led the way in building a clean energy infrastructure--producing clean, renewable energy and cutting our dependence on fossil fuels--I know that we can achieve meaningful change across our Nation, but we need the EPA and an Administrator to achieve this.  By law, the EPA has the authority to take steps to cut any pollution that threatens human health and welfare, including carbon pollution. Even the Supreme Court agreed that if EPA found carbon pollution to be a danger, the Agency was obligated to act to reduce the threat. So EPA has begun undertaking efforts to rein in those emissions.  Every protection that the EPA creates is the result of years of scientific inquiry, stakeholder involvement, public comments, and technological feasibility studies.  For all the talk of Federal overreach, EPA gives an enormous amount of authority to the For instance, in the Clean Power Plan, EPA sets emissions targets--that is true--but it was up to each State to develop a plan that is best suited to its unique circumstances.  The State of Hawaii has a really unique situation because we have lots of clean energy opportunities. But in terms of baseload power, we get all of our fuel from Asia, and it is It is low sulfur fuel oil. So what we do is we bring in oil on tankers, which is costing three and a half times the national average for electricity, and we light it on fire, and that creates electrons. That is not smart. So we are in a transition.  But there are other States that have geothermal resources or biofuel resources. So the EPA said: Hey, carbon is a pollutant. You have to reduce carbon pollution because, under the law, under the Clean Air Act, any airborne pollutant must be regulated, right? You have to reduce the airborne pollutants.  The EPA said: You have to do this over time, but we understand you are going to have your own energy mix and your own challenges. All you have to do is submit a plan that is kind of like thought through. So West Virginia's plan is different from California's plan and is different from Hawaii's plan. They empowered the States to endeavor to come up with their own energy mix.  Here is the good news about EPA's rules. This news is on the Clean Air It is on the Clean Power This is always the case. It always comes in below the estimated cost because what happens is, if you tell industry to innovate, even if they don't want to, frankly, even if they complain about it, even if they tell you that it is going to crash the American economy, which they often say, they end up driving innovation in the private sector.  In the case of electricity generation and transportation, the Clean Power Plan and the CAFE standards, the fuel efficiency standards for cars, accelerated the technological transition that was already underway.  Here are a couple of examples. When the auto bailout came in, President Obama negotiated very hard for an increase in fuel efficiency standards. You can imagine that the American auto industry was basically on the ropes. It was about to die without a major bailout. So they got the bailout, but there were also some strings attached, which were that they bring up fuel efficiency standards. They freaked out. And you know what happened? They met the standards. And you know what happened after that? The American auto industry has never been stronger because people like fuel-efficient cars, right?  What has happened with the Clean Power Plan and with the Paris climate accord and the investment tax credit and the production tax credit is that the cost of solar and wind energy is declining. But when utilities began thinking about long-term investments in a carbon-constrained world, the increased demand for clean energy drove down these costs even further, which is good for both consumers and the environment. In fact, more solar capacity was added in 2016 than any other energy source, by far. Solar and wind combined to make up almost two-thirds of the new capacity last year.  I want people to understand that the clean energy revolution is underway. The only question is whether we are going to have to take a 4-year break from this clean energy revolution and give the keys to the car to China and other countries, which would be pleased to let the United States abdicate its role as the leader of the clean energy revolution. We are going to lose all of those solar jobs, we are going to lose the innovation opportunities, and we are going to lose all of those wind energy opportunities.  The question is not whether we are going to make a transition to clean energy. The question is how quickly and whether the United States will drive it or not.  Consumers loved the first generation of hybrid vehicles so much that there were waiting lists to buy them. CAFE standards, along with similar fuel economy standards around the world, drove the automotive industry to innovate even further. Now we have unprecedented numbers of hybrid and hybrid electric vehicles on the road, and we stand at the precipice of a new age of electric vehicles.  So we find ourselves at a crossroads. If we continue down the path President Obama set us on, I have no doubt that American ingenuity and innovation will allow us to continue to lead the world in the clean energy economy, but if we turn back the clock and hand our future back over to the dirty fuels of the past, we will cede economic leadership to China, India, Germany, and the[[Page S1319]]rest of the world. Those countries are moving toward clean energy so quickly that we may never catch up; we may never be able to take full advantage of the economic opportunities that clean energy represents. It is sad, but it is true, that this is the path that our country will go on if Scott Pruitt is confirmed to lead the  I know for the public, after so many troubling nominees, that it is hard to wake up outraged for yet another nominee. But the reason to freak out about this one is very simple--clean air and clean water. Ask anyone who lived in L.or in Boston since the 1970s, and they can tell you that our country has clean air and clean water because of the laws that were put in place and the Agency that has done its job to implement them.  All of this will be in jeopardy with Scott Pruitt at the helm. He made his political bones trying to shred the EPA's ability to enforce the laws that protect clean air and clean water. Now this administration wants to give Mr.Pruitt the ultimate opportunity to lead the Agency that he has worked so hard to undermine. And he hasn't hidden the fact that he is utterly opposed to the  Let me highlight four statements that he has made that illustrate this point. He said: ``The EPA was never intended to be our Nation's frontline environmental regulator.''  The reality is that the opposite is true. The EPA was created for exactly that reason. Before the EPA existed, there were a number of offices and bureaus across the Federal Government that worked on protecting the environment, but the government saw--Congress saw--that it wasn't enough. Our Nation's waters were polluted, and the air was not clean. People were getting sick and even dying because there wasn't enough being done to protect the environment. So the intention behind the EPA was absolutely to put a single Agency on the frontlines of protecting and preserving clean air and clean water.  Not only does Mr.Pruitt disagree with the very mission of the EPA, but he also doesn't seem at all interested in the work being done by this He was asked during the confirmation process to name a single protection on the books at the Here is his answer:       I have not conducted a comprehensive review of existing EPA      regulations. As attorney general, I have brought legal      challenges involving EPA regulations out of concern that EPA      has exceeded its statutory authority based on the record and      the law in that matter.  I mean, just as a parent--forget my job as a Senator--as a parent and as a citizen, this really concerns me. I don't want to see the EPA led by someone who is basically given a softball question in the confirmation hearing: Name something you like about the But he declines to go on the record supporting clean air or clean water.  I mean, you would think that he could just say: Well, I like the Clean Water Act; I like the Clean Air He could even offer caveats, saying: I think there has been overreach, and I think there needs to be a recalibration. Say whatever you want, but he couldn't even bring himself to say he supports the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water That was the second comment that he made that was disturbing.  The third one relates to a Federal standard that targets pollution that decreases visibility. Mr.Pruitt had this to say about these standards:       [They] threaten the competitive edge Oklahoma has enjoyed      for years with low-cost and reliable electric generation.      This low-cost energy not only benefits Oklahoma      manufacturers, but gives our State a considerable edge in      recruiting new jobs.  What Mr.Pruitt is referring to is actually another reason why the EPA was created in the first place. When States were in charge of environmental protections, it was often a race to the bottom. Everyone would try to lower their standards so that companies would move plants and factories to their And the result is exactly what you would imagine. Companies were happy to meet the lowest standard possible, leaving huge messes for the State to clean up, and that is not a good use of our taxpayer dollars.  It isn't the government's job to allow companies to make a huge mess and say: Hey, we will clean that up for you. There is no need to clean it up. We have it.  Let's look at how this has worked out for I would like to read an article by journalist, author, and climate expert Eric Pooley, which was published by Time magazine:       Mercury is a deadly neurotoxin that damages the brains of      the ``developing fetus and young children,'' according to the      American Academy of It is spewed into the air      from coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources      before settling into lakes and waterways and contaminating      the fish we eat.       But Pruitt's challenges against the EPA's mercury standards      include a tidy piece of scientific denial, claiming ``the      record does not support the EPA's findings that mercury . . .      pose[s] public health hazards.''       After that legal challenge failed, Pruitt sued a second      time to block the mercury rules--even though virtually all      power plants had already complied with them at a fraction of      the expected cost.       Thanks in part to the EPA rules Pruitt opposed, mercury      levels in Atlantic Bluefin tuna are rapidly declining.  This isn't an abstract thing. If there are high mercury levels in fish and people eat the fish, they actually get the mercury poisoning. This happens in Honolulu all the time. We like our fish. And people go to the ER all the time. They don't know what it is, and it turns out that it is mercury poisoning.       But Oklahomans aren't so lucky. While Pruitt was busy      trying to kill national mercury rules, the number of Oklahoma      lakes listed for mercury contamination was climbing. This      year, the state lists 40 lakes with fish consumption      advisories due to mercury levels--up from 19 listed in 2010.      Eight lakes were added just this year.       Another Attorney General might have been trying to identify      the sources of the pollution. But Pruitt was apparently too      busy suing the       Pruitt also attacks limits on ground level ozone. The      ground level ozone--better known as smog--despite the fact      that ozone problems are huge and worsening in The      latest American Lung Association report gave all Oklahoma      counties surveyed an ``F'' for ozone problems and found that      the number of high ozone days had increased in most counties      as compared to 2010 to 2012.  The argument in this article can be boiled down to a single phrase: With Mr.Pruitt leading the EPA, we can bet that as goes Oklahoma, so goes the I can't speak for the people of Oklahoma, but I can say that when it comes to these kinds of statistics on polluted air and water, we would like to pass. If you ask most people in this country, they would agree that this is not the kind of environment they want their kids to grow up in.  The fourth disturbing statement Mr.Pruitt has made is about lead. Because of the EPA we have seen lead levels in both kids and adults drop by more than 80 percent in the past few decades. This is one of the legacy achievements of this This is something the next leader of the EPA should understand, but the senior Senator from Maryland, Mr.Cardin, raised this during a confirmation hearing. The Senator asked Mr.Pruitt if ``there is any safe level of lead that can be taken into the human body, particularly a young person.'' Another softball question.  Here is how Mr.Pruitt answered him: ``Senator, that is something I have not reviewed nor know about.'' This is pretty alarming because clearly he does not understand that in just 30 years this is an issue that the EPA has taken on as a high priority. This is an issue that we need the next leader to take seriously so we don't see any kind of backsliding. If you look at Mr.Pruitt's actions, they do, in fact, speak loudly about his approach to the Here is another news report:       The new administration is reportedly looking to close the      Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, and instead      let individual program offices handle enforcement. The outlet      inside EPA quoted ``a source familiar with the plan'' who      says the Trump administration intends to ``disassemble the      enforcement office . . . take it, break it up, and move it      back into the program offices.''       Environmental advocates were quick to point out that Scott      Pruitt--the Oklahoma Attorney General Trump picked to lead      the EPA--made almost the same move back home. Pruitt closed      his office's Environmental Protection Unit not long after he      took office in 2011.  Mr.President, how much time do I have remaining?  The PRESIDING The Senator has 14 minutes remaining.  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,2173,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,16.0,January
9138,topic-id,1470,"But Mr.Pruitt did more than close Oklahoma's Environmental Protection He also started a new unit solely dedicated to suing the He closed the Environmental[[Page S1320]]Protection Unit and set up a unit to sue the That is all they do--the other unit that people in Oklahoma might count on to investigate water contamination or illegal dumping. Mr.Pruitt's new unit has been quite active. Their office has filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the He has sued the EPA because of the way it tackles cross-state air pollution and the Agency's limits to oil and gas pollution. He sued to allow air pollution when facilities start up, shut down, malfunction, and to stop plans to address air pollution in his home  He sued the EPA because he disagrees with the Clean Power Plan, which will prevent an estimated 90,000 asthma attacks every year while saving American families money on their electric bill. He sued EPA to end protections against carbon pollution from new powerplants, even though these protections will cost companies very little to implement, and he challenged the clean water rule, which the EPA says protects the streams and wetlands that form the foundation of our water resources.  This is not a comprehensive list. I think there are 17 lawsuits he has filed. Guess what. Some of them are still pending. Mr.Pruitt was asked: Will you recuse yourself from the lawsuits in which you are the plaintiff? And he refused. So he is going to be the plaintiff and the defendant.  I am sure Mr.Pruitt is a good person, I am sure he is good to his family, but he also needs to be good to the American people and faithful to the law: the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species This is the foundation of what the EPA does. He doesn't get to have an opinion about those laws. He gets to implement those laws. If he wants to run for office, he can run for office and change those laws. If he wants to referee what authorities exist on those lawsuits, he can litigate, but if he is going to be the EPA Administrator, he has to check his ideological baggage at the door, and there is only one way we can be sure that he will not take his biases to the  I don't understand why in his confirmation hearing he didn't say: Look, anywhere I brought suit, anywhere I am a plaintiff, I am out. It is not unusual for a nominee to say on certain issues: I will recuse. There is ample precedent. It was done this year. It is also just plain common sense. It is the moral thing to do, the ethical thing to do, and it is politically smart because it is a problem that this person wants to remain plaintiff and defendant.  So it is disappointing and it is worrying. The agenda needs to uphold the Agency's mandate not to dismantle what the EPA has already done.  Senator Booker asked Mr.Pruitt how many kids in Oklahoma had asthma. Fair question to ask when you consider how many lawsuits Mr.Pruitt has filed against the EPA that if he wins will increase air pollution, and you can bet that more air pollution will hurt those kids who already have trouble breathing. Mr.Pruitt did not know how many kids in his home State have asthma, but here is the answer: 1 in 10--1 in 10 kids have asthma.  If Mr.Pruitt takes over the EPA, he is no longer responsible for just the kids in Oklahoma who have asthma. He is also responsible for the kids across the country and in my home State of There are millions of people in the United States who suffer from asthma, and for each and every one of them, not to mention the countless others at risk, Scott Pruitt guarantees that it will become harder to breathe. Scott Pruitt is going to guarantee that it becomes harder to breathe because he has sued the EPA to end the regulations that keep our air clean enough for us to breathe. Never before in the history of the Environmental Protection Agency has a President nominated someone so opposed to the mission of the Look, this administration has made it very clear where it stands on climate, on science, on protecting clean air and clean water.  We have seen climate change called the Chinese hoax. We have heard rumors that scientists will be muzzled and research stopped. We have seen the President sign a law that allows oil companies to hide what kinds of payment it is making to foreign governments in exchange for extracting oil. So there is no question that dirty energy is preferred by the current administration, but that doesn't mean the Senate has to be a rubberstamp here.  We are the Senate, and the United States Senate has a specific role under our Constitution and in our history. There comes a time where issues related to party have to be subsumed by issues related to the health and welfare of the country, and we have strayed from the bipartisan consensus that existed for decades and decades and decades, the basic premise that it is an American value in every small town, in every urban place from coast to coast, and everywhere in between, everybody likes clean air and clean water. Everybody at some point on a weekend wants to drive someplace or walk someplace and just be outside and be able to take a deep breath, enjoy your family, enjoy your friends, enjoy not having to work for 2 or 3 hours--go fishing, go hunting, go hiking, go surfing, go snowboarding, go skiing, whatever it is that people like to do to kind of restore themselves, that depends on our commitment to a legacy, and it depends on a commitment to these statutes. It really does. It depends on our commitment to the Clean Air Act and to the Clean Water Act and to the Endangered Species  I will just close with this. I have never seen the Senate in such a rush when there is not an actual deadline. I mean, we hurry when the government may shut down--and sometimes we screw that up too--but usually when we are in a hurry like this, when we are doing all night, there is a reason for it. I think it is just weird that congressional delegation trips overseas were canceled, multiple Members on a bipartisan basis were supposed to be meeting with NATO allies about 2 hours from now, but all of that got canceled.  Normally our vote is on a Thursday afternoon or a Friday morning, and this vote is at 1 p.m. on That is because somebody is bound and determined to get this vote done before those 3,000 emails between Scott Pruitt and a bunch of energy companies are disclosed. It is not a theoretical thing anymore. There was some talk about whether this was going to be disclosed. Now a judge is ordering that these emails get disclosed. Now everybody seems to be in an incredible hurry to make sure that we conduct this vote before those emails are disclosed.  I was talking to Senator Whitehouse and Senator Murphy about the content of those emails. I don't know what is in those emails, but here is what I know. I know the attorney general spent 750 days trying not to disclose those emails. I know they are between him and a bunch of energy companies. I know there seems to be a strong motivation on the Republican side to conduct the vote before we get the emails. And in the world's greatest deliberative body, it seems absolutely reasonable and consistent with our constitutional obligation to provide advice and consent on nominees and especially for a Cabinet position as important as this.  It just seems like we should probably wait to see what is in those emails. If I were a Republican on the other side, I would be very uncomfortable casting a ``yes'' vote, and I would be waking up Tuesday morning, probably at 1 a.m., and checking on the Internet and hoping there was nothing explosive in those emails. I hope there is nothing explosive in those emails. I don't want to know that we just confirmed someone who is inappropriate for the EPA, but we are going to know by  If my concerns are not well-founded, great. We can vote two Mondays from now, and we will have a new EPA nominee, but why not wait to find out what is in the emails. So I urge a ``no'' vote tomorrow, but more than that, I urge that we give ourselves the time to deliberate and to be a  I yield the floor.

9204,topic-id,1340,"Madam President, I rise today on two topics--the need for Attorney General Sessions to recuse himself from the executive branch investigation into General Flynn and the nomination of Attorney General Pruitt to be the EPA  First, on the matter of executive branch investigations into General Flynn's contact with the Russian Ambassador, I rise again to stress my expectation that Attorney General Sessions will recuse himself from this investigation.  This morning we learned--according to reports in the Washington Post--that General Flynn may have lied--lied--to FBI investigators about the content of his phone call with the Russian Ambassador prior to the election. That is a potential felony offense, and it must be looked at and, if validated, potentially prosecuted by law enforcement officials at the Department of That review must be independent and thorough and completely by the books. In order for it to be so, the Attorney General must recuse himself pursuant to Department of Justice guidelines that prohibit members of the Department from participating in investigations of close political allies or friends.  The guidelines are crystal clear. I have read them on the floor before, but they are worth reading because there is no wiggle room here. It is absolutely clear:       No Department of Justice employee may participate in a      criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or      political relationship with any person or organization      substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of      the investigation or prosecution. . . . Political      relationship means a close identification with an elected      official, candidate, political party, or campaign      organization arising from service as a principal adviser or      official.  Those are the words of the DOJ guidelines. Those are not my words, but they are common sense. We don't want conflict of interest in our prosecutors. We don't want the appearance of a conflict in something as sacred as law enforcement here in  It is patently absurd to think that the Attorney General--a man who served alongside General Flynn on Candidate Trump's campaign council--is prepared to lead this investigation in an impartial way and in full compliance with those longstanding Department of Justice rules. There would be a complete appearance of a conflict and might, indeed, be a conflict itself. By the guidelines, it certainly is. There is no wiggle room here. AGs have recused themselves at least eight times over the past two decades to avoid the appearance of bias--twice under President Obama, five times under President Bush, and once under President  To conclude my remarks on this topic, I want to show--and I ask unanimous consent that an op-ed coauthored by then-Senator Sessions calling on Attorney General Loretta Lynch to recuse herself in the matter of Secretary Clinton's emails be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From FoxNews.com, 05, 2016]Giuliani, Sessions, Keating, et al.: Time for Loretta Lynch to Appoint                            a Special Counsel(Editor's note: The authors of the following column are all supporting                       Donald Trump for president)       We are concerned about the egregious damage that has been      inflicted on two revered government agencies: the Department      of Justice and Department of The primary missions of      both have been derailed for political purposes.       The Department of Justice has been thwarted by its top      officials' refusal to conduct a proper investigation of      former Secretary Clinton's unsecured email server and the Pay      for Play accusations based on millions of dollars paid to      President Clinton personally and the Clinton Foundation by      entities having issues before the State Department, all while      she was       Attorney General Lynch and former President Clinton met on      the Phoenix, Arizona tarmac days before Secretary Clinton was      to be interviewed by the FBI for possible criminal activity.      It has been reported that her staff ordered witnesses not to      take pictures and no one was present during their 39-minute      conversation. General Lynch never recused herself from      decisions on the Clinton[[Page S1383]]     investigation after her self-admitted ``mistake,'' as it has      also been reported that she continues to deny the FBI the      authority to convene a Grand Jury, which is necessary for any      meaningful investigation. Secretary Clinton's conduct at the Department of State corrupted our                              foreign policy       It has also been reported that General Lynch opposed      Director Comey from fulfilling his obligation to Congress by      informing members of the discovery of 650,000 emails on      Anthony Weiner's and Huma Abedin's computer, the existence of      which had been concealed from government authorities.       Recusal is a formal process. It is a written document      specifically describing the scope of the recusal and      designating the official in charge of the recused matter. If      General Lynch went through the proper procedure for recusal,      she has not publicly shared it.       Secretary Clinton's conduct at the Department of State      corrupted our foreign policy. She and President Clinton      turned the agency into a Pay for Play adjunct of the Clinton      Foundation and their personal bank account, the latter via      his personal ``speaking'' fees. [UBS, Switzerland's largest      bank, contributed over $600,000 to the Foundation and loaned      it over $30,000,000. UBS was grateful that Secretary Clinton      had intervened in the IRS' demand to UBS to provide      identities of 52,000 depositors. Secretary Clinton announced      the settlement of only 4,450 identities in an ``unusual      intervention by a top U.diplomat,'' according to the Wall      Street UBS additionally paid President Clinton      personally $1,500,000 for a series of questions and answers      with top management.       President Clinton reaped $6,200,000 personally from foreign      governments and businesses for speeches while she was      Secretary of For example, Ericsson, a Swedish      corporation, had sanction issues pending before the State      Department regarding telecom sales in certain countries.      Ericsson paid President Clinton $750,000 for one speech. Days      later the State Department announced the sanction list and      Ericsson was not affected. Why should any spouse of a      Secretary of State be permitted ever to receive one cent from      a foreign entity?       Because of our grave concern for integrity in government we      ask for a Special When a high public official is      accused of serious wrongdoing and there is a sufficient      factual predicate to investigate, it is imperative the      investigation be thorough, with dispatch and without      partisanship.       Secretary Clinton is the subject of two spheres of criminal      conduct: her deliberate, systematic mishandling of official      and classified emails and her abuse of a family-controlled,      tax-exempt Foundation, and corporate and foreign donations      for her own economic and political benefit.       These allegations arose well before this election year.       Clinton's mishandling of emails became public in March      2015, and allegations over abuse of the Foundation arose well      before that. There has long been sufficient factual predicate      to require these matters be fully investigated.       The appropriate response when the subject matter is public      and it arises in a highly-charged political atmosphere is for      the Attorney General to appoint a Special Counsel of great      public stature and indisputable independence to assure the      public the matter will be handled without partisanship.       In 1991-1992, a Special Counsel was appointed for three      separate matters: House Bank, Iraqgate, and It was      also done in 2003 in the Valerie Plame matter.       Instead of moving with dispatch to ensure a vigorous      investigation of Secretary Clinton, it appears that the      Justice Department, along with State, have enabled the      Clinton campaign to ``slow roll'' the inquiry.       General Lynch continues to exert control of a matter that      she should have assigned to another official.       We are distressed by widespread and credible reports that      FBI agents have been hindered by the Justice Department's      withholding of basic investigative tools, such as grand jury      subpoenas, which are fundamental in a complex investigation.       It is time to do what should have been done long ago--     appoint a Special       Rudolph Giuliani--Former Associate Attorney General and      U.Attorney in Southern District of New York       Senator Jeff Sessions--former U.Attorney for Alabama's      Southern District       Frank Keating--Former Associate Attorney General, U.in      District of Kansas and Special Agent FBI       Victoria Toensing--former Deputy Assistant Attorney General      in the Criminal Division of the U.Justice Department       Henry McMaster--former U.Attorney, District of South      Carolina       Rudy Giuliani is the former Mayor of the City of New  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,16.0,January
9205,topic-id,827,"Senator Sessions, right here, called for Loretta Lynch--then Attorney General--to recuse herself because of a conflict of interest under the very same guidelines we cited. We hope and we pray that Senator Sessions doesn't have an enormous double standard by refusing to recuse himself now when he asked the previous Attorney General to do so. We hope that President Trump will abide by the guidelines and encourage Senator Sessions to go by the guidelines and not again invoke any double standard.  This op-ed makes it crystal clear. What was good enough for Loretta Lynch, who did step aside, is good enough for Attorney General Sessions, and it would be outrageous--outrageous--for him to be in charge of this investigation.  The op-ed says: ``When a high public official is accused of serious wrongdoing and there is a sufficient factual predicate to investigate, it is imperative the investigation be thorough, without dispatch and without partisanship.''  So I hope Attorney General Sessions takes the word of Senator Jeff Sessions to heart. Every day that goes by without a recusal from the Attorney General, the cloud hanging over this investigation and over this administration gets darker and darker. And every time the President and Attorney General Sessions confer, again, the cloud hovers over them: What did they talk about? Was it this investigation?  So I hope Attorney General Sessions will do the right thing and recuse himself. Justice, the American way, and separation of powers require no less.  Madam President, today we will vote on another Cabinet nominee who is clouded by potential conflicts of interest and whose views are almost antithetical to the very purpose of the Agency to which he is nominated.  Mr.Pruitt is a climate science denier--some say skeptic, but this is not an issue where you can be skeptical; either you accept the overwhelming opinion of climate scientists and researchers or you don't.  Here is Scott Pruitt on climate change on Oklahoma talk radio:       Well, reasonable minds can disagree what is actually      happening, whether it is happening, number one, whether there      is change in climate that is occurring, that the trajectory      of it is something that is sustainable and whether that is      actually happening . . . the debate about climate change is      just that, a debate.  I would invite this nominee to walk through Long Beach or Long Island or Staten Island in New York City in the days and weeks after Superstorm Sandy rocked my None of those residents--the thousands who lost homes, the hundreds of thousands who suffered injury, damage, economic problems from the flood--they don't debate it, nor should he. There was no debate there. Folks lost everything that belonged to them. There was no debate about that. Forty-eight people in my State died--no debate about that.  Climate change will lead to more devastating natural disasters like Sandy, which was the third 100-year storm to strike my State in a decade. Climate change will make asthma and respiratory diseases worse. It is increasing the range of deer ticks that cause lyme disease--no debate about that. We have to do something about climate change.  Scott Pruitt as head of our Nation's Environmental Protection Agency likely wouldn't lift a finger. But it is part of a lifelong pattern. Instead of fighting for average Americans, Mr.Pruitt decided to make a name for himself among the far right by endlessly suing the EPA in ways that would benefit large special interests that also happen to be campaign contributors. In 13 of his 14 lawsuits against the EPA, he joined corporations and trade associations that had contributed to his campaign.  Just yesterday, an Oklahoma judge ruled that Scott Pruitt must turn over approximately 3,000 emails relating to his communications with the fossil fuel industry--the very industry he represented in these lawsuits. We won't get those emails until So you would expect my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to be up in arms. Remember, emails? We should get them out, they said, about Hillary Clinton--the same group. In 2013, Gina McCarthy waited 122 days to be confirmed for EPA Administrator because she wasn't honoring a commitment, they felt, to transparency.  There were several inquiries into the emails of Lisa Jackson, another EPA But the majority and majority leader are proceeding right along and rushing Attorney General Pruitt through the process. We know why. They want you, my fellow Republicans, to vote for Mr.Pruitt before[[Page S1384]]those emails come to light. If they weren't worried about them, then why rush? It is not the worst thing in the world to take a few extra days to properly vet someone who will have immense power over our Nation's streams, skies, even the lead level in our homes and water supply.  Those emails could contain material information about his confirmation. But unless we move the confirmation back, the Senate will not get a chance to review those emails before voting on his nomination.  The PRESIDING The Senator's postcloture time has expired.

9300,topic-id,1668,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule. It is a fair rule that enables thoughts and ideas from both sides of the aisle to be considered on the House floor today. It enables us to proceed with the work that the American people have sent us here to accomplish. It is of great measure of the work that we are doing today. We had an extensive and long committee hearing at the Committee on Rules yesterday with witnesses from both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, who felt strongly about the issues and ideas that were before them and the ideas which will be presented on the floor of the House of Representatives today, the underpinning of which are entitled to give the American people a better shot at a better life not only from a business perspective, economic development, but also the creation of jobs in the United States of  Madam Speaker, I also rise in support of the underlying legislation contained in this rule. These bipartisan initiatives will enhance transparency, provide for a check on Federal agencies, and I believe help create a better process in the Federal Government for the people we serve, which are the people of this great  Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act in 1946 to ensure that the public had an opportunity to provide expertise, opinions, and other comments during the rulemaking process that takes place in the administration. It was designed to provide guarantees of due process in administrative procedures for self-governing American citizens who have to live under these rules that are promulgated by those unelected and not necessarily known by the American people.  The Administrative Procedure Act, known as the APA, as it is commonly referred to, was designed to require agencies to keep the public informed of the information and ideas, procedures, and rules, and to provide a means for public participation in the rulemaking process that would take place here in Washington, D. Unfortunately, as is too often the case, Federal bureaucrats over years and previous administrations have exploited the broad language of the Administrative Procedure Act to focus the rulemaking process solely for special interest reasons. Sometimes it is groups, sometimes it is ideas, and sometimes it is against the voices of the average American who wishes to participate in this process. This clearly was not the APA's legislative intent and reflects yet another encroachment on Congress' Article I powers which are enshrined in the United States  This shift away from the intent of the Administrative Procedure Act, known as the APA, has meant that most agency deliberations are carried out without a record or even a public review of those decisions that are made. Additionally, and possibly more troubling, agencies have undermined the purpose and the spirit of the notice-and-comment process by actively campaigning in support of their ideas using government resources and processes to that advantage.  The clearest example of this abuse can be found recently and numerously at the Environmental Protection Agency, known as the After issuing the waters of the United States notice of proposed rulemaking, the EPA undertook a public campaign utilizing social media platforms to solicit support for what was, at the time, a promulgated rule. Following this abuse, the GAO issued a report finding that the EPA violated propaganda and anti-lobbying provisions concerning the use of their fiscal year 2014 and 2015 appropriations.  The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017 helps ensure transparency in the rulemaking process by prohibiting Federal agencies from anonymously issuing statements for propaganda purposes, in other words, an agency lobbying for itself, its ideas, as opposed to the public comment period, final rulemaking, and then issues and ideas being discussed with and by the people of the country. Specifically, H.1004 requires agencies to make available online information about public communications on pending regulatory actions.  Further, H.1004 requires that agencies ``expressly disclose that the Executive agency is the source of the information to the intended recipients.''  Why is this important?  This is important because too many times information is provided without the basis of the facts behind it. It is opinion, Mr.When members of the public see information that is provided, a source should be behind that information.  Further, H.1004 prohibits agencies from ``soliciting support for or promoting . . . pending agency regulatory action.'' A simple concept of transparency and, I believe, professionalism that both sides of the aisle should not only demand, but also welcome from any executive agency, regardless of who is in the White It is in the best interest of the American public, and transparency and honesty related to that should be above reproach. Unfortunately, this has also not been the instance, as there are abuses and overreach by Federal agencies and unelected bureaucrats.  Presidents of both parties have required a centralized review of regulations since the 1970s. This has largely been handled by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, or OIRA, as it is commonly referred to. Every President since President Ronald Reagan has required a centralized review of regulations at OIRA so that an agency can do cost-benefit analysis of regulatory actions, which means there is a centralized process for the administration to look at what they do.  In 1993, President Bill Clinton put into place Executive Order 12866 to designate OIRA as the repository of expertise concerning regulatory issues. The executive order limited OIRA's review of regulations to only significant rules changes, those that have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. This office is responsible for reviewing the regulatory actions at both the proposed and final rulemaking stages. Unfortunately, lately, agencies have blatantly ignored the principles of the executive order from President Clinton, Executive Order 12866, and other governing authorities, including those requiring State, local, and tribal consultation in the rulemaking process have been ignored.  According to a policy center at George Mason University, agencies usually satisfy 60 percent or less of the requirements called for in the regulatory analysis, meaning that certain times we have found the executive branch did not even follow the well-known processes that are there to protect the people who they are trying to[[Page H1405]]provide services to. Mr.Speaker, we believe that is partially why we are here today, to clarify and correct these problems.  For example, between 2000 and 2013, 98 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency's final rules contained no estimated compliance costs. That means that the agency chose not to follow the process that is prescribed by the executive order. Additionally, the EPA routinely justifies its regulatory activities by claiming benefits from matters unrelated to the underlying legislation. Mr.Speaker, you can well see why there is consternation not only among people in the United States, but uncertainty with business that is attempting to follow the well-understood rules and regulations and the processes that go therein only to find out that our government chooses not to follow the rules and regulations that they should be following.  H.1009 codifies the requirement for OIRA to conduct a review of significant regulations to ensure the regulations are consistent with applicable law and the principles set forth in the executive order. It also establishes new transparency measures such as requiring increased disclosure when extending review time, explanations about regulations that are dropped from the unified agenda, and a redline of changes that agencies make to regulations while it is under review by  OIRA review is important to provide a double check on agencies to ensure not only compliance with the law, but the well-understood proposals that are made by agencies and the processes that they expect to understand in that process. That is why the main tenets of the underlying legislation have been supported by Presidents in the past, Members of Congress in the past, and even the judiciary that should expect that processes and procedures are followed properly.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to take a note, if I can, and add into the Record a Statement of Administration Policy that came from one of our former colleagues, now the Director of the OMB, the Honorable Mick Mr.Mulvaney, in his new duties as the Director of the OMB, provided his first Statement of Administration It is concerning exactly the act that we are speaking about. I would like to congratulate the young Director of the OMB for his ascension to not only an important role, but helping the United States Congress to clarify for the American people that which is in their best interest.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                   Statement of Administration PolicyH.998--Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily                          Burdensome (SCRUB) Act                (Smith, R-MO, and three cosponsors)              H.1004--Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017               (Walberg, R-MI, and eight cosponsors)        H.1009--OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act               (Mitchell, R-MI, and four cosponsors)       The Administration is committed to reducing regulatory      burden on all On January 30, 2017, President Trump      signed Executive Order 13771, Reducing Regulation and      Controlling Regulatory Costs, which provides for repeal of      two regulations for every new one issued. This historic step      accelerates the retrospective review process to make common-     sense reforms to regulations across the Federal      Legislation is helpful where it amends agencies' regulatory      processes to ensure they are transparent, and appropriately      balance costs and benefits.       Each of these bills would address different aspects of the      regulatory process. The SCRUB Act, H.998, addresses the      numerous outdated, duplicative, and otherwise unnecessary      regulations that have accumulated throughout government. The      Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, H.1004, would restrict      the use of agency funds to advocate on behalf of regulations,      and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act, H.     1009, would codify specific executive branch regulatory      review procedures.       The Administration supports the SCRUB Act, the Regulatory      Integrity Act, and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and      Accountability The Administration looks forward to      working with the Congress on technical and other amendments      to these bills.       The Administration appreciates the efforts of the Congress      to rationalize the regulatory system and looks forward to      continuing to work together to reform the regulatory process.

9302,topic-id,436,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate the gentleman's thoughtful observations on this rule and on the bills. I will acknowledge that yesterday at the Rules Committee there was a vigorous discussion--I thought, professional on both sides--where there was an idea about the intent of this bill and what it would, in essence, lay off on the administration, or any administration, in trying to make sure that they complied with the law.  I will tell you that our Appropriations chairman, as well as the Appropriations Committee, would be able to deal effectively with this if they believed they needed more money in order to accomplish these efforts. But I think that transparency is an important issue, and I think that our authorizing and appropriating committees will understand that, as they deal with agencies, a better dialogue, whether it be Republican or Democrat in office, needs to be able to deal with Congress, provide us information, provide the American people with information, and be forthright about the decisions that they are going to make.  I think that the new Director of the OMB, the Honorable Mick Mulvaney, responded in his advice back--meaning the statement of administrative policy that directly took on this issue--that he looked forward to not only working with Congress on their needs, but also complying with the spirit of the law. I believe, Mr.Speaker, that what we are doing today is providing information to a brand-new administration and saying to a brand-new administration that it is okay if you have your ideas about those issues that you would wish to take up, but you have to be forthright about what you are doing. You have to provide information not only to Congress, but the American people; and when you propose changes or rules, you have to be honest and forthright in doing that.  It may be a little bit more money, but this Congress will stand behind this. And I believe that the new Trump administration, at least through my conversations with our new President and the head of OMB, they intend for across the government, across a new administration to attempt to be forthright and direct about what they are doing and why we are doing it. Now, more than ever, whether you are a Republican or Democrat or not--you could be a person back home--you are entitled to try and clarify and ask information. That is what we are doing.  Mr.Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.Newhouse), a member of the Rules Committee, who served his State honorably as their agriculture commissioner.[[Page H1407]]    ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgH1403-5.txt,1548,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1004, REGULATORY INTEGRITY ACT OF",2017.0,1.0,February

9308,topic-id,1422,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the debate today has been fair and above board. I want to congratulate and thank the gentleman from Colorado not only for his service on the Rules Committee, but his service today in annunciating not just his party's policies and ideas on this, but also his own, as he brings a vast business experience not only to Congress and to the Rules Committee, but to serve the people of his congressional district.  However, with that said, Mr.Speaker, I think that this will be overwhelming success on a bipartisan basis today, and the reason why is, because what we are doing is in the best interest of the American people.  We are doing this because the American people want and need an opportunity, as they petition their government, to know that they were heard, for their issues and ideas to be seen. And I would think now more than ever, especially if it were a prior administration, we would be accused of trying to jam down their throats something that we saw that was trying to put an undue burden on another administration. But, in fact, we are not.  And so the thoughts and ideas today should be--regardless of the administration, regardless whether you completely agree, or somewhat disagree,[[Page H1408]]we would want that government, that agency to be able to operate with the confidence of the American people. And that means that they are not there for their own purposes, or special interests, or for them to skew facts or information that might be provided to the American people, but, in fact, were opinions as opposed to something that was reasonably gained as a result of a scientific fact or information that was based on facts of the case.  Mr.Speaker, the regulatory state in this country has grown exponentially and, really, to unprecedented levels. Unelected bureaucrats have exceeded their authority, they are creating regulations, they are negatively impacting the marketplace, which causes a problem for me back home, and Members of Congress back home, as businesses talk about following rules and regulations rather than the marketplace, and trying to add employees and to turn the cash register.  Accordingly, the American Action Forum, when totaling all available regulatory costs reported by executive agencies, the Obama administration imposed more than $600 billion in regulatory costs from 2009 to 2014. That is $600 billion worth of regulatory costs imposed on the American people by unelected bureaucrats that have increasingly become unaccountable, not only to economic growth, but also to the American people, and I believe to  Other studies have produced the same conclusion and it is this: that runaway regulations have a disastrous effect on the United States economy, impacting not only job creation, but also the effective opportunity for the free enterprise system to exist.  Federal agencies should exist to serve the American people. And as such, they should heed and respect their views and comments, while staying within the parameters of laws passed by lawmakers or ensuring the rulemaking process is transparent and free of propaganda.  Mr.Speaker, we appreciate you allowing us time to debate this on behalf of the American people today. This rule and the underlying legislation will provide an important check on the regulatory state that we find exists today in the United States, and to return transparency, responsiveness, and, I believe, honest dignity to the American people that we serve, for this overreaching process. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 156 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       Sec 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign      Interference in the 2016 All points of order      against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate      shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour      equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking      minority member of the Committee on Foreign After      general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment      under the five-minute rule. All points of order against      provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of      consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall      rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as      may have been adopted. The previous question shall be      considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to      final passage without intervening motion except one motion to      recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of      the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution      on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House      shall, immediately after the third daily order of business      under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the      Whole for further consideration of the bill.       4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.356.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

9188,topic-id,3099,"Madam President, I rise in support of Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and I think it is important, as we are continuing this debate, to make a couple of things perfectly clear.  We all, like the Senator from Delaware who has been leading the debate, believe in clean water, clean air, how important that is to all Americans, certainly important to my State, which has some of the cleanest water, cleanest air, the most pristine environment in the world. I certainly don't think any of us debate that. We all agree on properly disposing of waste and cleaning up contaminated sites. And just this past year, Congress passed very dramatic legislation, very important--bipartisan, by the way; I am on the Environment and Public Works Committee--the Toxic Substances Control Act, TSCA, which does that. And I think most of us agree that the EPA has an important role in ensuring that we have clean water--within the authority granted to that Agency by So I think the vast majority of this body agrees with that.  But as I have been listening to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and their criticism of Attorney General[[Page S1376]]Scott Pruitt, one thing that has not come up over the past 24 hours in this debate--as a matter of fact, on the EPW Committee, on which I sit, the past 2 years, I don't think I heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle ever talk about this issue, and it is a very important issue for the country. It is the rule of law and the U. We have been debating Scott Pruitt's nomination for a while now, but not one of my colleagues has uttered that phrase--not one--even though many of my colleagues are lawyers and former law professors and former attorneys general themselves.  Why is this important? Why is it important to have a debate on the rule of law when we are looking at Scott Pruitt's nomination?  Well, I think it is incredibly important because if you looked at the EPA's actions and activities and focus over the last 8 years--the last 8 years--it has not been an Agency that has focused on the rule of law. In many ways it has been a lawless Agency, a rogue So when we are having this debate, we need to put the debate of Scott Pruitt's nomination and confirmation in the context of what has happened over the last 8 years.  We have had an Agency in the EPA that does not listen to States, even though it is required to by Federal law; that ignores the rule of law, as evidenced by numerous Federal court decisions rebuking it; and that believes it has the power to regulate every nook and cranny of American life--every economic activity of That is literally what we have right now with regard to our current This is not just one Senator making this claim. It has become the conventional wisdom and the common narrative with regard to this EPA in the last 8 years by a variety of Federal courts and law professors throughout the country.  Let me provide a few examples. A number of my colleagues have talked about the waters of the United States rule, WOTUS, and how this aggressive, far-reaching rule claims authority--the EPA claims authority to regulate literally puddles and irrigation ditches throughout the country, an enormous power grab.  A number of us were concerned about this. In hearings and in letters, I asked the previous EPA Administrator, Gina McCarthy, where she got the legal authority to do this. It was a pretty big deal. It took months to get an answer. States, under the law, are supposed to be consulted on this issue. States like my State, the great State of Alaska, were not consulted. They were ignored.  So what happened? What happened? Thirty-two States--bipartisan by the way, including Alaska--sued the EPA over this law, over this regulation, the waters of the United This is a critical point. ``Cooperative federalism,'' another term I have heard very little of in this debate, is the bedrock of environmental laws like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air The principle establishes that the States and the EPA are partners. Indeed, under these Federal laws, the States are the primary protectors and implementers of our environmental protection laws.  That is in the law. That is in the Federal law. But for the past 8 years, the EPA has consistently ignored this on major rules. The most dramatic is right here, the waters of the United Thirty-two States sued to stop the EPA on this regulation. What happened in the lawsuit? The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals put a stay on the entire rule, expressing serious doubts about its legality. That is one instance and a big deal.  Let's look at another one, the so-called Clean Power I know the Presiding Officer has talked this, about how it is very concerning for her State of West Whatever your views are on climate change and the appropriate response, there should no debate in this body that we have to address this issue in a way that is consistent with the U.Constitution and rule of law--no debate.  Again, I never hear anyone talk about the rule of law on the other side. So this rule is promulgated. Once again, the Environmental Protection Agency, in the promulgation of this rule, took actions that the court and commentators across the political spectrum viewed as likely another illegal rule by the  So, like the waters of the United States rule, numerous States and others sued to stop the Clean Power Plan, in which the Environmental Protection Agency claimed somehow they had the authority to regulate almost the entire U.energy sector. Look at the rule. That is what they are claiming, that Congress somehow gave them that power.  In a previous Supreme Court case called Utility Air Regulatory Group, which was a lawsuit against the EPA--at the time I was serving as attorney general for the State of Alaska and was one of the AGs who initiated this suit--the EPA lost that one, and the Supreme Court and Justice Scalia, in writing the majority opinion stated:       When an agency, the EPA, claims to discover in a long      extant statute an unheralded power to regulate a significant      portion of the American economy, we typically greet its      announcement with a measure of skepticism. We expect Congress      to speak clearly if it wishes to assign an agency decisions      of vast economic and political significance.  In other words: EPA, you didn't have the power to regulate a huge swath of the American economy. The Supreme Court struck that down--Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency--so it was not surprising that with regard to the Clean Power Plan regulation, the Supreme Court of the United States put a stay on that rule. The Supreme Court of the United States put a stay on that rule before any other court, any other lower court, a district court, a court of appeals, had heard the arguments on that rule. Think about that. Do you know how many times the U.history that has happened? Do you know how many times in the history of the U.Supreme Court that has happened? Never before. It was the first time in the history of the Supreme Court that it saw a rule that it probably felt was so egregious that it put a stay on it before any other court ruled on that rule. It was pretty dramatic, pretty remarkable.  Clearly, the U.Supreme Court has serious doubts about whether the EPA is acting in a lawful manner on the Clean Power If you think it is just conservative jurists and lawyers and Senators who hold that view, you would be mistaken. Here is what Laurence Tribe said about the EPA's authority with regard to the Clean Power  For those of you who don't know Laurence Tribe, he is a very well-respected constitutional law professor at Harvard but very liberal. He was President Obama's law professor, but he is well-respected. Here is what he said about the EPA's authority on this very important regulation. He wrote in challenging the Clean Power Plan:       Even more fundamentally, the EPA, like every administrative      agency is constitutionally forbidden to exercise powers      Congress never delegated to it in the first place. The brute      fact is that the Obama administration failed to get climate      legislation through Yet the EPA is acting as though      it has the legislative authority anyway to re-engineer the      nation's electrical generating system and power grid. It does      not have this power.  That is Laurence He later testified in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in 2015 with regard to this regulation:       The EPA is attempting to exercise lawmaking power that      belongs to Congress and the judicial power that belongs to      the Federal courts. Burning the Constitution should not be      part of our national energy policy. EPA is attempting an      unconstitutional trifecta: usurping the prerogatives of the      States, Congress and the Federal courts all at once.  That is Laurence That is Harvard professor Laurence Tribe, who believes EPA is clearly acting in an unconstitutional manner.  It is not just losing in court and in the realm of both conservative and liberal leagues of public opinion; it has been the way that the EPA leadership, from the top to its foot soldiers, has treated the American people over the last 8 years--the American people whom the Environmental Protection Agency is supposed to serve.  That treatment can be described in many ways as with disdain. Let me provide a few examples of that. On the eve of another Supreme Court case, which the EPA lost--this is EPA v. Michigan--EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy was asked on a TV show, Did she think she was going to win the case?  She responded as you would think most Administrators would. She said[[Page S1377]]yes, she was going to win. That is fine. She probably believed it and had good lawyers telling her that. But then she went on to say this:       But even if we don't [win], it was 3 years ago. Most of      [the companies] are already in compliance, investments have      been made, and we'll catch up.  Think about that quote. This is the head of the EPA, essentially saying: Even if we lose, we win. We are the Federal We don't have to abide by the law. Those companies and American citizens who are abiding by the law, who are abiding by the regulations, they have already made investments--hundreds of millions. They are stuck. We win. Heads we win, tails we win. That is a remarkable statement by the leader of a Federal Agency who shows disdain for the law.  Let me give you another example. My colleague and good friend from Colorado came down and talked about the Animas River and what happened there. Clearly it was a mistake. I don't believe that the EPA meant to do that, to spill millions of gallons of toxic waste into a river. But in a hearing in the EPW Committee, I asked the Administrator: Well, are you going to hold the EPA officials who did that to the same standard you would the private sector? In the private sector, in similar kinds of activities, the EPA has actually criminally charged people for doing something like that--negligence--criminally charged them.  She looked at me and said: Senator, not only are we going to hold ourselves to that standard, we are going to hold ourselves to a higher standard.  That is a pretty good answer.  So what has happened on the Animas River, with the EPA holding themselves to a higher standard? Remember, they put people in jail for doing this. Was anyone held responsible? Was anyone criminally charged? Did anyone go to jail?  Of course not. Nothing happened.  In my State, the EPA's disdain for my constituents has manifested itself in a couple of remarkable ways. First, we had the Administrator, former Administrator Gina McCarthy, in Alaska visiting after she came into office.  There was a big Wall Street Journal article on her visit. She was given some gifts by Alaskans, my constituents, the people she serves. When she was given gifts from my constituents on her visit to my State, she was later asked by a reporter what she did with them according to the government ethics rules.  Here is a quote from that story:       [Gina McCarthy] has been surprised by the government ethics      bureaucracy and its gift guidelines. Remarking how officials      chased her down for a dinky North Pole--  That is a community in Alaska--       pin someone gave her at an event as a gift (``I threw the      f-ing thing away,'' she told them).  With regard to another gift she got, a jar of moose meat from a young girl at a hearing in Alaska, she said that gift ``could gag a maggot.''  This was the leader of an Agency serving the people, and yet she was doing it in a way that is clearly disrespectful.  Let me talk about another incident in Alaska, in a place called Chicken, AK, where we have plaster miners out mining--small mining operations, family businesses, mining for gold.  The EPA thought there was going to be some Clean Water Act violations, which they never found. So what did they do? They didn't talk to the local community. They did a raid--body armor, assault weapons--on my constituents, a raid, a military assault to find clean water violations, which they never found, and they never apologized for the raid.  Now, you might ask: What does all this have to do with the nomination of Attorney General Pruitt? My answer is: Everything; everything.  He understands that the EPA needs a serious course correction, that it must get back to listening to the States and following the rule of law and, most importantly, regaining the trust of the American people, which has been lost over the last 8 years due to some of the actions I just described.  The American people see this. They see statements like this, and they know this has been an Agency that has not been acting in their interests and has not been acting according to the law.  Not only does Attorney General Pruitt understand this, he emphasized this during his confirmation hearing--6 hours long, which I sat through the entire thing.  Let me conclude by reading a few excerpts of his opening statement. The American people need to hear this because this is what Attorney General Pruitt is going to do when he leads the He said his priorities were:  First, under our Constitution, the role the EPA plays in protecting the environment is defined by statute, just as statutes limit every Federal  Members of this body--the Senate--and the House of Representatives have worked tirelessly over decades to set the balance in environmental policies through laws that have been passed. The EPA's role is to administer those laws faithfully.  As attorney general of Oklahoma, he stated: I saw examples where the Agency became dissatisfied with the tools Congress had given it to address certain issues and bootstrapped its own powers and tools through rulemaking. This, unfortunately, has only resulted in protracted litigation, where the courts suspended most of these rules after years of delay.  In the meantime, we lost the opportunity for true environmental protection as a nation. This approach is not right. So getting back to the rule of law, that is 1 for Attorney General  Second, he said:       Cooperative federalism must be respected and applied by the      EPA with regard to our environmental laws. Congress has      wisely and appropriately directed the EPA through our      environmental statutes to utilize the expertise and resources      of the States to better protect the environment, and for the      States to remain our nation's frontline environmental      implementers and enforcers. If we truly want to advance and      achieve cleaner air and water the States must be partners and      not mere passive instruments of federal will. If confirmed, I      will utilize the relationships I have forged with my      counterparts in the States to ensure that EPA returns to its      proper role, rather than using a heavy hand to coerce the      States into effectuating EPA policies.  Cooperative federalism--that is in the law, and he wants to uphold it.  Third, and finally, he said:       It is critical to me that EPA also truly listen to the      diverse views of the American people, and learn from them. If      confirmed as Administrator, I am committed to ensuring EPA's      decisions are conducted through open processes that take into      account the full range of views of the American people,      including the economic consequences of any regulation.       Environmental regulations should not occur in an economic      vacuum. We can simultaneously pursue the mutual goals of      environmental protection and economic growth. But that can      only happen if EPA listens--listens to the views of all      interested stakeholders, including the States, so that it can      determine how to realize its mission while considering the      pragmatic impacts of its decisions on jobs, communities, and      most importantly, families.  Finally, in the closing of his opening statement, Attorney General Pruitt said this:       My time as Attorney General of Oklahoma afforded me the      opportunity to travel my state meeting farmers, ranchers,      landowners, and small business owners of all sorts. These are      good people--hardworking Americans who want to do the right      thing by the environment. They want the air that their      children breathe and the waters in which they swim to be      clean. They want to follow the law. But recently they have      felt hopeless, subject to a never ending torrent of new      regulations that only a lawyer can understand. They fear the      EPA, and that just shouldn't be the case. If confirmed, I      will work tirelessly to ensure that the EPA acts lawfully,      sensibly, and with those hardworking Americans ever in mind.  That is how he ended his testimony.  Scott Pruitt is the right person to lead the We have gotten to the point, as he noted in his testimony, where millions of Americans, including some of my constituents in Chicken, AK, certainly have come to fear their own Federal Government, especially when it acts in a lawless fashion.  He is exactly the right person, with the right qualifications and the right emphasis to fix this problem, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support the confirmation vote we are going to make on him in a few hours.

9286,topic-id,803,"Mr.President, I have been coming down to the floor for the past several months recognizing Alaskans who make our State great and our country better for all of us. I really enjoy doing this because it gives me an opportunity to share the excellent work my citizens are doing in their communities. It also gives me a few minutes to highlight to all my colleagues here in the Senate--and to some of those Americans who might be watching at home--to talk a little bit more about the unique place I call home and am honored to serve and represent in the  This week, I would like to honor pilot Glen Hanson, who is right now somewhere flying above racing sled dogs in the far north in Alaska, literally as we speak.  Before I get to how he is helping Alaskans and how he is this week's Alaskan of the Week, let me take you back through a remarkable bit of history that happened in Nome, AK, in 1925, when a diphtheria serum was desperately needed for the children in The nearest batch of serum was 1,000 miles away in Anchorage, There weren't--and still aren't--any roads that connect Nome to There was very challenging winter weather during this time, so no airplanes could fly. In fact, the nearest train station was over 700 miles away from Nome, so people traveled mostly by dog sled.  On the night of January 27, 1925, musher ``Wild Bill'' Shannon tied a 20-pound package of serum wrapped in protective fur around his sled. He and his nine dogs started the journey called then the ``Great Race of Mercy'' across the frozen Alaska land. Miles later, he met up with another racer and another team of dogs, and the relay continued all across Alaska, over 1,000 miles--20 mushers and 150 sled dogs--through some of the world's most rugged terrain and some of the world's most brutal weather. In fact, right now in parts of Alaska where the Iditarod is happening, it is 40 to 50 below zero.  That original race, the Great Race of Mercy, began to be reenacted, with some twists, in 1973 and continues today. In fact, it is going on right now, the Iditarod, the Last Great Race, in my great People from all across the world come to participate in it and come to watch it. It is the quintessential Alaskan event that involves the work of hundreds of Alaskans, lodge owners, veterinarians, dogs, dog handlers, volunteers, pilots--hundreds, thousands.  Alaska, as you might know, is home to more veterans per capita than any other State, but we are also home to more pilots per capita than any other Our pilots are a vital part of our economy and transportation, and they are a vital part of the In fact, the race couldn't exist without them.  Every year, more than a dozen volunteer pilots load their planes for the Iditarod race with more than 100,000 pounds of dog food, hundreds of bales of hay, and lumber for tents. They fly the veterinarians, the judges, the dog handlers, and so many of the volunteers out to the checkpoints hundreds of miles away. We call them the Iditarod Air Force, and every one of them deserves recognition.  That gets me back to Anchorage resident Glen Hanson, who is our Alaskan of the Glen, along with his brother Bert, is tied among this year's pilots as the longest serving volunteer in the Iditarod Air He began volunteering for the Last Great Race--the Iditarod Air Force--in 1984. Glen has since put in roughly 1,500 hours of volunteer time, making sure that the Last Great Race continues and that the dogs and the mushers are taken care of--taken care of right now in 40 to 50 below zero, as this race is going on.  This year, Glen won the Alaska Air Carriers Association Iditarod Humanitarian Service Upon receiving it, the Air Carriers Association wrote to Glen:       You are obviously an accomplished pilot held in high regard      by your peers. While there are many volunteers working to      make the race possible, you consistently go above and beyond      the call of duty. You are always quietly willing to take      every assignment, no matter how unglamorous or uncomfortable.      You step up time after time to fly in the challenging air      strips to ensure that the musher supplies and race personnel      are available to keep the race safe.  Thank you, Glen, for all you do to keep our great Alaska history alive. And thanks to all the pilots in the Iditarod Air Force this year and so many of the other volunteers who keep everybody safe--and are doing it right now during this year's And to all the mushers and these great dogs, good luck.

You tell me, and we will yield back and get this done.  I want to talk about the nomination of Scott Pruitt and how this important vote will impact my home So many folks call Montana home today because their parents or grandparents or great-grandparents pushed west to start a new life in the homestead era. My family is no different.  I am proud and honored that my wife and I are still able to farm the land that my grandparents homesteaded over a century ago. I know that it does not matter if you are growing alfalfa, winter wheat, spring wheat, safflower, or garbanzo beans. I know it doesn't matter if you are raising cattle or sheep or hogs. You have to have access to clean water or you cannot succeed in agriculture.  In Montana, agriculture is the number one industry. Local economies around our State are driven by that agriculture economy, whether it is farms or ranches. In a good year, our State's wheat production alone will clear a trillion dollars.  This production not only helps create jobs and farms and ranches but it boosts the bottom line for the local grocery store, the hardware store, and local construction crews keep busy. Agriculture is the backbone of Montana's economy, but it is not the only industry in Montana that relies on clean air and clean water.  Montana's outdoor economy is growing rapidly every year. Hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping generate over $6 billion and sustain over 64,000 jobs in Montana each and every year. More folks are visiting Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks every summer.  And when they visit, these folks spend millions of dollars in communities outside the parks. Communities like Gardner, Livingston, Coram, and Columbia Falls constantly have packed restaurants and bars and hotels, thanks to our clean water and our clean air.

9220,topic-id,992,"Madam President, folks are coming to Montana from all over this country because of our clean air and clean water and the habitat it provides. Not only Montanans, but this entire country respects clean air and clean water. In fact, in Montana, it is Montana's Constitution that says we value clean air and clean water.  The reason we place such a high importance on clean air and clean water is because we see what happens when it is put at risk. On numerous occasions, Montanans have been victims to corporations who treated Montana like a Third World country. They reaped the value of our natural resources, and then they left the American taxpayer to clean up the mess. Folks like the Anaconda Company, W.Grace, Glencore, just to name a few.  They left a mess. It wasn't the EPA that left that mess. It was these corporations, and it is the EPA's job to make sure they clean up this mess, not out of the pocketbook of the American taxpayer. These folks, these corporations, have put our clean air and clean water at risk. Not only did they contaminate the land, they contaminated our local economies. One of the largest Superfund sites in this country is in Butte, It took 16 years, nearly $150 million to clean up just a portion--just a small portion of what the Anaconda Company left behind after mining copper in Southwest  In Libby, hundreds of people have died, and over 1,000 people are ill because of asbestosis due to asbestos exposure. Even though a local vermiculite mine closed in 1990, folks are still getting sick due to asbestos-related diseases.  And for years, I have been fighting alongside the folks at Columbia Falls, MT, to hold Glencore accountable to that community for the cyanide and arsenic they left abandoned on the banks of the Flathead River near the gateway of Glacier National  Companies that put our clean water at risk cannot be trusted because they never stick around to clean up the mess they have made. We have seen it firsthand. And that is why we need an EPA Administrator who is going to side with the American taxpayer, with local economies, with local families, and hold the polluters and contaminators accountable for their shortsighted actions.  It is for these reasons that I cannot support Scott Pruitt's nomination for Administrator of the Throughout his career, he has consistently sided with the big polluters over the local businesses and the local families.  I am not convinced that Mr.Pruitt understands the critical role that clean air and clean water plays in agriculture and our outdoor economies. In my conversations with Mr.Pruitt, I received no assurances that he will be a[[Page S1388]]champion for Montana's family farmers, ranchers, those who love to hunt, fish, and hike in Big Sky Mr.Pruitt has endorsed policies that will put Montana jobs at risk and put our outdoor heritage on the ropes.  Don't just take my word for it. Thousands of Montanans have contacted my office regarding Mr.Pruitt's nomination. Caitlin from Libby wrote me:       No community understands the grave impact lack of      regulation or failure to enforce environmental regulations      can have on a community like Libby does. Four hundred people      died in Libby because W.Grace mined vermiculite that was      contaminated with asbestos. . . . These people died . . .      when they were just doing their job. Libby doesn't want or      need another person that looks the other way while big      corporations prey on hard-working people.  Stephen from Corvallis wrote:       I am a farmer in Montana, and I regularly use pesticides,      where I hope the EPA has my back to make sure these things      are safe for me and the environment. . . . Farming continues      to be less predictable, due to a change in climate. I want      someone in that position that has my back as a farmer, not      someone that questions broad scientific consensus.  Rich is a retired public lands manager from Stevensville who wrote me saying this about Pruitt:       Is not fit to be leading an agency responsible for      protecting wildlife, clean water, clean air, and leading the      charge of addressing a changing climate. Pruitt is anti-     science, routinely disregarding well-established studies      involving climate change. I recently retired . . . the      thought of the possible damage and undoing of what I've lived      and worked for over my [entire] life by this man is      disheartening to say the least.  Look, folks, the Earth's climate is changing. There is no ifs, ands, or buts about that. If we want to be able to continue to take our fly rod and go fishing down those rivers, you have to have somebody in the EPA who will ensure that we have clean water and clean air. I will tell you something that happened in Montana for the first time this year. The Yellowstone River closed. The bottom reason for it was the water warmed that much. If you are going to have good habitat for fisheries, if you are going to have good habitat for elk and big game hunting, if you are going to be able to go up in the mountains and hike, fish, bike, and do the things we do in Montana, you have to have somebody in the EPA that makes a difference.  What we do today will not be felt today. It will be felt tomorrow. That is why today we need a man in the position of EPA who will fight for clean water and clean air. It is critical to our survival, no ifs, ands, or buts about it.  Stephen, Caitlyn and Rich are right. We need folks in the administration who will stand up and understand the value of clean air and clean water. Unfortunately, the President has nominated someone who can't deliver.

Mr.Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.26, the REINS In a minute, I want to share an experience I had a few months ago which will explain why, aside from the Constitution, I think it is important that we rein in unelected bureaucrats.  When we talk about regulatory reform, it is sometimes hard to understand the impact regulations have on our economy. That is for the simple reason that someone who goes in for a job interview never sits there and is told by the employer: I would love to offer you the job, but I can't because of the crushing regulatory burden coming out of And that is because the crushing burden of regulations causes the job not to be created in the first place; and, hence, there is no interview for the job.  The experience I had a couple of months ago, I was back home, and I met with the Michigan Restaurant There were 8 or 10 folks sitting around and telling me about the issues that are important to them.

9190,topic-id,2322,"Madam President, I also rise today to oppose the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection  I believe the President should be able to assemble his or her own team, and I understand that elections have consequences and that a President should be able to put forth his or her policy agenda. I voted on this floor many times in support of nominees with whom I have policy differences, but they have been qualified persons, experienced in their field, who believe in the fundamental mission of the agency they are tasked to lead. That is not the case with Attorney General Mr.Pruitt has extreme environmental policy views, and he has zero experience running the Environmental Protection In fact, he does not believe in the fundamental mission of the Attorney General Pruitt made his name opposing EPA rules that protect human health and the environment--fighting against clean air and clean water, disregarding the science behind the EPA's protections for human health and the environment on behalf of for-profit special interests, not the public interest.  He has brought 19 suits against the Eight are currently pending in courts, and if confirmed, he won't recuse himself from all the pending cases. As a lawyer and especially as your State's top lawyer, you shouldn't change sides in litigation. It is just not right. There may be an ethics violation here. I have never heard of a lawyer representing both sides of a case.  Let's look at just a few examples from his litigation records, starting with his opposition to clean air. Mr.Pruitt is leading litigation against the EPA's ozone or smog rule. In 2015 the EPA revised its ambiant air standards[[Page S1379]]for ground level ozone. The EPA was long overdue in revising its ozone standards to protect public health. It even had to be sued by States and environmental organizations to make sure the standards adequately protected human health. High concentrations of ozone are bad for public health, children, and older adults, and people with lung diseases such as asthma are especially vulnerable.  The EPA set a standard of 70 parts per billion. This standard is based on the best science, which included thousands of studies analyzing the effects of ozone on public health. In addition, the EPA built in flexibility for States that would have trouble meeting the standard. But the Oklahoma attorney general currently leads a four-State charge to do away with the rule.  Mr.Pruitt thinks it is OK for powerplants to emit unhealthy levels of mercury and other toxins into the air. In 2011, the EPA passed the mercury and air toxics standards. This rule limits emissions from powerplants of mercury, arsenic, and other metals. Like the ozone standard, this rule was long overdue, and the EPA was forced by the courts to develop the standard.  The science is well established that these toxins are a serious public health threat. Fortunately, there are proven and available technologies to limit the emissions. Scott Pruitt fought the mercury and air toxics standards, and he is still litigating in court against the standards even though the vast majority of powerplants in the Nation are currently in compliance with the standards.  Just to show you how serious this is in my home State of New Mexico, pregnant women and children can only eat a very small amount of fish from the streams of New Our streams are polluted with mercury. The levels are so high that vulnerable populations are advised to severely limit their consumption. Scott Pruitt wants to continue this pollution of our streams.  Mr.Pruitt testified in the hearing before the EPW Committee that he saw a role for the EPA to address pollution that crosses State boundaries, but his litigation history does not support that testimony. As Oklahoma attorney general, he fought the EPA's cross-state air pollution rule, a rule designed to reduce powerplant emissions across State lines that cause smog and pollution and health problems in downwind Especially, the cross-state air pollution rule reduces sulfur dioxide, or SO 2, and oxides of nitrogen or NOX emissions. NOX emissions contribute to fine particle and soot pollution and to ground level ozone formation, otherwise known as smog. Even though this pollution affects the air and health of downwind States, Mr.Pruitt sided with the powerplants.  Air pollution is not the only problem that crosses State lines. River and stream pollution does not stop at State boundaries either. The EPA and the U.Army passed the clean water rule in 2015. The rule clarified a dizzying set of Supreme Court cases defining protected water. The EPA and the Army reviewed the best science, reviewing more than 1200 peer-reviewed public scientific studies to define protected waters.  New Mexico is an arid We have very little surface water. We need to protect all of our surface water for domestic, agricultural, industrial, and recreational uses. By the way, the EPA and the Army's definition of surface waters is no broader than my own State's definition of surface waters. New Mexico's definition is appropriate and reasonable to protect our precious surface water.  The attorney general of Oklahoma is fighting the clean water rule, too, even though it protects against cross-state pollution.  Here is one more example--the Clean Power The Clean Power Plan is our country's best effort to address climate change. We know that climate change is happening. We know that the climate change is primarily caused by humans. We know that powerplants are a major contributor. We know that we need to take action and that we need to take action fast to protect our planet. The Clean Power Plan significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions from existing, modified, and future powerplants. The Clean Power Plan was developed based on the best science. It was developed based on a tremendous amount of input from the States, industry, environmentalists, and others. It provides States with a lot of flexibility with how to comply. Mr.Pruitt, true to form, is litigating against the Clean Power Mr.Pruitt apparently does not understand the science of climate change.  In the National Review in 2016, he wrote: ``Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.'' During his confirmation hearing, he similarly stated:       Science tells us that the climate is changing and human      activity in some manner impacts that change. The human      ability to measure the extent of that impact is subject to      continuing debate and dialogue as well as they should be.  That is not what science tells us. That is maybe what fossil fuel special interests tell him, but that is not what science tells us. His views are not consistent with the scientific consensus on climate change. The 2013 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found it ``extremely likely'' that more than half of the global warming that occurred between 1951 and 2010 was a consequence of human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  So many of the decisions made and the regulations passed by the EPA rely heavily upon good science. It is absolutely critical that the EPA Administrator understand and use the best science.  I am not convinced that Mr.Pruitt understands and will use the best science if he is confirmed to lead the  When developing regulations, the EPA must first follow the law's requirements to protect human health and the environment. Then, within the law's requirements, the EPA should take account of input and information from all sources--from industry, environmentalists, States, and public agencies.  I am not convinced that Mr.Pruitt will follow the law's requirements to protect public health and the environment, and I am not convinced that he will take into account the input of all stakeholders. Throughout his career as attorney general, Mr.Pruitt has aligned solely with industry and against public health and the environment. He has no record of aligning with the public or of securing our environment for the future.  As attorney general, he engaged in a scorched earth policy against environmental regulations. He dismantled his environmental protection unit. He became very close politically to the energy industry. He adopted letters written by energy lobbyists almost verbatim, and then submitted them on behalf of the State of Oklahoma in Federal legal proceedings.  As chair of the Republican Attorneys General Association, he became even more closely aligned with the fossil fuel-related companies.  Mr.Pruitt's record is one-sided and extreme, and it does not give me confidence that as EPA Administrator he would have any commitment to protecting the public health now or protecting the environment for future generations.  Finally, I am concerned that Mr.Pruitt has not shown and does not have the proper respect for tribal sovereignty. Oklahoma is home to 39 tribes. Mr.Pruitt's litigation history as attorney general has consistently been anti-tribe. As vice chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I pay special attention to a nominee's record on tribal issues, especially nominees for agencies that will deal with tribes on a government-to-government basis, like the  As Oklahoma's top attorney, Mr.Pruitt routinely sought out ways to fight tribal sovereignty--even all the way to the Highest Court in the land. In Dollar General v. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mr.Pruitt filed an amicus brief in support of a corporation that refused to submit to tribal jurisdiction. Mr.Pruitt's side lost. This case is a prime example of Mr.Pruitt's misguided views of tribe and their inherent sovereignty. Indian Country needs an EPA Administrator who respects tribal sovereignty. I am not convinced Mr.Pruitt does.  Just recently we had in town the National Council of American They submitted a letter on January 18. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.[[Page S1380]]  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              National Congress of                                             American Indians,                                 Washington, DC, January 18, 2016.     Re Indian Country's Concerns with EPA Administrator Nominee          Scott     John Barrasso,     Chairman, U.Senate Committee on Environment and Public          Works, Washington,     Thomas Carper,     Ranking Member, U.Senate Committee on Environment and          Public Works, Washington,       Dear Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper: On behalf      of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), the      oldest, largest, and most representative American Indian and      Alaska Native organization serving the broad interests of      Tribal governments and communities, I am writing to express      our deep concern with the nomination of Oklahoma Attorney      General Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) based on his history of      fighting environmental regulations and the new      Administration's statements denying the existence of climate      change. The continuing impacts of climate change are a major      concern of Tribal Nations and, before this Committee votes to      move forward with Attorney General Pruitt's nomination to      lead the EPA, it must thoroughly consider the potential      impacts that his nomination will have on climate change, the      protection of natural resources, and protection of Tribal      trust and treaty rights.       American Indians and Alaska Natives are disproportionately      impacted by climate change due to our geographical areas and      direct connection and reliance on the surrounding      environments. It is threatening to destroy our lands, waters,      and natural resources, which will impact our traditional and      customary ways of life that has been sustainable for      thousands of years. The well-documented plight of Alaska      Native villages is probably the most profound manifestation      of the climate crisis and requires focused, high priority      attention from the federal government. NCAI's Tribal      leadership and members have spoken strongly on climate change      by passing four resolutions in the past four years calling      for action and setting Tribal Climate Change Principles      calling on further federal action and partnership with Tribal      governments.       The federal government's treaty and trust responsibilities      to protect Indian lands includes the duty to protect lands      from the impacts of climate change, which requires not only      that sufficient federal resources be equitably allocated to      address climate change, but that Tribes be included as      partners to solve these issues. Federal programs and policies      must allow Tribal Nations to engage effectively in adaptation      and mitigation strategies that will help ensure the integrity      of our cultures, homelands, infrastructures, and services.      Further, it is imperative that federal agencies enforce      Tribal treaty and reserved rights to both on- and off-     reservation resources.       The EPA's mission to protect human health and the      environment means that it plays an essential role in fighting      climate change-related impacts. Due to its charge, EPA also      has a sacred responsibility to uphold and protect Tribal      trust and treaty rights through the protection of Tribal      natural resources. In fact, the EPA acknowledges the      importance of reviewing how agency actions will impact treaty      rights in its recent policy guidance EPA Policy on      Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribes: Guidance      for Discussing Tribal Treaty       Since the EPA is critical to combating climate change and      protecting Tribal trust and treaty rights, Indian country is      deeply concerned with Attorney General Pruitt's nomination to      head the It is our understanding that, in his role as      Attorney General for the State of Oklahoma, Pruitt has      repeatedly filed suits against the EPA for its regulations      seeking to protect the environment. Further, his nomination      comes from an incoming Administration which claims that      climate change is a ``hoax'' and questions whether the EPA      should continue to exist.       This Committee must ensure that attorney General Pruitt      understands and acknowledges the realities of human impacts      on global climate change, the need for the EPA and federal      regulations to protect the environment, and the importance of      EPA's role in protecting Tribal lands, waters, and natural      resources. We must get his commitment on the record to      sustain the EPA's role in fighting climate change and      protecting Tribal trust and treaty rights. Without these      acknowledgements, Indian Country cannot support Attorney      General Pruitt's nomination for Administrator of the       We are at a critical moment in combating the increasing      climate changes effects from human-made sources.

9191,topic-id,551,"Madam President, I would like to just read a couple of paragraphs from the letter.       On behalf of the National Congress of American Indians      (NCAI), the oldest, largest, and most representative American      Indian and Alaskan Native organization serving the broad      interests of tribal governments and communities, I am writing      to express our deep concern of the nomination of Oklahoma      attorney general Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the      Environmental Protection Agency based on his history of      fighting environmental regulations and the new      Administration's statements denying the existence of climate      change. The continuing impacts of climate change are a major      concern of Tribal Nations and, before this Committee votes to      move forward with Attorney General Pruitt's nomination to      lead the EPA, it must thoroughly consider the potential      impacts that his nomination will have on climate change, the      protection of natural resources, and protection of Tribal      trust and treaty rights.       American Indians and Alaskan Natives are disproportionately      impacted by climate change due to our geographic areas and      direct connection and reliance on the surrounding      environments. It is threatening to destroy our lands, waters,      and natural resources, which will impact our traditional and      customary ways of life that have been sustainable for      thousands of years.       We are at a critical moment in combating the increasing      climate change effects from human-made sources. Indian      Country, the United States, and the world cannot afford to      take a backseat role in fighting climate change.  In conclusion, my concerns about Mr.Pruitt's record on environmental policy aren't just because we disagree on policy. Mr.Pruitt has made his reputation in litigating fiercely against the EPA's most important regulations to protect public health and the environment, clean air, clean water, toxics on land--you name it--regulations that comply with Federal environmental laws that are based on good science, that have taken years to prepare, and that have taken fair account of all stakeholders' input.  I cannot support a nominee to lead this Agency whose record is so hostile to the environment. For all of these reasons, I must vote no on Mr.Pruitt's nomination to be EPA  Finally, we have today the court's ordering Mr.Pruitt to release a large number of records that are relevant to this particular nomination. He has refused to release them. The administration, in vetting him, did a very poor job. As you know, they do not vet anybody. They throw it up here, and we have to do the vetting. That is our job to do the vetting. This is a critical part of the record--a vast number of emails that should be looked at.  Many of us believe we should have the time to look at these emails, to deliberate about them, to maybe even ask some written questions to Mr.Pruitt about them, but this nomination is being rammed through. In a couple of hours, we are going to have a vote. Luckily, Senator Merkley is going to urge that we vote to delay this so we can have a chance to look at those emails. It is so that all of us--all of the 100 Senators--have the opportunity to have a full, complete record on Mr. Madam President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

9250,topic-id,168,"Mr.Speaker, President Trump today plans to unravel the Clean Power Plan that, once implemented, would reduce carbon emissions by 870 million tons, the equivalent of 166 million cars.  Why? False science, false economics.  Some of the best minds of the 18th century apparently are advising President Trump on science matters. This planet is melting. We have had the worst wild weather in centuries; the three hottest years on record. Let's not deny what is before our very eyes, false economics.  President Trump apparently believes we have to make a choice: either jobs or a clean environment. The exact opposite is true; 8.1 million people worldwide work in clean energy. It will be 24 million in 2030. Solar jobs in Vermont grew at the fastest pace of any jobs.[[Page H2470]]President Trump believes we either have jobs or a clean environment. He has it exactly wrong.

9146,topic-id,11532,"Thank you, Mr. There is a lot we don't know about Scott We know that thousands of emails between this man and the industry that he is supposed to be regulating as EPA Administrator have been suppressed by him for years. We know that just yesterday a court found that suppression of his emails unreasonable, an abject failure of his duties under the law to disclose. Those ought to be alarm bells for the side of the aisle that is forcing, jamming this nomination through.  He told us he couldn't get these emails released for more than 2 years, and the court ordered him to release the first chunk Tuesday, just days from now; the second big chunk, 10[[Page S1333]]days from now. So clearly there has been some mischief here, when on the one hand this office pretends that it can't get the emails out for more than 2 years, and a court looks at the situation and says: You make them available That is not a sign of good things.  2, this is a guy who, as part of his political money operation--a political money operation that is heavily funded by big fossil fuel industry players about whose carbon emissions he will be making vital decisions as EPA So far, his relationship with them has been to take their money and to be their lawyer. That is not a good start, either, for an EPA  Here is the other thing we don't know: We don't know about his dark money operation. The Rule of Law Defense Fund--the whole reason you set up something like that is to hide the source of money that you use in politics. That is why the entity exists. It is to take groups like this and launder their identities right off of them so that, when money shows up, for instance, at the Republican Attorneys General Association, it is not attached to Devon Energy; it is not attached to ExxonMobil; it is not attached to Murray Energy; it is not attached to the Koch brothers or to their front groups--Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity--it is not attached to the company whose billionaire president was his finance chairman for his campaign, Continental Resources; it is not attached to the Southern Company and to other big energy companies. It just comes out of the Rule of Law Defense The identity of the donor has been scrubbed away. It is an identity laundering machine.  These are the relationships that are forged when you are asking people for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and $1 million a year was the budget for the Rule of Law Defense If you are asking for that kind of money from these people, it is elementary that the Senate should know about that, but our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have completely stonewalled this--zero inquiry into the dark money operation that this individual was allowed.  Why is that? That is pretty unusual. Why were we not allowed to get these emails? Why were we told: Oh, you will have to line up behind everybody else in this FOIA line that I have maintained for 2 years. That was an adequate answer to the majority on the EPW Committee, but the judge who took a look at that same situation said: No, you get them If the chairman had said: No, you get them Tuesday, we wouldn't be having this problem. We would have seen them weeks and weeks and weeks ago.  All of the pressure from the majority on this nominee has been to cover up this stuff. Don't let it in. Nothing to see here, folks. Move along. Move along.  That is not right. That is not the way the Senate should behave. That is not consistent with our advice and consent responsibilities, and, frankly, it sets up Republican If and when it ultimately does come out that there is significant mischief exposed in those emails or if there are significant conflicts of interest created by that dark money operation, the Senate does not look great for having used its energy and effort in this nomination to cover that stuff up.  There is a doctrine called willful blindness, which is the wrongful intention to keep oneself deliberately unaware of something. It is a culpable state of mind in criminal and civil law. That is the state of mind that is being maintained by the majority with respect to this individual, and one has to wonder why. Why are there these big things that we don't know about Scott Pruitt?  It is not that we didn't ask. It is that we got told by the majority: Run along; it doesn't matter. You will have no support from us. We are going to clear this guy anyway. It doesn't matter if his answers to you make no sense. It doesn't matter if his answers aren't truthful. It doesn't matter if his answers put you at the end of a long FOIA line when this is the Senate's advice and consent process. None of that matters.  Just by one point of evaluation, the difference is that, when the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works looked at this, they said: Run along; nothing here. We are not interested. Don't show us a single email.  And the judge looking at it said to get them out Tuesday--a local State judge.  Since when is the double standard in which Senators are deprived of seeing highly relevant evidence? What is being covered up and why? Who is pulling the strings around here so that these obvious questions don't get answered when you put it side by side with a State court proceeding that asks the same question and the questions get answered like that. Something is rotten in  It hasn't fooled Rhode My correspondence is running about 50 to 1 against Scott Over 1,000 Rhode Islanders have written in against him. Let me just read a couple of their communications with me.  This is from Amanda Tarzwell:       As a member of the Committee on Environment and Public      Works, I urge you to do all you can--  ``All you can,'' she says--     to block Mr.Pruitt's nomination as the head of the My      grandfather, Clarence Tarzwell, worked for the EPA and opened      the EPA lab in  Narragansett is a Rhode Island town.       It is located on Tarzwell Drive in his honor. He is now      deceased, but I believe in the work he did and the necessity      to protect our environment and continue to work on climate      change. Please do everything you can to urge your fellow      committee members on both sides of the aisle to do the same.      Thank you.  On the next, her name is right in the letter. So I will read it:       I am a 23-year-old woman with a bachelor of science degree      in wildlife and conservation biology from the University of      Rhode       I am writing to respectfully demand you vote ``no'' on the      approval of Scott Pruitt for Administrator of the      Environmental Protection It is extremely clear that      Pruitt is the WRONG choice to head the       As someone with an extensive education in environmental      sciences, conservation, wildlife and plant biology,      chemistry, and physics, I am deeply concerned with Pruitt's      capabilities. A climate change skeptic, with no formal      science-based education, Pruitt has zero concept of what it      takes to make informed decisions about the current and future      stakes of our environment.       Rhode Island is leading the country in many environmental      fields, such as renewable energy, environmental protection,      and sustainable agriculture and aquaculture. We cannot allow      a climate change skeptic, with a love affair with fossil      fuels, to make important decisions regarding our precious      environment and those working hard to protect it.       I urge you to vote no on the approval of Scott Pruitt for      Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Catherine Hoyt wrote in:       I have a special concern for the upcoming vote on the EPA      Director, Scott I know you are on the Committee for      Environment and Public Works so you are more informed than      most people--  Although, as I just explained, we are deliberately underinformed in some very telling ways--     and I trust that you are unlikely to vote contrary to the      interests of our beautiful and environmentally unique coastal            Among other things I do, I am a sailing instructor in      Edgewood, in  Cranston is another one of our municipalities.       I have been sailing in the Upper Bay for about 10 years.      Even in that amount of time, the bay is noticeably cleaner.      The water is clearer, and there are more birds and fish and      crabs and other creatures that signify, through my direct      experience, that the environment is healthier in the Upper            My anecdotal evidence is also confirmed by scientific      reports from URI--  The University of Rhode Island--     over the summer that Narragansett Bay is cleaner now than it      has been in 150 years. I would be very sorry to      see that trend reverse. I am old enough to remember what it      was like before the EPA, and I do not want to go back to      smog-filled skies, polluted waters, and tragedies like Love      Canal and Woburn's poisoned well water.       I am sure that, if it were not for the EPA and groups like      Save the Bay--which is a local environmental organization--     that the Upper Bay would have become more toxic and polluted      due to industrial use, sewage, rainwater runoff, pesticides,      and road salt. What is more, I believe that the EPA      regulations have been good for business. Because pollution      is, ultimately, wasteful and counterproductive, and clean      businesses often are efficient and, therefore, more      successful businesses. Look at the careful reutilization of      materials by companies like Apple, who are investing in the      future and their profitability by going further than      required. They are nearly cash neutral at this point.  Some of that is through buying carbon credit, but, clearly, they are not[[Page S1334]]afraid of being environmentally responsible.       As a concerned citizen of Rhode Island and America,      regarding President Trump's nomination for head of the      Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, I believe      deeply that this is not the person for the job, that there is      nothing in his background that suggests he has any interest      in protecting American citizens and their health and      environment from harm. I have never written any of my      congressional Representatives in my many, many years on this      planet until today.       I remember the air quality in Rhode Island in the late      sixties and through the seventies-plus. Those visible brown      clouds, especially in the summer, as pollution and smog      drifted from New York or Connecticut towards Rhode I      remember the pollution in our beautiful Narragansett I      see the changes ocean rise has already effected.       Climate change is real, and it is scientifically accepted      across the world. I am deeply troubled by Mr.Pruitt's      statements and legal actions he has instigated against this      I am asking you to take a stand for the health of the      citizens of Rhode Island and the American people. Please vote      no when the votes are called for Mr.Scott Pruitt's      nomination.  Here is the last one I will read:       As a retired Federal scientist, meteorologist, I am deeply      concerned that the EPA continue to be an agency that makes      decisions about our environment that are based on the best      science available.       Scott Pruitt has a record of supporting policies that are      pro-business at the expense of the environment despite what      the science shows. How can he possibly be considered as the      voice that will fight for clean air and clean water? Despite      excellent progress over my lifetime, pollution continues to      be a major problem for the air we breathe and the water that      sustains us.       Please join the voices on the Hill that block the      appointment of Scott Pruitt as EPA Thank you.  I wish we could block the appointment of Scott Pruitt as EPA It is really rare to see a nominee for a Federal agency who is as unqualified--indeed, as disqualified by conflict of interest--as this individual. As for the idea that he is being jammed through just as thousands of emails are going to be released about him--between him and his big funders and the groups that they funded him through--something is wrong. This is not the way the Senate should behave.  The people on that side--in taking all of this mystery, all of this mischief, all of the emails, all of the dark money--who are being asked to vote are being told: Don't even look at that.  I can promise you that if the shoe were on the other foot, Republicans would be clamoring for emails.  This is a grim day for this Chamber--what we are doing here, knowing of this man's record, knowing of his record of shutting down the environmental agency in his home State while attacking the environmental agency of the Federal Government while pretending that his concern is federalism; right? He has pretended that he thinks that the enforcement responsibility shouldn't be at the Federal level, that it should be down at the State level. But if that were even remotely sincere, he wouldn't have shut down his own office's environmental enforcement unit as the attorney general of  The common thread here is that he doesn't want any environmental enforcement at the Federal level and he doesn't want any environmental enforcement at the State level. He shut down the unit. He zeroed out the budget. He gave us a bunch of soft soap about how actually he moved the environmental unit into something called a federalism unit. But if you look at his own website for the federalism unit, the word ``environmentalism'' or ``environment'' doesn't appear. It is news that that is his environmental enforcement section, because it doesn't say so on his own website. That was an invention just for the hearing.  When you look at his own budget, the amount he budgets for environmental enforcement disappears. It has gone to zero. When you look at the Environmental Enforcement Task Force that his office's environmental unit had participated in under the previous attorney general, Drew Edmondson, that has disappeared too. He has gotten rid of every element of environmental enforcement that he controlled at the State level, while taking money from all of the big polluters, while having the CEO of Continental Resources--a billionaire--as his fundraising chair.  He took money from the fossil fuel industry through all of these different entities--through his leadership PAC, Liberty 2.0; through his campaign, Pruitt for Attorney General; through his super PAC, Oklahoma Strong PAC--sorry, that is his leadership PAC, and Liberty 2.0 is his super PAC--through the Rule of Law Defense Fund, which is his dark money operation. By the way, whatever the attorney general needs is a dark money operation. Really? Through the Republican Attorneys General Association, which he raised money for, and who knows what else.  This guy is fully fossil fuel funded. And in his entire career, he has dedicated himself to getting rid of and attacking environmental enforcement wherever he finds it--at the State or Federal level. You can't beat shutting down the environmental unit in your own office.  So that is what we are looking at. When you look at that combination and throw in the secrecy about the dark money operation and this mad rush to get this guy through before the week is out in which these emails come out, it stinks.  What we are doing here is a deliberate act of sabotage of the orderly and honest operation of an agency of our government. We are putting in a person who can demonstrably be shown to be incapable of and disqualified for those duties. I think that is actually not a bug in this program; that is the feature. That is the feature because these same forces that have been behind Scott Pruitt all his life, as he has fought all environmental enforcement--State and Federal--are awfully powerful in this Chamber as well, and they are obviously calling the shots at the White House, where a nominee like this would come from.  We are in the process of deliberately sabotaging the orderly and honest operation of an agency of the U.Government, not at the behest of a foreign power but after a special interest--the biggest and, in my view, the foulest special interest in the world today--the fossil fuel industry.  The fossil fuel industry has become so big and so powerful and so mercenary that it has decided its best investment is no longer in oil fields or coal seams or fossil fuel processing plants, but in acquiring a controlling interest in the Government of the United And it turns out we come pretty cheap.  According to the International Monetary Fund, we give the fossil fuel industry a subsidy every year in the United States alone of $700 billion. That is a more valuable prize than any drilling rights or any mining lease. To protect it--to protect $700 billion a year--acquiring a controlling interest in the U.Government is a bargain. One fossil fuel front group spent $750 million in the last election. That is a 1-to-1,000 payback--a 1,000 times ROI--each year that they keep the $700 billion subsidy if they keep plowing $700 million a year into politics to produce results like this nominee for  You get benefits once you have acquired that controlling interest.  Only one Republican has publicly taken a stand against Scott Pruitt, the most compromised and corrupted nominee in memory, with huge holes of secrecy still around his relationship with the industry he is supposed to regulate--nobody else, just the one. No Senators from States whose big cities are flooded by rising seas on sunny days, no Senator from States whose historic native villages are washing into the sea, no Senators from States who are losing ancient forests to pine beetles and wildfires, nor from States whose farmers see unprecedented extremes of flood and drought, and whose home State universities assign responsibility for those new extremes to climate change caused by carbon emissions from companies like these--none from the States whose fisheries are imperiled by warming and acidifying seas--no one. There is just that one How well this industry is succeeding.  This EPA nominee may be compromised and corrupted, but he is compromised and corrupted by the fossil fuel industry. So there is no talking about it on that side. Everybody just studies the ceiling tiles when the subject comes up. Nobody will help us find out about the thousands of stonewalled emails with his fossil fuel industry patrons. Nobody will help us inquire into the nominee's fossil-fuel-funded dark money operation. Nobody challenges[[Page S1335]]his nonsense answers in the confirmation process. He answered, he answered; let's move along, let's move along.  The dark hand of the fossil fuel industry is all over this nomination. This is the wolf being deliberately inserted into the lamb fold. It is from the fossil fuel money that fueled his politics--unknown fully because we refuse to shine the Senate's light into his dark money operation--to the thousands of emails between him and his fossil fuel industry patrons, only a fraction of which have been brought to light throughout our confirmation process, and which were only uncorked after his office was sued--not because of any effort on the other side in the confirmation process--to the fossil fuel front groups that have come out supporting this nominee and are spending millions to push him through. Think about that. These groups are funding ad campaigns to push this guy through. Obviously, they have expectations about how well they are going to be treated by him. Through all of that, the sting of this industry's influence is profound.  Just reflect on that last point. A dark money operation is being cranked up by polluters to ram the EPA nominee through.  Here is a headline:       Energy executives, secretive nonprofit raise money to back            New group warns that EPA nominee's confirmation ``is not a      certainty'' and millions of dollars are needed for the fight.  There would have been a time when it would have been disqualifying when polluters were raising millions of dollars needed for a fight to ram through an EPA nominee. This is conflict of interest in plain day, but it is a conflict of interest with the right folks around here, I guess, and so we don't consider it conflict of interest any longer.  Whom do you suppose most of the dark money is? Well, we don't know, because it is dark money. But who is it usually? Well, the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers, and their front groups. And what do you suppose they want to spend millions of dollars for? What could be better for them, the biggest polluters on the planet, than a little minion to run the EPA as Every Polluter's Ally.''  In any sane world, the fact that all this dark and dirty money is being spent to ram through an EPA nominee would be disqualifying all by itself--but not here, not now, not in a Congress that is so compliant to the fossil fuel industry that this alarm bell doesn't even register.  Fossil fuel front groups sent a joint letter of support for their little minion Here is the letter with all of these various groups who I think are united in their dependence on fossil fuel money.  Here is the legendary Heartland They are that classy group that compared climate scientists to the That has been their contribution to the discussion about climate change.  Competitive Enterprise Institute, Americans For Tax Reform, groups from the State Policy Network--why don't these folks turn up somewhere else? They turn up in the research of academics who are actually studying the climate denial operation--because it is an operation. You can follow the money from the fossil fuel industry out into an array of front groups--front groups by the dozen--whose whole purpose in life is to make them look like they are not fossil fuel industry front groups. So they have names like the Heartland Institute or the George Marshall Institute, which, by the way, has nothing to do with George Marshall or his family. They just took the name because everybody knows what a respected individual George Marshall was. They just took the name and went to work phonying up the climate change debate under the name of George  That is a pretty shameful act when you think what George Marshall did for this country, but these are not people for whom shame has much effect.  If you look at Brulle's analysis--he is one of the academics who looks at this array of front groups that are fossil fuel funded--this group of people, of entities that signed the letter for this guy--they show up here too--small world.  Well, I wonder whom they thought that letter would convince? I don't think they expected it would convince many Many of us on the Democratic side have gone to the floor of the Senate to call out these fossil-fuel-funded, dark-money-driven front groups, as the fossil-fuel-funded, dark-money front groups that they are.  So I don't think Democrats are very plausible targets for that letter. So why the letter? Well, my view is that this was done because everyone in this building knows that the Koch brothers' political operation is behind all of these groups--many wiggly tentacles of the same fossil fuel polluter Behind this letter is the same Koch brothers political operation that warned Republicans of the political peril--not my word, their word--that Republicans would be in if they crossed this industry, of ``how severely disadvantaged''--another quote from the industry books--``they would be if they dared to do anything on climate change.''  That is what this letter is. It is a signal. It is the political mailed fist of the Koch brothers in a front-group glove giving its marching orders. In any sane and normal world, this letter by itself from all these polluter front groups would be disqualifying, but it appears this body will obediently turn the Environmental Protection Agency of our government over to the minion of the polluters to join an administration dead-set to destroy science with politics. It is like everyone on the other side has been sworn to secrecy while this happens in plain view.  This is a heartbreaking speech for me. I perhaps need to start with a little personal background to explain.  Last year, we commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. After Pearl Harbor was attacked, boys across America rushed to sign up for the service of their country. My father and my uncle were two of those boys. Both became pilots in the Pacific theater. My dad was a Marine Corps dive bomber pilot; my uncle was a carrier-based Navy fighter pilot. My uncle was killed over the Actually, he was under John McCain's grandfather's command--small world--but I doubt that Admiral McCain knew who Ensign Whitehouse was.  My father came home from the war, and he served our country all his life, first as a CIA officer and then as a decorated career diplomat. I believe he won every award the State Department has to offer, and he served in difficult, challenging, poor, and war-torn countries his whole life. At the end, he came out of retirement to set up Special Operations Command in the Pentagon for President Ronald  I was raised in that life. We were often in dangerous and war-torn places, and we were surrounded by American families who faced the discomforts, the diseases, and the dangers of those far-away postings because to them something mattered. Something mattered to take your family to a place where, if your child was sick, there was no decent hospital. Something mattered to take your family to a place that if your child was bit by a dog, there was a good chance the dog was rabid. Something mattered to take your family to places where the electricity wasn't reliable, the water wasn't clean, the people weren't friendly, and diseases abounded.  These folks didn't talk about it a lot. Today, a lot of people wear their patriotism on their sleeve. It was not really a topic of conversation, but it was a thread through their lives that showed that in their choices something mattered. They didn't wear their patriotism on their sleeves; they lived it.  The American Government that they served and that my uncle died serving was, to them, an ideal. Did America sometimes fall short of that ideal? But I will tell you what: Every other country in the world knew the difference between America and everybody else. We stood out for what we stood for. Across our agencies of government, for decades, many Americans have worked quietly and honorably to advance that American ideal.  At the heart of that ideal is a duty, and the duty is to put country first, to put the American people first, even before your own families's comfort and safety. That honor and that duty running through the lives and service of millions of public servants are the core heartstrings of American democracy.  Into that government, this Trump administration has nominated as Administrator of the EPA, a tool of the[[Page S1336]]fossil fuel industry, a man who demonstrably will not take his government responsibilities seriously because he never has. He has never taken EPA's responsibility seriously. He has done nothing but sue them. He has never taken his State's environmental responsibility seriously. He has shut down the enforcement arm that his office had. He will represent with the biggest conflict of interest in history a polluting industry whose regulation is actually now the EPA's primary public duty. This isn't some fringe question of conflict of interest about some question that may emerge. This is the biggest stinking conflict of interest I think we have ever seen in this body about the issue that is at the center of the Environmental Protection Agency's responsibilities. With the most important task before the EPA being to control carbon emissions before we push this planet over the climate cliff, the industry in question will now rule the regulator.  Well, this hits home. I have fishermen in Rhode Island who need honest environmental policy to protect our seas. ``It is not my grandfather's ocean,'' they have told me. ``Things are getting weird out there,'' people who have fished since childhood have told me.  Moreover, Rhode Island is a downwind State from the midwestern smoke stacks and a downstream State from out-of-state water pollution. Rhode Island needs a strong EPA to enforce clean air and clean water laws from harm starting outside our boundaries. My attorney general has not shut down his environmental unit, and my department of environmental management is doing our best to keep Rhode Island clean and livable. But they can't do much about out-of-state polluters. That is where the EPA comes in. For a man who so plainly disbelieves in and deprecates the EPA's mission, it is an alarming picture for Rhode  We are a coastal State, and a small one. We don't have a lot to give back to rising seas. I have to say, I am sick of having to comfort people whose homes have been washed away into the sea.  This is a picture I took not too long ago. Colleagues who have been here for a while might remember this individual. He was the Governor at the time, but he was my predecessor in my seat in the Senate, Lincoln His father served here with enormous distinction for many, many years and was actually a Republican chairman of the Environmental and Public Works Committee who cared about the environment. He was an environmental Republican leader.  These are houses that have washed into the sea as the result of a storm. Sea level rise has raised the level of the ocean so that storms throw their water farther in, and they take little houses like these that have been beachfront houses for many years and they just pull them into the ocean.  I spoke to the lady who I think owned that house. She was, I would say, in her seventies. She had childhood memories of that house. It had been her grandparents', and she would come to visit as a little girl. What she remembers as a little girl is that she would come out of that house, and in front of the house was a little lawn big enough to put up a net and play volleyball or badminton. Across from their lawn was a little road, just a sand-and-gravel road, but it allowed cars to come down and park near the beach. On the other side of the road was a little parking area where the cars could pull in. Beyond the lawn and the road and the parking area was the beach. Her memories of the beach were of sunny days with the sun beating down on the sand, and she would get across the lawn and across the road and across the parking lot, and then she would just have to scamper as fast as she could on her little feet across the hot sand. She described to me remembering what a long run that felt like for her to rush down to the ocean where she could put her feet into the cool Atlantic waters and swim. That beach, that parking area, that road, that lawn, and now her house are all gone. These are the things that are happening in my State that the Republicans in this building could not care less about--could not care less about.  The math is obvious: When you add heat into the atmosphere, the ocean absorbs the heat. Indeed, the ocean has absorbed almost all of the heat of climate change. God bless the oceans because if it weren't for them, we wouldn't be worried about hitting 2 degrees' increase in temperature. We would be worried about hitting 30 degrees' increase in global temperature. Because of all the heat that has been piled up, it has gone into the oceans 93.4 percent. That is like setting off more than two Hiroshima nuclear bombs in the ocean every second. Every second.  Think of the heat of a nuclear explosion of the level that destroyed Think of the--whatever it would be--terajoule of heat energy that gets set off by a nuclear explosion. Our oceans are absorbing heat. If we measure over the last 20 years how much heat they have absorbed, they are absorbing heat at the rate of multiple Hiroshima nuclear explosions happening in the ocean every second for 20 years.  We wonder why Senator Cantwell was talking about strange things going on in the oceans. We wonder why my fishermen are saying it is getting weird out there. But when all that heat goes into the oceans, there is a law called the law of thermal expansion. That is not the kind of law we debate around here. That is one of nature's laws. That is one of God's laws. That is one of the laws of physics and chemistry that we so ignore around here because we are paying attention to the laws of politics and the ``golden rule'': Who has the gold, rules.  But these are laws that we don't get to repeal or amend. What they are doing is swelling the seas with that heat. On top of that, in comes the water from melting glaciers and there is your sea level rise, 10 inches of sea level rise that we have measured at Naval Station Newport, to the point where we face scenes like this: a man in a kayak going down in front of the Seamen's Church Institute in Newport, This is not water in the ordinary course. This is a place where tourists walk. That is a storefront with water coming through the doorway. This was the storm surge, the tide, that came in with Sandy--which missed us, by the way.  We have a Coastal Resources Management Council that defends our shores, and our University of Rhode Island and Coastal Resources Management Council work together to see what is coming. They have developed new computer tools to determine which houses are going to be lost in what kind of storms, how often this scene is going to have to repeat itself in Rhode We are anticipating 9 feet of sea level rise by the end of this century.  My colleagues may think that is funny, that this is all sort of an amusing hoax we can talk about, but any State whose coasts are threatened with 9 feet of sea level rise, any representative of that State has a responsibility to come here and fight to try to defend that  When the adversary is the big special interests that is causing that and that has mounted the vast campaign of lies I talked about earlier to try to cover it--it is $700 billion in subsidies every year--then that is an adversary worth going after because that is a dirty and wrongful adversary.  When their representative is going to run the EPA, that is a disgusting state of affairs. If Rhode Island had to suffer this to save our country for some great goal, if Rhode Islanders had to go off to war again like my father and uncle and Rhode Islanders have since the first battles in Portsmouth, RI, the Revolutionary War, we would saddle up--sign us up--to take on whatever we need to defend this great country, but don't ask us to take a hit like this to protect a big special interest.  The arrogance and the greed of the fossil fuel industry and the dirty things it is willing to do to advance its interests knows no bounds. It lobbies Congress mercilessly against any action on climate change, and it has for years.  It runs a massive political electioneering operation of dark money and false attacks to prevent any action on climate change, and it has for years. It operates that giant array of front groups, a multi-tentacled, science-denial apparatus to put out streams of calculated misinformation. It does this all to protect what that International Monetary Fund report identified as a $700 billion annual subsidy.  What would big corporations do to protect $700 billion? Well, we are finding out. For years, the fossil fuel industry has been deliberately sabotaging[[Page S1337]]the honest and orderly operation of the legislative branch of America's government to protect its subsidy. With this appointment, it would be able to corrupt and sabotage the  I use the word ``corrupt'' because this is indeed the very definition of corruption in government. This is government corruption in plain view. In the Supreme Court decision Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce, here is how the U.Supreme Court described corruption. The Court described it as ``the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.''  Back we go to this network of false front operations, established by immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of a corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public support for the corporation's ideas.  We got some interesting polling recently. The George Mason University went out recently and conducted a poll of Trump voters. What did Trump voters think? It turns out that more than 6 in 10 Trump voters support taxing and/or regulating the pollution that causes global warming. In general, Trump voters were asked: Which of these two approaches to reducing the pollution that causes global warming do you prefer? Well, 16 percent said: I don't know; 21 percent said: Do nothing; but 13 percent of Trump voters said: Tax pollution; 18 percent said: Regulate pollution; and 31 percent said: Tax pollution and regulate pollution.  That adds up to more than 6 out of 10 Trump voters thinking that the pollution that causes climate change should be taxed or should be regulated or should be taxed and regulated.  When you go back to the Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce definition of corruption and look at the section that says that the policies pushed by the massive aggregations of wealth accumulated with the help of the corporate form want to go one way and the public wants to go another way and the corporate powers' views have little or no correlation to the public support for the corporation's political ideas, well, heck, we know Democrats support doing stuff about climate change.  It turns out Trump voters do too. The public is actually happy to get something done. It is this mess that is stopping us. It is groups that spend $700 million in a single election to influence Congress that is the problem, not the American public.  Teddy Roosevelt described corruption this way. He described corruption as a sinister alliance between crooked politics and crooked business, which he said has done more than anything else for the corruption of American life against the genuine rule of the people themselves.  If you look at the influence of Big Business--particularly the fossil fuel business--it has been something else around here. I was elected in 2006. I was sworn in, in the Senate, in 2007. When I was first here in those early years, there was a Republican climate bill floating around the Senate virtually all the time.  My recollection is that there were five Republican cosponsored climate bills during my time there. Susan Collins did a climate bill with Senator Cantwell; Senator John Warner of Virginia, Republican, did a bill with Senator Lieberman; Senator Graham worked on a bill with Senator Kerry; Senator Lamar Alexander had a bill of his own; and Senator McCain supported climate legislation and ran for President of the United States on a strong climate change platform. And then came 2010. Then came a decision called Citizens United, which the fossil fuel industry asked for, expected, and immediately acted on when it came out, and it said to the big special interests: Go for it, boys; spend all you want in politics. We five Republican appointees to the Supreme Court are going to make the comically false finding that nothing you can do with unlimited money could possibly ever corrupt American democracy or could possibly even be seen as corrupting by the American public.  Of course, that is such hogwash that right now the Supreme Court is viewed by people who have been polled on this question as not likely to give a human being a fair shake against a corporation.  If I remember correctly, the numbers were 54 to 6. In a polling group of 100, 6 Americans believe they could get a fair shot in the Supreme Court against corporations and 54 believed they could not get, as human beings, a fair shot in the U.Supreme Court against a big corporation, but with the big corporations at the Supreme Court, the fix was in--not a great place for the Court to be when by 9-to-1 American human beings think they can't get a fair shot in front of that Court against a corporation.  They did deliver, and they delivered Citizens United and opened the floodgates. The next thing out there was groups like Americans for Prosperity, the front group for the Koch brothers, Donors Trust, which launders away the identity of big corporations like ExxonMobil, and all of these other front groups we looked at earlier, and they are spending immense amounts of money. The result is, if there was a heartbeat of activity on climate change with Republicans before Citizens United, it has been a flat line since. That has been the story behind this.  Not only has dark money poisoned our conversation about climate change, this guy actually ran his own dark money operation. His Rule of Law Defense Fund, a 501(c)4 organization that does not disclose its donors have been linked to the Koch brothers, who run one of the biggest polluting operations in the country, but we don't really know. We don't really know. It has been kept absolutely quiet.  There is a black hole of secrecy around this nominee's dark money operation; whom he raised it from, what the quid pro quo was, what he did with it. Not allowed to know. Move along. Move along. It doesn't matter.  This is a test. This is a test of the Will this nominee ever tell us exactly what his relationship with the fossil fuel industry is? Will we get these emails in time to make an informed decision before his nomination is rammed through one step ahead of the emails that the judge said had to be released?  I can't get over the fact that this guy covered up the emails for 750-plus days for more than 2 years and a judge said: No, get them out And they are going to get them out The second chunk, you have 10 days to get them out. He sat there in our committee and acted as if this was some huge terrible task that he couldn't possibly get done; that with 2 years to do it, he couldn't get a single email out. By the time of our hearing, zero of those thousands of emails had come out. A judge took a look the same situation and said: Do it And they are doing it.  We have been so deliberately stonewalled, and it has been so painfully and plainly made clear by what the judge has ordered. We are not passing this test of how a Senate should act.  President-Elect Trump promised to restore genuine rule of the people themselves. Remember, Teddy Roosevelt's quote that the sinister alliance between crooked politics and crooked business has done more than anything else for the corruption of American life against the genuine rule of the people themselves. President Trump promised to restore genuine rule to people and themselves, and yet it is looking more and more like shadowy and industry-funded groups will really run our government.  This is a test also for the rest of corporate A lot of corporate America has good climate policy. Most of corporate America has good climate policy, but when are they going to stand up about an EPA Administrator who is the minion of the fossil fuel industry? What will Coca-Cola say to the Georgia Senators? What will Walmart ask of its Arkansas Senators? What will VF Corporation urge its North Carolina Senators to do? How will Rio Tinto advise its Senators from Arizona? All these companies have taken important stands on global warming. Why not now?  Let's talk about the due diligence that a nomination like this should get, particularly the due diligence about climate change that the present urgency demands. I wondered what due diligence my colleagues have done to[[Page S1338]]assess the reality of climate change before making this fateful and foul vote. The fossil fuel fox is on its way to the henhouse now, and I challenge the colleagues who will have put him there: Have you gone to your home State university for a briefing on climate science to understand what your own universities are teaching?  This nominee, Mr.Pruitt, never had. When we met in my office, he didn't even know who Berrien Moore was. Berrien Moore is the dean of the College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences at the University of He is a nationally renowned climate scientist. Before this nominee and I met in my office, for all this nominee's years of litigation against doing anything about climate change, he had never bothered to go to his own University of Oklahoma and find out from there, his home State expert, what climate change was, how it worked, and what it meant. Why not? The most logical answer is because he didn't care to know. He had already chosen sides and had been richly rewarded for doing so, although we don't know exactly how richly, since his dark money operation is still a secret, protected by the Senate Republicans who are shoving this nomination through.  Here is what Mr.Pruitt would have found out if he had bothered to go to the University of Oklahoma to ask the dean about climate change. The dean of the University of Oklahoma's College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences has said: ``On the increasing strength of earth sciences, we can now state that global warming is `unequivocal.' ''  The fact that the planet's warming and the fact that CO2 is a greenhouse gas and the fact that it is increasing in the atmosphere and that increases in the atmosphere due to humans--about those things? There is no debate.  He has said:       We know precisely how fast CO2 is going up in      the atmosphere. We have made a daily measurement of it since      1957. We have ice-core data before that.  He continued:       We know without any question, that it has increased almost      40 percent since the industrial revolution, and that increase      is due to human activity primarily fossil-fuel burning.  Those are the words of the dean at the University of Oklahoma, who is the expert in this subject. And Mr.Pruitt had never bothered to actually ever ask him. The fossil fuel industry had told him all he needed to know, and that is going to be a continuing problem with him as EPA  I thought to myself, have any of the Senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee, who voted for this nominee out of committee, done any better? Which Senator on that committee has been troubled to go for, say, half a day, to their own home State university and get a briefing on climate science? As I have said, this matters to Rhode Island because we are a downwind We have had bad air days where little kids and seniors and people with breathing difficulties are supposed to stay indoors in the air conditioning, not go outside. We are seeing warming rising, acidifying seas along our shores, hurting our fishermen, causing those families to lose those coastal homes I showed.  And the hits are just going to keep on coming. A child born today at Women & Infants Hospital in Providence, RI, can expect to see upward of 9 feet of sea level rise raging on Rhode Island shores in her lifetime, according to the University of Rhode Island and our State agencies.  Well, it seems to me the least a downwind State like Rhode Island might expect is some modicum of due diligence by colleagues who are blocking action on this subject. At the University of Rhode Island, the due diligence is very clear. URI is working with Rhode Island fishermen to help predict the harm from warming and acidifying seas and figure out what that means for our fisheries and our agriculture.  The Senator is from a State that has very distinguished fishing and agriculture himself, and I am sure his home State universities are doing similar research.  URI and our State agencies are drilling down to generate fine local data on sea level rise and storm surge, and we are starting to be able to predict, with specificity, which homes are likely to be lost in storms, which roads will become inaccessible in coming decades, what plan B is necessary to get emergency services to communities when flooding bars the way, and what water and sewer and other public infrastructure is at risk. These are all now the daily questions of Rhode Island coastal life, thanks to climate change, and our University of Rhode Island is at the forefront of studying that.  Of course, URI is not alone. You can go to every State university and find climate change concerns. They just understand this stuff. They are not actually just learning climate science, they are teaching about climate change. It is astonishing that Senators from those States will not listen to what their own universities teach.  Let's call the Republican roll of the Environment and Public Works Committee, all of whom voted to suspend the committee rules to jam this fossil fuel industry minion through to the Senate floor as Administrator of the EPA, notwithstanding the black hole of secrecy around his dark money dealings with the polluting fossil fuel industry, and notwithstanding his years of stonewalling dozens of Open Records Act requests, including the one that has just been ordered to be disclosed by the judge today--thousands of emails.  Let's see what our Environment and Public Works Committee colleagues, who cleared the way in committee for this nominee, would find at their home State universities, if they looked.  Chairman Barrasso could go to the University of Wyoming, where he would find the University of Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics reporting: ``Many of the most pressing issues facing the western United States hinge on the fate and transport of water and its response to diverse disturbances, including climate change.''  He would find University of Wyoming scientists publishing articles on ``The effects of projected climate change on forest fires' sustainability'' and the University of Wyoming awarding university grants to study the effects of climate change on pollinators, on water flow, on beaver habitat, and on whitebark pine growth, all work being done sincerely at the University of Wyoming on climate change.  Next down the line, we come to Senator Inhofe of The senior Senator from Oklahoma could also go, of course, and consult Dean Moore of the College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences at the University of But if he really wanted to dig in, he could also go over to Oklahoma State and get an update from Oklahoma State Professor Riley Dunlap, who has written in a peer review and scientific journal: ``Climate science has now firmly established that global warming is occurring, that human activities contribute to this warming, and that current and future warming portend negative impacts on both ecological and social systems.''  ``Portend negative impacts on both ecological and social systems''--that is science-ese for it is going to hurt people, as we Rhode Islanders already see all too plainly.  Oklahoma State's Professor Dunlap goes on to write something more. However, he goes on to say:       There has been an organized ``disinformation'' campaign . .      . to generate skepticism and denial . . . to ``manufacture      uncertainty,'' . . . especially by attacking climate science      and scientists.  Huh?  And he goes on:       This campaign has been waged by a loose coalition of      industrial (especially fossil fuels) interests and      conservative foundations and think tanks--  Look at that. He seems to be agreeing with Brulle at Drexel University--     that utilize a range of front groups and Astroturf operations      [to manufacture that uncertainty].  That is the research that Senator Inhofe would find at Oklahoma That organized disinformation campaign that Professor Dunlap reports on and the massive political muscle operation that supports it explains a lot of what goes on around here. And if you cross-reference the entities that Professor Dunlap puts into that organized disinformation campaign, you will find them on the record supporting this nominee. He is the nominee of the organized disinformation campaign. And that is because, behind this whole mess[[Page S1339]]of a nomination, is the fossil fuel industry.  Let's go back to the Environment and Public Works Committee and continue down the row on the majority side. We come next to Senator Senator Capito from West Virginia could go to West Virginia University, where the Mountaineers could show her their mountain hydrology laboratory, which tells us, ``Climate change has important implications for management of fresh water resources.'' These include, ``that the highlands region in the central Appalachian is expected to wet up.'' As warmer air, which carries more moisture, leads to what West Virginia University is calling ``intensification of the water cycle,'' the laboratory warns that, ``the implications of this intensification are immense.''  West Virginia University's Wildlife Conservation Lab publishes regularly on climate change effects, and one of West Virginia University's climate scientists, Professor Hessl, has been recognized by West Virginia University as West Virginia University's Benedum Distinguished West Virginia University even sends people all the way to China to study climate change. Some hoax.  My friend, Senator Boozman, is next in the line. His home State University of Arkansas has actually signed onto both the first and second university president's climate commitments. And the University of Arkansas has undertaken what it calls an aggressive and innovative Climate Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help prevent climate change. The University of Arkansas explains the need to reduce greenhouse gases, particularly including carbon dioxide and methane. It is because these gases' ``absorption of solar radiation is responsible for the greenhouse effect.''  Explaining further, the University of Arkansas describes that the greenhouse effect ``occurs as these gases are trapped and held in the Earth's atmosphere, gradually increasing the temperature of the Earth's surface and air in the lower atmosphere.''  A University of Arkansas scientist predicts ``that the spread of plant species in nearly half the world's land areas could be affected by global warming by the end of the century.''  On down the EPW row is my friend Roger Wicker from Down in Mississippi, the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, actually has an Office of The Ole Miss Office of Sustainability is there ``to further the university's efforts to combat global climate change.''  Believe it or not, Ole Miss is another signatory to that University Presidents' Climate Commitment just like It is moving toward net zero greenhouse gas emissions. By the way, so is the University of Southern The director of the University of Mississippi's Center for Hydroscience and Engineering explains why this matters.       Human influence and greenhouse gasses are the dominant      causes of the increase in global average temperature of the      earth. The impacts are observed in rising sea levels,      precipitation patterns, hydrologic regimes, floods and      droughts, and environmental processes.  He continues.       We must reduce our carbon footprint and take the necessary      steps to reduce our vulnerability to future climate change      impacts.  From the University of Also, at Ole Miss, anthropology professor Marcos Mendoza warns that ``climate change is the greatest environmental threat facing global society in the 21st century.'' Let me say that again--from Ole ``Climate change is the greatest environmental threat facing global society in the 21st century.'' But the fossil fuel machine is going to see to it that we put a climate denier into the EPA Administrator's seat.  So let's stay in Mississippi and go over to Mississippi State University, where several professors contributed to the American Society of Agronomy's report, ``Climate Change and Agriculture: Analysis of Potential International Impacts.'' The forward to that volume states that ``the threat of global climate change due to anthropogenic modification of the atmosphere--the so-called greenhouse effect--could potentially be one of the major environmental problems of our time.''  Down on the gulf, all three Mississippi universities are working together with Sea Grant, on what they call a climate team to assess ``the risk of environmental, economic, and societal impacts from rising sea levels and storm surges.'' My friend who is presiding knows well the effects in the gulf. When you are looking at the risk of environmental, economic, and societal impacts from rising sea levels and storm surges, you have something in common with Rhode Island as well.  Let's go on to Nebraska from where Senator Fischer hails. The University of Nebraska has published extensive reports on what they call ``Climate Change Implications for Nebraska.'' One University of Nebraska report leads with this blunt sentence: ``Climate change poses significant risks to Nebraska's economy, environment, and citizens.'' Well, Nebraskans, it turns out, agree. The University of Nebraska has published research that ``most rural Nebraskans believe the state should develop a plan for adopting to climate change, as do 58 percent of Nebraskans 65 and older.''  So even the elder Nebraskans by 58 percent believe it, and nearly 70 percent of young Nebraskans, from 19 to 29 years old. On the science, the University of Nebraska reports the following:       Is there debate within the scientific community with regard      to observed changes in climate and human activities as the      principal causal factor? The short answer here is no, at      least certainly not among climate scientists; that is,      scientists who have actual expertise in the study of climate      and climate change.  Let me repeat that again from the University of       Is there debate within the scientific community with regard      to observed changes in climate and human activities as the      principal causal factor? The short answer here is no, at      least certainly not among climate scientists; that is,      scientists who have actual expertise in the study of climate      and climate change.  The University of Nebraska goes on.       For more than a decade, there has been broad and      overwhelming consensus within the climate science community      that human-induced effects on climate change are both very      real and very large.  As to scope of those effects, the University of Nebraska warns:       The magnitude and rapidity of the projected changes in      climate are unprecedented. The implications of these changes      for the health of our planet and the legacy we will leave to      our children, our grandchildren, and future generations are      of vital concern.  The University of Nebraska has even published what it calls ``Key Climate Change Data for Nebraska.'' This is the list:  Temperatures have risen about 1 degree Fahrenheit since 1895; frost-free season has increased 5 to 25 days since 1895; very heavy precipitation events have increased 16 percent in the Great Plains Region; projected temperature increase of 4 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit, low-emissions scenario, or 8 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit, high-emissions scenario, by 2100; projected summer of 2100 will have 13 to 25 days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; number of nights over 70 degrees Fahrenheit will increase by 20 to 40 by 2100; soil moisture is projected to decrease 5 to 10 percent by 2100; reduced snowpack in Rocky Mountains equals reduced streamflow in our rivers; increasing heavy precipitation events; increasing flood magnitude; increasing drought frequency and severity.  That is the University of Nebraska's list of coming attractions to Nebraska from climate change.  On to Kansas, where Senator Moran would learn from Kansas State University about climate change's effects on agriculture in his home Kansas State University Professor Charles Rice, Distinguished Professor of Agronomy, working with the National Science Foundation is using ``climate modeling tactics to predict the effects of climate change in the Great Plains, and to develop adaptation and mitigation strategies for agriculture in the region,'' to help meet what Kansas State calls ``one of the grand challenges of the 21st century: evaluating and predicting the biological and ecological consequences of accelerating global climate change.''  Kansas State brought the executive director of agricultural giant Cargill to talk about climate change. News reports describe what the Cargill executive stated; that ``climate change is real and must be addressed head-on to prevent future food shortages.'' Specifically, the Cargill executive said that ``U.production of corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton could decline[[Page S1340]]by 14 percent by mid-century and by as much as 42 percent by late century.'' This is a senior corporate executive in one of our leading agricultural companies, warning of a 14-percent decrease in these essential crops by midcentury, and as much as a 42-percent decrease by late century.  From an agricultural standpoint, the executive said, ``We have to prepare ourselves for a different climate than we have today.'' Maybe that is why Kansas State calls evaluating and predicting the biological and ecological consequences of accelerating global climate change one of the grand challenges of the 21st century.  Let's head out to South Dakota, where Senator Mike Rounds would hear from South Dakota State University about climate change on the Dakota South Dakota State's Leffler Lab calls climate change ``the signature challenge of the 21st century.'' So let's bear in mind, we have the Kansas State University calling climate change ``one of the grand challenges of the 21st century.'' We have South Dakota State's Leffler Lab calling climate change the ``signature challenge of the 21st century.'' We have an EPA nominee who is a climate change denier, wrapped so tight with the fossil fuel industry, you can't tell where one ends and the other begins, and he has the support of the Senators from Kansas and South  It is a riddle. South Dakota State scientists are not just saying that climate change is the signature challenge of the 21st century, they are out studying climate change around the globe. From the Upper Ghanaian forests of West Africa to the West Antarctica ice sheet. South Dakota State University Professor Mark Cochrane is working with the U.Forest Service to determine ``how a changing climate impacts forest ecosystems'' and reported that ``forest fire seasons worldwide increased by 18.7 percent due to more rain-free days and hotter temperatures.''  The South Dakota State University News Center has reported that season-shifting climate changes ``are all being affected by warming from an increase in greenhouse gases due to human activity''--``all being affected by warming from an increase in greenhouse gases due to human activity.''  South Dakota State University even brought in Harvard Professor and ``Merchants of Doubt'' author Naomi Oreskes, saying that her work ``has laid to rest the idea that there is significant disagreement in the scientific community about global warming.'' Somebody needs to translate between South Dakota State University and this EPA nominee.  So on we go to Iowa, continuing down the Environment and Public Works Republican roster, where Senator Joni Ernst could hear from an Iowa State University professor who told a United Nations conference not long ago that ``climate change was already affecting Iowa farmers. This is not just about the distant future,'' he said. Iowa State has published extensive reach and I will just quote the title of it. ``Global Warming: Impact of climate change on global agriculture.'' Iowa State's prestigious Leopold Center views climate change not merely as warming, but as a ``worsening destabilization of the planet's environmental systems.''  Climate change is not just warming, it is a ``worsening destabilization of the planet's environmental systems'' and yet the good Senator voted to move this climate-denying industry tool forward to be our EPA  A worsening destabilization of the planet's environmental systems, they call it, that will create ``an aggravated and unpredictable risk that will challenge the security of our agricultural and biological systems''--``aggravated and unpredictable risk that will challenge the security of our agricultural and biological systems.''  That is Iowa State talking. They conclude: ``The scientific evidence is clear that the magnitude of the changes ahead are greater, the rate much faster, and [the] duration of climatic destabilization will last much longer than once thought.''  Now we come to the end of the row of the Republicans on the Environment and Public Works  As an Alaskan, Senator Dan Sullivan would get double barrels from the University of Alaska, first about climate change and second about ocean acidification.  ``Alaska is already facing the impacts of climate change,'' the University of Alaska reports.  This question of ``facing the impacts of climate change'' matters enough to the University of Alaska that, on global warming, the university has stood up the Alaska Climate Science The Alaska Climate Science Center has been established to help understand ``the response of Alaska's ecosystems to a changing climate.''  The Alaska Climate Science Center of the University of Alaska is charting the recordbreaking, year-over-year warming in Alaska, analyzing temperature trends, and receiving awards for ``modeling and evaluating climate change impacts in the Arctic.''  ``One thing for sure,'' the center says, is that the climate ``will continue to change as a result of various natural and anthropogenic forcing mechanisms.''  Then there is the other climate change punch coming at Alaska, from the sea. In addition to its Alaska Climate Science Center, the University of Alaska is serious enough about this to have also stood up an Ocean Acidification Research Center to address what it calls ``growing concerns over increased acidity in the ocean and the impacts this phenomenon will have on Alaska's marine ecosystems''--``growing concerns over increased acidity in the ocean and the impacts this phenomenon will have on Alaska's marine ecosystems.''  Alaska's seafood industry is an enormous asset to Alaska's economy, and it depends on Alaska's marine ecosystems. Well, the University of Alaska's Ocean Acidification Research Center warns that ocean acidification ``has the potential to disrupt this industry from top to bottom''--``to disrupt this industry from top to bottom.''  The Ocean Acidification Research Center identifies the culprit of this phenomenon as ``the transport of CO2 from the atmosphere into the ocean.''  Indeed, as we have loaded up the atmosphere with more and more CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, the ocean has actually absorbed chemically about a third of that  In addition to all that heat I mentioned earlier that the ocean had absorbed--more than 90 percent of the added heat--it actually absorbed one-third of the carbon dioxide. Of course, when carbon dioxide interacts with seawater, there is a change that takes place.  Indeed, why don't we see about doing a demonstration of that change. It will take a minute to get that organized. While we are getting that organized, let me continue.  Here is a description--thank you to the University of Maryland for the graphic--of how atmospheric carbon dioxide turns the ocean acidic.  When you add additional CO2 to the atmosphere, at the surface, where it meets the sea, there is a chemical exchange, and the CO2 can be absorbed by the ocean. As I said, one-third of it has been. That dissolved carbon dioxide joins with the water chemically, and it creates carbonic acid. The carbonic acid, in turn, creates bicarbonate ions, hydrogen ions, and carbonate ions, and those ions interfere with the makeup of marine creatures, which make their shells out of free carbon in the oceans, and some of those effects are pretty apparent.  This is the shell of an ocean creature called a pteropod. It is at the base of a great deal of the ocean food chain. There are studies off the northwest coast that show that more than 50 percent of this creature have experienced what the scientists who them caught them and studied them called severe shell damage. Here is what happens when you expose them to high concentrations of acidified seawater, higher than usual. That is what it looks like day 1. That is a healthy shell. Fifteen days later, it is starting to gray. Thirty days later, beyond just starting to gray, it is starting to actually come apart. And by 45 days, the shell is a wreck. That is not an animal that is capable of surviving.  So let's see how this works. This is a glass of water, and I have just put 20 drops of a pH test into it. That shows what the acidity is of the water. As you can see, it has turned the water rather blue, which matches roughly this level of pH.[[Page S1341]]  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to continue with this little demonstration.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Kennedy). Without objection, it is so ordered.  ",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,1823,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,16.0,April
9147,topic-id,1393,"Mr.President, this is a very simple bubbler that anybody with an aquarium will recognize. All you simply do is you put the bubbler in. I produce carbon dioxide as I exhale. So I am exhaling one breath into this same glass. I will do one more. It was not even a full breath, but there it is.  It used to match that color; do you remember? Now look at what color it matches. Just breathing carbon dioxide through the water has changed its pH and has made it more acidic.  I can do that right here with a breath. It is happening on a global scale, as the interaction between the atmosphere and the oceans transports CO2 into the oceans. When that happens, the same chemical effect that we modeled here takes place, and the oceans become more acidic, and the effects continue to be damaging.  The previous shell that I showed was the pteropod, a humble creature, but an important creature in the food chain. It is actually called the ocean butterfly by some because its snail foot has been transformed by God's law of evolution into an oceanic wing that allows it to fly in the seas.  This is an oyster. The Senator's State of Louisiana does a lot of work with oysters, as does Rhode Again, exposing oyster larvae to ocean water with heightened levels of acidity--day 1, day 2, day 4, and then we see exposure to acidity. Here is what a healthy larva looks like; here is what one exposed looks like. Here is what the healthy one looks like; here is what the exposed one looks like. Here is a healthy one; here is one exposed.  You will see that the healthy larva is growing day after day. It is getting bigger. It is going to become an oyster. Somebody is going to have a great oyster stew some day with that oyster with any luck.  This one is shrinking and deforming, and the reason is that the little creature is trying to take the carbon out of the ocean to make its shell--the calcium. And because of those ions that I pointed out, it is bound up, and they can't get it. So they deform this way.  When you are at a point where more than 50 percent of ocean pteropods are experiencing severe shell damage, if you are not paying attention, you are going to take a big punch.  Now I know around here we don't give a darn about God's creatures as being God's creatures. I probably sound funny to some people talking about a funny little creature in the ocean called a pteropod. The things we care about here are things that we can monetize because this is Mammon This is the temple where gold rules.  These little creatures are a little bit away from the gold. But who cares about the pteropod? I will tell you who cares about the pteropod. Salmon care about the pteropod, and people care about the salmon, and Alaska has a pretty good salmon fishery. The Pacific Northwest has a pretty good salmon fishery. If you drop out the pteropod from the bottom of the oceanic food chain because it can't grow because the ocean has acidified, there is a big collapse to take place.  As scientists would say, the upper trophic levels fall as the lower trophic levels collapse. So this is serious.  As I went through all these different Republican Environment and Public Works Committee Senators' home State universities, maybe you could say that all those home State universities are part of the climate change hoax that our President is so pleased to tweet about.  If so, my colleagues really ought to call their home State universities out about that. If they think their home State universities are in on a hoax, I think it wouldn't be right, and they ought to call out their home State universities. If the home State universities are part of a big old hoax, say so. Say so. But if all of my Republican colleagues' home State universities right down the line on the Environment and Public Works committee aren't in on a hoax, if what they are doing is good science, why not listen to them? Why not listen to them? What is the dark star in this firmament that causes the real science from the home State universities of these Senators to warp and twist around as it comes to this body? What is the power? What is the force that is causing every single one of these home State universities to be ignored by their home State Senators?  Let me go back and review very briefly what they said. Home State universities of the Republican Senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee warn of ``pressing issues'' related to climate change. That is Wyoming--pressing issues.  Assert that the science of climate change is ``unequivocal,'' ``without any question.'' That is from  Foresee ``immense'' implications related to climate change. That is West  Making anti-greenhouse gas ``climate commitments'' to fight climate change. That is the University of  Warn that ``climate change is the greatest environmental threat facing global society.'' That is  Find the ``significant risks'' from climate change to be ``of vital concern.'' That is That is the one that had the hit list of coming attractions from Nebraska of climate change  Describe climate change as ``one of the grand challenges of the 21st century.'' That is  Call climate change ``the signature challenge of the 21st century.'' South  Predict ``aggravated and unpredictable risk'' from climate disruption. That is  Prepare for fisheries risk that could shake the State's seafood industry ``from top to bottom.'' That is  Right down the row of Republican Senators who voted for this climate denying nominee, you have home State universities that say the opposite, that say that it is real, that it is beyond scientific debate at this point, that its effects are here, that its effects are worsening, and that it is going to shake industries like the fishing industry from top to bottom and create significant risk and disturbances in agriculture. But not one of those Senators stood up against the nominee who is the shameless tool of the industry that is causing all that harm.  So I have to ask, how does that end? If you listen to what all your home State universities are saying, this is a pressing and immense grand challenge. This greatest environmental threat--it doesn't go away. This is truth measured by science, God's and nature's truth, and truth always demands a reckoning.  If we listen only to the fossil fuel industry as it lies and prevaricates and propagandizes and disassembles and does all its nonsense to protect its all-important right to pollute for free, how do we expect this turns out in the end? Do you think these acidifying shells give a red hot damn what a fossil fuel industry lobbyist says? They are responding to laws of chemistry and nature that we don't get to repeal or amend.  Let me make one last point in closing, as I saw Senator Carper here, our distinguished ranking member, and I am sure he wants to speak.  Our Republican friends claim to support market economics. They are big on how you have to trust the market. You shouldn't regulate. Markets are the way to go. Market economics is the most efficient tool for allocating resources. Market economics are how we create wealth. Actually, I agree. So let's look at market economics.  What I believe and what economists say on all sides of the political spectrum is that it is market economics 101 that for the market to work, the harm of a product has to be built into the price of a product.  The fossil fuel industry, the dark star of our politics, absorbing and bending all of this home State information, absorbs and bends even conservative market principles so that they disappear here in Congress, at least wherever those principles conflict with what appears to be our first principle: the well-being and the power of the fossil fuel industry.  The fact that Senators do not hear or do not care about this science from their home State universities tells you all you need to know about the brute political force of the fossil fuel industry here in  (",CREC-2017-02-16-pt2-PgS1315-2.txt,1823,REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN NEED OF SCRUTINY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,16.0,January

9070,topic-id,1132,"Mr.President, today I am introducing the Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency This bill is a necessary step to restoring public information on animal cruelty that was removed from the U.Department of Agriculture's, USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, APHIS, website under the Trump administration.  On February 3, 2017, APHIS removed information from its website related to oversight and enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act, AWA, and Horse Protection Act, HPA, including animal inspection and licensing reports for more than 9,000 licensed facilities that use animals--facilities like commercial dog breeding operators, animal research labs, roadside zoos, and horse show participants. Since 2009, APHIS has made this information public to increase transparency and hold violators of these animal cruelty laws accountable. This information is now hidden from the public and is only available through a Freedom of Information Act Request, which can take months and sometimes even years for an agency to respond.  The Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency Act restores transparency by requiring APHIS to once again make AWA and HPA inspection reports accessible to the public. In my view, transparency is key when it comes to giving animal lovers and consumers information about whether their pets or the products they buy are the result of heartbreaking beginnings. These inspection reports also help law enforcement officials track and understand trends in animal welfare violations.  Preventing animal cruelty starts with getting facts out to consumers. By shedding light on AWA and HPA violations, the Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency Act holds accountable puppy mill operators and other businesses that use animals for breeding, research, and testing.  To ensure that taxpayers are not paying for entities that violate animal welfare laws, the Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency Act also prohibits businesses that are found to be in violation of the AWA or HPA from collecting certain tax benefits.  Under current tax and accounting rules, companies can write off the value of breeding and working animals on their taxes using accelerated depreciation, as if those animals are machinery. They keep that preferential and valuable tax benefit, even if they violate animal cruelty laws. The Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency Act puts an end to this practice and holds companies accountable for breaking the law by prohibiting businesses found to have violated AWA or HPA from claiming accelerated depreciation for tax purposes for five years.  The Animal Welfare Accountability and Transparency Act is a much needed step to restore transparency in animal cruelty and to hold companies accountable for violating the law.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 503       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

9071,topic-id,1284,"Mr.President, today I am reintroducing a bill honoring two Oregon legends--Frank and Jeanne Moore--who have spent their lives together on the North Umpqua River as fishers, stewards of the land, and hosts to visitors from across the world at the famous Steamboat  The North Umpqua River runs through the Umpqua National Forest in Southwest The river is a destination for rafters and kayakers, and is home to some of the best steelhead runs in the world, making it a fly-fishing haven. Frank and Jeanne Moore founded the Steamboat Inn in 1957, and spent years introducing visitors to the beauty of the Umpqua National Forest and the North Umpqua Frank, a decorated WWII veteran and a recent inductee into the Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame, was the fishing guide for the Inn's visitors, and has now been fishing this river for 70 years. The Steamboat Inn's website paints a wonderful picture of how Frank and Jeanne welcomed visitors to the North Umpqua River:  ``Each night, Jeanne Moore cooked evening meals for as many as sixty road construction crew members, who ate in shifts, before turning her attention to feeding her lodge guests. Frank pitched in, helped with the cooking, and also made a policy decision that would henceforth guide the Fisherman's Dinner: From then on, anglers could fish until the last light disappeared on the river. Dinner would be served one half hour after sunset!''  In the 1960's, the river and its tributaries experienced significant degradation, and Frank Moore has worked tirelessly ever since to rehabilitate the river and the steelhead populations. Frank served on the State of Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission and has received the National Wildlife Federation Conservationist of the Year award and the Wild Steelhead Coalition Conservation He works with his neighbors and local organizations to monitor the river, and just about everyone he comes across on his drives along the river knows his name and knows his work. Frank and Jeanne have opened their door to visitors and have taken great care of this Oregon treasure.  The Frank and Jeanne Moore Wild Steelhead Special Management Area will stand as a tribute to the Moore's and their dedication to protecting this special place in Oregon and preserving the hard work they've put in to ensure that Oregonians and visitors alike will have a healthy river, full of steelhead, to visit for decades to come.

9181,topic-id,1067,"Madam President, last month I stood here to express my serious concerns about the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the U.Environmental Protection  As the vote draws closer, I want to reiterate those concerns and give voice to the thousands of individuals and groups in Oregon who have sent letters and made calls and spoken up in my town hall meetings. Oregonians have expressed their fears that Pruitt will steer us into a ditch when it comes to protecting the environment and public health. I share their concerns, and I cannot support this nomination.  In my view, the importance of the EPA cannot be overstated. The EPA is[[Page S1371]]at the heart of maintaining clean air and clean water for every person in this country, but Mr.Pruitt has made a career of denying climate science, attempting to weaken or even get rid of worker protections, air quality standards for toxic air pollutants, and basic environmental standards. Those rollbacks would hurt us all.  One prime example of how the EPA has stepped in to protect Oregonians is during a recent air quality scare in In 2015, researchers with the U.Forest Service discovered that heavy metals including cadmium and arsenic had been emitted for decades into the air of Portland neighborhoods and schoolyards at dangerous levels.  I called on the EPA to take action, and within days they were on the ground in Portland, testing the air quality and helping our community wrap our heads around the public health risks. It wasn't long before they identified the root of the problem and corrected course.  I am not confident that a Pruitt EPA would have jumped to the aid of my community in a time when parents wondered if they had been poisoning their own children simply by feeding them vegetables grown in their backyards.  Mr.Pruitt's career is defined by repeated attempts to weaken or eliminate health-based environmental standards, weaken or eliminate limits on carbon emissions that would help address the challenge of climate change, weaken or eliminate air quality standards to fight the kinds of toxic air pollutants we saw in Those rollbacks hurt us all.  Mr.Pruitt has a history of attacking the very Agency he now wants to lead. As attorney general of Oklahoma, he has been involved in more than 20 lawsuits against the EPA, and he has failed to give Congress any kind of assurances that he would recuse himself from matters related to those lawsuits.  Mr.Pruitt has clear connections with big businesses who profit from polluting--oil and gas companies and coal-hungry electricity giants, among others. He has a history of siding with these special interests at the direct expense of the health of our families and communities.  According to news reports, as Oklahoma's Attorney General and head of the Republican Attorneys General Association, Pruitt helped raise millions from industries he is now expected to regulate.  More and more of this shadowy history is coming to light. Particularly after a judge has ordered him to release thousands of his emails as Oklahoma's Attorney General just days from now, the Senate should not hold a vote on a nominee when more information may come to light about an alarming association with the very industries he would be regulating as head of the  However, Mr.Pruitt has until next Tuesday to release those emails--4 days after Senate Republicans are forcing a confirmation vote. In the interest of transparency, the Senators should be able to read these emails before voting so we can make a fully informed decision.  By jamming this nomination through today, Senate Republican leadership is forcing the Senate to vote on a nominee without knowing the content of the full background of this nominee. In my view, that is legislative malpractice.  So I join my Democratic colleagues in asking that the vote on Mr.Pruitt's nomination to lead the EPA be delayed until those thousands of emails are released and Members of the Senate have the opportunity to review their contents.  The American people are demanding that Senate leadership delay Mr.Pruitt's confirmation until this important information is disclosed and questions about his possible conflicts of interest are answered.  On even the most basic level, Mr.Pruitt has a troubling history. He has denied the fundamental science that should be used to inform public policy.  Time and time again, Mr.Pruitt has argued against the reality of climate change, going so far as to dispute the EPA's rigorous science-based finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.  The EPA cannot be run by an individual with a career founded on alternative facts; yet that is much of what Scott Pruitt is promoting.  As I have said to Oregonians about this nomination and others, policymakers ought to come together and find the truth, not fall back on alternative facts.  Nearly 800 former employees of the U.Environmental Protection Agency expressed opposition to Pruitt this week in an open letter. These are 800 public servants who are dedicated to the Agency's core mission.  I think Oregonians and the American people need to hear what is in this letter. It states, in part:       Our environmental laws are based on a partnership that      requires EPA to set national standards attind gives states      latitude when implementing them so long as certain minimum      criteria are satisfied. This approach recognizes that      Americans have an equal right to clean air and water, no      matter where they live, and allows states to compete for      business without having to sacrifice public health or      environmental quality.       Our environmental laws include provisions directing EPA to      allow for a ``margin of safety'' when assessing risks, which      is intended to limit exposure to pollutants when it is      reasonable to expect they may harm the public health, even      when all the scientific evidence is not yet in. For example,      EPA's first Administrator, Bill Ruckelshaus, chose to limit      the amount of lead in gasoline before all doubt about its      harmfulness to public health was erased. His action spared      much of the harm that some countries still face as result of      the devastating effects of lead on human health. Similarly,      early action to reduce exposure to fine particle pollution      helped avoid thousands of premature deaths from heart and      lung disease. The magnitude and severity of those risks did      not become apparent until much later.       Mr Pruitt's record and public statements strongly suggest      that he does not share the vision or agree with the      underlying principles of our environmental statutes.

9045,topic-id,376,"Mr.Speaker, today I will reintroduce the WINGMAN Act, a vital veterans' bill that will expedite the claimsprocess for veterans who come to our congressional offices seeking assistance with their benefit claims. The current processleaves thousands of veterans and their families remaining in limbo awaiting resolution on their claims. The status quo isunacceptable, and it must change.  No servicemember should have to wait to receive benefits they have more than earned.

9102,topic-id,428,"Mr.Speaker, today I will reintroduce my bill, the State Sponsors of Terrorism Review Enhancement This legislation passed the full House last Congress unanimously. I hope this Chamber will once again take up this commonsense legislation and pass it as soon as possible.  The designation of a foreign government as a ``State Sponsor of Terrorism'' is one of the United States' most powerful statements that we can give on another statement.  Besides imposing sanctions, the stamp of ``State Sponsor of Terrorism'' labels a state untouchable to the international community.                              {time}  1030  This pariah status is much deserved as these are states that support the killing of innocent people as a matter of policy.  Under current law, in order for a state to be delisted, the President of the United States only needs to certify that the country being considered for delisting has not engaged in supporting terrorism for a paltry 6 months. We are talking 6 months to be delisted. Considering the heinous acts of violence these countries have supported in the past, we should not be allowing them to be delisted after only 6 months.  To address this, my legislation will--and, again, it passed last Congress unanimously--quadruple the time a designated country must refrain from sponsoring terrorism, before the President can remove it from the sponsor list, from 6 to 24 months; increase congressional oversight by doubling the time Congress has to review the President's proposed removal from 45 to 90 days; establish a uniform process through which Congress can disapprove of the President's decision to remove a country from that list; and require the administration to notify and brief Congress upon initiating a review of a designated country's potential removal from the list.  This legislation will assert congressional scrutiny and oversight and hopefully bring to an end politically motivated delistings. Successive administrations--both Republican and Democrat alike--delisted countries based on their presidency's legacy rather than the facts. This will stop absurd delistings like that of North Korea in 2008.  North Korea was delisted in exchange for their promises of dismantling their nuclear program. However, 9 years and 5 nuclear tests later, they remain off the list. This rescission from the list has enabled North Korea to engage in supporting terrorism abroad. By increasing the amount of time for a state to not be engaged in terrorism and increasing congressional oversight and scrutiny, my legislation will not allow mistakes such as this delisting of North Korea's to take place.  I want to remind people that this passed unanimously, and we hope that we will get the support again.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-10-pt1-PgH242-2.txt,2115,IMPROVING CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR VETERANS,2017.0,10.0,February

We were elected by the good men and women of the United States who believe in our vision of America and who believe in our dedication to doing whatever it takes to ensure the American Dream is alive and achievable. It is for these reasons the REINS Act must pass.  Federal regulations imposed on American the job creators and households, an estimated $1.9 trillion burden in 2015.  Who pays that?  The American citizen does. It costs on an average, as Chairman Goodlatte brought up, $15,000 per U.household.  Could that money be better used to offset the cost of a college education or maybe the staggering cost of health care due to the Affordable Care Act?  Let me give you a real-life illustration from my district. A couple of years ago, a constituent, a dairy farmer, was targeted by an incredibly vague, broad, and costly EPA rule called WOTUS, Waters of the United The EPA sued and won this case not due to environmental damage, but due to the vagueness of this rule and the determination in court. It cost my constituent over $200,000 in fines and court costs for a natural depression in his pasture that the EPA determined could qualify as navigable waters.  The rule states that any water or any land that becomes seasonably wet is affected. I live in We get 54 inches of rain a year. That is my whole State of  This is downright outrageous. This is just one example of the many times the EPA has overstepped its authority by enforcing vague regulations unfairly on individuals. The REINS Act will prevent these costly job-killing regulations from going into effect and safeguard against Federal bureaucrats imposing the heaviest burdens on the American economy, and this will increase the livelihood of the American people.
