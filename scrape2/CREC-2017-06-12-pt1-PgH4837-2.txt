 EXPRESSION OF GRATITUDE TO HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ENTERING THE MILITARY

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and to express my 
gratitude to the young men and women who are answering the call to 
serve in our military upon graduation from high school this year.
  Throughout New York's 22nd Congressional District, countless men and 
women are serving our country. We are thankful to those who will now 
join them in the armed services. They have taken upon themselves a duty 
and a responsibility far greater than themselves.
  General MacArthur famously said: ``Duty, honor, country: those three 
hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can 
be, and what you will be.''
  We as a community and as a country are thankful for their dedication 
and service. We wish them tremendous success in their service to our 
great Nation.
  I also wish to acknowledge specifically the Conklin Kiwanis Club's 
``First to Say Thank You'' program that was held to honor the men and 
women of the Southern Tier who are joining the military service. From 
the 22nd District, there are 35 individuals who are being recognized, 
and their names will be permanently commemorated in the official 
Congressional Record. I congratulate them and thank them.
