   PROVIDING FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A CITIZEN REGENT OF THE BOARD OF 
                 REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

  Mr. HARPER. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee 
on House Administration be discharged from further consideration of the 
joint resolution (S.J. Res. 35) providing for the appointment of 
Michael Govan as a citizen regent of the Board of Regents of the 
Smithsonian Institution, and ask for its immediate consideration in the 
House.
  The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Mississippi?
  There was no objection.
  The text of the joint resolution is as follows:

                              S.J. Res. 35

       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
     United States of America in Congress assembled, That, in 
     accordance with section 5581 of the Revised Statutes (20 
     U.S.C. 43), the vacancy of the Board of Regents of the 
     Smithsonian Institution, in the class other than Members of 
     Congress, occurring by reason of the expiration of the term 
     of Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson of New York on May 5, 2017, is 
     filled by the appointment of Michael Govan of California. The 
     appointment is for a term of 6 years, beginning on May 6, 
     2017, or the date of the enactment of this joint resolution, 
     whichever occurs later.

  The joint resolution was ordered to be read a third time, was read 
the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the 
table.
