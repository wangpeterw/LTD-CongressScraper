                   HONORING LOUISE McINTOSH SLAUGHTER

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, Louise McIntosh Slaughter 
served the people of Rochester in Monroe County, as well as the city of 
Buffalo, in the United States Congress from 1987 until her untimely 
death last week.
  Louise Slaughter was a champion of progressive causes and a liberal 
lioness in the United States Congress. She knew who she was fighting 
for, and she knew how to fight.
  For the homeless, the hopeless, and the voiceless, Louise Slaughter 
championed all their causes because her political ethos was forever to 
defend the dignity of every citizen. She never deviated from that cause 
and reinforced it each and every day on the floor of this Congress, the 
institution that she loved.
  She served as chair and ranking member of the Rules Committee and 
championed the first $500 million earmark for breast cancer research to 
the National Institutes of Health and the Violence Against Women Act. 
These are among a long list of impressive accomplishments that were 
championed by Louise Slaughter.
  Her friends and her family will miss her, but her accomplishments 
will forever be enshrined on this institution representing the people 
that she loved in Rochester and Monroe County.
