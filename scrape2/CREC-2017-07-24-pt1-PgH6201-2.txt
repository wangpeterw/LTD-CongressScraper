                    SUPPORTING THE FULBRIGHT PROGRAM

  (Mr. RASKIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the 
Fulbright Program, which more than 370,000 people from the United 
States and over 180 countries have participated in since its founding 
in 1946.
  For 70 years, the Fulbright Program has promoted strong relationships 
between Americans and other people and stimulated international 
education and progress. Some 57 Fulbright Fellows have received Nobel 
Prizes; 82 have received the Pulitzer Prize; 33 have gone on to serve 
as head of state; and 10 have been elected to the U.S. Congress.
  All over the world, more than 370,000 Fulbright alumni are making 
waves in science, medicine, public service, art, business, 
philanthropy, and education.
  Mr. Speaker, President Trump now proposes a staggering 55 percent cut 
to the Fulbright Scholar Program. This would devastate a successful and 
flourishing project.
  Our country benefits enormously from Fulbright Fellows past, present, 
and future, and I urge all of my colleagues to continue supporting this 
excellent program on a full basis.
