                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Gracious and loving God, You continue to give us reasons for 
rejoicing in Your love and grace. We praise You for the beauty of the 
sunrise and the glory of the sunset.
  Today, guide our lawmakers with Your wisdom and love, empowering them 
to strengthen men and women on life's journey. Lord, help our Senators 
to remember that nothing is impossible for You, for Your grace and 
might hold the galaxies in place.
  Lord, we are grateful for Your presence in this Chamber, our Nation, 
and our world. Use us all for Your glory and for the good of those in 
need. Continue to do in our lives exceedingly, abundantly, above all 
that we can ask or imagine.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
