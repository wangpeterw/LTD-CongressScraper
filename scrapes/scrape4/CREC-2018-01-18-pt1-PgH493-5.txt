           RECOGNIZING LITTLE ROCK FIRE CHIEF GREGORY SUMMERS

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of Fire 
Chief Gregory Summers as he retires after 35 years of service to the 
city of Little Rock.
  Chief Summers served as the 12th fire chief for the city of Little 
Rock and became the department's first African-American fire chief. He 
was appointed chief in 2009, and his leadership has had an indelible 
impact on central Arkansas communities.
  Under Chief Summer's leadership, the department earned Class 1 status 
by the Insurance Services Office and received international 
accreditation through the Center for Public Safety Excellence. This 
saves our community insurance dollars and improves safety. The Little 
Rock Fire Department is one of only 57 fire departments across the 
country to receive this recognition.
  My congratulations and best wishes for Chief Summers' future 
endeavors.
