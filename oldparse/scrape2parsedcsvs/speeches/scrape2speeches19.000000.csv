14873,topic-id,239,"Mr.President, I congratulate the Senator from Ohio not just on his speech and his remarks but on his leadership on the opioid epidemic in our country and its progression into other areas. He speaks passionately about it publicly and privately to his colleagues, just as he did today at our lunch as we discussed healthcare. He was a leader last year when we passed the 21st Century Cures Act to try to move these medical miracles that we know are coming through the regulatory and investment process more rapidly and into medicine cabinets and doctors' offices.  Senator Portman and Senator Whitehouse and others, in a bipartisan way, worked to add at least $1 billion more funding for States to deal with opioids after they had passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act earlier that year. So the opioid epidemic and the families who suffer from it have no more effective spokesman and advocate than the Senator from Ohio, and I am glad I had an opportunity to hear his remarks today.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 4:30 be equally divided in the usual form; further, that all postcloture time on the Gottlieb nomination expire at 4:30 p.m. today; and that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid on the table, and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.  The PRESIDING Is there objection?  Without objection, it is so ordered.  ",CREC-2017-05-09-pt1-PgS2830.txt,1695,REDUCING REGULATORY BURDENS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,9.0,July
14874,topic-id,2619,"Mr.President, while the Senator from Ohio is here, one more word on opioids.  Francis Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health, has testified before the Senate that in the next decade we could have--we should have a discovery of a nonaddictive pain medicine.  I cannot think of anything that over the long run could deal more with opioid addiction than to find a substitute for opioids that wasn't addictive. So we have discussed that with the President, with the new head of the FDA--after today, Gottlieb, I hope--with Price, Senator Portman, and with others, and, hopefully, in a bipartisan way, we can lean forward into accelerating the discovery of a nonaddictive pain medicine, and we can make that contribution in this effort.  Mr.President, the Senate will vote shortly at 4:30 p.m. on the President's nomination of Scott Gottlieb to serve as Commissioner of the Food and Drug He is the right person to lead the FDA in this vital mission and move the agency forward so America's patients can benefit from the remarkable discoveries--one of which I was just discussing--that our Nation's researchers are working on.  Gottlieb has impressive qualifications from every perspective. He was a practicing physician and hospitalist for many years, received his medical degree at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and completed his residency there. He held three positions in the Department of Health and Human Services, including two at the FDA as Deputy Commissioner, from 2005 to 2007, and before that, in 2003 to 2004, as a senior adviser to Commissioner Mark McClellan, and as the FDA's Director of Medical Policy  Gottlieb has studied health policy as a resident fellow at the American Enterprise He is a prolific writer and speaker on medical innovations. He has testified in front of Congress 18 times on a variety of issues, including the drug approval process, drug costs, drug shortages, importation, and healthcare reform.  Gottlieb is also a cancer survivor. He knows firsthand how medical treatments affect patients and their families.  Gottlieb, like others who were nominated by Presidents, has been through an exhaustive vetting process. The President announced the Gottlieb nomination on March 10. We received the nomination March 27. On April 5, Gottlieb testified for 2\1/2\ hours in our Senate HELP I offered Senators an opportunity to ask any questions they wished. Following his hearing, he answered 189 follow-up questions. If you count all the subquestions, it was 372 questions.  On April 27, our committee approved his nomination by a vote of 14 to 9, readying that nomination for consideration by the full Senate today.  On March 28, more than a month ago, the independent Office of Government Ethics concluded that Gottlieb ``is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing conflicts of interest.''  Let me read from the Office of Government Ethics' website about what that agency does. It says: ``OGE provides an independent review of the financial disclosure reports of candidates for Senate-confirmed nominees. OGE makes sure that these individuals have complied with the extensive requirements for financial disclosure under the Ethics in Government OGE ensures compliance with financial disclosure requirements and assists in the resolution of potential conflicts of interest. It carefully evaluates nominees' financial disclosure reports and works with agency ethics officials to prepare individualized ethics agreements.''  The website continues: ``After confirming with the agency that there are no unresolved conflicts of interest, OGE then transmits the financial disclosure report, the ethics agreement, and a cover letter directly to the Senate.''  That all arrived at our committee on March 28. So that should answer any questions about whether Gottlieb has a conflict of interest because the independent agency Congress set up to resolve that question says he has none--or if he has any, he will resolve them according to an agreement with that office.  I believe Gottlieb will help to move the FDA forward so patients can benefit from the remarkable medical discoveries that researchers are working on. The FDA affects nearly every[[Page S2838]]single American and regulates about a quarter of all consumer spending in our country, over $4 trillion annually.  It is responsible for areas as diverse as prescription drugs for humans and animals, medical devices, biologics, dietary supplements, cosmetics, over-the-counter medications, food, and tobacco products. In addition to drugs and medical devices, the FDA is responsible for protecting our Nation's food supply and working to reduce the number of people who get sick from foodborne illnesses.  Some of my Democratic colleagues have expressed concern about Gottlieb's prior work with companies that are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, but the fact is, it is not so unusual to have an FDA Commissioner who has consulted with the food and drug industry. Califf, the distinguished former FDA Commissioner under President Obama, consulted for many companies prior to his confirmation from the That didn't disqualify I supported him. So did 89 other He was confirmed 89 to 4.  I think we should recognize the obvious fact that it is a good idea to have people serving in government with some experience in the types of industries they are in charge of. The other day we confirmed a Secretary of I think it helps that he is a farmer and a veterinarian. We confirmed the Secretary of I think it helps that he has some background in business. Some of the same people who are criticizing Gottlieb for having a background in working with companies that manufacture drugs criticized President Trump's Secretary of Education because she had never been on the payroll of the people she was about to be in charge of. So you can't have it both ways.  I believe Gottlieb's background in understanding how drugs are manufactured, how they can be manufactured safely, how they can be moved through the regulatory and investment process more rapidly is vitally important to the opportunity we have in America--more than we have ever had before--of finding these new medical miracles and putting them in our medicine cabinets and our doctors' offices.  Gottlieb has broad support from an array of patient, industry, and research organizations. The supporters include three former FDA Commissioners and President Obama's Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  On Friday, I received a letter of support for Gottlieb from 10 State attorneys general who particularly praised the nominee as ``a leader in the fight against opioid abuse,'' the subject Senator Portman spoke on a moment ago.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of 93 groups that support Gottlieb's nomination at the conclusion of my remarks.  Mr.President, here are a few examples of what some of these groups had to say.  Jeff Allen, the President and CEO of Friends of Cancer Research, said: ``Through his knowledge and experience, we have no doubt that Gottlieb will be the right person to ensure FDA keeps pace with science and innovation without sacrificing the safety and efficacy gold standard established by FDA.''  The Healthcare Leadership Council said: ``Gottlieb's qualifications to lead the FDA are extensive and indisputable. . . . Gottlieb has consistently demonstrated his vision for accelerated medical innovation in this country and greater patient access to the drugs and devices that improve lives.''  Mark McClellan, FDA Commissioner from 2002 to 2004, said: ``He's a very good nomination,'' adding ``he is very dedicated to finding better ways to protect and improve the health of the public, all of which are great prerequisites for FDA Commissioner.''  Andy Slavitt, who just stepped down as the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services under President Obama, said that Gottlieb is ``a very good choice.''  The FDA has always been important, but there never has been a more important time for this agency. It is responsible for making sure patients benefit from the promising research driven by significant funding Congress has given to medical research in last year's 21st Century Cures Act, which the majority leader called ``the most important legislation of the year.''  I don't want it to go unnoticed that last year Congress increased funding for the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion. Last week, Congress increased funding for the National Institutes of Health by another $2 billion. The 21st Century Cures Act, which Congress also passed last year, authorized a $4.8 billion increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health for President Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative and for the Cancer Moonshot the Vice President worked on. Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell, President Obama, Vice President Biden, all of us want to see these medical miracles move forward, and having competent leadership in the FDA is absolutely essential to that effort.  I am very excited about the prospect of having Gottlieb and Francis Collins, who is the head of the National Institutes of Health, at the head of these two lifesaving agencies, which are important to every single American family.  The reason 21st Century Cures is such an important bill is that it will drive forward this extraordinary research, and Collins talked about some of the discoveries that will be possible in the next decade. I mentioned the possibility of nonaddictive pain medicine. Collins said that we will also have hearts that will be rebuilt from our own stem cells. We will have a universal flu vaccine. Did you know that the flu kills between 12,000 and 56,000 Americans a year? There will be a universal flu vaccine. There will be an HIV/AIDS vaccine and an artificial pancreas for patients with diabetes who have spent decades injecting themselves with insulin. These are the discoveries that are just over the horizon, not to mention medicine that will identify Alzheimer's before there are symptoms and then slow the progression of the disease. Think of the grief it would save families and the billions it would save the country. We have invested in that.  We have competent leadership to be approved by the Senate today, in working with Collins and Price, who can make sure those dreams become a reality perhaps even more rapidly.  The FDA plays a key role in this. At the committee hearing, I asked Gottlieb about the subject Senator Portman and I just talked about. I asked him how the FDA can be forward-leaning in accelerating the finding of new nonaddictive pain medicines--the ultimate cure for the opioid epidemic. It is a heartbreaking issue that almost every Senator knows about. Gottlieb said that the opioid epidemic is ``having staggering human consequences.''  He also said:       I think it's the biggest crisis facing the agency. It's      going to require dramatic action by whoever steps into the      agency. I think it's going to require an all-of-the-above      approach that does include reevaluating the framework for how      we can develop alternatives to opioid drugs. I think it also      includes looking at device alternatives to opioid drugs and      looking at devices in the context of drugs.  Gottlieb's first order of business will be to work with us on the reauthorization of the FDA user fee agreements, which experts at the FDA told members of our HELP Committee at one of the two bipartisan hearings on the agreements, are integral to helping patients and continuing the implementation of the 21st Century Cures  Before September 30, four different agreements need to be reauthorized. They fund $8 billion to $9 billion over the next 5 years, which is about a quarter of the Food and Drug Administration's budget. If we do not move quickly to pass these agreements in late July, the FDA will be forced, by law, to send layoff notices to more than 5,000 FDA employees and notify them that they may lose their jobs in 60 days.  A delay in reauthorizing these agreements would delay the reviews of drugs and devices that were submitted after April 1--1 month ago. For example, if we do not pass these user fee reauthorizations on time, an FDA reviewer who gets started in reviewing, say, a cancer drug that was submitted to the agency in April would be laid off on October 1, which would be before the reviewer is able to finish his or her work.  In addition to harming patients and families who rely on medical innovation, a delay in reauthorization would[[Page S2839]]threaten America's global leadership in biomedical innovation.  After reviewing the recommendations from industry and the FDA, I believe these are good agreements for patients. The sooner we pass the legislation, the better so as to give patients, doctors, FDA reviewers, and companies' certainty.  At this moment, Washington, DC, is not a very bipartisan town on many issues, but on this issue--the issue of user fees to support the Food and Drug Administration--it has been.  I compliment Senator Patty Murray and her staff. Senator Murray is the ranking Democrat on the HELP Our staffs have been working together for 15 months in a bipartisan way and working with the House of Representatives to try to make sure we can present to the full Senate our FDA user fee agreements. We have had two bipartisan hearings. Tomorrow, we have a markup at which we hope those agreements will be reported to the Senate floor.  The FDA has a vital and important mission, and I am confident Gottlieb is the right person to be leading the agency. We are fortunate that he is willing to serve. I look forward to the Senate's approving Gottlieb's confirmation this afternoon.

14856,topic-id,575,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the time, and I am grateful to be here with the gentleman. I want to speak to both of these bills rather than speaking to a different bill that was considered in this body.  With regard to H.1761, this bill became necessary because of the court-imposed misinterpretation of a congressional statute with regard to the visual depiction, or live transmission, of a victim of child abuse, or sexually explicit conduct. This is important because it closes a loophole that otherwise would allow a perpetrator to walk free because of a lack of specific intent when recording images of the victim that they are victimizing.  This bill is important because it closes the loophole and gets back to what the intent of Congress was when they passed legislation intended to protect children and criminalized the production of images of child sexual abuse. This bill does all we can at this point to protect our children from sexual predators.  It is a moral necessity that we close this shameful loophole, created by a judicial opinion, to provide the appropriate punishment to those who look to harm minors. It won't protect all of our children, but it will provide a significant deterrent to protect more of our children, and that makes this bill important, crucial, and necessary.  With regard to H.1973, Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act of 2017, this broadens the coverage of current laws that require reporting of child abuse, specifically with regard to those children who are participating in organizations that are organized for the purpose of helping--ostensibly helping--young athletes train for international competition.  When you are a parent of an athlete, just like your child, you trust these coaches who are mentoring and working and interacting with your children not just for training these children and preparing them to be the best athlete they possibly can be, but you also entrust, many times, your children's keeping to them.  Gone are the days where kids were playing in Little League and saw their coaches for brief periods of time. In many instances, the children that will be protected by this bill are those elite young athletes who spend quite a bit of time actually away from their parents and in the care and custody of coaches, trainers, and other people associated with the program.  As a father of athletes, it is important that I be able to trust that, if someone has been convicted or has had to report that, that information is available. And due to this particular[[Page H4522]]legislation, the government will now be able to pursue cases that it would not otherwise be able to prosecute.  This legislation specifies that national governing bodies are authorized to develop training oversight practices, policies, and procedures to prevent sexual abuse of amateur athletes. And then what is critical, it requires that it is necessary to assure child abuse is being reported by those who work with amateur athletes. Those reporting requirements are essential protective deterrences and provide assurances to all surrounding that young child and that athlete that they have the opportunity for safekeeping.  Organizations must be taking action against coaches or other members when allegations are made against them to assure young athletes are kept safe. The safety of these young athletes must trump, in many cases, perhaps, their ability to develop their unique gifts and talents.  Mr.Speaker, I am grateful that these bills are brought forward, and I support them.  ",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgH4520-4.txt,99999999999999,REDUCING REGULATORY BURDENS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,24.0,May

14968,topic-id,490,"Mr.President, last week the Senate passed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, but this legislation does nothing to address one of the most critical problems at the To improve the healthcare our returning heroes receive, we need a VA that is fully staffed with the best healthcare professionals we can find, and in many VA facilities throughout the Nation, including in Ohio, that is far from the case.  Across the U.S., there are more than 49,000 VA vacancies that this administration has yet to fill. In Ohio, as of[[Page S3485]]April of this year, there were more than 1,700 VA vacancies, and more than 1,500 of those positions were considered critical to public health and safety.  That is a massive problem that needs immediate attention by the administration. These vacancies are not just numbers; they have serious consequences for our veterans who need care.  When the VA is understaffed, it means longer wait times. It means veterans unable to see the specialists they need. It means overstretched doctors.  Overworked doctors means mistakes are more likely and veterans are not getting the quality care they deserve.  Imagine a doctor tells an Ohio veteran she needs an Well, if there is no MRI tech at that facility because they have not hired one, she has to wait longer for the test and diagnosis. She might have to find someone to drive her to another town.  The last thing we ought to be doing is making it harder for these men and women who have sacrificed so much for our country to get the care they need. We owe all of our veterans--and the families who support them--our gratitude, our respect, and the best healthcare in the world. That means recruiting talented doctors, nurses, and other staff members has to be a priority for the  The agency must improve outreach to prospective employees to show that it is a desirable place to work. It needs to demonstrate that employee's voices, including those of whistleblowers, will be heard and protected when necessary. Future VA employees need to know that all efforts by VA workers to improve the quality of services provided to our veterans will be encouraged, appreciated, and acted on.  We absolutely need to ensure that we are holding the workers who care for our veterans and servicemembers to the highest standards--but that is not enough.  We can improve the quality of care by the VA by making sure it is properly and fully staffed. That is currently not the case, and I will continue to press the VA to provide answers as to why more than 1,700 positions in Ohio--positions that should be filled by Americans dedicated to serving our veterans--are vacant.  When our servicemembers return home, they should be able to focus on spending time with loved ones and rejoining their communities, not worrying about whether they will be able to get the quality healthcare they deserve.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-14-pt1-PgS3484-2.txt,2106,STREAMLINING DHS OVERHEAD ACT,2017.0,14.0,May

14858,topic-id,959,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Nearly 30 years ago, I held my son, Cody, for the first time. A couple of years later, I held my daughter, I knew right then that these two children were the most important and cherished things in my life. They deserve the happiest childhood and the brightest future and the safest world.  I imagine anyone who holds their child for the first time has the same thought. Until you become a parent, it is hard to describe the love you have for your children.                              {time}  1245  Mr.Speaker, that someone would hurt a child simply perplexes me. Children are the most vulnerable, the most innocent in our society. They, most of all, don't deserve the trauma and pain that accompany abuse. They don't deserve to have their trust in adults or their trust in the world shattered at such a young age. They don't deserve the ghosts of suffering that accompany abuse victims for the rest of their lives.  Mr.Speaker, to commit a crime against children is to engage in the greatest of evils. It is to violate our moral order in the most egregious of ways. Our job in Congress is to debate and maintain that moral order. Thankfully, everyone in this Chamber can agree on the moral imperative to protect children.  Our job today is to uphold our values through well-crafted legislation. We are here today to pass laws that uphold our belief in the sanctity of innocence. We are here today for our children.  Mr.Speaker, H.1973, the first bill in this rule resolution, strengthens the laws protecting child athletes. The bill requires coaches and adults involved with amateur sports organizations overseen by the U.Olympic Committee to report suspected child abuse to local and Federal authorities.  Unfortunately, reporting isn't always the standard under current law. Over the past 20 years, around 368 individuals affiliated with USA Gymnastics faced sexual abuse by adults affiliated with the organization, according to The Indianapolis Sadly, some of the victims never saw justice. Their allegations remained unresolved, sometimes because coaches moved from State to State to avoid investigation.  H.1973 pulls additional adults into the mandatory reporting category, ensuring that those adults working with minors under the U.Olympic Committee's jurisdiction must report instances of child abuse to local and Federal authorities.  It further clarifies the sexual abuse reporting duties of national governing bodies, or These organizations, supervised by the U.Olympic Committee, manage amateur athletic competitions.  We need to promote a culture of reporting sexual assault among youth athletes. That culture needs to overflow into all parts of our society.  We are not suggesting we toss out due process for the accused. The legislation at hand only requires the reporting and investigation of sexual abuse of children. Additionally, H.1973 makes stronger the civil remedies that victims of sexual abuse may pursue.  Mr.Speaker, the other legislation under this rule, H.1761, goes after those who create child pornography. Just to utter those words is unbearable, but our job in Congress is to stop the unbearable.  Under current law and due to the impact of the court ruling in United States v. Palomino-Coronado, perpetrators of child pornography can sometimes evade prosecution for child pornography under a loophole. Under the precedent set in the case, even if perpetrators memorialize the sexual abuse of a child through images and video, they do not necessarily possess the intent or purpose to sexually abuse children in order to take a picture. In other words, they didn't intend to violate title 18 of the U.Code, section 2251, which prohibits child pornography.  We need to close this loophole. If evildoers are sexually abusing our children and photographing or filming it, they should be going to prison for a long time. This loophole was carved out by the judicial branch. It is time for the legislative branch to step in and tighten the statutory language to prevent the exploitation of this loophole and to prevent the exploitation of our children.  The bills under consideration today serve two purposes. First and foremost, they provide a deterrent to criminals who would consider harming a child.  We can't preemptively stop everyone who plans to commit a crime against a child, which is why we must deter them with the threat of discovery, conviction, and jail time.  These bills very practically make the exploitation of a child harder to get away with. They commission more well-meaning adults to be on guard against the occurrence of sexual abuse. They allow victims to pursue even stronger civil penalties that will, hopefully, deter future criminals, and they strengthen the law itself to ensure that child pornographers face prosecution and appropriate punishment for their heinous crimes.  The second purpose achieved today is to send a message. These bills signal to all of America that our society is serious about protecting children and that we are serious about catching child predators.  H.1973 specifically directs coaches and others to report sexual abuse. But these bills send a broader message: everyone in this Nation should join the fight against child exploitation.  We have too many examples of well-meaning adults remaining silent in the face of child abuse. This legislation is meant to push Americans to do what is right, even if it is not easy.  We are all the guardians of our Nation's youth. We all are responsible for their childhood. We are all proponents of their future. These are our children, our pride and joy. We must offer them the same vigilance and protection we offer our own children. The rule before us gives this House a chance to do just that.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important rule and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

14974,topic-id,886,"Mr.President, today I wish to speak about the issue of international religious freedom.  Sadly, in recent months, the nightly news has reported far too many stories of innocent people around the world who have been intentionally targeted in acts of horrible violence simply because of their desire to worship in a way their consciences dictate.  Recently, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association held the first ``World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians'' in Washington, where participants from 130 countries gathered together, many of whom have faced brutal persecution in their home country because of their faith.  As I am sure my colleagues and most Americans know, Billy Graham has touched the lives of millions of people in the United States and around the world. He has counseled Presidents and Prime Ministers and has been called America's pastor. As a fellow North Carolinian, I am proud call both Billy Graham and his son Franklin my friends.  As the son of a Presbyterian minister, these recent events reminded me of a letter written by my late father, David Burr, to my grandparents. On Thanksgiving Day 1964, writing from South Korea as a soldier in the Army, my dad wrote a letter about a special worship service held for troops in a tiny chapel on the side of a hill, just within sight of the 38th Parallel dividing North and South With rifles in tow, my father and his fellow soldiers made their way through the snow and into the chapel. To their surprise, the man standing up front to conduct the worship was not their usual Protestant or Catholic chaplain, but a young Jewish rabbi and a veteran of the previous war.  In his letter, my father wrote about the beautiful lesson he had heard that day where the scripture reading was from Hosea chapter 6, which says, ``The voice of God cried unto His people, What shall I do with you? For your goodness is as the morning cloud, and as the dew that goes early away. For I desire goodness, not promises; I desire acknowledgement and not your bargains.'' My father, deeply moved by the message, then went on to write about the rabbi's powerful benediction prayer that closed the worship: ``He that enjoys anything without thanksgiving is as though he robbed God.''  Every July Fourth, our country gives thanks for the freedoms we are privileged to have as Americans and celebrates the birth of our Indeed, the freedoms we enjoy are immortalized in our Declaration of Independence: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.''  The Founding Fathers understood that these unalienable rights, including the freedom to worship, was a fundamental human right endowed by our  As I read from my father's letter, I can see he realized this, too. ``All the way back to the barracks,'' he wrote, ``I knew that I was one who was stealing from God, for every day I am enjoying the times that were so full and wonderful there at home. Every day, though we are cold and discouraged, my heart is warm with your prayers and thoughts of you, and I have not been thanking I have not been fair, for God has walked with me all these years and I have never thought to say thank you to Him.''  I share this story today because I believe that, if we as Americans are thankful for these unalienable rights endowed by our Creator, we should also stand up for the millions across the world who are robbed of these same fundamental human rights--and sometimes lose their lives because of it. As Members of the U.Senate, we especially should not forget this.  As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I think about North Korea, I think about Iran, and Ithink about all the different regions around the world where terrorist activity poses a real threat to our national security. Today I also think about[[Page S3990]]places like North Korea, Iran, and so many other countries not just in a national security capacity alone, but about the people who are suffering under political systems that deny their fundamental right to freely worship as they choose.  The rabbi's lesson of Hosea chapter 6 that day was about a passage where strength, courage, and hope by the great Hand above were poured into those who were lonesome, afraid, and discouraged. At the end of my dad's letter, he asked my grandfather, ``Please, dad, put the benediction of the rabbi over your desk for that is the quickest way you can bring me home.'' If so, by keeping international religious freedom as a foreign policy priority, I believe that is the quickest way we can bring persecuted people hope.  As my father did in his letter, I close by repeating the rabbi's benediction: ``He that enjoys anything without thanksgiving is as though he robbed God.'' I urge my colleagues: Let's remember to be thankful for the God-given freedoms we enjoy in the United States and to shine a light on the dark corners of the world. Let's not forget in this Congress how we can help the millions who are robbed of these fundamental rights.  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-13-pt1-PgS3989.txt,153,REDUCING REGULATORY BURDENS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,13.0,June

14868,topic-id,2003,"Mr.President, the topic before us is clearly the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, and that is what I rise to speak about today. In part I will speak as a Senator, and in part I will speak as a doctor, as I am a physician. My wife is also a physician. I worked in a hospital for the uninsured for many years.  First, let's just describe the state of play. It is so interesting, President Obama's healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act,  I had two different communications yesterday, one from a sister-in-law in San I think her husband voted for Bernie She is, you know--but she said: This is incredible. Speaking of herself, she said: I am paying $20,000 a year in premiums, and each of my family members has a $6,000 deductible.  They have to pay San Francisco prices for everything, and they make good money but not exorbitant money. They are paying $20,000 a year for a premium, for a young couple in good health, with a family deductible probably of $13,000.  The next communication was in a phone call with a consultant here in Washington, DC, who does healthcare. He knows his stuff, and at some point, he breaks out of sort of a professional kind of ``this is the way I talk,'' and he says: You don't see my insurance. I am paying $24,000 a year for premiums, and I have a $13,000 family deductible. If my family gets in an accident, it will be $37,000 my family puts out before we see any benefit from our insurance.  I reminded him he would have preventive services, such as a colonoscopy, but that was cold comfort for him.  The reality is that middle-class America can no longer afford the now-ironically named Affordable Care So where does that leave us?  President Trump--I like to say because I think he would say it--established a contract with the American voter. President Trump said that he wanted to continue the number of folks who were covered under ObamaCare, he wanted to take care of those with preexisting conditions, he wanted to eliminate mandates because Americans hate to be told what to do by the Federal Government, and lastly, he wanted to lower costs. I think the average voter took lower costs to mean lower premiums, not a better CBO score, and lower premiums are really what those two communications are about.  The second thing I will note is that he was very passionate about a particular preexisting condition that the Presiding Officer here in the Senate cares about, which is opioid addiction. And he would go to counties where[[Page S2831]]there was a high incidence of opioid addiction and speak to how he wished to address their needs.  So I think President Trump's proposals--his contract with the voter--really give us hope. The question is, How do we achieve that? Well, first we have to acknowledge a couple of things.  Rich Lowry is a conservative author for National Review, and he wrote a column: Basically, coverage is important. We cannot deny--no one can deny that it is important to have coverage. And if we speak--as the Presiding Officer did at lunch--about the family whose son is addicted to narcotics and the fact that now he has coverage and he is able to get off of the opioids instead of either dying, living in a gutter, or being incarcerated--that is a sign of hope. And when President Trump spoke of the forgotten man or the forgotten woman, in my mind, I think in his mind, he was referring to someone such as that.  So we have to acknowledge, as Rich Lowry did, that coverage is important. My own experience as a physician supports that. I am actually going to quote somebody from my wife's experience. My wife is a retired breast cancer surgeon, and she once told me about a patient who lived in a nice section of my hometown, Baton Rouge, had a nice car and children in parochial school, paying tuition. But her husband died. He always managed the family affairs, and he died, and she ended up uninsured. She had a nice car and nice home and kids in parochial school, but she didn't have insurance.  Going back to coverage being important, she began to develop breast cancer--something that is described in medicine as fungating, which means the cancer begins to eat through the skin on the chest--and she didn't know where to go because she didn't have coverage. And when the breast cancer was actually coming out of her skin is when she came to see my wife. My wife operated on her for free. The hospital wrote off the cost. But that is not the end of it because then she needed radiation therapy, she needed breast reconstruction, and she needed chemotherapy. And her only hope for survival is if she had this coverage.  So we can acknowledge two things--that coverage is important but also that premiums under the Affordable Care Act have become unaffordable.  I will go back to what President Trump said. President Trump said he wants everyone to be covered, care for those with preexisting conditions, without mandates, and lower premiums. That is something, whether Republican or Democratic or Independent, we should be able to get behind.  How do we have a path forward? Some folks say: Well, President Trump's promise cannot be kept. There was a good article recently by Jim Capretta, a conservative economist, and he says that, basically, we can achieve these goals. The way we do it is we automatically enroll folks in the insurance program so that if you are a young person, you get a credit, and that would be sufficient enough to pay for your annual premium. You don't have to take it, but if you do, you are automatically enrolled in insurance. By automatically enrolling these young people, we expand the risk pool, which is to say that we now have a lot of healthy young folks, most of whom will not get sick, but the fact that they are in the insurance pool means that those who are older and sicker will have lower premiums because the cost of their care is spread out over the many. That is a good thing. That would increase coverage and it would lower premiums without mandates, taking care of those with preexisting conditions.  I think Candidate Trump's genius was to recognize that the only way you get to lower premiums is if you expand coverage, and the only way to care for those with preexisting conditions is to expand coverage.  I am pleased to say we have a proposal that is called the Patient Freedom Act, which I have cosponsored and introduced with Susan Collins, and four other of our Republican Senators have cosponsored it. The six of us propose this: that every State be given the right to choose their path forward. If you are a blue State, you can continue with the status quo; you just have to reimpose penalties and mandates. If you are a red State, you can go in a different direction where folks in your State get a tax credit, again, sufficient for the premiums. Not everybody will be eligible--typically, lower income folks--and this credit can only be used for health insurance or healthcare. If you do nothing, you end up with a health savings account, prefunded. You have first-dollar coverage.  If you have to take your daughter to the urgent care center--instead of an ObamaCare $6,000 deductible, when your daughter has her earache, you have first-dollar coverage to pay that $150 to get your child seen and to buy the antibiotics. If the mother instead wishes to pool her family's health savings accounts together, their tax credits together, she could buy a richer family policy or she could assign it to her employer as the employee's contribution on employer-sponsored insurance. The patient has the power.  I should say, in my medical practice, I found that if the patient has the power, the system lines up to serve the patient.  By the way, just a rule of thumb: If you ever go to a hospital that delivers babies and you walk in, it is clear who has the power. The walls are painted mauve or powder blue or pink. There is a concierge to park your car because women don't like to walk in parking lots at night. And if you are pregnant, you really don't want to walk at all, so someone parks your car for you. There is a coffee shop as you walk in, and a floral shop. It is all a therapeutic experience that addresses not just the physical need but the emotional and psychological need, and that is because that system is lining up to serve her, that patient. The Patient Freedom Act incorporates that.  By the way, we also have a third option. If a State doesn't want to have anything to do with this, the State can say: Take a hike; we don't want you. But generally, States have three options, and that recognizes a conservative principle that States should have the right to do what they want to do and what works best for the But we do require the patient have the power.  Now, I will be frank. I am not sure we are going to pass meaningful reform as good as it could be with only the Republican side of the So aside from asking my Senators to join with me and my Republican Senators to promote something that fulfills President Trump's pledge, I ask my Democratic colleagues to look beyond partisanship and to say: Wait a second; wouldn't it be good if a blue State could do a blue thing and a red State could do a different plan for themselves? Wouldn't it be good if President Trump, in his contract with voters, said: Eliminate mandates but also lower premiums, which are so much of a problem for so many Americans now, while at the same time covering and caring for those with preexisting conditions.  I ask my Democratic colleagues to move beyond partisanship--or perhaps they are not liking the results of the election--and into a spirit of cooperation that puts patient before party. We don't need a red plan or a blue plan, a Democratic plan or Republican plan. We need an American plan.  I will finish by saying this. There is another way to lower premiums, and that is to give lousy coverage. I coined the phrase, and I didn't realize it would become so instantaneously recognized, but we should also have the Jimmy Kimmel test. I think people understand that Mr.Kimmel's child was born, and instead of being a celebration as a new life emerges into the world, all of a sudden it quickly became that the child was blue and would die. The whole medical staff comes in, recognizing that the child has a rare cardiac condition that, if not immediately operated on, would be fatal. The child was transferred, and after several surgeries already in its first week of life, apparently, is doing well.  I raise that because, again, we can lower premiums by having lousy coverage. But whatever we do to lower premiums, it should pass what I call the Jimmy Kimmel test, which is that someone you love has adequate coverage for the care he or she needs when they need it. In that way, I think we can be fiscally responsible, and we can help someone like my family or the man I talked to yesterday, paying $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 for their insurance. We have to do something about[[Page S2832]]that and at the same time fulfill the rest of President Trump's contract with the voters which is to care for those with preexisting conditions, to continue coverage, and to eliminate mandates.

14779,topic-id,166,"Mr.Speaker, today, Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions spoke in Memphis, I felt like I was listening to something out of the fifties or sixties. He put out all the platitudes about being tough on crime and locking people up and thinking that was going to help solve the crime problem.  He didn't talk at all about the cost of crime and the Bernie Madoff-like budget that we have been presented by the Trump administration, cutting minority business centers, cutting SNAP funding, cutting LIHEAP funding, and cutting opportunities for Medicaid, healthcare, and education.  There are causes to crime that should be attacked. There is a smart way to attack crime, and there is a dumb way to attack crime. The dumb way is to return to the era where we failed because we locked up so many people at $30,000 a year that the only people who are happy about his approach are the private prison industry who make money out of people's misery and crime.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgH4593.txt,,KATE'S LAW,2017.0,25.0,July

14927,topic-id,242,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.953, Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017. This legislation eliminates the requirement to acquire two permits for the same pesticide application under two separate laws and, I might add, if you live in California, there is a separate requirement under the California Clean Water Act that requires an additional permit. That would still apply regardless if this legislation is passed.  In order to be permitted to use a pesticide, that pesticide must be approved under FIFRA, which includes an analysis that must be performed that finds it will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects to the environment or to the health. However, current law requires another permit to be acquired for the same action under the Clean Water Act if you happen to be close to a water body, and that is where the duplication occurs.  Not only are these requirements redundant, they are expensive, and the cost of the individual Clean Water Act permit ranges from $150,000 to $270,000 and can take up to 2 years. No one wants to risk human health, not I, not anyone, but in my opinion this would not do so. We have Zika, we have West Nile, and we have a host of spreading of these diseases by mosquitoes in which this, in fact, can address those issues.

14825,topic-id,653,"Mr.President, the attacks in London last weekend exposed in a matter of minutes just how vulnerable free societies truly are. All it takes is a van or a knife and an unsuspecting bystander to turn a fun night out on the town into a horrific nightmare.  Of course, we shouldn't need any reminders, but let me give one yet again: We are at war with Islamic extremists. We have been for years, and I am sorry to say that there is no end in sight. It is easy to forget this as we go about our daily lives, but our enemies have not, and they will not. They have never taken their eyes off the ultimate target, either--the United  Yes, we are at war with a vicious and unyielding foe, and just as our enemy can attack us with the simplest of everyday tools, the strongest shield we have in our defense is just as basic: It is the intelligence--information--of knowing who is talking to whom about what, where, when, and why.  After the 9/11 attacks, our national security agencies developed cutting-edge programs that allow us to figure out what the bad guys are up to and stop them before they can perpetrate such heinous attacks. Very often, the intelligence they have collected has made the difference between life and death for American citizens. But one of those programs is going to sunset later this year. I am talking about section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance This is a program that collects information about foreign persons on foreign soil and, as a result, saves American lives.  Unfortunately, this and other programs were distorted in the public debate by a traitor, a disgruntled ex-NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, who now sits in the warm embrace of Russian intelligence services. Ever since his very damaging leak of classified material many years back, many Americans have grown doubtful about these programs and about section 702 in particular, which is why it bears repeating just what section 702 does. It allows our national security agencies to collect internet or phone communications from a source within the United States, like an internet service provider, but only under a very specific set of conditions. It cannot target American citizens--not even lawful permanent residents. It can't even target foreigners communicating on U.soil. It can target only people discussing a specific list of topics preapproved by the FISA court, which is made up of Federal judges with life tenure. We are not talking about what they are picking up at the grocery store or when they are checking in on the kids. We are talking about things like weapons of mass destruction.  It is true that this program occasionally does collect information about American citizens. That will be true of any attempt to stop any kind of homegrown terrorism. But if you are concerned about protecting Americans' privacy rights, then you should support extending 702. It puts in place a host of privacy protections to scrub raw intelligence of any unnecessary identifying information. To allow this program to expire on December 31 would hurt both our national security and our privacy rights.  That is why today I am introducing a bill that would reauthorize section 702 permanently, as is, with no changes. We can't tie the hands of our national security officials at the precise moment that our enemies are taking the gloves off around the world. Terrorists don't plan to sunset their threats to our way of life, so why should our important counterterrorism tools sunset?  I am glad to say that my legislation has the support of every Republican Senator on the Intelligence Committee, and I look forward to earning the support of my colleagues in the weeks ahead because we can't afford to let this program expire. It is not too much and it is not an exaggeration to say that American lives depend on section 702.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-06-pt1-PgS3296.txt,2098,NORTH KOREA,2017.0,6.0,July

Again, that has been the struggle for people on both sides of the Long Island Sound, who have been frustrated by the fact that, because Congress mandated a sale without any other options, the incredible, pristine environmental quality of this precious piece of property was basically pushed down the food chain in terms of, again, the way the Federal Government was operating.  Again, I think it is important to recognize--and my colleagues from New York, Mr.Donovan and Mr.Zeldin, understand this--this still is the most densely populated area of The boat traffic, the maritime traffic that flows through Long Island Sound, again, is the busiest in the country. And to have a piece of property that is this precious and this pure--which Mr.Zeldin visited, and I think he can attest to that personally, and I have sailed past it--is really an opportunity that really we just cannot possibly allow to go to a developer that would make that quality forever lost.  So this legislation, which stops the 2009 process in its tracks, has GAO step in and do a full complete analysis across the board in evaluating all options. In particular, the options of preserving this unique environmental asset is the right move for our country, and, again, it will be to the benefit of generations to come.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:                               H.2182       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Plum Island Preservation      Act''.     2.       Congress finds the following:       (1) The Federal Government has owned Plum Island, New York,      since 1899.       (2) Since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center has      conducted unrivaled scientific research on a variety of      infectious animal-borne diseases, including foot-and-mouth      disease, resulting, most recently, in the development of a      new cell line that rapidly and reliably detects this highly      debilitating disease of livestock.       (3) Over 62 years, the Center has had a strong, proven      record of safety.       (4) $23,200,000 in Federal dollars have been spent on      upgrades to, and the maintenance of, the Center since January      2012.       (5) In addition to the Center, Plum Island contains      cultural, historical, ecological, and natural resources of      regional and national significance.       (6) Plum Island is situated where the Long Island Sound and      Peconic Bay meet, both of which are estuaries that are part      of the National Estuary Program and are environmentally and      economically significant to the region.       (7) The Federal Government has invested hundreds of      millions of Federal dollars over the last two decades to make      long-term improvements with respect to the conservation and      management needs of Long Island Sound and Peconic       (8) In a report submitted to Congress on April 11, 2016,      entitled ``National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility      Construction Plan Update'' the Department of Homeland      Security noted that the new National Bio- and Agro-Defense      Facility under construction on such date in Manhattan,      Kansas, is, as of such date, fully paid for through a      combination of Federal appropriations and funding from the      State of     3. REPORT REQUIRED ON FINAL DISPOSITION OF PLUM       Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of      this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall      submit to Congress a report containing the following:       (1) The alternatives for the final disposition of Plum      Island, including the transfer of ownership to another      Federal agency, a State or local government, a nonprofit      organization, or a combination thereof for the purpose of      education, research, or conservation.       (2) With respect to each such alternative final      disposition, an analysis of--       (A) the effect such disposition would have on the island's      resources;       (B) the remediation responsibilities under such      disposition;       (C) any future legislation necessary to implement such      disposition;       (D) the possible implications and issues, if any, of      implementing such disposition;       (E) the costs of such disposition, including any potential      costs related to the transition, hazard mitigation, and      cleanup of property that would be incurred by a recipient of      the property under such disposition; and       (F) the potential revenue from such disposition.     4.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.2182, the Plum Island Preservation Act, sponsored by my colleague from New York (Mr.Zeldin).  This bill requires the Government Accountability Office to review the alternatives for the final disposition of the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate's Plum Island Animal Disease Center, commonly known as Plum  Since 1954, Plum Island, located in Suffolk County, New York, has served the Nation in defending against accidental or intentional introduction of foreign animal diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease. However, Plum Island's facilities are aging and nearing the end of their life cycle.  That is why in 2005, DHS announced that the work being conducted on Plum Island would be moved to a new Federal facility in Plum Island will continue to operate until the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility is fully operational and a complete transition has been made in 2022 or 2023.  This raises the question of what will happen to Plum Island once its activities are fully transferred over to the[[Page H6240]]new facility. The Department looked at this issue and, in June of 2016, released a report that reviewed several options for the final disposition of Plum  This bill simply requires GAO to review and analyze these alternatives to ensure all necessary information was taken into account before the Department decides how to move forward with the final disposition of Plum Specifically, GAO is to analyze the effects, possible implications and issues, and potential costs and revenue for each disposition.  Finally, H.2182 suspends the sale of Plum Island until GAO completes this thorough review and analysis of alternatives.

14877,topic-id,577,"Mr.President, I wish to express concern with President Trump's nominee to serve as next Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration,  The FDA Commissioner is responsible for overseeing our Federal agency tasked with protecting and promoting the public health through the regulation of food, tobacco products, dietary supplements, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and veterinary products. I am not convinced that Scott Gottlieb is the right person for this job, based primarily on his less than impressive record of defending women's access to healthcare, his association with an ecigarette--or vaping--company that has produced and marketed tobacco products to youth, his stated desire to expand ``off-label'' communications between drug companies and health providers, and his long-standing and vocal opposition to the Affordable Care Act, If confirmed, I hope he proves me wrong.  Of particular concern to me is protecting our Nation's food safety. I was pleased that, in 2001, then-President Obama signed into law the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, marking the most comprehensive reform of our Nation's food safety system in decades. Every year, 48 million Americans suffer from preventable foodborne illness. More than 120,000 people are hospitalized each year because of food contamination and 3,000 die. Every 4 minutes, someone is rushed to the hospital because the food they ate made them sick, and at the end of the day, eight will die--which is why I have spent much of my career working on various bills to strengthen food safety structures at FDA and the U.Department of Agriculture, to create a single food safety agency, and to support increased inspection and protection of foreign food imports. Even with passage of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, more work remains to be done. We must further beef up both foreign and domestic facility inspections. We must ensure the FDA has sufficient staff and resources to carry out their responsibilities. We must do a better job of effectively tracking and tracing high-risk foods in the event of a foodborne illness outbreak.  In addition, the FDA can and must do more to better regulate dietary supplements. I was pleased that, in 2015, the FDA announced creation of the Office of Dietary Supplement Programs to increase focus on and regulation of the ever-growing dietary supplement industry. It is my hope that this FDA office continues to receive the funding they so desperately need to carry out their mission of regulating a $35 billion dietary supplement industry and aggressively pursue wrongdoing.  Finally, ecigarette products continue to be a growing threat to our Nation's youth. Last year, then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy released a report, calling the skyrocketing use of ecigarettes among youth ``a major public health concern.'' Ecigarettes are now the most commonly used form of tobacco among young people in the United Over the past 5 years, the number of middle school and high school students who have used ecigarettes has tripled. Among young adults aged 18 to 24, the number has doubled. While some research indicates that ecigarettes contain fewer toxic substances than ecigarettes, vape from ecigarettes is not harmless, and these products are a gateway to smoking. The popularity of ecigarettes stems in part from aggressive marketing and products aimed at youth, including the marketing of bubble gum, tutti frutti, and marshmallow flavorings. The FDA must aggressively oversee these products and ensure that they are not being marketed to children or young adults. Any attempt to exempt these products from FDA regulation will be met with extreme resistance from me.  ",CREC-2017-05-09-pt1-PgS2830.txt,326,REDUCING REGULATORY BURDENS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,9.0,May

Their requests are simple: increase their manpower to provide them with a sufficient number of agents to interdict not just drugs and guns from cartels, but also criminals and terrorists who seek to do us harm; invest in the technology that they need to do their jobs, to include drones and aerial surveillance, infrared technology, heat sensors, motion detectors both above and below the ground, and an array of 21st century, high-tech options that serve as force multipliers along the border.  They need physical barriers in various forms along various stretches of the border in order to slow down the cartels and allow for sufficient response time for the agents to interdict. Moreover, we must invest heavily in a robust human intelligence program, giving our agents the resources they need to recruit human sources on the other side of the border to provide our agents with the advance notice of both the sources and the methods of criminal conspiracies that are forming along the border.  In addition, we must bolster the Office of Inspector General to crack down on border corruption through the use of drug testing, financial screening, and polygraph examinations.  Mr.Speaker, the concept of border security is a multipronged challenge that requires action on all fronts, not just one or two, and I urge my friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Please do not politicize this issue.

14920,topic-id,1482,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Today we are considering H.953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017, introduced to clarify congressional intent regarding pesticide use in or near navigable waters.  The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, otherwise known as FIFRA, is the appropriate Federal statute to govern safety and the use of pesticides.  FIFRA first passed in 1910, 62 years before the Clean Water Act was passed. In 2009, the Sixth Circuit Court decision, the National Cotton Council v. EPA, changed how this all works. For years before the Clean Water Act, pesticide use was regulated by the EPA under Under FIFRA, the EPA regulates and approves pesticides for safe use under the label, and they have full jurisdiction under  The EPA previously ruled that using pesticides under FIFRA-approved use does not require a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, otherwise known as NPDES, permit under the Clean Water  Because of this court decision in 2009, those who have been safely applying products to control pest populations now must comply with additional NPDES permitting.  Some of my colleagues across the aisle have called this Groundhog Day in the past. I agree. Time after time, they have supported increasing the regulations just for regulation's sake. They are even willing to risk public health and outbreaks of Zika and West Nile virus.  The Sixth Circuit Court decision ignored the congressional intent when the FIFRA and the Clean Water Act were passed. The court ignored sensible agency interpretation, it ignored years of regulatory precedent, it expanded the clean water jurisdiction beyond the scope set by Congress and over areas already appropriately regulated. The court decision placed burden on the[[Page H4536]]EPA, requiring a new and expanded NPDES permitting process for products already regulated.  The EPA says there are about 365,000 pesticide applicators affected by this ruling. They would include State agencies, cities and counties, mosquito control districts, water districts, pesticide applicators, farmers and ranchers, forest managers, scientists, and even everyday citizens or homeowners.  The EPA estimates $50 million in paperwork to comply alone every year with this new regulation. Federal, State, and local agencies are forced to spend taxpayer dollars in permitting, paperwork, and compliance. Private applicators, like farmers and ranchers, also face increased costs. This adds compliance costs, adds permitting costs, and it adds time and hurts productivity and efficiency. It does not add any new environmental protections.  This bad court decision affecting the budgetary decisions from local agencies, I will give you some examples here: the Benton County, Washington, Mosquito Control District preserves 20 percent of its annual budget in case it is sued under the Clean Water I think it is important to mention when the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972, it was set up with severe penalties to go after the polluters we had--I like to say the polluters of the 1960s--to clean up our waters, that we had severe problems. And when it did that, it also opened it up for citizens' lawsuits and opens up the door for more litigation.  The Benton County, Washington, Mosquito Control District, $37,000 in permit costs and paperwork they have spent. Benton County could have treated almost 2,600 acres for mosquito abatement or 400 lab tests for West Nile virus, or paid for three seasonal workers.  In Gem County, Idaho, the Mosquito Abatement District's staff spends 3 weeks a year tabulating and documenting seasonal pesticide applications related to permit oversight.  California vector control districts have estimated that it costs them $3 million to conduct administration of the NPDES permits. They also have to spend 20 percent of their annual operating budget just to maintain the computer software related to the unnecessary NPDES permit.  As a result of this court ruling, mosquito districts, State and local agencies, are now vulnerable to frivolous lawsuits for things like simple paperwork violations under the Clean Water Fines for these paperwork violations, which obviously don't have any affect on the environment, can be as much as $50,000 a day.  For example, the Gem County, Idaho, Mosquito Abatement District was forced to spend $450,000 to resolve a lawsuit.  In my home State of Ohio, the Mosquito Control District for Toledo is currently embroiled in a citizen's lawsuit from a simple paperwork violation.  The 2012 West Nile outbreak is proof NPDES permits and association costs are hindering the ability to protect the public.  In 2012, the first year of the permitting requirement from the court case, West Nile cases jumped from 712 cases to almost to over 5,600 cases. That is nearly an 800 percent increase because of the unnecessary permit requirements.  The States and communities affected by West Nile had to wait until after a public health emergency was declared. Only then could relief from the NPDES permit be approved. Only after the West Nile had spread could local agencies use lifesaving pesticides to kill mosquitoes carrying the virus. Keep in mind, when the local entity, municipality, declares an emergency, they don't need to get a permit. They can spray. I like to say it is after the fact when the mosquitoes are out of control, then we do aerial spraying. Maybe we could have prevented it with surface spraying and be less harm to the environment. We shouldn't have to wait until it becomes an emergency.  H.953 gets rid of the unnecessary red tape so communities can prevent outbreaks of diseases like Zika and West  Cities that need to conduct the routine preventative mosquito abatement should not have to do it with one hand tied behind their back. H.953 provides a narrow, limited exception from NPDES permit requirements for those pesticides already approved under FIFRA law and used in compliance under the label which is approved by the  I think this is an important point to keep in mind: EPA already regulates these pesticides and approves them under It goes through rigorous testing and reporting requirements, and they set the label and make the determination. They approve how it is going to be used. If it is a restricted pesticide, they can also put more restrictions on the applicators and who the applicators are.  Therefore, removing this redundant NPDES permit is appropriate because the EPA already has full control and can handle the situation like they did for over 60 years before this court case.  The EPA has assisted in drafting H.953, which does not roll back any environmental protections. It fixes the regulatory problem caused by the Sixth Circuit Court's decision and maintains the EPA's jurisdiction through  Similar legislation has passed the House every Congress since the court's decision, and I look forward to passing it again today, and then passing it in the Senate and have the President sign it into law.  A list of organizations--this is a snapshot of the many organizations because I don't have enough time to list all the organizations, but the American Mosquito Control Association supports it; the American Farm Bureau Federation; the National Farmers Union; the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture; the National Association of Wheat Growers; National Corn Growers Association; and United Fresh Produce Those are just a few groups representing thousands of Americans who depend on commonsense EPA regulations for their livelihood.  Mr.Chair, I include in the Record--and I want to talk about it here for a minute--I have a letter from former Secretary of Agriculture In 2009, he was Secretary of Agriculture in the Obama administration. When this court case happened, he sent out a letter to Lisa Jackson, the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection In his letter, he urges the EPA to consider the significant adverse effect of the Sixth Circuit Court's 2009 decision, the National Cotton Council and EPA will have on American farmers and USDA agencies. He said in the letter:  ``By broadening the Act's reach, the court burdens American agriculture with a newly minted NPDES permit requirement. . . .''  ``The Sixth Circuit's decision encumbers the American farmers' and the agencies' ability to do business, while reaping little or no environmental benefit in exchange.''  I want to repeat that. The Secretary of Agriculture in the Obama administration said that this court case has little environmental benefit, and it hampers American farmers to do their job to produce the most wholesome, safe, affordable food in the world.  ``Subjecting FIFRA-compliant pesticides to the additional regulatory regime''--he goes on to say--``of the CWA is duplicative and will not help protect the environment.''  Mr.Chair, I include in the Record this letter, dated March 6, 2009, from Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack and his opposition to the court case and, in his opinion, what this bill does.

14921,topic-id,2468,"Mr.Chair, I have nearly 120 organizations that support H.953, representing a wide variety of public and private entities and thousands of stakeholders. I have a letter from the nearly 120. I listed some of those. Some of the additional names are Agricultural Retailers Association; American Farm Bureau Federation; American Mosquito Control Association; the Association of Equipment Manufacturers; CropLife America; Family Farm Alliance; National Agricultural Aviation Association; the National Alliance of Forest Owners; National Association of State Departments of Agriculture; National Farmers Union; National Pest Management Association; and the National Rural Electric Cooperative I include that letter in the                                                      May 3, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the over one hundred      undersigned organizations, we urge you to vote in favor of      H.953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017.       For almost forty years, the Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA) and pesticide applicators including public health      agencies charged with mosquito control operated exclusively      under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act      (FIFRA). In fact, EPA has testified to the adequacy of      FIFRA's comprehensive regulatory requirements including      substantial enforcement mechanisms in pursuit of that goal.       However, a 2009 activist-inspired lawsuit resulted in a      federal court decision identifying a technicality in the law      that Congress had not properly clarified its intent that      FIFRA should have preeminence over the Clean Water Act (CWA).      This decision resulted in pesticide users being required to      obtain a CWA National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System      (NPDES) permit. These permits were originally created to      address the discharge of waste by major industrial polluters,      but now are mandated for mosquito control districts and      others who are applying pesticides approved by EPA for use in      the environment for their beneficial purposes of trying to      prevent or control the spread of public health disease in the      U.      Though the NPDES permit burden lacks any additional      environmental benefit under these circumstances, it does      force substantial costs on thousands of small application      businesses and farms, as well as the municipal, county, state      and federal agencies responsible for protecting natural      resources and public health. Further, and most menacing, the      permit exposes all pesticide users--regardless of permit      eligibility--to the liability of CWA-based citizen law suits.      In a number of instances, applicators--that once conducted      mosquito abatement applications for local governments and      homeowner associations--can't afford the costs or risk of      frivolous litigation that accompanies NPDES PGPs and have      refrained from conducting public health applications.       H.953 would clarify Congressional intent that federal      law does not require this redundant permit for already      regulated pesticide applications.       In the 112th Congress, similar legislation (H.872)      passed the House Committee on Agriculture and went on to pass      the House of Representatives on suspension. In the 113th      Congress, the legislation (H.935) passed both the House      Committees on Agriculture and Transportation & Infrastructure      by voice vote, and again, the House of In      the 114th Congress, the Zika Vector Control Act (H.897)      passed the House of Representatives yet again. With your help      and support, H.953 will also pass the House and hopefully      become law.       Since H.897 passed the House last year, there has been      yet another costly lawsuit against a mosquito control      district, forcing the district to spend its funds fighting in      court instead of protecting public health.       Under these circumstances, NPDES permit requirements impact      the use of critical pesticides in protecting human health and      the food supply from destructive and disease-carrying pests,      and in managing invasive weeds to keep open waterways and      shipping lanes, to maintain rights of way for transportation      and power generation, and in preventing damage to forests and      recreation areas. The time and funds expended on redundant      permit compliance drains public and private resources. All      this for no measurable benefit to the environment. We urge      you to eliminate this unnecessary, expensive, and duplicative      regulation by ensuring the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of      2017 passes the House on           Sincerely,       Agribusiness Council of Indiana;

For over forty years and through both Democratic and      Republican administrations, the EPA and states held that      these permits did not apply to public health pesticide      applications. However, activist lawsuits forced the EPA to      require such permits even for the application of EPA-     registered pesticides including mosquito control.       AMCA has testified numerous times to establish the burden      created by this court ruling. The threat to the public health      mission of America's mosquito control districts comes in two      costly parts:                        Ongoing Compliance Costs       Though the activists contend that the NPDES permit has      ``modest notification and monitoring requirements'' the      actual experience of mosquito control districts is much      different.       Initially obtaining and maintaining an NPDES permit comes      at considerable expense. California mosquito control      districts estimate the NPDES compliance costs for their 64      districts to be approximately $4 million dollars over six      years. These costs include;       Initial amount spent by Districts determining waters      subject to reporting.       Total amount spent by Districts tracking treatments to      Waters of the US       Water Testing Consultants       NPDES Administration/Regulatory Consultants       Legal fees related to NPDES       Physical monitoring of larvicides--not completed by      consultants       Completing annual reports       In Wyoming, there are several issues that have impacted the      mosquito districts;       Record keeping requirements has redirected 2-5 % of      District funds annually to permit fees and administrative      costs.       The cost for acre applications of both adulticide and      larvicides has increased 5 to 10-fold for some      This is due primarily to the fear that local aerial      applicators have regarding the citizen lawsuits. The local ag      pilots have declined to fly for some of the mosquito      districts in Wyoming, requiring them to go out of state to      professional application companies. The City of Laramie which      was able to treat for an estimated $1 per acre now pays an      estimated $5-$10 per acre. This has greatly reduced the acres      that can be treated with larvicide and adulticides.       In Durango, CO, the Animas Mosquito Control District      reported spending over $50,000 in GPS/GIS system, maintenance      and upgrades purchased to comply with an unknown annual      report requirement. They spent numerous hours conducting      meetings, phone calls and on the computer to clarify the      annual reporting requirements, the detail necessary in annual      reports, and even where to send the information.       The fact that the existence of the permit over the last 6      years has no additional environmental benefit (since      pesticide applications are already governed by FIFRA) makes      these taxpayer diversions from vector control unconscionable.       In a survey of mosquito control programs, 71 reported (out      of 734 nationwide) that their multiyear period expenses      incurred due to the NPDES permitting including operational,      permitting, reporting, monitoring and other administrative      costs totaled over $4 million. (This survey does not include      all of the 6-year California estimate mentioned previously).          How Could $4 Million in NPDES Costs be Better Spent       Seasonal field workers ($11,000 for starter), 377      employees.       Bti larvicide ($1.44/lb), 2,879,738 pounds.       Acres of water larvicided aerially (10 lbs/acre + $5.25      applicator cost = $19.65), 211,034 acres.       Acres of water treated by ground crews (10 lbs./acre),      287,973 acres.       West Nile virus--in house testing of adult mosquitoes      (RAMP) $19.36, 214,195 tests.       30 second radio ads for public education ($40-$200),      103,671-20,734.       Acres of aerial adult mosquito control ($.89 applicator fee      + $.95 chemical), 2,253,708 acres.       Evening ground spraying hours ($396/hr. for vehicle,      employee, adulticide), 10,472 hrs.       Every dollar spent on duplicative regulations is a dollar      that could have been used towards Integrated Pest Management      (IPM) activities that control mosquitoes and prevent      mosquito-borne illness.       Resources must not be diverted from these mosquito control      activities in order to protect public health:       Disease surveillance--trapping and testing adult      mosquitoes, monitoring dead birds.       Larvicides and adult mosquito control--reduce mosquito      populations through targeted applications       Habitat modification/source reduction--ditching/dredgers to      permanently reduce mosquito oviposition habitats to reduce      the need for chemical control measures.       Monitoring invasive species of mosquitoes.       Public education--publications on reducing backyard sources      of mosquitoes, information on repellent and personal      protective measures.       Employees, training, and certifications.       Programs that are most affected:       Poorer, rural mosquito control districts       Programs associated with small municipalities       In the Western US, those associated with private aerial      contractors concerned with taking on the added liability.       Municipalities in the south looking to start Zika virus      control efforts. Why would Congress approve $1.1 Billion to      fight and explore Zika virus and then burden us with      regulations that hinder our ability to control the vector of      the disease?       So, why would the activist organizations be so adamant that      these permits be mandatory for public health pesticide      applications . . . ?                    Exposure to Activist Litigation       Municipal mosquito control programs are vulnerable to CWA      citizen lawsuits where fines to mosquito control districts      may exceed $37,500/day. Under FIFRA, the activists would need      to demonstrate that the pesticides were misapplied, that the      product labels were not followed. Additionally, this is not a      question of the applications causing harm to public health.      The pesticides we use are specific to mosquitoes and are      generally used in very low doses by qualified applicators).       However, the CWA 3rd Party Citizen Suit Provision allows      for any third party to sue for alleged violations of NPDES      program requirements. Additionally, the CWA does not require      actual evidence of a misapplication of a pesticide or harm to      the environment,[[Page H4539]]     but rather simple paperwork violations or merely allegations      in permit oversight.       The Toledo Area Sanitary District is currently involved in      a lawsuit that has already initially cost the mosquito      control program more than $40,000 in legal fees, and the case      has yet to go to court. This could lead to an injunction on      the spray program and end up costing taxpayers $100,000+      dollars, even though the case has nothing to do with      substantive water quality issues, but rather focuses on      alleged administrative paperwork violations.       Gem County Mosquito Abatement District (ID) was the subject      of one of these activist lawsuits utilizing the 3rd Party      Citizen Suit It took ten years and the grand total      of an entire year's annual operating budget ($450,000) to      resolve that litigation against that public health entity.       These ongoing compliance costs and threat of crushing      litigation directly impact mosquito control districts. The      existence of this unnecessary requirement for mosquito      control activities is directly related to our ability to      combat the vectors related to It diverts precious      resources away from finding and suppressing mosquito      populations.       The American Mosquito Control Association urges Congress to      vote ``YES'' on H.953, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act      of 2017.                                  ____                              American Farm Bureau Federation,                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2017.     Bill Shuster,     House of Representatives, Washington,     Bob Gibbs,     House of Representatives, Washington,     Michael Conaway,     House of Representatives, Washington,     Garret Graves,     House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Shuster, Gibbs, Conaway and Graves: Later this      week, the House is expected to vote on H.953, ``The      Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017.'' This legislation      has previously passed the House of Representatives with      strong bipartisan support, and the American Farm Bureau      Federation (AFBF) urges all members of Congress to vote in      favor of the bill.       H.953 is narrowly crafted to clarify that lawful use of      pesticides in or near navigable waters is not excessively      covered under two statutes, the Clean Water Act and the      Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide In doing      so, the measure simply codifies EPA's longstanding      interpretation of the law before it was thrown into confusion      by a 2009 court ruling, which imposed an additional layer of      needless red tape on pesticide applicators. H.953 corrects      the duplicative requirements associated with EPA's National      Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) pesticide      permit by specifying that NPDES permits are not needed for      the lawful application of EPA-labeled pesticides. This is an      important fix that will reduce red tape and legal liabilities      associated with the lawful use of pesticides in protecting      public health and food security.       We urge all members to vote in favor of the ``Reducing      Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017.''       Thank you very much for your support.

14922,topic-id,336,"Mr.Chair, I also include in the Record a letter from the National Association of NACo recommends that Congress address some of challenges posed by the EPA's Clean Water Act permit for pesticides to allow counties to more quickly respond to the mosquito-based public health threats. Counties have reported either significantly scaled back or discontinued mosquito abatement programs due to the additional, duplicative, and expensive paperwork and monitoring obligations required by the program.                             National Association of Counties,                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: As the U.     House of Representatives moves forward with the ``Reducing      Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017'' (H.953), we would like to      highlight the impact that U.Environmental Protection      Agency's (EPA) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination      System (NPDES) Pesticide General Permit (PGP) program has on      county governments' ability to respond promptly and      effectively to emerging public health threats.       As the summer months approach and we enter mosquito season,      counties are concerned about the health and safety impacts of      mosquito-borne illnesses such as The Zika virus is an      emerging mosquito-borne illness, primarily stemming from the      bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, and there is no vaccine.      Since mosquitos and their breeding habitats pose the largest      threat to public safety, counties can play a major role in      minimizing the potential spread of the virus and other      mosquito-borne illnesses through public education and      mosquito eradication.       However, since EPA's PGP program was instituted in 2011,      counties have reported that they have either significantly      scaled back or discontinued mosquito abatement programs due      to additional, duplicative and expensive paperwork and      monitoring obligations required under the permit.

14935,topic-id,324,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I just want to make a few remarks on what my friend, my colleague from Oregon said. I call it the rest of the story.  We talked about the fish kill in 1996 of the steelhead. I inquired of this tragic incident and came to the conclusion that NPDES permitting under the Clean Water Act would not have prevented the fish kill.  In 2003, the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs published a report which looked at this potential risk posed by the herbicide that was used in the 1996 fish kill. The report stated:       Where sufficient information has been provided, it appears      that the fish incidents are as a result of misuse. The form      of misuse is that water was released from the irrigation      canals too early. In some cases, this was because the gate      valves were not properly closed or that they leaked. In other      cases, the applicator opened them intentionally, but too      soon. In one case, boards that helped contain the irrigation      canal water may have been removed by children playing.  The EPA goes on in the report to address each of the various species of salmon and steelhead analyzed and repeatedly states:       It is very unlikely the pesticide suspected to cause the      Oregon fish kill would have affected the steelhead or salmon      if it was used in accordance with the label requirements.      Completing NPDES permit paperwork and paying a permit fee      does not prevent fish kills, nor does it improve water      quality. Pesticide applications in accordance with FIFRA      pesticide labels will avoid adverse environmental impacts,      including fish kills.  If a pesticide is improperly applied, there are enforcement mechanisms in place to address this violation. In the case of the 1996 Oregon fish kill, I understand the party was subject to more than $400,000 in fines and reimbursements for the incident.  Mr.Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Allen).  ",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgH4535.txt,2049,1415,2017.0,24.0,July
14940,topic-id,1033,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In my closing, I just want to really reemphasize the importance to pass this bill and get it signed into law because the environment is at risk, human safety is at risk, human health is at risk. We have over 100 Zika outbreaks currently in the United We have hundreds of West Nile outbreaks. And what this bill does is it puts a tool in the toolbox for our mosquito control districts, an additional tool to help eradicate or control the mosquito population to prevent and protect human health around our citizens.  There has been a lot of talk about pesticide chemicals in the water, and some of these chemicals that have been mentioned are what we call legacy chemicals that were used years ago. As a farmer, I can tell you some of the chemicals we used when I started farming in 1975 didn't break down. They weren't biodegradable.  The industry has changed a lot. We have new chemicals, better chemicals, safer chemicals. Many of them are biodegradable. So these legacy issues are not--the contaminants in a lot of the[[Page H4545]]water today isn't from chemicals being used in today's agricultural environment, but it is from past years because those chemicals last in the environment for many years.  I think it is also important that the former Secretary of Agriculture--I stated earlier--Tom Vilsack, was very concerned about this, and he sent a letter to the EPA Administrator at the time, Lisa Jackson, that this court case doesn't do anything to help protect the environment or protect water quality in the United States, and it adds additional costs and burdens to our agricultural producers in their efforts to produce the wholesome, safe, affordable food supply to feed the world.  This is commonsense legislation, and I urge people to vote for H.953. As has been said earlier, this bill has been up several other times in previous Congresses; it has had strong bipartisan support. Unfortunately, the Senate did not move on it and take action. Hopefully this time we will see that, especially with the outbreaks of Zika and West Nile and seeing the cost.  It was mentioned earlier, too, about the cost of getting the permit. Obviously, doing the permit, actually applying it probably isn't much costly, but to get all the stuff lined up, the consultants and all the paperwork they have to do to get the information there is quite costly.  We had in previous committee hearings mosquito control districts coming in and talking about the cost. The thousands of dollars they are spending has blown their budget where they could be using that to spend on mosquito eradication.  So, obviously, we have hundreds of groups around the country that support this legislation. It is needed, and I urge my colleagues to support it so we can move on and protect the environment, enhance the environment, and also human health and safety.

It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-21. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read.

USE OF AUTHORIZED       Section 3(f) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and      Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.136a(f)) is amended by adding at      the end the following:       ``(5) Use of authorized pesticides.--Except as provided in      section 402(s) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act,      the Administrator or a State may not require a permit under      such Act for a discharge from a point source into navigable      waters of a pesticide authorized for sale, distribution, or      use under this Act, or the residue of such a pesticide,      resulting from the application of such pesticide.''.     3. DISCHARGES OF       Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33      U.S.1342) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(s) Discharges of Pesticides.--       ``(1) No permit requirement.--Except as provided in      paragraph (2), a permit shall not be required by the      Administrator or a State under this Act for a discharge from      a point source into navigable waters of a pesticide      authorized for sale, distribution, or use under the Federal      Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, or the residue      of such a pesticide, resulting from the application of such      pesticide.       ``(2) Exceptions.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the      following discharges of a pesticide or pesticide residue:       ``(A) A discharge resulting from the application of a      pesticide in violation of a provision of the Federal      Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act that is relevant      to protecting water quality, if--       ``(i) the discharge would not have occurred but for the      violation; or       ``(ii) the amount of pesticide or pesticide residue in the      discharge is greater than would have occurred without the      violation.       ``(B) Stormwater discharges subject to regulation under      subsection (p).       ``(C) The following discharges subject to regulation under      this section:       ``(i) Manufacturing or industrial effluent.       ``(ii) Treatment works effluent.       ``(iii) Discharges incidental to the normal operation of a      vessel, including a discharge resulting from ballasting      operations or vessel biofouling prevention.''.

14942,topic-id,371,"Mr.Chair, a couple of points I would like to make. When my colleague from Connecticut talked about spraying chemicals, pesticides over water, the EPA has full authority, full jurisdiction to restrict those pesticides, how they are used, when they are used, and also who is using them; and they can restrict it to a manner where the applicator has to have specific training. And there is nothing to stop the EPA to say that if you are going to spray over a body of water, you have to notify the The EPA has that authority. They have the jurisdiction to do that.  I think it is also interesting to mention when talking about spraying and getting a permit after the fact, yeah, that if the local entity declares an emergency, then they can go in. But my argument is that since this additional permitting requirement, this additional red tape bureaucracy is stopping the preventive programs, so we shouldn't have to get to an emergency situation where we just spray and do the permit after the fact.  But her amendment, H.953 eliminates the duplicative, expansive, and unnecessary permit process, and helps free up resources for States, counties, and local governments to better combat the spread of diseases like Zika and West Nile virus. This amendment, in effect, undermines these efforts.  The amendment intends to make the bill's exemption from the Clean Water Act permitting ineffective by carving out from the bill those waters that may receive a discharge containing any one of several hundred listed chemical substances. The vast majority of substances referenced in this amendment are not even a pesticide and have nothing to do with the regulation of a pesticide.  Additionally, a discharge covered under this amendment does not have to be related in any way to the use or application of a pesticide. The net effect of this amendment is to undermine the bill based on circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with the use of a pesticide.  Further, the amendment would require a pesticide user to conduct extremely expensive and time-consuming monitoring. This defeats the bill's purpose of reducing the regulatory burdens. I urge Members to oppose this amendment.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgH4535.txt,2049,KATE'S LAW,2017.0,24.0,May

14949,topic-id,371,"Mr.Chair, well, that was a lot of drama. Let's not lose sight that what we are trying to do in H.953 is to free up the resources so States, counties, local governments can fight the mosquito population, fight Zika, fight the West Nile virus, and let our agricultural producers have the most efficient way to protect the environment, and also produce a safe, wholesome food supply.  This amendment undermines the base bill. The amendment intends to carve out from the bill those waters that have a discharge of any type. That means the way this amendment is written, any type of discharge--even if it is not a pesticide--any type of discharge, a nutrient discharge, anything would fall under this and undermines the bill. This amendment covers all types of discharges. I think that is important to mention.  In addition, most waterbodies in this country are fishable, and, therefore, subject to this amendment's carve-out. As a result, the types of discharges and waterbodies in question under this amendment do not need to be related at all to the actual regulation of a pesticide.  Further, the amendment would require that a pesticide user conduct extremely expensive and time-consuming monitoring. Moreover, the amendment's standard of any negative effect is vague and subjective and could include an effect that has nothing to do with a pesticide.  Registered pesticides already take into account aquatic species' and fisheries' health into consideration during the registration process. I think it is important that they go through a rigorous testing process, and more testing, and the EPA has full control. They can reject that. If they determine that a pesticide is environmentally harmful, or potentially harmful, they can pull that product off.  They can also restrict the product even more so, and restrict who the applicators are, and there is nothing to stop the EPA or the State EPAs to say: Before you apply a pesticide over a waterbody, you need to tell us first before you do it.  There is nothing to stop the EPA from doing that.  So all this amendment does, it defeats the bill's purpose, reducing the regulatory burdens, and I urge my Members to oppose this amendment.

15008,topic-id,4776,"Mr.Speaker, I want to follow up on what my friend from Florida, Congressman Ron DeSantis, was saying: Under ObamaCare--that passed without a single Republican vote--Congress was expressly put under all of the conditions of ObamaCare, and it expressly took us out from the insurance that we liked, the insurance plans we had and liked, and 180 degrees contrary to what President Obama said and so many of our friends across the aisle.  Even though we liked our insurance and we wanted to keep it, it turns out that was not true what they had been saying for so many months. We didn't get to keep our insurance. I know emails keep circulating that Members of Congress have some special ``pie in the sky'' health insurance, but, actually, it is exactly the same insurance options that every single Federal employee from--well, I started to say[[Page H6138]]from the President down, but, actually, the President does have his own special healthcare. But I guess that is why ObamaCare seemed so appealing. It wouldn't affect the President and his family, or he might have looked at it a little bit differently. But since he has his 24/7 physician, it seemed okay to him to force the rest of the country under it.  Every Federal employee before ObamaCare had the same options we did. The major change in congressional healthcare came since the provision was put in there. Although every single Federal employee had employer--which means Federal Government, which means taxpayer--assistance in paying the premiums for their health insurance, we had to pay part and the Federal Government paid part--taxpayers, in other words, paid part. That was pretty common across the country.  But in ObamaCare, for some reason, Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Harry Reid thought it was a good idea to stick it to Members of Congress that were not in leadership so that there would be no Federal supplement. No Federal employer was going to pay part of the cost of the insurance, health insurance, for Members of That is in the bill.  Originally, we thought that meant every single Member of Congress would not get the employer part paid by the Federal But it turns out the Speaker and certain of the leadership and leadership staff who must have helped draft the bill, that the way it was worded did not include the funds they were paid for them so they would continue to get the Federal portion paid by the government and taxpayers as that is.  But then Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader Reid, and President Obama got together, and they worked out a deal. Like my friend, Congressman DeSantis from Florida, pointed out, they made a deal to completely ignore what was in black and white print in ObamaCare that Members of Congress, other than the leadership, would not have the Federal Government paying any part of theirs. All the rest of the Federal employees in the country, yes, they would still have the Federal Government pay part of their insurance, only Members of Congress wouldn't.  They made a deal to specifically ignore what our Democratic friends put in the law, in black and white expressly there, and so we had gotten so many calls and so much information.  Going all over east Texas, I've heard from so many people who have lost their insurance who now could not afford their insurance and now were forced into a network that did not have the doctor who was saving their lives or the medication that was saving their lives, didn't have Mayo Clinic and didn't have the certain cancer facility that they had been using to keep their lives going.  I had heard so many of those horror stories from constituents I just could not--I mean, I went and talked to the personnel here that are supposed to help us sign up for healthcare, and I just could not bring myself to sign up for ObamaCare that was being illegally interpreted. It is not even an interpretation; it is very clear. We didn't get the Federal subsidy, yet they agreed to do it despite what they put in the law and agreed to in the law. So I went without insurance at all for a few years and then have to pay extra to have insurance through my wife's employer.  Ron DeSantis made a great point. If we went ahead and enforced ObamaCare exactly the way it is written, the Speaker and the leaders would be taken care of in the House and Senate, but the rank-and-file Members of the House and Senate, I think, would more quickly have come to the conclusion: we have got to have a change, and we have got to have it quick.  Perhaps that is what President Obama was thinking when he agreed to have the taxpayers fund the huge part of the congressional health insurance that, gee, if he did that, then they wouldn't be as quick to want to overturn it.  I think it is very important as we hear friends across the aisle talk about how devastating it will be if we repeal Yeah, what happens? Think about it. What happens if we repeal ObamaCare? We would go back to the way it was before ObamaCare passed. I didn't remember it being quite this high, but one of our friends mentioned this week, I remember the polls were saying 75 percent of Americans were satisfied with their health insurance before ObamaCare was shoved down every Americans' throat. So if we repealed ObamaCare, what would happen is we would go back to a health insurance--or a healthcare situation--where 75 percent of Americans were satisfied.  What many of us were saying, as we were in the minority on this side, we were begging our friends across the aisle, look, don't just throw out the entire healthcare system the way it is even though you have got people in the health insurance business and the big pharmaceuticals helping you write ObamaCare so they are going to make billions and billions more than they have ever made--yes, it is true, a lot of health insurers have gone out of business, but the big ones that helped write ObamaCare and sign on to it--happy to endorse it and embrace it--made record profits. So much for opposing crony capitalism. We see it at its best in  So Americans should be a bit skeptical when they see some of the people who helped write ObamaCare and made billions and billions saying: oh, no, let's not throw it out.  Well, just remember, if we did that, if we just voted to end ObamaCare and have our system exist as if ObamaCare had never passed, it would immediately put us into a situation where the vast majority of Americans were satisfied with their health insurance and with the healthcare they got.                              {time}  1300  I have noted over the years that one of the things that has helped with the acceptance by the minority that has accepted ObamaCare as being a good thing has been that politicians here in Washington have skewed the difference between health insurance and healthcare.  I know people have said: Oh, gosh, people were dying on the sidewalks.  Actually, if you are on the sidewalk and you have got a health problem, you do as people that I have seen in the emergency rooms have done: they go to the emergency room. I am standing in line behind them, waiting to get care for one of my children.  So it wasn't a matter of not getting that healthcare. Those people did not have health insurance.  What good is ObamaCare insurance when your deductible is $7,000, $8,000, and you are paying $10,000, $12,000 a year for your insurance and you don't have enough to put aside in savings to even pay $1,000 to $2,000 of your deductible?  Yes, you have health insurance, but you sure don't have healthcare because now, because of ObamaCare, you cannot afford it.  Yes, from time to time I hear people say: Yeah, but the subsidy is working out so well, I am able to have insurance.  Well, what is your deductible?  Well, it is pretty high, but I am satisfied with it.  You know what we keep finding?  They are satisfied with it because they have got cheap health insurance and it works out fine until they have something catastrophic happen and they find out they don't have the money to cover what they have got to cover.  We have got to do something. I submit it wouldn't be so bad to go back to a system that a majority of Americans said they were satisfied with and then work from there.  Don't throw out the whole system again and make the Federal Government, Big Brother, have its fingers in every aspect of your supposed care. When the Federal Government has that role, whether you want to call them death panels or not, there are bureaucrats who will make decisions to decide what they are going to allow you to have and be paid for. That should never, ever be the role of the government.  Some say to go to a single-payer system. I despise that term because it masks just how evil the system is. It is socialized medicine, which is also another way of saying you have rationed care. Everybody is not going to get what they need, and the government will decide who they think has a life valuable enough to get a new knee or to get a new hip or to have back surgery or to have lifesaving surgery. The government will decide that.[[Page H6139]]  That is the same reason I have heard from numerous seniors now. Before ObamaCare passed, they had Medicare as supplemental coverage. But even so, after ObamaCare passed, which cut $716 billion out of Medicare, they could not get timely surgeries that they needed before  If we don't repeal ObamaCare, it will continue with those wait times that many seniors are now experiencing. Whereas, it used to be: When do you want to do this? Tomorrow? Next week? When do you want to do it?  Now it is: I know you need it now, but it is going to be 2 or 3 months before we can work you in.  It is rationed care. That is what ObamaCare causes. There is going to be more and more of that unless we get ObamaCare repealed. I just don't think that is an option. A majority of Americans did not want ObamaCare, and, after it passed, still didn't want They gave us the majority in the House, now in the Senate, and now the Presidency on a promise that we would get rid of  So we start from the premise that healthcare will be better and more affordable once ObamaCare is repealed. There needs to be reforms, but you have got to start from the premise that you have to get rid of the system that is skewing and basically destroying the greatest healthcare system ever produced in the history of the world.  Medical historians, as I noted before, have indicated there was probably some point in the early 1900s--it can be debated when that point may have occurred; some say around the protocols in the early 1900s, around World War I--or whenever it was, around 100 years ago, for the first time in human history, someone who needed healthcare had a better chance of getting better if they didn't go see a doctor. That point was in the early 1900s. After that point, you started having a better chance of getting well if you went to see a doctor.  So you look at that time, whether it is 100 years, 120 years, and to think that just in the thousands of years of recorded history in our lifetimes, you have not only had a chance of getting well after seeing a doctor, but you have a great chance of being cured.  Think of all the diseases and conditions that we found cures for. We have so many yet to go. There will always be something else that needs to be researched and cured, because that is the state of this world. But we had a system here in America that produced more lifesaving medications and treatments and surgeries, more lifesaving and enhancing procedures of all kinds because, for one thing, we had competition, we had a free market system.  Our Founders so wisely put in the Constitution provisions for rewarding people, because of original thoughts or inventions, copyrights and patents. Congress has done a lot of damage to that system in recent years, but it still provides an incentive to create something that is lifesaving or life-enhancing.  We simply cannot build a healthcare system that helps people based on the foundation of More and more--until it is complete, socialized medicine will be, if we leave ObamaCare in place, there will be more and more rationed care, which means less and less care for individuals.  For 6 years, Republicans have been united in our support for fully repealing Congress has voted--at least the House has--more than 60 times to repeal So it is not the time to get timid. Now is the time to support the President's efforts to get rid of  If what we have to do is bring forth the bill that we passed in the last Congress and put it on the desk of the President to get rid of the thing that has, at least informally, President Obama's name and that he says he is proud of--people are getting hurt, people can't afford what they have got. More and more are losing insurance. We are losing more and more insurance companies.  I still continue to be quite concerned to just say there is a great panacea in buying insurance across State lines because, unless we end the exemption from the monopoly laws, the antitrust laws, then we could very easily end up with only one or two insurance companies in the whole country instead of having only one in 30 or 40  Far better it is to just end the exemption from antitrust laws, end the ability for a health insurance company to monopolize and have monopolistic tactics that keep entrepreneurs from developing new insurance companies, different ways of paying for healthcare. We have got to end that so that people that come up with new ways and better ways to provide healthcare end up doing well because of their great idea to provide more affordable healthcare.  One thing in my mind that is absolutely certain: if we can just get rid of ObamaCare, then one of the steps we have got to take is to get back to a system that we had 50 years ago or so, when I was growing up in Mount Pleasant in east Texas, and you knew what things cost.  All the different times I had to be taken in for stitches because I got involved in activity that was going to get somebody hurt--and I was often the one--all those times I went in for stitches, my parents always knew what it was going to cost when the doctor put stitches in my head or above and below my eye. All the different places I have got them, they knew.  Of course, on one occasion--he can't get in trouble now because he is gone--a dear friend of the family that was a family physician at the time let my mother, since she was such a good seamstress, put in maybe three of my five stitches. Mother said: That is just basic sewing; I can do that. He said: You sure could. I have seen you sew. That is all it is.  I don't encourage that kind of thing, but mother did a nice job, and he closed it up. She knew she was still going to pay the fee. Even though she put a couple of stitches in, she knew she was going to pay the fee. Anyway, he was shorthanded on nurses that day, and mother was the nurse because it was a weekend and he came in special.  Anyway, you don't see people anymore, like they did when I was young, who say: I am going to a different doctor because the other doctor raised his prices and that one is just as good. You don't see that.  Nobody knows actually what the doctors are getting paid. I have asked for answers from wonderful healthcare providers that are really trying to take care of people: How much is this? How much is that?  Well, Louie, I can't really tell you. It depends.  Is it Medicare, Medicaid, cash, Blue Cross, Anthem, an HMO? You have got to tell me. And what is the diagnosis?  Sometimes it is a different charge, depending on what the disease is.  Why is that?  Because the government has put different payment schemes on these things.  We have got to get rid of a system where nobody knows what anything costs. You can't have competition and spur healthcare and healthcare providers on to the very best they can possibly do to innovate new ways and better ways to treat people and to provide healthcare if we don't have actual competition and people knowing what they are paying for. That is one of the things we have got to get back to.  I know there are some physicians who have said: Well, my contract with the insurance company doesn't have that provision.  I have heard some do, but some have told me: Yes, my contract as a doctor with that insurance company said I specifically cannot let somebody who is paying cash pay as low an amount as I am taking as full payment from this insurance company.  Well, that shouldn't be the case. But as long as an insurance company can monopolize, violate antitrust laws, then they will be able to do that kind of thing to keep people from being able to pay cash as readily as they could if they were one of the major insurance companies.                              {time}  1315  We ought to get out of that.  How do you get out of that?  Well, the first thing is you never ever will as long as ObamaCare continues to be the law of the land.  So I am so proud we have a President that continues to push the idea of getting rid of ObamaCare so that we can have a better system providing healthcare. And I do use the word ``healthcare'' and not ``health insurance.''  And it bothers the heck out of me that the CBO makes this grandiose[[Page H6140]]claim of how many people will lose their insurance, because they are too ignorant, under the models they create, to distinguish the difference between somebody who chooses not to buy a policy that costs them a fortune, has a huge deductible, and is going to not help them when they need it, and someone who says: Gee, I want to keep this insurance, but I can't afford it.  The CBO has made themselves--put themselves in such a blind position, they can't tell the difference. The CBO says, ``Well, if somebody says, I am not paying for this insurance policy. The deductible is too high. The premiums are too high. I am going to put my money in a savings account, and I will have, in 3 years, $40,000 to cover healthcare problems, if I have some in the future, and that will keep growing,'' well, they will say that poor person that now has a huge growing health savings account is like a poor homeless individual, and the government yanked away their insurance.  They just chose to quit rewarding a health insurance company for not providing them insurance that they need. There is a difference between losing insurance and just refusing to buy insurance that is worthless.  I am hoping that we are moving closer to the day when we can get rid of this Democrat Congress contrived group called the Congressional Budget Office, I have been convinced for a number of years that we will never be able to get this country on sound footing with a driving economy, all boats being lifted, getting the country out of debt as long as the CBO is the official scorer for the bills in this building.  It seems clear to me. Yes, I understand. They have come to my office a couple of times. I understand. I get it. You create models, and then you feed this information in that you think is important to the models you created that hardly ever rely on actual historical performance. And then you just dutifully report what the model says the cost is and what is going to happen as a result.  Try living with history and using absolute historical evidence of what happens instead of creating some goofy model that, as best it appears now, when they--well, first, I think $1.2 trillion, they estimated And then after President Obama woodshedded Elmendorf, the director--and I know he doesn't like that term--but whatever you want to call it, he called him over to the Oval Office, met with him; Elmendorf comes out, redoes his numbers--Oh, it was under a trillion dollars. $800 billion, just like President Obama said. How about that?  And then as soon as it passes, shortly thereafter, well, you know, it is actually probably more like 1.7, 1.9. And now more modern estimates say it is not $800 billion; it is now 1.2. It is at least $2 trillion, maybe $4 trillion, maybe $4\1/2\ trillion. It is just through the roof.  So I don't think it is unrealistic to say that the CBO's margin of error on ObamaCare wasn't plus or minus 2 or 3 percent. It was plus or minus 200 to 400 or so percent. No entity that cannot have a better margin of error than 200 percent has any business scoring anything considered official in this building.  And I know Arthur Laffer got a private grant to figure out a way to have competitive scoring of bills in the House and Senate so that these scorers could have a score on their accuracy, their success rate for accurate scoring of bills.  So as you go along, this Republican idea of competition being a good thing--you have competitive scoring instead of one official group that will never allow this country to get on a proper footing because it was set up in 1974 as Nixon was going out. And the Democrats were having a heyday, and they got a little giddy and left 2 million people in southeast Asia to die instead of having an orderly transition, and, at home, were wreaking havoc with the way we pass laws in this building.  I will continue to urge the President of the United States, as we take up a tax reform bill, not to give in to the pressure from people in Congress toward the top to go more to a 20 or 21 percent corporate tax because the corporate tax really is about the most insidious--one of the most insidious taxes because it is based on a lie.  We tell the American people, ``Oh, you don't have to worry. We are going to sock it to these evil corporations and make them pay all this big tax,'' when the fact is that corporations don't exist, don't continue to exist if they don't have the customers pay that corporate tax. That charge is ultimately paid by Americans across the country. It is another way of sticking it to the little guy when you have a high corporate tax.  And I am fully aware there are people in this country that think it is a great thing that they think we are evolving from a manufacturing country to more of a service economy where we just provide services and don't get engaged in this lowlife manufacturing.  Well, guess what, that lowlife manufacturing is how a country survives for centuries. Any nation that is considered to have power in the world loses that power after the next war if they cannot produce the things that they need to defend themselves from hateful, evil leaders in the world.  Some people didn't seem to mind when we were losing the tire manufacturing, steel manufacturing, steel product manufacturing, losing all that to They didn't seem to care. Oh, Louie, don't worry about it. We are a service economy.  Well, as a historian, I am telling you, if we don't get back to manufacturing the things that we have to have to defend ourselves successfully against evil tyrants--whether in Iran, North Korea, totalitarian in Russia, wherever, if we don't manufacture what we need to defend ourselves and our freedoms, we won't have them past the next war. And be sure of this. Don't believe me. You know, Jesus said there will always be wars and rumors of wars. They are going to exist.  But Reagan was right. You know, the best way to avoid a war is to have so much strength that people will not attack you. They don't want to challenge you because they know you can take them out.  Unfortunately, we have had the ability to take out evil empires and evil tyrant leaders for a long time. But just as occurred when I was in the United States Army, Active Duty for 4 years, was at Fort Benning, and our embassy was attacked in Tehran, hostages were taken. We had a President--well, he had hailed the Ayatollah Khomeini as a man of peace when he took power, so it was kind of tough on him to turn around and attack him.  But the Iranians said the students did it. But it became very clear very soon, they stopped saying the students had the hostages, and started saying, ``We have the hostages.'' It was a government-orchestrated attack. They could have and should have protected our embassy, and Carter should have made it clear: You either get our people out unharmed or we are bringing the full power of the United States military to And it wouldn't be a bluff. I think they would have let them go.  That is why they spent at least 3 days talking about the students having them. That was a way out. If Carter had said, ``We are coming if you don't get those folks out,'' I think that they would have let them go. But you can't bluff in a situation like that. But we should have made it clear that we are not tolerating attacks on United States land--and that is what an embassy is.  And because we didn't defend ourselves there, the stories started: Well, they ran from You know, didn't do anything, the paper tiger.  One after another we got hit and didn't properly respond. And I understand President Reagan acknowledged that he let the Congress intimidate him into pulling our forces out of Beirut after 300 marines or so precious lives were lost to a terrorist attack.  So the story built and continued: The United States is a paper tiger. They won't defend themselves.  And it became attractive to be attacked.  So we need a 15 percent corporate tax. Meeting with different CEOs in years past over in China: Why did you leave America?  I thought they would say: Because of all the regulations. Yeah, those were problems. And sometimes unions are too--demand too much, and we can't stay in business, so we move.  But no. The number one answer over and over is: You know, we got a deal cut, and now we are at an effective rate between 15, 20 percent corporate tax.[[Page H6141]]And in America, you know, they say, cumulatively, corporations are probably paying around 40 percent for corporate tax.  It is time to undercut the tax that China pays. Bring back our steel industry. Let's get back to having Detroit--after so many of the great Midwestern States had cities that were model cities, and people were working, and there weren't the big slums because things were going great, that day can come back. But it will not come back to the extent it could with a 20 or 21 percent corporate tax.  But, oh, my goodness, if we cut our corporate tax to 15 percent, this United States economy will explode. This less than 2 percent that we had growth under President Obama, lowest for any 8 years in our history, that would end overnight.  Mr.Speaker, if I might ask how much time I have left?  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 23 minutes.  ",CREC-2017-07-20-pt1-PgH6137-5.txt,1801,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1973, PROTECTING YOUNG VICTIMS FROM",2017.0,20.0,July
15009,topic-id,2272,"Mr.Speaker, I want to direct attention to this ongoing narrative about collusion with We still desperately need an independent counsel to investigate the Mueller-Comey-Lynch-Clinton relationships.  It appears Mueller is on a tear and he is going to do everything he can to divert attention from his collusion with James They were buddies. They colluded about so much.  Comey is trying to get an independent counsel appointed. He was able--by leaking illegally, pulling these shenanigans, he consulted with Mueller even on his testimony. And Mueller is the guy who is supposed to judge the testimony. And under current Federal regulations, Mueller should have recused himself.  We got to have somebody investigate It is getting out of hand.                              {time}  1330  In the meantime, the new developments seem to make clear to some of us that Donald Trump, Jr., seems like a nice guy, but he appears to have been the target of a Democratic action to try to take down the Trump campaign.  They point to this meeting between Donald Trump and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Moscow attorney. Some of this is in an article written by Scott McKay, July 14, The American She was trying to meet with Donald Trump, Jr., and when they actually had the meeting, she didn't have anything to give him. She brought up about the bill that was passed that helped some extremely wealthy Russians who were buddies with Putin, but, as this article points out, the evidence of collusion between Trump, Jr., and the Russians seems to be based on a timeline which included the WikiLeaks disclosures of hacked Democratic National Committee emails and Trump's request that the Russians make public the 30,000 emails of Clinton supposedly that she deleted from her illegal private server. But it is a smoking gun that Trump was the beneficiary of this Putin regime intelligence arm hacking the 2016 elections, so our friends across the aisle seem to say, but that doesn't make sense. He got nothing out of the meeting.  At some point, everybody in this room had to run for election, and if they had an opponent, if somebody said, ``Hey, you need to know this about your opponent,'' you know, at some time or another, everybody in this room has listened to something, and many times it is just garbage, and you say, ``I don't want anything to do with that.''  And essentially that is what Donald Trump, Jr., did after he got lured into a meeting.  But when you think, wait a minute, what was this Moscow attorney even doing in this country? This article points out that her presence in the United States alone ought to be the source of suspicion, that not only is the Trump-Russian collusion narrative suspect, but the real inquiry ought to be whether the encounter was a small part of a larger attempt to trap the Trump campaign.  The Russian lawyer wasn't even supposed to be in the United She had been denied a visa for entry into the United States in late 2015, but given a rather extraordinary parole by the Obama administration to assist preparation for a client subject to an asset forfeiture by the Justice  She could not be in the United States unless someone who answered directly to the President of the United States said: We are going to let her in. She is working on something special, so we are going to let her in. Even though we knew previously she is not somebody we should let in, she is doing something special right now. We want her in.  And the story is that Loretta Lynch had to approve her coming in.  So the client, Prevezon Holdings, that this Russian attorney was allowed to come in to help, was suspected of having paid some portion of $230 million stolen by Russian mobsters. When Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer representing a company that had been the victim of the theft, reported it to authorities in Moscow, he was promptly jailed and beaten to death by the  The American response to this atrocity was the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which sanctioned several individuals connected to human rights abuses. The Russian Government retaliated by preventing American adoptions of Russian children. Who did that hurt? The Russian children, but Putin didn't care. Why would he care? He is making billions, he has got people like this Russian lawyer who Loretta Lynch let in.  So then we find out in June the Russian lawyer was permitted to fly back to the U.to have the meeting with Trump, Jr., at Trump Tower, no less, and then ends up in the front row for a congressional hearing. She was sitting right there behind the Obama  In my experience, all the hearings I have seen, when you have somebody from the administration of the caliber of an ambassador, they are very careful to make sure people behind him are those who can hand a note to help him answer a question. That is what is normal. Yet there she is, right behind Obama's Ambassador to  Then she turns up at a D.showing of a documentary film on the negative effects of the Magnitsky Act and later appeared at a dinner involving another couple of representatives, and she is now a lobbyist for the Russians overtly. Maybe she was then. The repeal of that legislation is a priority item for the Russians and a personal objective for Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney.  So rather than any Clinton dirt, as was reportedly the primary subject brought forth at the meeting with Donald Trump, it appears she was here with the approval of Loretta Lynch, with the approval of the Obama Department of Homeland  They knew what she was about, just like they knew what the member of a terrorist organization was about when they approved him coming to the White House and Janet Napolitano lied at our hearing, said that that wasn't happening.  So she did all of this without a visa. She did not file a Foreign Agents Registration document, which is required, and the Obama administration gave her a pass on those things: Sure, let her in. She is doing important work. We are not giving her a visa; we are just letting her in. We are not going to pick her up, because she is doing important work.  Really? She is setting Donald Trump, Jr., up, and the Obama administration considered that important enough to let this person who they previously realized should not be allowed in the country to come in to do that kind of important work, set up Donald Trump?  Well, anyway, turns out Veselnitskaya was connected to Fusion That is the Democrat opposition research firm, which employed a former British spy who used Russian contacts to produce the infamous and now debunked ``urinary dossier'' smearing Veselnitskaya hired Fusion GPS head, Glenn Simpson, to work on behalf of Prevezon, the company she was allowed into the country to represent. Fusion then hired Christopher Steele, the British spy who drew on Russian sources to produce his dossier, and then they made him available for private briefings on the dossier with left-leaning media sources such as Mother Jones, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Yahoo, The New Yorker,  And, by the way, there is Veselnitskaya's social media account, which is decidedly more aligned with the Fusion GPS side of the equation[[Page H6142]]than with She was no friend of the Every indication was she wanted the Trumps taken down.  Trump, Jr., met with her. It appears to be a setup.  I was guest hosting Patriot Tonight the other night. Some people say: Why do you do this media?  One of my jobs is to not only be aware of what is going on here, try to vote properly, argue the right way on different bills, but it is also to make sure that people in America know what is going on. And a guy called in, very interesting, but he seemed to have a pretty good grip on all of this. It is just amazing how many American citizens across the country--they are not confused by the smokescreen that we get from the mainstream media.  So if timelines are interesting to you, there is this: reportedly the Obama administration sought permission to electronically monitor Trump Tower in early June, and the FISA court refused to grant it, but in October, they allowed it. Isn't that something?  Once they set up Donald Trump, Jr., with this friend of the Obama administration, this Russian attorney who was using the Democrats' own opposition research firm, she was helping them, they then convinced a judge: Go ahead and let us monitor everything going on in Trump When the judge initially refused to do that.  The article said: ``So if you'd like to don your tinfoil hat and play the collusion game, try this on for size--when the Obama administration couldn't get permission from the FISA court to surveil Trump, they allowed Veselnitskaya back in the country to take part in those Washington activities''--meeting up with Donald  `` . . . and in the meantime''--she used--``the administration's pals at Fusion''--GPS--``with attempting to hook Trump, Jr.''--into a basis for them getting a warrant.  There was nothing to that meeting, yet they used it, got a warrant to further monitor everything going on in the Trump Tower in  It just keeps pointing back to the fact we have got to get an independent counsel to investigate Mueller and his ties to Comey and Lynch and the Clintons, and get to the bottom of this mess. Yes, I want an investigation, because this is looking pretty lurid right now.  Just in the time left, I do need to mention, this continuing push by friends across the aisle and the Obama holdovers in our executive branch, they think net neutrality is something we have got to have. Maureen Collins in The Federalist has a great article on July 19, and she points out regarding net neutrality:  ``The debate over net neutrality can easily turn into techie-jargon that no one understands. Here is the basic gist: the internet is made up of bits. Proponents of net neutrality want to make sure these bits are all treated equally, meaning all web content appears on your computer at the same speed and with the same quality.  ``That sounds like a good thing, right? Supporters say that net neutrality would make all content equal by ensuring that internet providers cannot buy faster or higher quality content. The free market, they say, is inherently unfair and only a third party--the government--can determine how content should be treated. But that sounds exactly like textbook New-Deal progressivism.  ``You see, this is not a question of whether or not internet content should be equally available. Rather, it is the much older question of who should determine that content is equally available: consumers, or the government?''  ``Even the background of net neutrality is straight out of the New Deal playbook. Like many administrative programs, the fight for net neutrality began when similar provisions failed in After legislative failures, what is a good progressive to do?''  ``Progressive,'' that term bothers me, kind of like ``single payer.'' Single payer means socialized medicine, government-run and rationed healthcare. What does progressive mean? Well, it actually is a throwback. It is socialism. Some socialists are even hardcore communists, not all are, but they want an Orwellian government where they watch and know everything going on, and they know better than Americans do. Let the government decide your future.                              {time}  1345  ``The Bush FCC adopted principles for `preserving internet freedom' in 2005, but did not go through a formal rulemaking process. In 2008, the FCC went after Comcast for going against these principles, only to get struck down by the D.Circuit, where bad administrative law goes to die.  ``The entire process repeated itself under the Obama administration. In 2010, the FCC adopted an `Open Internet Order.' Verizon Wireless sued the commission and, again, the commission lost at the D. ``By now, it may seem that there must be something legally wrong with the FCC's net neutrality regulations.''  And that is exactly right.  ``Under the U.Constitution, only Congress can give a specific power to an executive agency, like the FCC--usually through statute. Here's the kicker: the FCC claimed Congress gave them the power to regulate the internet through the Communications Act of 1934. The observant reader will notice this law was passed a long time before the internet even existed, though the act did give the FCC power to regulate `common carriers' like radio, wire communication, and telephone companies.''  But not the internet.  ``Not only does net neutrality follow the New Deal's progressive formula, it literally derives its power from a New Deal-era law. Right before the 2016 Presidential election, the Obama FCC created a third set of net neutrality rules.''  The bottom line is, if there is net neutrality, the government will decide what you get to see and hear on your internet. When I had family living in China, I knew what it was to be censured and have the government deciding. You can't learn anything negative about the government.  We cannot allow this pleasant sounding net neutrality to become a reality because, though it goes along perfectly with ObamaCare, with the government controlling our healthcare, why shouldn't they control what we get to see and hear on the internet?  And the bottom line is, this is the United States of America and it was created to control government, not to let the government control our free choices.

14866,topic-id,853,"Mr.President, I rise to speak on an issue that is vitally important to the well-being, safety, and security of Nevadans; namely, Yucca I have said it before--and I will say it again--that Yucca Mountain is dead. Let me repeat myself. Yucca Mountain is dead, and I will continue to come to the floor until we, as a country, move past this ill-conceived project.  Last week, I had the opportunity to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Environment Subcommittee regarding draft legislation to effectively restart the licensing process for Yucca While I appreciate having had the opportunity to testify in order to ensure that Nevadans' voices on this issue are heard, I am concerned that we are using valuable time and taxpayer resources to hold a hearing on a closed issue.  Let me say this one more time. Yucca Mountain is dead.  Instead of focusing our efforts on reviving failed proposals of the past, I will continue to encourage my colleagues and the administration to focus on policies of the future. The failure to do so will have real economic, environmental, and national security implications for all This afternoon, I will focus on the economic impact that resuming licensing activities, with regard to Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste repository, will have on my home  As many of you know, Yucca Mountain is located just 90 miles from the world's premier tourist, convention, and entertainment destination--Las Vegas, Last year, Las Vegas welcomed nearly 43 million visitors. Over the past decade, the Greater Las Vegas area has been one of the fastest growing in the United States, with a population that now exceeds 2.1 million people, according to an estimate from the U.Census Any issues with the transportation of nuclear waste to the site or issues with storage there would bring devastating consequences to the local, State, and national economies.  It begs the question, Would you want to go to Las Vegas knowing that high-level nuclear waste was being transported, very likely, through the heart of the strip?  Let me outline the vitally important role tourism plays in the Greater Las Vegas area.  This industry accounts for close to 44 percent of the local workforce and provides close to $17 billion in local wages. Moreover, tourism has an estimated $60 billion in local impact. Without tourism, every household in Southern Nevada would pay close to $3,000 more in taxes. That is a significant amount of money to individuals and families who are working to make ends meet. People visit not only as tourists but as business professionals who attend conferences, meetings, and trade shows, which generate another $12 billion in local economic impact. Las Vegas has 3 of the 10 largest convention centers in North America, and it has been the 1 trade show destination for 23 consecutive years.  This economic driver within the State is a critical component of another related industry that is vitally important to the State of Nevada; namely, the gaming industry. In Nevada, this industry alone supports more than 430,000 jobs, pays more than $18 billion in wages, and generates close to $8 billion in Federal, State, and local tax revenues. The reason I draw the Presiding Officer's attention and our colleagues' attention to these numbers is due to the fact that Yucca Mountain will have very real negative economic consequences for  I am proud to come to the floor to stand with the many concerned citizens, many small business operators, and casino operators in opposition to any attempt to restart the repository licensing process. I will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that radioactive waste is never stored anywhere near the world's entertainment capital, also known as Las Rather, I encourage my colleagues to partner with me on identifying viable alternatives for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in areas that are willing to house it.  I come to the table with a solution to our Nation's nuclear waste program and am proud to have introduced bipartisan legislation on this issue. My legislation would allow for the construction of a nuclear waste repository only if the Secretary of Energy has secured written consent from the Governor of the host State, affected units of the local government, and affected Indian  This is consistent with the consent-based siting initiative to site waste storage and disposal facilities that was initiated by the Department of Energy in late 2015. This open process ensures that a State has a meaningful voice in the process and that no State will be forced to accept nuclear waste against its own will.  Identifying communities that will be willing hosts for long-term repositories rather than forcing it upon the States that have outright opposed such a site for decades is the only viable solution to our Nation's nuclear waste problem. The failure to do so will just result in decades of more litigation and in the wasting of more taxpayer dollars without solving the problem at hand.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

14881,topic-id,1135,"Mr.President, now is the time to get back to basics. The Federal Government doesn't exist for its own sake, it exists for the people, and if Federal regulation serves no useful function for the people, then it only serves to hold back our Nation's prosperity and growth.  With so many Americans hungry for good-paying jobs, now is the time to unleash our Nation's economic potential by getting government out of the way. It is just plain common sense to eliminate regulations that are duplicative, costly, and unworkable. We need to get back to the basics by getting rid of those kinds of regulations, and one of those regulations is the BLM methane rule.  Now, the BLM methane rule is one of those midnight regulations that the Obama administration put out as they were walking out the door. This new regulation from the Bureau of Land Management--or BLM--imposes new rules and royalty rates on methane emissions from oil and gas production on Federal and Indian lands.  For those wondering why methane emissions aren't already regulated, there is a simple explanation: They are. Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency, in partnership with individual States, is tasked with regulating air quality, which includes methane emissions. In fact, States like my State of North Dakota and the State of Texas, where the Presiding Officer resides, currently have regulatory systems in place to govern oil and gas emissions. Critically, the North Dakota Industrial Commission has put in place flaring requirements that have successfully reduced the flaring in our State from 35 percent down to 10 percent as a result of their work, and they have a goal to take it even further. This flaring reduction is a big deal because to reduce methane emissions you need to reduce flaring.  Flaring sounds complicated, but it is very simple. When excess gas is produced along with oil and it can't be captured, then it gets burned off, or flared. Neither industry nor State officials like flaring because it wastes natural gas--it wastes a natural resource--of which methane obviously is the main component. As most Americans know, obviously, natural gas is a valuable commodity that is used to heat our homes and power our factories. That is why both industry and the States have worked hard to make big improvements. They want to capture that natural gas and that methane. That is not just in North That is in other energy-producing States across the country.  Nationally, methane emissions from the oil and gas industry have been on the decline for a number of years. So we are already actively working at the State level under a regulatory regime where States have primacy to spend, authorized by EPA, to reduce natural gas flaring.  With methane emissions already being regulated and reduced by the States and industry, it is tough to figure out why this new BLM regulation has been passed and what it is accomplishing. This rule has been calculated to cost up to $279 million each year. So the cost of this rule is $279 million a year--a duplicative rule. That is in addition to the redtape. BLM estimates that the rule will impose an additional 82,000 hours of paperwork.  These numbers just might sound like the cost of doing business, if you will, but America's job creators know it is really costing us business, it is costing us economic growth, and it is costing us jobs. These aren't really numbers. There are livelihoods at stake.  What makes the BLM methane rule particularly burdensome is the fact that it is simply unworkable. The rule sets a maximum volume that each well can flare, which will lead to curtailment and shut-in wells, meaning actually having to shut down the wells. Of course, that decreases oil production and reduces royalty payments. So that means less energy, the owners get less revenue, and we have less jobs. Meanwhile, this rule treats all drilling spacing units the same, regardless of whether they have minimal Federal ownership. Remember, a lot of these wells they are trying to regulate are on minerals owned by the Federal Government, but they may also be on minerals owned by private individuals. So, once again, we have one of these Federal one-size-fits-all regulations that just does not work in practice.[[Page S2842]]  That is why regulating the natural gas and methane emissions has been delegated to the States by EPA and why it should be up to the  So the States are fighting back. Wyoming, Montana, and North Dakota filed a legal challenge to the rule in the U.district court in  The good news is that the States and our economy will not have to wait until this lawsuit makes its way through the court system. We can provide regulatory relief right now, and we should do so through the Congressional Review Act--the CRA--which provides Congress with a tool to rid the Nation of burdensome, duplicative regulations like this one, and that is what our schedule is for tomorrow--to take up this  I am a cosponsor of this CRA, and we need to pass it. I wish to thank the chairman of the EPW Committee, Senator Barrasso, for his work on this issue, and others. The House has already passed this This has already been passed by the The President has expressed his support for it. We need to pass it tomorrow. We need to get this done.  Every week I meet with North Dakotans and others who are working so hard to produce energy for this country, to create jobs and a better future for their families. They need and deserve a Federal Government that will not stand in their way. This is a basic but fundamental objective and a good place to reduce that regulatory burden to get our economy going. The way to create more economic growth, more jobs, and higher income levels is by reducing the regulatory burden, and this is a great example.  Again, it is just about common sense. It is about empowering the States to take a States-first approach, a State's primacy approach in terms of this kind of regulation. How we produce energy in Texas or North Dakota or Ohio or Pennsylvania or Washington State--it is different across the country. We can't have a Federal one-size-fits-all rule. That is why it needs to be left up to the  We have a chance tomorrow to pass this measure, and it is exactly the kind of measure that will help reduce that regulatory burden, help us grow our economy, and help us create good jobs.

14946,topic-id,1926,"Mr.Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to offer this amendment and to speak against the underlying bill.  Unfortunately, I wasn't serving the House in 2011 when this bill was first brought to the floor. I was here in 2014, when the bill was brought up again, twice. I was here, also, in 2016, when it was brought up twice.  This bill has gone through a number of name changes, but its intent remains the same, and that is, to allow the irresponsible application of pesticides into our Nation's waterways. Undermining the Clean Water Act, as this bill does, means taking the EPA out of the picture, blocking them from weighing in on pesticides that are[[Page H4547]]dumped into rivers, lakes, and streams, without regard to the impacts of human health, or to those who rely on recreational, commercial, and Tribal fisheries.  We know, unfortunately, that despite efforts to regulate pesticides for public health and safety, these dangerous chemicals continue to be detected in surface and groundwater bodies at dangerous levels. Impacts to fish and wildlife have been significant, and have already been devastating in some instances. Oysters, shrimp, sea trout, and redfish--four of the most important species to food webs, fishermen, and the economy along the Southeast and Gulf Coasts--have shown effects ranging from impaired survival skills, to damaged DNA, to death as a result of exposure to pesticides that have been approved for agricultural use.  In 2006, USGS released its review on pesticide occurrence and concentrations in streams and groundwater. According to this report, at least one pesticide was detected in water from all streams tested throughout the In addition, chemicals such as DDT, which has been banned in the U.for decades, were still showing up, found in fish tissues sampled across watersheds nationwide.  We see a similar situation at the State level. In my State of California, pesticides are among the top sources of water quality impairments in the 437 waterbodies are impaired by 40 different categories of pesticides. That is why commercial fishing groups oppose the underlying bill.  My amendment will ensure that we don't deny either the EPA or a State their ability to require permits for pesticide use that could have negative effects on fisheries. Let's make sure that streams and rivers that support fish are clean. Let's make sure that the fish we catch, eat, and sell are free from toxic chemicals. America's fisheries are a backbone of both sport fishing and commercial fishing industries.  The recreational sector alone accounts for more than $115 billion of our country's economy, and it employs more than 828,000 people. My amendment would protect these recreational activities, not only for current generations but for future generations of anglers to come.  By accidentally contaminating our waterways, pesticides also exacerbate the precarious status of endangered and threatened species. In 1996, the death of over 90,000 steelhead fish, 100 coho salmon, and thousands of nongame fish resulted from an herbicide called acrolein that entered the waterways in Bear Creek, Many wild salmon stocks are now on the brink of extinction on the West Coast, and losses in such sensitive populations make recovery efforts increasingly difficult.  Pesticides can pose a dangerous threat to commercial fisheries. In 1999, a massive lobster die-off devastated the lives and livelihoods of Connecticut and New York lobstermen along the Long Island Sound, producing a multimillion-dollar settlement with pesticide manufacturers mishandling the chemical malathion.  Similar concern has brought forth proposals to regulate methoprene and resmethrin in Maine in order to protect their commercial fishery, which is worth over $700 million.  Mr.Chair, I have letters of support here for my amendment from the American Sportfishing Association, Trout Unlimited, the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Karuk Tribe, the Winnemem Wintu Tribe, the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, Seafood Harvesters of America, and other organizations who are very interested in this amendment, and support it.                                                     May 24, 2017.       Dear Representative: As the House considers H.953, the      Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017, we the undersigned      groups representing millions of hunters and anglers across      the nation, urge you to ensure that H.953 does not      negatively impact water quality, fish health and the      recreational fishing industry by supporting Amendment #3,      sponsored by Representative Jared       The Huffman Amendment protects fisheries and water quality      by ensuring any pesticide spraying into or over waterways      that would negatively impact our nation's fisheries is      properly monitored and permitted. The 47 million sportsmen      and women that hunt and fish each year depend on strong Clean      Water Act protections to ensure thriving fish populations      that are safe to eat and the Huffman amendment would ensure      it continues to do so.       America's hunters and anglers contribute more than $200      billion to America's economy each year and this robust      outdoor economy depends on healthy rivers, lakes, and      streams. Nearly 2,000 waterways in the United States are      known to be impaired because of pesticides, and, even at low      levels, pesticides pose a particularly concerning threat to      fish and wildlife populations. Without protective federal      safeguards in place to regulate pesticides applied to our      waterways, sportsmen and women will have access to fewer      quality hunting and fishing opportunities.       On behalf of our millions of members and conservation-     minded hunters, anglers, and wildlife enthusiasts, we urge      you to support this common-sense measure to safeguard our      water resources and outdoor heritage and support the Huffman      amendment.

Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of thousands of tribal,      commercial, and recreational fishermen who depend on healthy      fisheries for their subsistence, traditional cultural      practices, businesses, and recreational enjoyment, we write      to urge you to vote YES on the Huffman amendment to H.953.      The amendment would ensure that existing Federal Water      Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) permitting requirements for      point source polluters remain in place when science clearly      indicates they are needed to protect fisheries.       Under 402 of the FWPCA, the Administrator of the EPA      may issue permits for point source discharges of approved      pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides into navigable waters,      which are also inhabited by many important and valuable fish      species that are worth billions of dollars to fishermen and      anglers each year. H.953 would eliminate the EPA's      permitting authority for approved pesticides, herbicides, and      fungicides discharged into navigable waters. Many of these      chemicals, despite their approval for agricultural use, are      known to be seriously harmful to iconic fish species      including salmon and trout, jeopardizing their survival and      posing a risk to the food supply.       Congressman Huffman's amendment to H.953 would simply      leave EPA permitting requirements in place for the dumping of      pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides into our streams and      rivers when they are known to pose a significant risk to      fisheries.

The amendment specifically preserves the ability of the      EPA Administrator or a State to require permits necessary to      protect fisheries including Tribal treaty fisheries from      harmful discharges of FIFRA approved pesticides.       Tribal members are justifiably concerned about the impact      of water quality on the natural resources of the Columbia      River system. Our member tribes' right to abundant, healthful      fish is guaranteed by the 1855 treaties with the United      A century's worth of federal court decisions has      established beyond dispute that these treaty fishing rights      are permanent in nature, and that they secure for the tribes      the right to take all species of fish found throughout their      reserved fishing areas for subsistence, ceremonial and      commercial purposes. Tribal treaties are the supreme law of      the land, and federal agencies and States must interpret      designated uses to include subsistence fishing and must      protect fishable waters. Pesticides can wreak havoc on the      health of the habitat and associated food webs that support      our fisheries. They can disrupt water quality conditions and      the availability of natural riparian and aquatic vegetation      cover as well as the abundance of aquatic invertebrates and      fishes that support the growth and maturation of salmonid      species. Our tribes recognize that the health and future of      our tribal fisheries require clean, cold water that is free      of contaminants.       Regulations should be efficient, just, and effective, and      necessarily must provide the EPA and States with the      authority to protect the unique habitat and food web system      that is essential to the health of our tribal fisheries.      Thank you for your consideration of these comments.

Jared Huffman,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Huffman: On behalf of the nation's      recreational fishing industry, the American Sportfishing      Association (ASA) would like to be on record as supporting      your amendment to H.953. This amendment leaves EPA      permitting requirements in place for the dumping of      pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides into our streams and      rivers when they are known to pose a significant risk to      fisheries.       America's fisheries are an economic powerhouse and the      backbone of the sportfishing and commercial fishing      industries. America's recreational anglers generate more than      $48 billion in retail sales with a $115 billion impact on the      nation's economy; creating employment for more than 828,000      people.       Our industry depends on clean water for continued healthy      and abundant fisheries. There are certain chemicals used for      various on-land industry operations that are known to be      incredibly harmful to fish development and survival when      released into waterways. The Administrator of the EPA      currently enforces permitting requirements for the disposal      of these chemicals into our streams and rivers. Your      amendment would ensure that existing Federal Water Pollution      Control Act permitting requirements for point-source      polluters (402) remain in place when science indicates      they are needed to conserve fisheries.       ``The Huffman amendment'' is needed because the original      legislation, H.953, would eliminate this permitting      authority for all approved pesticides, herbicides, and      fungicides discharged into streams and rivers; even when they      are known to pose a significant risk to fisheries.       We appreciate your leadership and understanding of the      importance of clean water to fishing and the outdoor      recreational economy.

Additionally, at the end of 2016, 17.2 million habitable homes sat vacant in our country.  These two trends are intertwined. Student debt is prohibiting millions and millions from buying their first home. We must find a solution, or thousands more will be saddled with sunk debt depriving them of building wealth through building home equity.  The Transform Student Debt to Home Equity Act offers us a road forward. This bill allows the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Housing Finance Agency to start a pilot program that connects creditworthy Federal student debt holders with habitable homes for sale from the Federal ledger.  By recalculating financing terms and interest rates, some student debtors can transition their debt into homeownership. Eventually creditworthy participants would pay off debt and help strengthen neighborhoods simply by maintaining their home mortgage.  We must use our power and resources to transform debt to equity. Transforming a student debt to home ownership is a pathway forward for the aspiring generation.

14878,topic-id,680,"Mr.President, as the Senate continues to consider nominees to lead our Nation's top agencies, we are once again faced with the difficult decision to confirm an individual whose interests run counter to the mission of the agency he or she will be tasked to lead. Scott Gottlieb, the nominee for Commissioner of the U.Food and Drug Administration, FDA, is another such nominee.  Scott Gottlieb is a physician and current medical consultant for pharmaceutical, medical device, and other healthcare companies. From 2003 to 2007, Gottlieb was a senior adviser to the FDA Commissioner for Medical He was also the Deputy Commissioner for Medical and Scientific Affairs under two different FDA In 2013, Gottlieb served on the Federal Health IT Policy Committee for the Department of Health and Human He also[[Page S2841]]worked as an adviser to Mitt Romney during his 2012 Presidential campaign.  While I appreciate that Gottlieb has qualifying experience, I remain concerned about his policies and conflicts of interest. For instance, while serving as the FDA's Deputy Commissioner, Gottlieb defended the Bush administration's position to deny the availability of certain contraceptive care drugs over-the-counter, despite the science that pointed to lifesaving benefits from such drugs. Additionally, while serving with Kure, a company that operates vaping and ecigarette products, Gottlieb was noncommittal in supporting regulations over commerce in such products, which directly targets young kids through marketing, when there is a lack of appropriate medical science to suggest vaping and ecigarettes are less harmful than tobacco products. He has also historically sought ways to ensure that the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 can better support the industry instead of better protecting patients and their families. This is especially problematic, given that the law provided the FDA with the authority to regulate tobacco in order to further curb smoking.  I am also concerned with Gottlieb's public disagreement with proposals that would allow patients to access affordable medications through drug importation. I have always supported policies that would allow patients to access safe and affordable medications from Canada because this is a cost-effective method to provide patients with the resources they need to manage their health needs. Of course, Gottlieb has long been an outspoken critic of the Affordable Care Act, ACA, making troubling assertions along the way. He has been quoted as opposing the ACA's medical loss ratio, which ensures that the dollars consumers pay on their healthcare go to just that and not to CEO salaries and overhead costs. He has also publically opposed the individual mandate and has supported converting the ACA's premium tax credits from an income-based to an age-based rating system, which would significantly bar patient access to quality, affordable care.  Most concerning are Gottlieb's undeniable ties to some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the marketplace. As an adviser for New Enterprises Associates, Gottlieb currently manages more than 40 drugs now in development that could come before the FDA for approval. He has also received compensation from many of these companies, earning more than $400,000 from multiple pharmaceutical and medical device companies from 2013 to 2015 alone. Gottlieb also served on six pharmaceutical company boards, two insurance company boards, one medical laboratory company board, and several other similar boards, all of which have hundreds of drugs currently awaiting FDA approval. Without proper recusal, which Gottlieb has not committed himself to in full, these conflicts are in direct contradiction to the ethics and objective work required of the Commissioner of the  The leader of the FDA has a firm responsibility in promoting policies and overseeing drug development with the purpose of enhancing the health and well-being of the American people. We should put ourselves in the shoes of the American people, our constituents, in evaluating nominees to head agencies that bear directly on the public's healthcare needs. Given Gottlieb's significant conflicts of interest, combined with his ideological approaches to public health policy, which suggest that he would rather deny patients access to lifesaving resources than support ways to improve healthcare and promote prevention efforts for all, I cannot in good conscience support his nomination.

14755,topic-id,741,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to mourn the passing of the Chinese human rights advocate and Nobel Prize Laureate, Liu Xiaobo, who died last Thursday in China, under guard.  The world has lost an incomparably courageous advocate who was dedicated to advancing human rights and the rule of law, and paid for them with his own freedom and life.  Liu's passing last week in Chinese custody marked a tragic end to over a decade of persecution by the Chinese authorities who relentlessly mistreated him as he gradually became a symbol of the pro-democracy movement around the globe.  In 2010, the Nobel Peace Committee awarded him the Peace Prize for his thoughtful advocacy for reform and for his courageous support of the pro-democracy document Charter 08.  A year prior to the Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to Liu, in 2009, Chinese authorities tried him for subversion of state power, for which he received an 11-year sentence. Given his rising stature in the international community, they imprisoned him in secret locations away from family, supporters, or international media. They kept him from receiving the Peace Prize and put pressure on the committee to rescind the award, in addition to doing everything they could to prevent Liu's supporters from attending the ceremony in  They routinely censored and continue to censor the internet for references to Liu and other pro-democracy advocates and ideas.  China was so afraid of the power of his words and the bravery of his actions that while Liu was suffering from severe illness, Chinese authorities adopted the ultimate cruelty of not letting him leave China for medical help that experts said might save his life. For China, the supreme goal was his silence.  The more we care about human rights and freedom, the more we must now mark his death and remember him not by being silent ourselves.  I first came to know about Liu's work a few years after the Congressional-Executive Commission on China was created as part of the debate over China's ascension to the World Trade Organization and concerns from Members of Congress over China's human rights record.  In 2000, I coauthored the legislation that created the China commission to help advance and monitor human rights abuses in The commission continues to do important work and continues today by shining a spotlight on many issues such as abuses in labor, environment, and freedom of speech and association.  While he was the most prominent voice in China against its repression of human rights and democratic values, Liu was not as well known in his life as another brave voice, Andrei His voice and action occurred during the Cold War, where there was a full press against the Soviet Union, including its suppression of freedom. He supported numerous efforts for freedom, including those of another noble warrior for freedom, Natan Like Sakharov, Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, but both were kept in virtual imprisonment and not allowed to go to  Liu's battles for freedom occurred when China's economic and political power were rising. The United States and other nations were wrestling with how to adapt, and relations with China have been increasingly infused with concerns about security, including the nuclearization of North So there has been a tendency for concerns in other nations about human rights and freedom in China to take a back seat.

The U.government at all levels, including the highest, must speak up clearly for her freedom.

It is vital that we aid these last handful of countries, get us over the finish line with these resources, and end our fight against polio so we can tell future generations: Like smallpox, polio is no longer in this country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-22-pt1-PgH4394-2.txt,99999999999999,1230,2017.0,22.0,May
14876,topic-id,1341,"Mr.President, before I discuss why the nominee before us, Scott Gottlieb, is the wrong choice to lead the Food and Drug Administration, I want to take a minute to talk about the FDA's impact on the health and safety of patients and families nationwide and how that impacts my perspective on this nomination.  Our constituents rely on the FDA's work every single day. They trust that the food they buy from the grocery store is safe. They trust that when they go to the emergency room, the drugs and medical devices that are used in their care have been held to the highest standards of approval and that the FDA's decisions are based on science, not politics or ideology. In other words, they trust in FDA's gold standard of approval. So it is critical that the FDA continue to have strong, independent leadership, especially in light of President Trump's radical priorities.  Like many, I am deeply concerned by this administration's efforts to roll back the progress we have made to strengthen the FDA and to improve public health. Let me give two recent examples from last week alone. First, the FDA delayed the implementation of a rule on menu labeling requirements, which would have provided families access to critical nutritional information about the food they buy and eat. These requirements have been worked on for years by several Senators and the Obama administration, with the support of public health groups and restaurants. The rule was less than 1 week away from going into effect. On the very same day, the FDA announced that it would delay the enforcement of a rule to ensure greater oversight over tobacco products, including cigars, pipe tobacco, and e-cigarettes. Now is not the time for the FDA to be taking its foot off the gas when it comes to protecting our children and youth from harmful marketing and flavoring tactics. These are significant steps in the wrong direction.  Families have every reason to be worried about this administration, and they are making it clear that they want leaders who are prepared to stand up for them, which brings us back to  At our HELP Committee hearing, after scrutinizing his past record, asking where he stands on key policy issues, and reviewing his answers to many of my questions, it has been made clear to me that Gottlieb is not that leader. He has not convinced me that he can withstand political pressure from this administration or that he will be truly committed to putting our families' health first. For these reasons, I will be voting no on Gottlieb's nomination today.  In reviewing Gottlieb's professional history and background, I have grown increasingly concerned about whether he can lead the FDA in an unbiased way given his unprecedented industry ties. On numerous occasions, Gottlieb has invested in or advised a company and then used his public platform to promote policies that will benefit that company in the future.  I know that, if confirmed, Gottlieb has agreed to recuse himself for 1 year from decisions involving some companies in which he has invested or held positions, but Gottlieb will still be allowed to weigh in on matters that involve other companies in which he had been previously invested. His complicated relationships with a venture capital firm and an investment bank specifically raise many questions, and he will not be recused from matters that involve a number of their clients. Companies Gottlieb has invested in have more than 60 drugs in development that could come before the FDA for approval, and the companies Gottlieb will be recused from have over 120 drugs in development.  The extent of these entanglements is unprecedented, and they are particularly troubling given this administration's clear willingness to skirt ethics rules and pressure Federal employees in order to jam their agenda through. Yet, as troubling as these entanglements are, they are not my only problems with this nomination. I am equally concerned about where Gottlieb stands on key policy issues.  For one, I do remain unconvinced that Gottlieb will ensure independent, science-based decisionmaking at the FDA if he is confirmed. While Gottlieb was at the FDA under the Bush administration, I was working very hard to ensure that, consistent[[Page S2840]]with expert recommendations, emergency contraception known as Plan B would be sold over the counter to all age groups. Yet the Bush administration ignored the science and made a decision, based on purely ideological grounds, on a so-called behind-the-counter option for Plan B, which allowed politics to interfere directly with women's access to the healthcare services that they need, and that was a position which Gottlieb defended.  I have had the opportunity to discuss this matter with Gottlieb on several occasions now, but regrettably my concerns remain unchanged. When I asked Gottlieb about this at our hearing--whether he would allow this administration to use the FDA to further its political agenda against women's health--Gottlieb said he would ``not relitigate settled approval decisions'' on this matter. When I made clear that I was asking about the future and how he would respond to future pressure from this administration to undermine women's health, Gottlieb did not give a clear answer. Given the Trump administration's commitment to undermining women's reproductive rights, which we have seen so clearly in these past 100 days, I find this aspect of Gottlieb's professional history especially troubling.  I have also raised concerns regarding Gottlieb's published positions on a number of important issues that focus on drugs and medical devices.  As I stated at the beginning of my remarks, I find the administration's recent decision to delay oversight on tobacco products to be especially concerning, which makes it all the more important that the next FDA Commissioner have a clear position on this issue. I asked Gottlieb about this at our hearing, specifically as it relates to flavored e-cigarettes that have flooded the markets in recent years. I have to say that I was disappointed by his response. I think it is clear that a line has been crossed when tobacco companies prey on children by coming out with e-cigarette flavors like gummy bear and cookies and cream. Yet, during his hearing, when I asked Gottlieb about this, he said he was not quite sure where that line gets drawn. That speaks volumes to me, and it is a pattern I have seen in Gottlieb's answers, whether I have asked him about off-label communications by drug companies or combating the opioid epidemic and what the FDA can do to help rein in drug costs.  I could go on, but I want to make one related point, which is that we still have many questions about where Gottlieb stands on pressing policy questions he will have to confront when he is confirmed.  As I said during our HELP Committee markup, we submitted many questions to Gottlieb following his hearing, and I was encouraged that in his answers to these questions, Gottlieb committed to upholding the gold standard and working with me on a number of priorities, like improving the postmarket surveillance of medical devices. Yet, in large part, I have to say we were left disappointed with the lack of specificity in his answers. Many of them were vague, and some questions were flatout ignored.  I just came back from hearing from families in my home State, and I can tell you that people are looking at what President Trump is doing. They are appalled, and they are looking for leaders to step up. Whether it is Gottlieb's unprecedented financial entanglements, his inability to withstand political pressure from the Bush administration in order to ensure science and not ideology drives decisionmaking at the FDA, or whether he will truly prioritize patient and consumer safety and the public health over the interests of corporations that stand to gain financially, I continue to doubt whether Gottlieb will be able to stand up to President  I believe that families and patients, rightly, expect more. They want independent, science-based leadership at the I stand with them and will oppose this nomination.  ",CREC-2017-05-09-pt1-PgS2830.txt,1409,MORNING BUSINESS,2017.0,9.0,May

14924,topic-id,476,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.953, Reducing the Regulatory Burdens As I have noted before on similar bills in the past, I remain concerned that this bill would mean that no Clean Water Act protections would be required for pesticide application to water bodies that are already impaired by pesticides.  The Clean Water Act in no way hinders, delays, or prevents the use of approved pesticides for pest control operations. In fact, the Clean Water Act permit provides a specific emergency provision to prevent outbreaks of diseases such as Zika virus.  Under the terms of the permit, pesticide applicators are covered automatically under the permit and any spraying may be performed immediately for any declared pest emergency situations. In most instances, sprayers are only required to notify EPA of their spraying operations 30 days after the beginning of a spraying operation.  Most pesticide applications in the United States are done in accordance with FIFRA, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act which only requires proper labeling on pesticide products regarding usage.  However, FIFRA labeling is no substitute for ensuring that we understand the volumes of pesticide we seem to apply to our rivers, our lakes, our streams on an annual basis.                              {time}  1515  According to a 2006 USGS report on pesticides, commonly used pesticides frequently are present in streams and groundwater at levels that exceed human health benchmarks and occur in many streams at levels that may affect aquatic or fish-eating wildlife and also human life.  In the data that the States provide the EPA, more than 16,000 miles of rivers and streams, 1,380 of bays and estuaries, and 370,000 acres of lakes in the United States are currently impaired or threatened by pesticides.  The EPA suggests that these estimates may be low because many of these States do not test for or monitor all the different pesticides that are currently being used. I am very concerned of the effect these pesticides have on the health of our rivers, our streams, and especially the drinking water supplies for all our citizens, especially the most vulnerable, the young, the elderly, and the poor and disenfranchised people who have no representation. We have much cancer appearing, and we have no idea what it is. Adding pesticides is not helping.  Mr.Chair, I include in the Record a Federal report on how pesticides in California are the leading cause of impairments to water quality.         U.EPA Report on California Water Quality Assessment        California Causes of Impairment for reporting year 2012       Pesticides are the Cause of water impairment in California      for 4,534 miles of rivers and streams, 235,765 acres of      lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, 829 square miles of bays and      estuaries, 35 miles of coastal shoreline, 42 square miles of      ocean and near coastal waters, and 43 acres of wetlands.

14925,topic-id,328,"Currently in California there are over 4,500 miles of rivers and streams, 235,000 acres of lakes and reservoirs, and 829 square[[Page H4540]]miles of bays and estuaries in my State that are impaired by pesticides. This is a significant concern in my home State, where every drop of water has to be cleaned and needs to be conserved, reused, and cherished.  We hear that pesticide application is already regulated under FIFRA and that the Clean Water Act review is not needed. I understand the concerns about the duplication of effort and the need to minimize the impacts that regulations have on small business or business at large. All the supporters are mostly farmers and other business entities.  However, I am still very concerned that these pesticides are having a very significant impact on water quality and that, with this bill, we are creating the exemption from water quality protection requirements without considering the impacts to the waters that are already impacted by pesticides, as they are in  This, in turn, costs our water users, our ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars to filter these pollutants out of water before it is potable. This is something I deal with on an ongoing basis as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and We currently have aquifers that are contaminated by the continued use of pesticides and fertilizers. Millions of dollars have been spent on the 20-plus-year-long cleanup effort of a Superfund site in my area that has pesticides as one of the contaminants.  We cannot, and should not, take away one of the only tools available to monitor for adverse impacts of pesticides in our rivers, our streams, and our reservoirs. Over the past 6 years, this tool has been reasonable, has been workable to pest control operators and agricultural interests alike, and needs to be retained.

14933,topic-id,994,"Mr.Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.DeFazio).  Mr.I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr.Chairman, this is the fifth time the United States House of Representatives has considered this bill.  Now, we have heard a lot of alternative facts today. Let's have some real facts.  Killing trees, well, first off, here is the extensive application. It is slightly over three pages long and it can be filed electronically, so we don't need to kill any trees.  Allegations that somehow this slows down control of mosquito abatement or Zika virus are absolutely false. Anybody can apply a pesticide in a public health situation. They have 30 days to file the paperwork online afterwards. It takes about 5 minutes. It has such technical things as your name and address, your pesticide applicator license verified with a certain State, where you are going to use the pesticide or herbicide.  Now, why would we want to know that? Or maybe, why wouldn't we want not to know that? Because that is what they are saying on that side of the aisle.  There is nothing registered with the Department of Yes, we have These pesticides and herbicides have been registered. They have labels--it can't be applied over water; it can't be applied here; it can't be applied there--and we trust the applicators to follow those rules. But when they actually use the herbicides and pesticides absent this form, this burdensome 3\1/2\-page form, we won't know.  Now, why would we care? Well, this is essentially the 20th anniversary of a massive fish kill in Jackson County, In that incident, an operator applied an aquatic herbicide in an irrigation canal that, when it leaked into the nearby creek, killed 92,000 steelhead. Now, we kind of care about our steelhead in the Northwest, so that was a problem.  So then the Federal agency said, Well, this is kind of a problem when someone does that, 92,000 steelhead. Plus, anybody who drank the water was poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. But we don't want to know about that on that side of the aisle because Dow Chemical doesn't like it because maybe it inhibits sales of some of these chemicals that cause these sorts of problems.  Now, we have data now because of these forms, and we know about areas[[Page H4542]]that are impaired. In my State, which is like the clean, green State, 825 miles of rivers and streams and 10,000 acres of lakes and ponds in the State of Oregon are impaired by pesticide contamination. That is something we should do something about. People are drinking that water; they are swimming in that water; their kids are bathing in that water. I think that is a problem.  But we don't want to know about that. This is just a horrible restraint on pesticide applications.  Now, we heard a lot of other hooey here. It is like: This is so difficult; it is so difficult to do. I was talking to the ranking member of the Agriculture He said, well, farmers don't want to file those forms. If they hired a pesticide applicator, that person could file the form for them.  Or, yeah, maybe they are going to have to file the 3-page form if it involves the waters of the United States of If it doesn't involve the waters, you don't have to file it. So this is really an incredible thing.  Now, we have taken this up numerous times. It was the Pest Management and Fire Suppression Flexibility Act in the 109th Congress--the same bill, exactly the same bill.  Then in the 112th and the 113th Congresses, it was the Reducing Regulatory Burdens It still didn't work. It didn't become law then.  Well, wait a minute. Let's pass it on to public fears. Last Congress, it was called the Zika Vector Control Act in the 114th We just heard a lot of hooey about how this will inhibit killing mosquitoes, which, of course, is absolutely not true.  But now we are back to here. So the Zika Control Act and the Pest Management and Fire Suppression Flexibility Act are now back to the Reducing Regulatory Burdens  Now, in the past 6 years, since this paperwork was required, or electronic work, do you know how many pesticide applicators have faced significant impacts because of these protections?  Do you know how many applicators have raised problems with the Clean Water Act pesticide general permit to EPA?  In fact, I specifically asked this question of the EPA's head of water at a Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee hearing. No specific instances where the clean water permit was causing problems or impacts on pesticide application. Yet here we are again, one more time, under the guise of reducing this horrible regulatory burden: name, address, phone number, what did you apply? Where are you registered to apply these sorts of permits? That is useful information.  I had a couple more instances in  Tiller, Oregon, again, right in the same area where the steelhead were killed. That same creek was contaminated with atrazine in 2014. Local residents who drank the water complained, and they also complained of the overspray. Then, in 2013, a helicopter in Curry County, Oregon, oversprayed residents.  Now, if they didn't have to file these forms, we wouldn't know who did it, when they did it, and what the chemical was. I guess that is kind of what the Republicans want. If someone oversprays your property and sprays stuff on you: ``Geez, I don't know. That was one of those black helicopters. We don't know where it came from, or who that was. We don't know what they dumped on you. Sorry.'' That is burdensome paperwork. We wouldn't want to require that kind of burdensome paperwork.  So that is why we are here again today for the fifth time with the fifth remaining rationale for what we are doing here today, and it still fails the smell test.

Re Oppose H.953 (Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017).       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members      and supporters nationwide, we urge you to oppose H.953      (``Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017''). A[[Page H4543]]     more apt title for this damaging legislation is the ``Poison      Our Waters Act'' because it would eliminate Clean Water Act      safeguards that protect our waterways and communities from      excessive pesticide pollution. The Pesticide General Permit      targeted in this legislation has been in place for nearly six      years now and alarmist predictions by pesticide manufacturers      and others about the impacts of this permit have failed to      bear any fruit.       This bill is the same legislation that pesticide      manufacturers and other special interests have been pushing      for years. It has been opposed not only by the Obama      but also more than 150 public health,      fishing, and conservation organizations (see attached list).      Contrary to earlier claims made by its proponents, this bill      will not improve nor impact spraying to combat Zika virus and      other human health threats. The Pesticide General Permit at      issue already allows for spraying to combat vector-borne      diseases such as Zika and the West Nile virus. According to      the U.Environmental Protection Agency, the permit      ``provides that pesticide applications are covered      automatically under the permit and may be performed      immediately for any declared emergency pest situations''      (emphasis added).       Further, the Clean Water Act has no significant effect on      farming practices. The Pesticide General Permit in no way      affects land applications of pesticides for the purpose of      controlling pests (that is, spraying that doesn't discharge      into water bodies). Irrigation return flows and agricultural      stormwater runoff do not require permits, even when they      contain pesticides. Existing agricultural exemptions in the      Clean Water Act remain.       Repealing the Pesticide General Permit--as this damaging      legislation seeks to do--would allow pesticides to be      discharged into water bodies without any meaningful oversight      since the federal pesticide registration law (the Federal      Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)) does not      require tracking of such applications.       Now that the Pesticide General Permit is in place, the      public is finally getting information that they couldn't      obtain before about the types of pesticides being sprayed or      discharged into local bodies of water. All across the      country, pesticide applicators are complying with the      Pesticide General Permit to protect water quality without      issue,       The Pesticide General Permit simply lays out commonsense      practices for applying pesticides directly to waters that      currently fall under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water      Efforts to block this permit are highly controversial, as      evidenced by the attached list of groups opposed.

14938,topic-id,906,"Mr.Chairman, there is one other thing that I want to bring to the attention of this committee. One of the potential human health applications related to unregulated discharges to water is drinking water.  In May of 2017, the Natural Resources Defense Council released a report entitled, ``Threats on Tap,'' that documented potentially harmful contaminants in tap water in every State of the This report, based on information obtained from State and local public drinking water utilities, documented tens of thousands of drinking water violations related to chemicals and other contaminants currently found in our domestic water supply.  The report included a focus on synthetic organic compounds commonly found in a wide variety of products, from household cleaners to industrial, commercial, and agricultural products, including pesticides and herbicides regulated under                              {time}  1545  According to this report, human exposure to these contaminants can lead to cancers--I repeat, lead to cancers--developmental effects, central nervous system, and reproductive difficulties, endocrine issues, or liver and kidney problems.  According to an appendix of this report, which I include in today's Record, in 2015, there were 6,864 drinking water violations associated with synthetic organic compounds, potentially affecting as many as 2.6 million drinking water users. Of these, a number were for direct, health-related violations affecting more than 300,000 individuals. This report documented ongoing drinking water violations for the worst of the worst pesticides in terms of human health effects, including, atrazine, chlordane, endrin, and glyphosate.  Mr.Chairman, thanks to this report, we have more information on exactly where these drinking water violations are occurring and how increased use of pesticides on or near water increases the risk that humans will be exposed to these dangerous chemicals when they turn on the tap; which begs the question: Why the proponents of this bill want to reduce the public disclosure and monitoring requirements of the Clean Water Act relating to pesticide applications?  Do these proponents want to let these pesticide applications and chemical companies go back in the shadows where information on the release of pesticides is no longer known?  I include in the Record a list of chemicals and their potential health impact.

14883,topic-id,903,"Mr.President, most everybody has seen the news of another disturbance with regard to an airline in an airport terminal. Indeed, what has happened at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just in the last day has been a disturbance where they had to call in the Broward County Sheriff's Office to put down the disturbance because there were some upset people.  I have just gotten off the phone with the CEO of Spirit Airlines, as well as the head of the Air Line Pilots Association, and basically have told them that they should get this thing fixed and get it fixed quick. There is not so much a labor dispute, because they are in negotiations and I think are reaching final conclusions, but, as a result of some things with the schedule, it caused a number of flights to be canceled and, unfortunately, canceled right at the last before they could let the passengers know ahead of time before they ever came to the airport. Even much more of an irritant, they load them on the airplane as if they are ready to go and then tell them they don't have a crew of pilots and, therefore, the flight has to be canceled. Those problems are going to go through today and tomorrow.  I am given to believe--having talked to the head of the pilot's union, as well as the CEO of the airline--that they will have this straightened out over the next several days. It has been costly, and it has certainly been an irritant and an inconvenience to the passengers because 300 flights have been canceled already in the past several days, and we are going to see some more canceled in the next couple of days.  Now, this all culminated in what the American television viewer has seen--a chaotic scene at Spirit's front ticket counter at the Fort Lauderdale airport after passengers had to get off of the airplane and the canceled flight. Many people have seen this video. It is now circulating online. Obviously, these passengers were very frustrated, and it took, unfortunately, the deputies coming in to put down the disturbance.  Having said that, this is just the latest. Doesn't that recall something else that has happened in the last few weeks--a passenger being dragged off of an airplane, beaten, and bloodied? Then, who has to come and get him but an element of the airport authority of Haven't we also seen on another TV episode--and isn't this telling us something--that passengers are now recording evidence of how passengers are being treated because they have cell phones and cell phones have video cameras. So we saw an airline employee kind of go off on passengers in the case of another airline. Well, airlines, you had better start fixing this because the passengers are not going to tolerate it.  On the instant circumstance, having talked with the CEO and the head of the union, they are in these discussions. I think they are going to get it fixed. But they need to fix it fast because the traveling public only has so much patience. What happened at Fort Lauderdale was unacceptable and deeply unfair to the affected passengers, the overwhelmed airline employees, and local law enforcement. It was unfair. Let's not forget, also in dealing with the Fort Lauderdale airport, that memories are still fresh of the shooting that took place in January at the baggage claim.  Now, what happened just last night in Fort Lauderdale is just another example of passengers becoming sick and tired of what they perceive as mistreatment by airlines, be it that circumstance in Chicago with the forcible removal of a passenger, or be it failing airline IT systems and airline fees run amok. So the airlines had better start paying attention to this.  It appears airlines are giving the impression that they have forgotten their customers must come first. So what is it? I know the airline companies don't intend to do this, but it is happening. It is being recorded on video, and it is all the more causing people to express their frustrations.  I have no trouble in putting the airlines on notice. If they can't get their act together and start treating the flying public with respect rather than making them think they are self-loading cargo, then this Congress is going to be forced to act, and that time is going to come soon as the Senate begins work this year on what will be a bipartisan long-term bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation That bill is coming later this year.  I just want to say in conclusion that we have had a hearing in our Commerce Committee on this. I thought that would be enough and this Senator wouldn't have to speak out anymore, but here, again, we have another incident. My heart goes out, for example, to some of the CEOs who are trying to change a culture of treating passengers with disrespect or ignorance. It is important they change that culture because we will continue to see these kinds of circumstances arise if passengers do not feel like they are getting the proper respect they deserve. After all, they are customers. They are paying customers of the airlines.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Johnson). The clerk will call the roll.

At Plum Island, the Department of Homeland Security works with the U.Department of Agriculture to research and develop new vaccines and diagnostic tests for animal disease outbreaks and to defend against international or accidental introduction of animal diseases into the United  On September 11, 2005, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to develop the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, or NBAF, as a state-of-the-art biocontainment laboratory for the study of diseases that threaten both America's animal agricultural industry and public health.  As envisioned by DHS, the 580,000-square-foot facility would replace the Plum Island laboratory.  Following an extensive selection process, DHS selected a site in Manhattan, Kansas, for the new lab, and the site is slated to be fully operational by December of 2022.  What H.2182 aims to answer is what will happen to Plum Island when DHS vacates the facility.  DHS is currently studying the range of options for disposition of the property, including transferring it to another Federal agency, a State or local government, or a nonprofit organization for the purposes of education, research, or conservation.  In doing so, DHS is expected to assess the full implications of each option, including cost, cleanup, and hazard mitigation.  H.2182 requires the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, to assess whether the forthcoming study is satisfactory to support a decision. In the event that the study is lacking in a key area, GAO would be required to conduct its own study.  Importantly, H.2182 ensures that Plum Island cannot be sold by the Federal Government to the highest bidder.

This bill would restore congressional intent regarding the relationship between FIFRA and the Clean Water  Historically, Congress has viewed FIFRA as sufficient to protect human health and the environment. Until the early part of the past decade, even the EPA interpreted its responsibilities related to pesticide use as compliance with FIFRA would reduce the need for duplicative permitting under the Clean Water If pesticides were used according to their regulation under FIFRA, then permits for pesticide application under the Clean Water Act were unnecessary.  Unfortunately, this historic interpretation has been overturned by activist litigation. In 2009, a decision by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upended the historic interpretation of the space between these two laws. The Sixth Circuit order created a new permitting requirement that provides no additional environmental or public health protection.  The goal of this legislation has been to address only those problems created by the Sixth Circuit decision and to be consistent with congressional intent and the EPA's long-held interpretation. It is a commonsense solution to a court-imposed regulatory burden that Congress never intended to be applied. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

14871,topic-id,5464,"Mr.President, I rise today to continue a discussion we have had on the floor over the last year or so on the issue of opioids--that would be addiction to heroin, prescription drugs, and now this new form of synthetic heroin coming into our communities called fentanyl or carfentanil.  Sadly, I must say that things are not getting better. In fact, in the States we represent, in our communities, we see more and more evidence of not just addiction but overdoses and deaths. Fentanyl, in particular, is more deadly than heroin--30 to 50 times more powerful--and is resulting in not just more overdoses but more deaths per overdose. This has become a crisis to the point that it is the 1 cause of death in my home State of Ohio and across the country, surpassing car accidents.  This is the 35th time I have come to the floor to talk about this issue and what we ought to do. We have made progress. In the last year alone, we passed legislation, including the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, to help with prevention, treatment, and recovery, and to help our law enforcement and other first responders, with Narcan, be able to reduce the number of deaths--this miracle drug that reverses the overdoses--to be able to save lives.  We also passed the Cures legislation, which sent money straight back to the States that would help to provide the treatment that is so badly needed. Probably 8 out of 10 people who are addicted are not receiving treatment. Sadly, there is a revolving door where people are coming under the grip of this addiction, committing crimes, going to prison, getting out, getting into the addiction again, and going back into the criminal justice system once again.  This legislation we passed is now starting to be implemented. It takes a little while for things to get moving around here. I am happy to say that the States have now received some of this funding. Some of the programs--about half of those in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act are now implemented. I urge the administration to implement the other half of the programs, and I have done that every time I have come to the floor over the last few months.  Unfortunately, I also have to come to the floor today to talk about something that is going to make it harder to address this issue should it become reality. As some of you may know, recently it was reported that there was a document from the White House Office of Management and Budget saying that the White House is considering cutting funding dramatically for the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the This is the office that coordinates the drug issue for the White House, the administration. The proposal that was leaked to the media said that it would be a cut from $388 million a year to $24 million a year. That is a cut of 95 percent. What does that mean? It means the staff would be, obviously, reduced dramatically. They have 33 people who would lose their jobs, people who are out there every day on the frontlines, trying to use a relatively small number of people to expand this effort all over the country. It would eliminate a lot of grant programs, office administrators, including what is called the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program, or HIDTA, and a program called the Drug-Free Communities Support  I want to touch on those two programs quickly and make the point as to how important they are, hoping that the administration is hearing us and hoping my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will help us ensure that this proposal does not become reality, that we don't end up, at a time when we have an unprecedented drug crisis in this country--the worst drug epidemic we have had in our lifetime--pulling back on these important programs.  Why does this matter? Again, having a drug czar, which is what the Director of the Office of National Drug Policy is called, is very important to coordinate the efforts. In fact, it is cost-effective to have a drug czar rather than having different agencies and departments competing and sometimes in duplication with each other, to have one person in the White House in charge, talking about the importance of this.  President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan established the drug czar. The reason they did it was they wanted to be sure America and the White House were speaking with one voice on this issue. I have known every drug czar since then. I have known every one of them over the last--what would that be?--30 years. I think it is incredibly important to have this job filled with the right person to get out there and deliver this message that it is important that we work together on prevention and education to try to keep people out of drugs altogether, and should people become addicted, how do we maximize the chances of their success by getting them into treatment and recovery?  The program I mentioned a minute ago, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program, is one that pretty much every Senator knows about. Why? Because in pockets of every State, there are areas in which there is a particular problem with drugs. This program, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program, does something unique. It says: OK, we[[Page S2834]]are going to put Federal law enforcement together with State law enforcement and local law enforcement to intensely focus on this issue at the local level. As you know, that is necessary because so much of this is interstate, even international, and by having this intense focus, there has been enormous success in my State and States around the country.  Under the program, you have to have one full-time law enforcement officer at the Federal level, State level, and the local level. What I have found back home is that typically you have a sheriff or a police chief who runs this locally and has a lot of his officers involved but really is able to maximize what he or she can do because you have this involvement from the State highway patrol, you have this involvement from the FBI, you have this coordination.  The Ohio HIDTA alone has removed $90 million worth of illicit drugs from our streets. It has apprehended more than 4,000 fugitives involved in drug trafficking operations. Think about the difference that makes. It makes our communities safer; ultimately, of course, it is going to save a lot of lives.  So I think this is one that is really working. If you ask your law enforcement locally about it, they will tell you that if they don't have a HIDTA grant, they probably wish they did. It is very competitive; not everyone can get one. But if you can show that you can use the money effectively and if you have a really serious drug problem in your area, having that HIDTA program is important.  The second program I mentioned is called the Drug-Free Communities Support What does this do? This supports community anti-drug coalitions all around the country. Often, people ask me: What is the solution to this problem? Why are we in the situation we are in? I turn to prevention and education because, if you think about it, once you get into that funnel of addiction, it is very costly and very difficult.  Wouldn't it be better if we had better programs out there? Frankly, we did back in the 1980s and even the 1990s--to tell young people and to tell others why it is such a mistake to get into this drug issue, why they must do everything they can to avoid, in the case of heroin and prescription drugs and other opioids, taking these painkillers, these prescription drugs that are addictive, to the point that you become addicted, which is so often where the heroin addiction and the overdoses start.  Four out of five heroin addicts in the country started with prescription drugs, they say. Getting that information out there, that awareness, is incredibly important. That is what this Drug-Free Communities Program is about.  I got involved in this program early on through a personal experience. I was a first-year Member of the House of Representatives 23 years ago. A woman whose son had died of an overdose came to see me. She came to see me because she wanted to talk about her experience and what were we going to do about it.  At the time, Bill Clinton was I went to an event where both President Clinton and I were given a gold ID bracelet by a young man. The young man's name was Jeffrey I put Jeffrey Gardner's ID bracelet on, and then I prepared for my meeting with this mother, who was obviously very upset.  She was there with her younger son. She came to my office. I was prepared for her. My staff had done all the research, and we knew there was about $15 billion a year being spent on drug interdiction, interdicting drugs coming from other countries, incarcerations and prosecutions, and the eradication of drugs overseas in places like Colombia, where a lot of cocaine was being grown at that time. So I told her that. I said: Your tax dollars are being used well to fight this battle. This is what is happening with your dollars.  She looked at me and said: How does that help me? She said: I went to my church. I went to my school to get them to help, to mobilize people, to provide more prevention and education resources, to get the word out. They were in denial. They said: This does not happen here.  She said: I went to my neighbors and tried to get a community meeting together, and people did not show up.  She said: How does interdicting drugs help me? How does the work on eradication overseas help me?  I did more research and looked into it further and talked to people around the country who were experts on this and found out where there was this community-of-support network, bringing in all sectors of the community. It really made a difference to reduce drug abuse.  So we started this program. This program, the Drug-Free Communities Act, has to be made up of all sectors of the community. We are talking about the religious community, faith leaders--very important--but also teachers, police officers, parents, doctors, other community leaders who come together with this intense focus on education and prevention.  The program we put together has real accountability. You know, I am a I believe in accountability. I want to be sure tax dollars are being used wisely. To receive funding under this program, coalitions are required to be in existence for 6 months before they can even apply--get on their feet, be sure they are working. It is the only Federal drug abuse prevention program that requires that, by the way.  The coalition is required to go through a year-long training academy to ensure they have the skills necessary to effectively reduce drug rates, and they have to have data to show that their efforts are actually working. There have to be performance measures in place. In these coalitions, there are surveys done in schools to see what the results are.  These coalitions are made up of people who are on the front lines. They know their communities better than anybody else does. That is why they are more effective than anybody else. They know how to reach people in that setting, know how to respond quickly when problems begin.  In communities with these coalitions, use of alcohol, tobacco, prescription drugs, marijuana, and cocaine by our young people have declined: alcohol, 32-percent decline; tobacco, 38-percent decline; other drugs, including prescription drugs, 21-percent decline. So these things work.  I must say, I have seen it firsthand because, before drafting the legislation, I started my own coalition called the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater Twenty-three years ago, we started this coalition, and we did it with, again, all members of the community.  In my case, I reached out to the first lady, Hope Taft of our State; also to a religious leader in our community, Damon Lynch, Jr., one of the most respected community leaders and at that time head of the Baptist Ministers Conference; and the former CEO of Procter & Gamble, John Petter, so we brought in the business community as well.  We established this coalition not thinking that we were going to end up applying for Federal grant money because there was no Federal grant program then, but that we would focus on how to ensure we could actually make a difference. We set up a survey that went to two-thirds of the schools in our community and asked questions about drug use, so we would know if our efforts were working or not working, as the case might be, and how to target our efforts toward parents and teachers. We spent a lot of time in the faith community, but also with coaches and athletic directors.  This program is still going. It is called Prevention I chaired it for 9 years. I was on the board of the coalition again before I ran for the I know it works because I have seen it. We have gotten good results. The coalition tells me that since 2000, alcohol use among young people they worked with in Cincinnati has gone down 46 percent; tobacco use, 61 percent; marijuana use, 22 percent.  Since 2012, which is when we started focusing on the prescription drug issue, there has been a decline by 29 percent in the use of prescription drugs by our young people. So, I think, this program, which by the way, cost about 90 million bucks last year--as someone who was a distinguished military officer told me recently: That is about what we charge to keep the lights on in part of the Pentagon every day, not that I am not for more and smarter defense spending; I am, but $90 million is[[Page S2835]]what we are talking about for this program during the time of the worst drug crisis in the history of our country.  I just think this impact, which I have seen, really works. It means less crime, less strain on our healthcare system, more productivity in school, more productivity at work, more people who can pass a drug test and go to work. That benefits all of us, and it saves taxpayer dollars.  The success we had in this coalition, again, led me to the legislation. A Democratic Representative from Michigan, Sandy Levin, and I introduced the legislation, bipartisan in the  Here in the Senate, the leaders who were the leaders of this legislation are still here and continue to support it; that is, Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Patrick Leahy--again a bipartisan group. The bill, the Drug-Free Communities Act, is, again, based on these lead documents from the administration, one of the programs they have proposed defunding altogether.  I am hopeful that this legislation, the Drug-Free Communities Act, which has really worked--it has provided funding that has spawned over 2,000 community coalitions around the country. Today, it currently mobilizes 9,000 community volunteers all around the country. I am hopeful that we will not be defunding this program but, instead, focusing more on the issues of prevention and education. That is going to be the long-term solution to this drug problem. Yes, we have to get treatment to those who need it, but if we are not working on prevention and awareness and education, the issues of drug addiction and drug abuse are going to continue to get worse, in my view.  I am a former Budget I understand it is a tough job to look at all the different competing priorities when you are trying to save taxpayer dollars. I get that. But I also get that we don't want to take a program like this that is actually working, that has all of these accountability measures in place to be sure that taxpayer dollars are being spent right, and then get rid of it at a time that we have this growing crisis in our country.  When I first got involved in this issue 22 years ago, I became convinced pretty quickly that one reason the drug issue had raised its ugly head in the 1990s is that we took our eye off the ball. I think in the 1980s, under the leadership of President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan and Bill Bennett, who did an awesome job as drug czar, we made real progress, particularly on the issue of cocaine.  I think there was sort of a sense that we had solved that problem, and it was time to focus on other things. So we took our eye off the ball. That is why you saw, in the 1990s when the Drug-Free Communities Act legislation was necessary, there was a big increase in drug use, particularly among our young people. So I was always worried that we might do that again, that when there was a reduction in drug use, we might say: Well, that problem is behind us; let's move onto the next one.  The problem was never behind us, sadly. It is like the tide. It just keeps coming in, so you have to keep your focus on it. But I will tell you, I never expected that at a time when we would have a substantial increase in drug use, in crime, in overdoses, in deaths--which is what we have experienced in this country over the past few years--that we would cut these programs. I just did not imagine it. So I am concerned about it. We can't take our eye off the ball, particularly at a time like this. We have to be sure that we are supporting these programs that work.  Let me show you a chart that tells you where we are today. This is the number of drug overdose deaths in our great country from 1999 to 2015, the most recent year for which we have data. Look at this line here. This is opioid painkillers, this is fentanyl, and this is heroin. You see this incredible increase. Sadly, I will tell you that in 2016 and 2017, it keeps going up.  This year, we have had more opioid overdose deaths over the first few months than we had in the same period last year. In fact, here is one example. In Cleveland, OH, in the last 10 months, we have had more overdose deaths from fentanyl than we had in the previous 10 years. So it is sad that it is not getting better; it is getting worse.  Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, surpassing car accidents. This is, again, a troubling chart, but we need to look at it. We hear a lot about homicides, and gun homicides, in particular. We hear about car crashes. Here is an example of HIV/AIDS in 1995, a time that was the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis, when all of us reacted appropriately.  Here we are in drug overdoses in 2015--far worse than any of these. So between prescription painkillers, heroin, and synthetic forms of heroin, drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States of  According to CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more Americans died from drug overdoses in 2015, again, than died in the AIDS epidemic in 1995. A recent story in the New York Times said there are more than four times as many people dying every day from this epidemic than were dying at the peak of the crack epidemic.  Another way to look at it, sadly, is that more people died in the last 3 years than died in the Vietnam Those are tough things to compare, but the point is, this is not a time for us to be gutting these programs. Fortunately, we have these programs in place to help. Let's use them to try to encourage more prevention and more education.  Here is a chart that just shows where heroin and fentanyl are. Again, from 1999 to 2015, this is heroin, this is fentanyl. Look at the rise of this over the last few years. That is what we are dealing with. That is the reality. That is what is happening in the communities and in our streets.  You might ask yourself, why do we want to cut this back at this point? My understanding is that some have argued we don't need the program. They said this program is duplicative because we have other programs now, including great legislation passed last year that I mentioned earlier called the 21st Century Cures In fact, the author of that legislation just joined us on the floor, Senator Alexander of  They have said the Drug-Free Communities Act may be a duplication of that CURES That is an entirely different program--again, $90 million a year. CURES is $500 million a year needed right now.  I was a strong supporter of the CURES Act, and I again thank my colleague for working with some of us who have been focused on this issue, as he has, to get that legislation passed on a bipartisan basis.  The 21st Century CURES Act provides $500 million, but it provides that funding over this year and next, over 2 years. It is a temporary increase in funding to deal with the real crisis. This will help fill the gaps, but it does not ensure that $1 of that money goes toward this evidence-based prevention we talked about today.  Second, these programs have distinct goals. The CURES grants can be used however a State wants, and that is appropriate. In Ohio, I know Governor Kasich and the State legislature are focused on using it in a smart way, focused mostly on treatment which is badly needed. As I noted, 8 out of 10 people who are addicted and need treatment are not getting the treatment they need. We need more treatment facilities in some communities where the treatment is not available.  The Drug-Free Communities Act is specifically focused on this prevention through education at the community level. Funding goes directly to these coalitions I talked about and their focus is on prevention. It is not duplication. One is a prevention program focused on the community level, and one is an open-ended grant to the There is no other Federal program that funds evidenced-based prevention at the community level and has these measures except this one.  The accountability measures we talked about are important, and that distinguishes it from CURES or anything else. We require that communities provide matching funds, a one-to-one match. So if a dollar of Federal tax dollars goes out, it has to be matched by a dollar of non-Federal tax dollars just to get the funding.  We put a cap on administrative expenses of 8 percent to ensure that we maximize the amount of funding going into these programs. If you want funding in your coalition, you have to keep[[Page S2836]]your funding below 8 percent. That ensures that a maximum amount of funding goes into these programs. We specifically included strict accountability measures to ensure the highest level of support in solving the substance abuse crisis every community faces. These programs are effective. They use taxpayer dollars well, and cutting them doesn't make sense.  One of the reasons I believe President Trump was elected was that he had the courage and foresight to talk about this issue on the campaign trail. He talked about addiction, whether he was in New Hampshire, Ohio, or other States where we have a high level of heroin, prescription drug, and fentanyl abuse and addiction. He spoke with a passion about this and the toll it has on our citizens and devastation to our communities. I think that was one reason he was elected. He focused on how we would stop this epidemic. This proposal apparently put forward by Members of his administration runs counter to what he talked about during the campaign.  Earlier today, my original House cosponsor of the Drug-Free Community Act, Congressman Sandy Levin, and I sent a letter to the Office of Management and Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, encouraging him not to pursue this course of action.

We represent former      and current federal, state, and local officials, hundreds of      community-based organizations, and tens of thousands of      people working in drug prevention, drug treatment, drug      treatment courts, mental health, recovery, medicine, law      enforcement, and millions of individuals in recovery from      alcohol and drug use disorders. Like the Administration, we      believe drugs are a serious issue.       In light of the Administration's prioritization, we write      in strong support of the Office of National Drug Control      Policy (ONDCP) and the critically important Drug Free      Communities (DFC) program, which provides funding directly to      communities to prevent drug use. DFC-funded coalitions are      proven to effectively reduce alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and      prescription drug misuse among middle and high school-aged      children. The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA)      program, which coordinates federal, state, and local law      enforcement, streamlines efforts to dismantle drug      trafficking organizations and brings drug traffickers to      justice.       As we have written before, ONDCP brings essential expertise      to the table on complex drug issues, expertise that would      otherwise be missing or dispersed across multiple agencies.      ONDCP holds all federal, state, and local agencies      accountable for achieving specific goals to reduce drug      trafficking, use, and other consequences.       At a time when drugs now kill more people than firearms or      car crashes, it is more important than ever for ONDCP to      remain a strong voice in the White House and a visible      presence nationally. As plans are finalized for the      Administration's proposed FY 2018 budget, we once again ask      the Administration to maintain a strong commitment to ONDCP      by proposing the highest level of funding possible for the      agency and its programs given the importance of ONDCP's      mission and the current opioid crisis.

So I ask my colleagues to join me in urging the OMB Director and the folks in the White House who are making these decisions not to take this course of action but rather to support our proven community anti-drug coalition, to support ONDCP in doing the important work at a time of a growing epidemic.

15005,topic-id,806,"Mr.Speaker, last week, I spent our congressional recess in the Rocky Mountain National Park, home to some of America's most unique and breathtaking natural wonders, in an attempt to better understand the mounting impacts climate change has on our national parks and all of our public lands across the country.  More than 4.5 million people from across America and the world visit the Rockies every year to take in the snowcapped peaks, the winding rivers, and the endless evergreen forests. They see herds of elk and bighorn sheep, and hear the screeching call of the mountain pika, a small furry creature that I can personally attest makes one of the most distinctive sounds in the mountains.  Visitors to the park, like me, can experience all four seasons in an hour as they drive up Trail Ridge Road from the sunny, low-elevation valleys, to the top of 12,000-foot peaks covered in 20-foot snowdrifts. It is impossible not to appreciate the intricate balance of nature while standing in that environment, the way that each species is finely tuned to survive in its surroundings and the way that each depends on the other.  Unfortunately, this careful balance is being shaken to its very core by manmade climate change as well as the denial of its existence by a very small group of post-science, post-research skeptics.  For centuries, bark beetles and lodgepole pines maintained a special relationship. Beetles, held in check by deep, cold winters, ate and killed some of the largest and oldest trees, opening up valuable forest real estate for new, younger trees to thrive. Now, however, thanks to warming global temperatures, those cold winters haven't come and beetle populations have boomed, killing literally millions of trees in the Rocky  Formerly green mountainsides are dotted, or even dominated, by the silver skeletons of pines, it is one of the most conspicuous changes to visitors of the park.  The little pika is another of many species whose way of life is disappearing as global warming drives temperatures higher and higher. As summer temperatures spike, many of these creatures are dying out. Humans are not immune to these impacts either.  Warming winters cause more and more of the mountain's precipitation to fall as rain instead of snow, allowing it to run off or soak into the soil. The snowpack, which for generations has fed the Colorado River, is diminishing and, with it, our reliable and already taxed water source for seven Western  It was uncanny, Mr.Speaker, to be standing at the headwaters of the Colorado River, a mere creek in the Rockies, learning about the ways manmade warming is changing the world around us at the same time the President was withdrawing the United States from the historic Paris  It was tragic irony to be in that environment to hear this devastating announcement. It was truly inexplicable to be surrounded by one of many national treasures as our Federal Government announced their decision to abandon them when they are needed most.  The agreement, an unprecedented show of global will to tackle a truly global problem, isn't an end-all, as some less-enlightened critics have said. It is a framework, a roadmap to get the pollution reductions started, to ensure a safe, sustainable, and economically prosperous future. It supports an economic model built for the long haul, one that protects lives and livelihoods, while wasting less and producing more. These are irrefutable costs to leaving the Paris  By removing us from the agreement, the President isn't canceling it. He is simply ensuring that we are the ones who will be left behind as the world moves forward without us. We will be left behind with the cost of polluted air, preventable and expensive illness, and shrinking, uncompetitive fossil fuel industries that imperil their workers and drag the economy down.  It will cost us standing as a world leader in innovation as other countries step forward to fill the void that we have created and realize the benefits of clean-energy jobs, reliable public transit, and stable supply chains for businesses.  They understand that climate change affects us all, no matter our income or whether we are in the middle of a major city or on the top of the great Rocky  The 194 nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will continue to act, not because the U.once told them to do so, but because it is the right thing to do and it is in their best interest from economic gain and public health to national security and stewardship.  I encourage everyone to go visit the mountains. Go spend a week with the incredible men and women of the National Park Service who have dedicated their lives to understanding and protecting America's precious natural[[Page H4657]]places. Then come back here, and I guarantee that you will understand why we need to act.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgH4656.txt,1967,RECOGNIZING MILITARY CAREGIVERS,2017.0,7.0,June
14965,topic-id,249,"Mr.President, I would like to acknowledge an important event in our history, the Orphan Train This movement is not only extremely important to Kansas; it also placed approximately 250,000 orphaned, abandoned, and homeless children in homes across the United The National Orphan Train Complex, which is headquartered in our very own Concordia, KS--also known as Orphan Train Town--continues to tell stories of children who were impacted by these orphan trains.  The first orphan train arrived in Kansas in 1859 to the city of Wathena, where three children were placed with Kansas families. Since this first train, 12,000 children were moved to Kansas homes. These children would grow up in Kansas, raising families, growing the economy, and serving their communities through farming, teaching, and starting businesses. These children and their journey are an integral part of Kansas history.  The mission of the National Orphan Train Complex in Concordia, KS, is to collect, preserve, interpret, and disseminate knowledge about the orphan trains and the children who rode them. The National Orphan Train Complex is the only organization compiling a master list of orphan train riders to assist future generations with genealogical information. The tireless work done by this organization deserves acknowledgement. I am proud to recognize the 15th annual celebration of Orphan Train Riders, which takes place June 1 through June 4.  I ask my colleagues join me in recognizing the Orphan Train Movement and the National Orphan Train Complex on their outstanding research and preservation of our Nation's history.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgS3138-2.txt,968,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,24.0,July

Clarence asked me the cost of such an expansion, and I informed him it would be close to $100,000 to refurbish and move programs into Mallison He immediately responded, Mr.Speaker, that he would raise those funds by I reminded him it was already the end of December, but he and Corkie assured me that they would meet an April deadline.  Incredibly, Clarence devised a plan for what became known as the CSX Charity Train Ride, which entailed a fundraiser that gave contributors an amazing train ride with dinner and entertainment. The event was a first-class success, and Clarence had raised all the funds necessary to refurbish Mallison Park and move the Police Athletic League into those new facilities. Their efforts led to an over 40 percent drop in violent crime within a 1-mile radius of Mallison  Over the years, the CSX Charity Train Ride grew into one of the largest single charity events in northeast Florida, and it continued to add additional charity recipients every year.

14783,topic-id,275,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.2190, the Streamlining DHS Overhead  Despite being the Nation's third largest Federal department, the Department of Homeland Security continues to struggle with challenges from its integration of 22 different Federal departments and agencies.  One example of these challenges is the Department's management of its real estate portfolio. DHS pays $2 billion a year to occupy more than 100 million square feet of space. Weak internal oversight and a lack of property management processes have further intensified the problem.  Collaboration and coordination is important in these instances, and doing nothing has led to a footprint larger than what DHS needs to carry out its mission.  This legislation directly addresses these challenges by mandating the development of regional real property strategies that focus on consolidating leases, where appropriate, to the mission. It also gives the Under Secretary for Management oversight tools to ensure DHS property is being managed efficiently.  Another important part of this legislation is its outlining of responsibilities for the Chief Facilities and Logistics Officer to achieve cost savings.  As we have seen from the 2-year majority staff investigation, increased accountability and promoting efficiency is needed so DHS can more effectively use its resources to focus on its mission of securing the homeland while also saving taxpayer funds.  Improving the Department's operation and promoting efficiencies within its real property portfolio is an issue that both sides of the aisle and the Department should be able to work together on.  H.2190 is commonsense legislation. I urge my colleagues' support.  I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1915  ",CREC-2017-06-20-pt1-PgH4982.txt,99999999999999,REDUCING REGULATORY BURDENS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,20.0,June

14932,topic-id,511,"Mr.Chairman, I want to first thank my colleague from Ohio for his leadership on bringing forth this important legislation to actually help us focus more resources on killing mosquitoes, especially as the mosquito season starts, as we see so many threats with Zika, with West Nile, just the damage that we see happening around our country from mosquitoes. We have decided we are going to put resources into killing mosquitoes, and then we come about and find out about these regulations that were imposed by the courts in a way that actually makes it harder for us to kill mosquitoes.                              {time}  1530  What you hear so often from people around the country is: Why is it that you have got things happening out of Washington that make no sense?  Congressman Gibbs identified one of those areas and said it really doesn't make sense. We tried to work through a different remedy to try to get the administration to fix it, and they pointed to a court case that keeps them from fixing it.  It is one of the big frustrations you have that it actually takes an act of Congress to bring common sense into the process of killing mosquitoes, for goodness sake. But here we are doing it. At least we are spending the people's business doing something that actually injects common sense back into the things that people do in their daily lives.  All across our community and across this country, you have local governments that are really the ones that focus on killing mosquitoes, and we started hearing about this problem. Of course, Mr.Chairman, we asked the EPA to identify just how much this is actually costing.  So as everybody scrambles and fights and you hear agencies saying ``I need more money to do this,'' ``I need more money to do that,'' we need to be more responsible with the taxpayers' money, and people are saying, ``Live within your means.''  And we have asked the The EPA, Mr.Chairman, told us that the cost of implementing these EPA regulations is an extra $50 million a year. Think of how ludicrous that is. Because of the way the EPA is implementing the law, as we are trying to kill more mosquitoes, it is costing $50 million a year to comply with burdensome, duplicative regulations--rather than killing mosquitoes. We should be spending that money, $50 million, killing more mosquitoes, not killing trees to comply with ridiculous regulations.  So I want to commend my colleague from Ohio for bringing this back. The House passed this in a very bipartisan way last We didn't get it all the way to the President's desk. So this year, hopefully, we will get this bill not only passed through the House, but through the Senate and to President Trump's desk, where he will sign a bill that injects common sense back into the process of killing mosquitoes.  Let's spend our money killing mosquitoes, not killing trees and having to comply with ridiculous regulations that come out of Washington and make no sense. Let's pass this bill.

14822,topic-id,634,"Mr.President, I am frankly disturbed by the new strategy on the hard right to discredit Special Counsel Mueller and sully his reputation. Their strategy is clear. They know or suspect that facts might not be good for the President so they are trying to vilify the man who is in charge of finding them, but they have chosen the wrong man. Anyone who engages in these baseless attacks about Mr.Mueller's character is only heaping dishonor upon themselves.  Mr.Mueller is known for his service to America and for his integrity. He is a straight arrow. He is a Only a few weeks ago, these same hard-right commentators and pundits were praising Mr.They were lauding his qualities. Even Attorney General Jeff Sessions has unequivocally praised Mr.Mueller in the past for his service and credibility. Sessions said, Mueller's ``integrity is undoubted . . . his experience and love of country is undoubted.''  To these hard-right commentators who are attacking this honorable man who is trying to do a job for our country and see that the rule of law is obeyed, read what Attorney General Sessions has said.  Now, because Director Comey's testimony has made President Trump's actions less and less defendable, these hard-right commentators have turned tail. They have started an ad hominem, nasty assault on a career public servant and a very fine man.  A close associate of the President, Mr.Christopher Ruddy, has even insinuated that the President might fire Special Counsel I can't think of a worse move for the President at this time. I would have him look back in history and see what happened to a President who tried to do the same thing.  I have one question. What are these people who are attacking Mueller afraid of? Are they afraid of what Mr.Mueller is going to find? Is the White House afraid of what Mr.Mueller is going to uncover?  It seems pretty obvious that if they were not worried, they would let Mueller proceed because they would be confident he would find nothing. I find no other legitimate reason why the critics would flip so quickly to attack a man of integrity unless they were worried about what he might find. Again, if the White House truly has nothing to hide, they ought to encourage Special Counsel Mueller to investigate. They should let him do his job.  When people say ``where there is smoke, there is fire,'' they are pointing to actions like this, and it makes the American people distrustful of the White House and their allies.  I know these attacks probably don't bother Mr.He has a very strong spine, and he will go after the facts regardless of the noise around him, but they are bothersome, they are wrong, and they are nasty.  One of the most important things in our democracy is a bedrock faith in the rule of law; that no person is above the rule of law. The President's allies are going to attack every single law enforcement agent involved in the Russia investigation. If the White House ever joins in those attacks, it will greatly erode the American people's faith in the rule of law and do significant damage to our democracy at a time when it seems somewhat more fragile than it has in the past. This is not a game. This is not fun.  This is a very serious investigation that is headed by one of the most trusted men in It is about foreign interference in our elections, something that eats at--that corrodes the very roots of our democracy, the very wellspring of our being, and pride as a nation. I would urge that these attacks on Mr.Mueller be ceased and that my friends on the other side join me in defending his reputation. They have gone a little too far.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-13-pt1-PgS3415.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,13.0,May
14827,topic-id,834,"On taxes, Mr.President, yesterday, Secretary Mnuchin, in an appearance at the Milken Institute Conference, admitted that the administration plans to go it alone on taxes. He said they are trying to design their proposal to fit into the rules of reconciliation so they need only Republican votes to pass their tax cut.  The message was clear as day. The President is not interested in working with Democrats to craft a proposal that both parties can support. He is just going to pass his plan with Republican votes or not pass it at all. What that means is that the Trump tax plan likely will not have to change much from the 200-word outline that they put out last week, and that means the Trump tax plan will benefit the incredibly wealthy and the special interests while leaving the middle-class, working Americans with crumbs, at best.  We Democrats support tax relief, so long as it is aimed at the middle class and those struggling to get there. Those are the folks who really need the help. College is getting ever more expensive. Take-home pay is being squeezed in so many different directions. The middle class and those working to get there should be able to keep more of what they make, but the Trump tax plan seems designed to benefit his Cabinet and the incredibly wealthy on Wall Street, not Main Street and the middle class.  There are many wealthy people doing very well in God bless them. Their lifestyles are getting better every year. Their incomes are getting better every day. They don't need the help, but the middle class does. But in the Trump plan, taxes on the very wealthy and big corporations would go down, while tax deductions that benefit the middle class would go away. For example, President Trump campaigned on getting rid of the carried interest loophole. Instead, his plan keeps the carried interest loophole and creates an even bigger loophole for the wealthiest by allowing the so-called passthrough entities, which include wealthy businessmen like President Trump, to pay just 15 percent. So with this 15-percent passthrough, hedge fund managers, corporate lawyers, and big business CEOs who make millions of dollars every year would pay 15 percent, while their workers will pay 20, 25, 30 percent.  To add insult to injury, the Trump tax plan would repeal the estate tax, a tax on estates only of over $10 million--very wealthy people. How many of us have a $10 million estate? And it would result in the 5,200 wealthiest families in America each year--or estates in America--receiving an average $3 million windfall. While the Trump plan eliminates taxes for the very wealthy, it also eliminates tax breaks that are most beneficial to the middle class, like the State and local deduction. The loss of this deduction for those who use it would cost New Yorkers an average of $4,500 a year.  The middle class has seen rising expenses and virtually stagnant incomes. They need tax relief, not the loss of key tax deductions that helped put a few more dollars in their pockets. And the biggest danger for the middle class might be what happens after the Trump tax plan gets passed, if that happens.  A tax cut for the wealthy of the size President Trump is proposing would explode the deficit, costing between $5.5 trillion and $7 trillion over 10 years, by some estimates. The Republicans might be willing to ignore the debt and deficit now in order to get their tax cut. But make no mistake about it, a few years down the line, they will start howling about the deficit again and say: Oh, we have no choice but to cut Social Security and Medicare to make up for the massive debt they created with their tax cut. This has been the nefarious goal of the hard right for decades.  In fact, the same story played out during the Bush years. President Bush passed a big tax break, primarily for the wealthy. It racked up debt, and then he pursued deep cuts to the social safety net to try to balance the ledger. He might have gotten it, but Democrats stood in his way. This could be deja vu all over again.  In sum, the very wealthy get a huge tax break while the middle class gets very little. And down the road, programs like Social Security and Medicare--so crucial to the middle class--would be endangered.  If this administration wants to pursue such a plan all on their own, that is their choice, but as we saw with healthcare, the go-it-alone approach doesn't guarantee success. What it does guarantee is a very partisan bill that will benefit the very wealthy and the special interests--a bill that I predict will be very, very unpopular with the American people.

Well, now we are back in session, and unfortunately my friends on the other side of the aisle don't seem to be any closer to having a bill. If they do have one, they are hiding it and going down the same path as House Republicans--drafting a bill that will impact tens of millions in secret, no transparency, no committee hearings, no debate.  Even with all this secrecy, more and more Republicans seem increasingly pessimistic about finding a Republican-only bill that can get 50 votes in the Over the weekend, the senior Republican Senator from North Carolina, Mr.Burr, said: ``I don't see a comprehensive health-care plan this year.''  Just yesterday, Senator Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, said the Republicans may rush a healthcare bill to the floor before they know if it has the support of their caucus.  Well, my friends on the other side of the aisle are learning how difficult it is to refigure our healthcare system under a process with only votes from one party--the so-called reconciliation process--and do it in a way that actually improves our healthcare, not devastate it, as the House bill would.  I hope my Republican friends will realize the only way we will get votes necessary to pass a healthcare bill is to drop repeal and work with Democrats to improve our healthcare system, not to sabotage it. We stand ready and willing to work with our Republican colleagues to further stabilize the insurance markets, build on the progress we have made in healthcare. In fact, we are running out of time before the 2018 rates are locked in.  Most insurance companies are saying they are raising rates because of the uncertainty Republicans continue to inject into the market. The President has not come out permanently for cost-sharing, which would reduce premiums and keep people in the market. They just sort of do it one at a time, and that is going to make the markets worse.

They passed the bill without holding a single hearing, listening to any experts, or, most importantly, waiting for a score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  The Congressional Budget Office tells us what the bill will cost, how many people it will help, how many people it would hurt, something that, with healthcare, would have been vitally important.  But while the lack of a score didn't prohibit them from holding a vote, it did, apparently, prevent the majority from sending the bill over to the Mr.Speaker, this process is completely backwards and a major breakdown of the integrity of the legislative process.  Most schoolchildren know that, when a bill passes the House, you send it to the You don't hide it in a drawer for weeks until you finally get the information from the Congressional Budget Office that you should have had before you brought the bill to the floor for a vote.  This is no way to develop a plan that will impact one-sixth of the Nation's gross domestic product, and the process has finally laid bare one of the biggest political hoaxes in recent memory: that notion of repeal and replace. How often did we hear that over the last 7 years?  For the last 7 years, the majority voted more than 60 times to undermine the Affordable Care Act without having a thing in the world to replace it with, and now they are pushing the false notion that the Affordable Care Act is collapsing. The reality is that some States dealing with limited insurers never implemented the full benefits of the law or enacted the exchange under the Affordable Care Act, which would have cut their costs.  Mr.Speaker, one of my proudest moments as a Member of Congress was chairing the House Rules Committee and bringing the Affordable Care Act to the House floor. Almost every President since Theodore Roosevelt had attempted to give healthcare to the American people. Millions of people are now waking up to the benefits of this healthcare, and our Nation's uninsured rate is at its lowest level in more than 50 years. Why would you rip that away?  For the first time in a generation, we are actually slowing the yearly growth of healthcare costs. A poll released just this last month found that 61 percent of the public supports keeping and improving the Affordable Care That is in stark contrast to the 17 percent approval rating for the repeal bill that was voted on here several weeks ago.  Mr.Speaker, I wish the majority would stop turning a deaf ear to the people it represents. The American people have been marching and calling and writing against this bill in numbers none of us have ever seen before. A bad process led to a bad product.  Mr.Speaker, none of us believe that the ACA was perfect. I urge the majority to take the bill out of the drawer and shred it. Let's get together, strengthen our healthcare system and the Affordable Care It is exactly what our constituents deserve.  I reserve the balance of my time.

Expanding paid sick leave to the 45 percent of American workers who don't have access to it would be a great start.  Each week, up to 3 million employees go to work sick, infecting their coworkers and customers and delaying their own recovery. The benefits of allowing working Americans to earn paid sick leave are undeniable. It slows the spread of disease, lowers healthcare costs, and increases productivity.  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would allow us to also bring up Representative DeLauro's bill, H.1516, which would allow Americans to have paid sick time.

It will gut essential health benefits, kick millions of people off of health insurance, and place a crushing age tax on those aged 50 to 64 whose premiums will go up.

14870,topic-id,1896,"Mr.President, after some chaotic weeks of hush-hush deliberating, a lot of arm-twisting, and more than a few obvious buy-offs, the House has handed the Senate a healthcare bill that will plunge tens of millions of Americans into suffering. With it, the debate now comes to this side of the Capitol, and my Republican colleagues seem to be competing to find out who can put the most distance between themselves and the House bill.  The message is that they are starting from scratch with a partisan working group and a new bill under construction. But I want to make sure that everybody is realistic about where this debate stands. There is not a shred of actual hard evidence that the Senate Republican conference is objecting to nearly $1 trillion in tax breaks for the wealthy and the special interests, paid for by slashing middle-class tax benefits and cutting more than $800 billion out of The dates, the numbers, and the waivers might look a little different when Senate Republicans write a bill, but the underlying framework will be the same.  This process, in short, is leading America back to the days when healthcare worked only for the healthy and wealthy. It is clear, when we look at the particulars, that the bill passed by the other body doesn't care whether you are young or old. It poses a threat of pain across all generations.  So this afternoon, as I begin what will be a series of discussions here on the floor in the days ahead to discuss these issues, I want to talk about what we are dealing with now.  Under the House bill, the youngster who needs special education services could see that set of opportunities disappear with cuts to Medicaid, a key source of funding for special ed school programs.  Are the tax breaks in this bill for the wealthy worth depriving kids of the opportunities they need to get ahead in life?  Under this bill, the young adult at 18 or 20 who has been through a cancer scare could wear that preexisting condition like a scarlet letter. They could face discrimination by insurance companies for life if their coverage ever lapses for more than a few weeks.  Are the tax breaks in this bill worth exposing Americans with preexisting conditions to this danger?  The 45-year-old who thought she was home free with an employer-sponsored plan that avoids the worst insurance company abuses could once again face a lifetime limit on certain health coverage. They would be at risk for personal bankruptcy if they suffer the wrong kind of injury or come down with the wrong kind of illness.  Are the tax breaks in this bill worth putting insurance companies back in the driver's seat? The 60-year-old, still years from retirement, would get clobbered by what I call the age tax, charged up to five times as much as a young person for insurance coverage. Are the tax breaks in this bill worth reviving insurance company abuses like this?  Not even the most vulnerable seniors are spared under this bill. Medicaid helps cover the tab for nearly two out of three seniors in nursing homes. They are people who have done everything right. They worked hard, they scrimped, and they saved. They raised their kids and put them through school. You see them in Ohio communities, and you see them in Oregon communities. But colleagues, growing older in America is not cheap, and these are people who spend down their savings, and that is when Medicaid steps in. But if Medicaid funding is slashed, the nursing home benefit and other critical long-term care services like home-based care are going to be in danger.  Every one of us wants their loved ones to be cared for. But the fact is most families are already walking an economic tightrope in this country, balancing their mortgage and their gas bills and struggling to save for college and retirement. Where would working mothers and fathers today possibly find the money to pay for nursing home care for their elderly parents, perhaps $90,000 or more? Are the tax breaks in this bill worth putting seniors' nursing home care at risk?  I spent this weekend holding townhall meetings in Oregon, holding healthcare roundtables at home in It would be hard to overstate the fear and the tears I heard in conversations about this legislation.  Oregonians recognize that in many ways, this proposal is a return to an era when insurance companies had more power and the typical American had less, when women were penalized simply because of their gender, when for many a preexisting condition was a death sentence, when insurance companies deciding what preexisting conditions they would cover constituted a real death panel. Even worse, the system would invite young and healthy people not to buy insurance unless they needed it at that particular moment, which would drive up costs for everybody else.  Bottom line: You cannot revive a failed, abusive health insurance system and expect Americans to be very pleased and excited about it, especially when it is part of a scheme to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy. That is what my Republican colleagues are attempting. I understand why they are doing it. What they want to do is, in effect, get these tax breaks for the wealthy in a health bill so they can have it teed up to get more tax breaks for the wealthy in a tax bill. That is what this is really all about. Even casual watchers of the debate understand that this bill--the tax cuts, in particular, are stacked in favor of the fortunate few.  Every time you get a paycheck in North Dakota or Oregon or anywhere in America, a little bit for Medicare is taken out of that paycheck. Working people can see it; it is right there on their paychecks. A little bit is taken out. Under this bill, the only people who get a break on that contribution are at the very top of the income scale.  Furthermore, the tax break on investment income will be swallowed up by the wealthy almost in its entirety. People with incomes over $1 million will get an average break of more than $50,000--almost as much as a typical family earns in an entire year. Most of that tax break goes not to just the millionaires but to those at the uppermost slice of the income scale. They are the fortunate individuals who make money from wealth, not from wages like most  The 120,000 wealthiest families in the United States--those who bring in around $2 million a year, mostly from capital gains, interest, and dividends--would get an average tax handout under the House bill of $207,000. This is according to the Tax Policy Center, a well-respected group who analyzes these matters. I can tell you, even conservative health policy experts are looking at this bill and scratching their heads, trying to determine how this constitutes an improvement over the system that is on the books today.  Aside from the wealthy individuals and corporations lining up for these tax handouts, it is hard to see who will be helped by this approach Republicans have taken.  It is a worrying sign for anybody who believes in bipartisanship to see that Republicans in this body have decided they don't want any Democratic input. I have been involved in writing bipartisan health bills in the past, and there are more than a few cosponsors of those bills in the Republican conference today. A number of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have joined me in efforts, for example, to have loophole-free, air-tight protection against discrimination against those with a preexisting condition.  It is important to understand that a lot of us on this side of the aisle--and my colleague, the President of the Senate, knows it from our work on infrastructure--would very much like to work with colleagues on the other side on bipartisan issues. It can be done. In fact, just today, under the leadership of Senator Schumer, our whole caucus said to the Republicans: Drop reconciliation so we can all come together and[[Page S2833]]get serious about working in a bipartisan way on an issue that ought to be tackled in a bipartisan way for the American people and that I have a long history, in particular, of wanting to be part of.  For the next several weeks, I will be on the floor drawing on our past experiences and underlining why the partisan approach underway right now is wrong.  People ought to know that TrumpCare is a betrayal of the promises they have heard time and time again. They heard it through hundreds of TV commercials all through the election period, and what they are now seeing is a betrayal of those promises they watched on campaign advertisements over the last year.  People ought to know that this is not a real effort at fixing our healthcare system. This is a masquerade. It is a masquerade to try to pretend that what is going on is about healthcare when it really is about making sure taxes can be cut for the most fortunate, while healthcare benefits for the middle class are slashed. TrumpCare is the opposite of good health policy. There is no grassroots campaign I know of clamoring for the Congress to pass another round of the same old handouts to special interests, donors, and powerful individuals.  The American people are counting on the Congress to improve the health system and make their care more affordable. Congress ought to be working together on injecting more competition into the insurance markets and reducing out-of-pocket costs for families. We ought to be working especially on bringing down prescription drug prices. In my view, you can't really build a modern health system unless you address the challenges posed by chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's.  We want it understood that Democrats want to work in a bipartisan way to improve the Affordable Care That is the heart of the letter that all Senate Democrats signed today--we all went together--making it clear that we would like to see Republicans drop reconciliation and come together so we can find common ground. That would be in the country's interests, rather than using this go-it-alone process that is called reconciliation but specifically rejects bipartisanship.  I am going to be on the floor a lot over the next several weeks. I promised my constituents night and day over the course of last weekend--and people kept saying night and day, day and night--because the country feels that strongly about this.  I and others are going to hold our colleagues on the other side of the aisle accountable because we all ought to agree that this country cannot go back to the days when healthcare was for the healthy and the wealthy. Those preexisting conditions could be a death sentence. And that is because if you were healthy, you had no problem. If you were wealthy, you could write out the checks. But if you had a preexisting condition, you were in very serious straits. People told us about losing their homes and everything they had. We are not going back to the days in America when healthcare was for the healthy and wealthy.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Situated at the gateway of the Long Island Sound, I personally had the pleasure of visiting this treasured island.  In addition to being a critical resource for research, approximately 90 percent of the land on Plum Island has been sheltered from development, offering Long Island a diverse wildlife and ecosystem and critical habitat for migratory birds, marine mammals, and rare plants.  Plum Island is also an essential cultural and historical resource as well, with recorded history dating back to the 1700s.  The island held the U.military's Fort Terry, a coastal defense fortification, which was used through the end of World War  Since then, Plum Island has been utilized as a research laboratory and has since grown to become what is known today as the Plum Island Animal Disease  In 2005, the Department of Homeland Security, which currently has jurisdiction over the island, announced that the Animal Disease Center research would be moved to a new Federal facility, the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, NBAF, in  To offset the cost of this relocation, a law was enacted that called for the private sale of Plum Island by the Federal Government to the highest bidder.  However, because of the costs associated with the cleanup and closure of Plum Island, and because of local zoning restrictions, the Federal Government would receive little compensation for the sale of Plum  Also, in the 12 years since the move to Kansas was approved, the new facility in Kansas is already fully paid for by a combination of Federal appropriations and State and private funds.  Allowing for continued research, public access, and permanent preservation of the island, H.2182 will suspend the laws passed in 2008 and 2011 that mandated the public sale of Plum  This bill will commission the Government Accountability Office, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security, which currently owns the island, to formulate a comprehensive plan for the future of the island.  It requires the plan focus on conservation, education, and research and include alternative uses for the island, including a transfer of ownership to another Federal agency, the State or[[Page H6241]]local government, a nonprofit, or a combination thereof.
