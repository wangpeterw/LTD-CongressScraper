           By Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina:
       H.R. 367.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       With this Resolution, Congress is defending the 2nd 
     Amendment prerogative to keep and bear arms. The legislation 
     protects the hearing of those who choose to pursue their 
     rights under the 2nd Amendment without undue government 
     burden. Also, Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 gives Congress 
     the right to lay and collect taxes.
