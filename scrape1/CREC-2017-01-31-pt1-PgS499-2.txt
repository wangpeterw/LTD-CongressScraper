                                 PRAYER

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today's opening prayer will be offered by 
Rabbi Barry Block, leader of the Congregation B'nai Israel in Little 
Rock, AR.
  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:
  Divine Source of Blessing, we come before You today to ask Your 
blessings on the United States Senate and on the 100 men and women who 
serve our Nation here. Like King Solomon before them, let these 
Senators lead our Nation with wisdom, with Your Word and our Nation's 
Constitution constantly guiding them to pursue liberty and justice, 
opportunity and equality, for every man, woman, and child within our 
borders, for those who would peacefully seek refuge on our shores, and 
for each of Your children on Earth. Make them ever mindful of Your 
command to remember the heart of the stranger--the people most unlike 
them and the least powerful of voices--for we were all strangers in one 
Egypt or another. In this age of division, unite these Senators, for 
only when working together across party lines do they truly represent 
all Americans.
  Temper the majority's resolve with humility. Let the minority 
manifest an opposition that is as loyal as it is robust. Let all come 
together to ask Your choicest blessings on the United States of 
America.
  And let us say, Amen.
