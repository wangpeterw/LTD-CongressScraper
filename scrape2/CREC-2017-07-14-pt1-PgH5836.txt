                          HEALTHCARE TOWNHALLS

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, 118,000--the number of people in my district 
alone who will lose healthcare if TrumpCare passes.
  250--the number of people who joined me for a healthcare townhall on 
Monday in Charlotte.
  Zero--the number of public hearings the Senate has held on TrumpCare.
  Despite the potential for 22 million people who will lose their 
healthcare if TrumpCare passes, Senator McConnell hasn't asked to hear 
from any of them.
  On Monday, I held a townhall where my constituents shared their 
stories and asked that I share them with you.
  Katie Mpelkas, a mother of a 3-year-old with autism, relies on 
Medicaid for her son's healthcare. She is terrified at the thought that 
without Medicaid coverage her son won't get the care he needs.
  Adrienne Gonzalez's son, diagnosed with autism at age 2, has been 
receiving care paid for by Medicaid since he was 11 months old.
  Sadly, their stories aren't unique. Thirty-nine percent of children 
are on Medicaid for the care they need, and TrumpCare cuts the program 
by 35 percent by 2036.
  Our constituents are begging for help. It is our responsibility to 
fight for them.
