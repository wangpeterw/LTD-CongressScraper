                  HONORING THE LIFE OF DENISE BURDITUS

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Denise 
Burditus.
  Denise was a mother of two and a grandmother of three. She was 
looking forward to the birth of her fourth grandchild. She had recently 
left her job, after 30 years of working at a bank, so she could return 
to school and spend more time with her grandchildren.
  She went to the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas with her 
high school sweetheart and husband of 32 years, Tony Burditus.
  Denise is remembered by her friends and family for being full of 
life, for always being positive, and for her devotion to her family.
  I extend my condolences to Denise Burditus' family and friends. 
Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the 
whole country grieve with you.
