                WELCOMING REVEREND LOUIS M. MURPHY, SR.

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
Crist) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our guest chaplain, 
Reverend Louis M. Murphy, Sr., of my hometown of St. Petersburg, 
Florida.
  Reverend Murphy truly embodies what it means to love your neighbor as 
yourself. In his 18 years as senior pastor at the Mt. Zion Progressive 
Missionary Baptist Church, he has been a dedicated disciple of Christ, 
giving his time, energy, and compassion to lifting up his congregation 
and the larger St. Petersburg community.
  In addition to his duties as pastor of one of the largest churches in 
Pinellas County, Reverend Murphy has been a leader in economic 
revitalization efforts in south St. Petersburg, and in supporting job 
training and outreach programs for at-risk youth.
  A native of Florida, truly a man of God, and a man of the people. I 
personally thank Reverend Murphy for coming to the people's House and 
providing such a moving, thoughtful invocation. God bless you.
