             EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the eighth 
anniversary of the Affordable Care Act.
  Since it was signed into law, Americans have relied on the ACA for 
access to quality, affordable healthcare; but Republicans have attacked 
Americans' healthcare at every turn.
  Last year, Republicans tried to pass TrumpCare, a bill that would 
have imposed a crippling age tax, raised out-of-pocket costs, and 
increased the number of uninsured Americans by 23 million.
  After the American people stopped TrumpCare in its tracks, 
Republicans went after the Affordable Care Act again in their tax scam. 
On top of that, the administration waged a persistent campaign to 
discourage people from enrolling in the ACA plans.
  Despite GOP sabotage, Americans still signed up for the Affordable 
Care Act. Americans want better, more affordable healthcare, and that 
is what Democrats offer: A Better Deal for better healthcare.
