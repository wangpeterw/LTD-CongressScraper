         THERE IS NO DOUBT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TAX REFORM

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that the American people 
need and want real tax reform, but rather than passing a strong, 
inclusive bipartisan bill focused on helping hardworking middle class 
families, today Republicans passed a bill filled with massive corporate 
giveaways and loopholes for the ultrawealthy.
  For example, the top 1 percent in our country will receive over 82 
percent of the entire tax benefit in the bill they passed today.
  As long as Congress continues to pass legislation for partisan 
political reasons that seriously serve special corporate interests 
instead of the families that are struggling just to get by every day, 
where lobbyists have more input in the writing of this legislation than 
many Members of Congress, the American people lose.

  Mr. Speaker, I oppose this legislation today. It is a disappointment 
and a huge lost opportunity to actually help so many struggling 
families all across the country.
