                 NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH FUNDING

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, recently I met with leaders of 
the San Diego medical research community who had a unified message: We 
need to end the cuts in research that have slowed medical innovation 
for the last decade.
  This year I was proud to lead the bipartisan effort, along with over 
200 of my colleagues, to push for an additional $2 billion in funding 
for the National Institutes of Health.
  This is a very personal issue. Almost all of us know someone who is 
struggling with a disease where NIH funding is used to find a cure. 
That person could be a mother, father, family friend, or even more 
heart-wrenching, a child.
  I am thrilled that the spending bill before us this week avoids the 
cuts proposed by President Trump and actually increases NIH funding by 
$2 billion. We have seen what can happen when leadership takes a 
bipartisan approach: top priorities like medical research actually get 
funded.

  This isn't the bill that I would have written, but it is a compromise 
that I am very happy to vote for. Let's hope that Speaker Ryan has 
learned from this experience and will work with us on health care, on 
transportation, and other priorities moving forward.
