                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2199

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the 
desk due for a second reading.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by 
title for the second time.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 2199) to authorize appropriations for border 
     infrastructure construction, to provide conditional resident 
     status to certain aliens, and to amend the Immigration and 
     Nationality Act to include grounds of inadmissibility and 
     deportability for alien members of criminal gangs and 
     cartels, and for other purposes.

  Mr. McCONNELL. In order to place the bill on the calendar under the 
provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the 
bill will be placed on the calendar.

                          ____________________
