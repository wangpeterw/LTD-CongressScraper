 AMERICANS' TAX DOLLARS SHOULD NEVER BE USED TO END THE LIFE OF A CHILD

  (Mr. MOOLENAAR asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, today, the House voted to end taxpayer 
support for abortion.
  A majority of Americans believe abortion is wrong, and they do not 
wish to see their tax dollars pay for this gruesome procedure that ends 
the life of another human being. This legislation permanently puts into 
law a longstanding policy that has been renewed by Congress every year. 
It will reassure Americans that the hard-earned money they pay to the 
government will never be used to fund abortions.
  This is necessary because the Affordable Care Act, a law that has 
been unaffordable for so many Americans, actually paid subsidies for 
healthcare plans that include abortion. This is unacceptable. A child 
in a mother's womb is a blessing. Americans expect their tax dollars 
will never be used to pay to end the life of an innocent child.
  Today's legislation will protect taxpayers and, most importantly, our 
society's most vulnerable--the unborn.
