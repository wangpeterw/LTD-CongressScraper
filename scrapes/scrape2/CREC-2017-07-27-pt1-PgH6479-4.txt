           REPEAL INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS' CLASSIFICATION

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, during my ``Freedom Fridays'' series, each 
week I highlight burdensome regulations that limit American freedom. 
This week, my focus is on the Obama administration's net neutrality 
policy.
  The internet is one of the greatest innovations ever. This has 
largely been possible because of the Federal Government's regulatory 
absence from the industry. Yet the Obama administration, in one of many 
cases of overregulation, took a radical step to inappropriately insert 
government interference.
  In 2015, the FCC adopted a rule to reclassify internet service 
providers as ``common carriers'' under title II of the Communications 
Act of 1934. This reclassification caused undue burdens for American 
ISPs and consumers.
  The Trump administration has been supportive of rolling back the 
Obama-era regulation. Now Congress needs to limit the authority of 
Federal bureaucrats and preserve a free and open internet. We should 
repeal the 2015 rule and prevent the FCC from issuing a similar rule.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in restoring 
internet freedom.
