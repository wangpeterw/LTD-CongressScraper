                   HONORING THE LIFE OF LESLIE SPAETH

  (Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a beloved Warren 
County, Ohio, icon, Leslie Spaeth, who passed away recently at the age 
of 92.
  Mr. Spaeth was a dedicated husband and father and grandfather and 
great-grandfather. What made him so special was his dedication, not 
only to his family, but also to his community and to his country.
  Leslie Spaeth first served his Nation as a corporal during World War 
II.
  Throughout his life, he continued to serve our community as a 
volunteer firefighter, as president of the Mason Council, as Warren 
County Auditor, as a member of the Warren County Board of Elections, 
and, finally, as the Warren County chairman of the Republican Party.
  In his personal time, he bettered the lives of those around him, 
volunteering

with the American Legion's Buckeye Boys State program and as an elder 
at his church.
  Mr. Speaker, Leslie Spaeth was a patriot and a family man, and it has 
been my honor to represent him in Congress since Warren County came 
into my congressional district. I wish his family my sincere 
condolences as we say good-bye to one of our finest.
