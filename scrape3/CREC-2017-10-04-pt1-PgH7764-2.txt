 PROTECT WOMEN'S HEALTH AND SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO CHOOSE

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, 3 days after Congress allowed the 
Children's Health Insurance Program to expire, this House once again 
passed a bill that restricts women's health and reproductive rights.
  This should not be the time to prioritize politics. Women should be 
able to make their own choices about their bodies and their healthcare.
  Over the past 40 years, the Supreme Court has affirmed a woman's 
constitutional right to privacy, including the right to choose.
  Not only is the 20-week ban imposed by this Congress not based on 
accepted science, but this ban disregards the role doctors play in 
making health decisions.
  In States that have already passed this ban, young people, women of 
color, low-income women, and immigrant women are the ones who are most 
impacted by the ban.
  If we care about women's health, we should work to reduce unintended 
pregnancies, expand access to contraception, and support maternal and 
children's health. Instead, the majority is slashing Medicaid, 
attacking Planned Parenthood, and passing bans.
  Not me. I will remain committed to protecting women's health and 
supporting the constitutional right to choose.
