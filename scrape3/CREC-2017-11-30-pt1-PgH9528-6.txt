  (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the veterans in my 
district and those who support them.
  Earlier this month, I attended a Veterans Esteem Team event in Lapeer 
County. It is a dinner organized and prepared by local junior high and 
high school students from North Branch, Almont, and Dryden to honor 
area veterans. Those who served our Nation are the best 1 percent this 
country produces.

men and women of our military who have enabled our Nation to continue 
to be safe and prosperous. I am honored to serve with them and the 
students in my district who took the time to recognize and organize the 
veterans at this event.
