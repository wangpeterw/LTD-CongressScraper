                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, thank You for this 
opportunity to boldly approach Your throne of grace, finding help 
during life's challenging seasons. It is at Your throne that we obtain 
mercy to sustain us through life's hardships.
  Lord, we build these moments of silent anticipation into our day, 
aware of our need of You. Be for our lawmakers their shelter in the 
time of storm. Prepare them to meet whatever difficulties that may lurk 
in life's shadows as they seek to cultivate an experiential 
relationship with You. Lord, give them the wisdom to persevere through 
tough times and never give up.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
