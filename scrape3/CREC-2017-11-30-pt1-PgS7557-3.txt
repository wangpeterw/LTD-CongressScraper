                         TRIBUTE TO LUCY KELLY

  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of my 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee law clerk Lucy Kelly. 
Lucy hails from Seattle, WA, and is a second-year law student at 
American University.
  While clerking for the Commerce Committee, Lucy assisted the 
Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and 
Data Security. She is a dedicated worker who was committed to getting 
the most out of her clerkship. I extend my sincere thanks and 
appreciation to Lucy for all of the fine work she did for the committee 
and wish her continued success in the years to come.
