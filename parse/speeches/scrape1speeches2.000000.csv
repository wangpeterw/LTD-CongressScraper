11927,topic-id,1292,"Mr.President, President Trump's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a member of the U.Supreme Court is being considered this week in the Senate Judiciary Soon, the nomination is likely to move to the floor for debate.  Some have suggested that instead of allowing a majority of Senators to decide whether to approve the nomination of Judge Gorsuch, there should be first a cloture vote to determine whether to cut off debate. Cutting off debate requires the approval of 60 Senators, so if 41 of the 46 Democratic Senators vote not to cut off debate, there would never be an up-or-down majority vote to approve Judge In other words, the 41 Democratic Senators would have filibustered to death the Gorsuch nomination.  Filibustering to death the Gorsuch nomination--or any Presidential nomination, for that matter--flies in the face of 230 years of Senate tradition. Throughout the Senate's history, approval of even the most controversial Presidential nominations has required only a majority vote. For example, in 1991 President George H.Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme The debate was bitter. The Senate confirmed Judge Thomas narrowly, 52 to 48. Although the Senate rules allowed any Senator to try to filibuster the nomination to death, none did. In fact, Senate rules have always allowed Senators the option to filibuster to death a Presidential nomination; yet it has almost never happened. According to the former Senate Historian, with one possible exception, which I will mention in a minute, the number of Supreme Court Justices in our country's history who have been denied their seat by filibuster is zero. The number of Cabinet members in our country's history who have been denied their seats by filibuster is zero. The number of Federal district judges in our country's history who have been denied their seats by filibuster is zero. And until 2003, the number of Federal circuit judges in our country's history who have been denied their seats by filibuster was zero.  Senator Everett Dirksen did not filibuster President Lyndon Johnson's Presidential nominations. Senator Robert Byrd did not filibuster President Reagan's nominees. Senator Howard Baker did not filibuster President Carter's nominees. Senator Bob Dole did not filibuster President Clinton's nominees. During most of the 20th century, when one party controlled the White House and the Senate 70 percent of the time, the minority never filibustered to death a single Presidential nominee.  On the other hand, there have been plenty of filibusters on legislation--so many that in 1917, the Senate adopted a cloture rule as a way to end filibusters. The rule was amended in 1949, 1959, 1975, 1979, and 1986--always in response to filibusters on legislation, never on nominations. It was the 1975 change that established the current cloture standard of 60 votes to end debate except on amendments to the standing rules of the  Filibustering a Presidential nomination has always been treated differently than filibustering a legislative matter. The filibuster of legislation is perhaps the Senate's most famous characteristic. It has been called ``democracy's finest show, the right to talk your head off.'' As the actor Jimmy Stewart said in the movie ``Mr.Smith Goes to Washington,'' ``Wild horses aren't going to drag me off this floor until those people have heard everything I've got to say, even if it takes all winter.'' That was Jimmy Stewart in ``Mr.Smith Goes to Washington.''  The late Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia described the importance of the legislative filibuster in a different way. He said in his last speech:       Our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be a continuing      body that allows for open and unlimited debate and the      protection of minority rights. Senators have understood this      since the Senate first convened.  In fact, the whole idea of the Senate is not to have majority rule on legislation. Throughout Senate history, the purpose of the legislative filibuster has been to force consensus on issues, to force there to be a group of Senators on either side who have to respect one another's views so they work together and produce 60 votes on important matters, as we did on the 21st Century Cures bill and as we did on the bill fixing No Child Left  Nominations have always been treated differently from legislation. For example, under rule XIV, any Senator could bring legislation directly to the calendar bypassing committees. There is no such power for nominations. Senate rules allow debate and therefore the possibility of filibuster on a motion to proceed to legislation. Debate is not allowed on a motion to proceed to nominations.  In summary, while Senate rules have always allowed extended debate or filibusters, the filibuster was never used to block a nomination until recently. As I mentioned earlier, it was never used to block a Cabinet nomination, never used to block a Federal district judge, and until 2003, never used to block a circuit judge, and never used to block a Supreme Court Justice in the country's history, with one possible exception. That was in 1968, when President Johnson sought to elevate Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief When it became clear the Senate majority wouldn't agree, Johnson engineered a 45-to-43 cloture vote so forces could save face and appear to have won something. Fortas then asked the President to withdraw the nomination.  Other than the Fortas nomination, the filibuster was never used to block any judicial nomination until 2003 and 2004, when Democrats decided to use the 60-vote cloture requirement to block 10 of President George Bush's nominations. This unprecedented action produced a threat by Republicans to change the Senate rules, to make it clear that only a majority vote is required to approve a Presidential nomination. There was a negotiation and eventually five of Bush's nominations were approved, five were blocked and the rules were not changed. Then, in 2011 and 2013, Republicans returned the favor--as often happens around here--by seeking to block 5 of President Obama's nominees for the circuit court by insisting on a 60-vote cloture for[[Page S1878]]each. Republicans alleged that President Obama was trying to pack the circuit court in the District of Columbia with three liberal judges.  To overcome Republican objections, Democrats invoked the so-called nuclear option. They broke the Senate rules to change the Senate rules. The new rule eliminated the possibility of 60-vote cloture motions for all Presidential nominees except for the Supreme  That is where we stand today. There have been other examples of minority Senators filibustering nominations to death, all of them during the last three administrations and all involving sub-Cabinet nominations. Of course, there have been delays in considering nominations. My own nomination in 1991 as U.Education Secretary was delayed 51 days by Democratic Of course, I thought unnecessarily.  President Reagan's nomination of Ed Meese as Attorney General of the United States was delayed a year by a Democratic No one has ever disputed our right in the Senate, regardless of who is in charge, to use our constitutional duty of advice and consent to delay and examine and sometimes cause nominations to be withdrawn or even to defeat nominees by a majority vote.  As we approach a vote on Judge Gorsuch on the floor of the Senate, it is useful to remember that the tradition of the United States Senate, for 230 years, has been to treat legislative matters and nominations differently. Filibuster to death legislation, yes. Filibuster to death Presidential nominations? Should the Gorsuch nomination come to the floor soon, as I believe it will, overwhelming Senate tradition requires that whether to approve it should be decided by a majority vote of Senators, and there should be no attempt by the minority to filibuster the nomination to death.

In eastern Kentucky, not far from where I live, it is not just a recession that they are experiencing. What is happening in eastern Kentucky is a little depression over the last several years. The stream protection rule would be the final death knell of a proud industry that has literally powered America for over a century.  When I talk to the men and women of eastern Kentucky about the prospects of losing even more jobs in an economically depressed place, it is just absolutely devastating. So I applaud the work of the committee and I applaud the work of this House to take this matter seriously to end this regulation that would put even more of my fellow Kentuckians in economic distress.

11796,topic-id,432,"Mr.Speaker, with respect, I quote Mr.McKinley: ``We have to do this for the people of West Virginia and around the country.'' And I agree, and this is why we need the stream protection rule.  It is a commonsense approach to minimizing the impacts to surface water and groundwater from coal mining.  In Appalachia alone, mountaintop removal has been responsible for the destruction of 2,000 miles of streams. Peer reviewed studies have linked mountaintop removal mining to cancer, birth defects, and serious health problems for residents living near these mining sites.  Just look at my Virginia map. The highest death rates in the State and the most chronic diseases are in the coal fields.                              {time}  1430  I saw this firsthand while I was Lieutenant Governor of Virginia for 8 years, when mountaintop removal mining became the most prevalent coal mining technique in central  That is why this is so important. Communities near coal mining sites have a right to know what is in their water because it impacts their livelihood and their lifespan.  This rule includes commonsense monitoring of streams--many of which are important drinking water sources--for pollutants such as lead, selenium, and manganese. Basic monitoring for these toxins is essential, given their potential impacts on human health and the environment.  The rule also requires that streams and lands disturbed by surface coal mining be restored. This would result in the protection or restoration of approximately 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forest over the next two decades.  This is really important because we know the contamination of streams by coal mining pollution threatens everything from fishing and outdoor recreation to small businesses like restaurants and farms that are relying on clean, safe water. This rule is an appropriate balancing act between our energy needs and our environmental protections, and it is also appropriately flexible to coal mining companies.  Most importantly, the Congressional Review Act doesn't make sense here. If you want to trim a tree, you don't chop it down and bury it under cement so it will never grow again. The Congressional Review Act is an extreme measure that would permanently damage our surface mining laws. We have heard that it was a product of more than 7 years of work and the chairman talks about the 13 hearings, but not one has been held in the 18 months since the rule was proclaimed.

11926,topic-id,827,"Mr.President, later today the Senate will vote on H.69, and I am here to state as strongly and emphatically as possible my opposition to this misguided and unwise measure.  As a Senator who fights to preserve and protect the vast diversity of American wildlife and honor the natural beauty of our Nation's great refuges, I urge my colleagues to reject the effort to revoke a commonsense rule of the U.Fish and Wildlife This rule of the FWS is designed to prevent the use of cruel, unsporting, and inhumane killing methods on Federal land. It is really that simple, and repeal of it is an outrage.  Proponents of H.69 have attempted to frame this debate as an effort by the Federal Government to usurp State power, but that argument is simply absurd. The rule at issue is about Federal management of Federal land, Federal control over land owned by the Federal Government, pure and simple. The rule, which took effect in September, does not restrict subsistence hunting or normal hunting practices. It does not imperil public safety or impede on defense of property. It simply prevents brutal, cruel, barbaric hunting methods that target vulnerable bears, wolves, and coyote from occurring on lands that were intended to provide refuge for these animals. ``Refuge'' is the key word.  This resolution subverts the judgment of professional wildlife managers to adopt sensible wildlife management actions that are based on the best available science. If the U.Fish and Wildlife Service rule is undermined, any State would be permitted to allow egregious killing methods on these wildlife refuges, which is the one category of Federal lands specifically set aside to benefit wildlife. That is its singular purpose.  I will oppose this legislation because I believe in preserving our Nation's natural ecosystem and the constitutional responsibility of the Federal Government to manage Federal lands for all citizens and prevent the inhumane treatment of our Nation's most iconic wildlife.  This rule bans the killing of wolves and their pups at their den sites in springtime when they are most vulnerable. It bans the killing of sleeping black bear mothers and their cubs while they are hibernating in winter--not exactly fair sport and certainly damaging to our environment. The rule also bans the baiting of grizzly bears, which involves the use of toxic, rotting food or grease to lure and acclimate bears to a certain area so that trophy hunters can get a point-blank shot. It prohibits the use of traps such as steel-jawed traps or snares, which cause animals to suffer injury as they fight the trap or even slow and painful death from starvation or exposure. It prohibits using airplanes and helicopters to scout, land, and shoot brown or black bears. These practices are not only cruel and inhumane, they are really unsporting and have no place in a civilized society.  This resolution would foreclose our wildlife managers from making Federal wildlife management decisions. It will undoubtedly affect the future of all American wildlife, including regulating[[Page S1877]]inhumane practices on Alaska national wildlife refuges even though those practices may be recognized as cruel and unsustainable.  All in all, voiding the U.Fish and Wildlife rule would set a dangerous precedent for the management of public lands across the country. Time and time again, our Federal courts have held that the Federal Government has the authority to regulate wildlife on Federal lands and cannot be superseded by initiatives at the State level. This Federal rule explicitly prohibits only these particularly gruesome and egregious methods of hunting or other kinds of practices on national wildlife refuges. It does not apply to hunting in State-owned wilderness or to rural Alaskan practices for residents who hunt for subsistence.  Regardless of my colleagues' claims, there is not a Tenth Amendment issue here, and the case law clearly demonstrates it, from the Supreme Court decision in 1976 that held that ``the Property Clause also gives Congress the power to protect wildlife on public lands, state law notwithstanding''; the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which followed it; and just last year, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, which repeated the Supreme Court's well-established jurisprudence on the supremacy clause and the property clause.  Neither the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act nor the Alaska Statehood Act grants any State official the power to overrule these Federal land managers' decisions.  Putting aside the legal issues--and there are none that really argue in favor of sabotaging this Fish and Wildlife Service rule--it is the right thing to do for us and for our future. This legislation would essentially reject our authority and our responsibility and our obligation to future generations to promote humane wildlife management practices. It is not only a matter of our law but who we are and what kind of society we believe we should have.  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this abhorrent and appalling legislation.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

11928,topic-id,2179,"Mr.President, I rise to join my voice with a growing chorus of citizens, as well as members of the scientific community and colleagues, who are deeply disturbed by this CRA to repeal vital wildlife protections from Federal land in  Before I speak on this CRA, I would like to be clear that I am not someone who believes all regulations are good. In fact, I don't believe we should be trying to regulate our way out of all of our problems. I am proud of the work I have done, with people on both sides of the aisle, in an effort to make our government work smarter and more efficiently for the benefit of my constituents in New Jersey, as well as all Americans, but today I am profoundly disappointed.  Instead of working to create bipartisan policies that will serve all Americans, we are now considering a CRA resolution--unfortunately, one of many ones of this type--that prioritizes special interests above the good of the public, and it is deeply unpopular, in fact, with the public at large.  I oppose this CRA that would repeal the U.Fish and Wildlife's rule called the non-subsistence take of wildlife on national wildlife refuges in Alaska rule. The rule was finalized by the Fish and Wildlife Service in August of 2016, with the clear goal to forever ban unnecessary and extremely cruel methods of killing bears and wolves and other animals on more than 70 million acres of public land managed under our Federal National Wildlife Refuge System in  Let's be clear. When it says the word ``take''--that it prevents the ``take'' of wildlife--that means the killing of wildlife. Specifically, the rule prevents inhumane killing of animals on our wildlife refuges.  Examples of the rule are: prohibits the killing of mother bears and their cubs. It prevents the killing of wolves and pups in their dens. It prohibits using planes to track and kill bears. It prohibits using snares to strangle and kill bears, steel traps to kill bears, and it prohibits baiting and killing of grizzly bears.  Why was this rule issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service in the first place? Our national wildlife refuges are public lands that exist for the benefit of all Refuge lands are managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service for the express purpose of conserving natural diversity in wildlife populations. This means that any management activity that favors certain species over others is inconsistent with the goals of the National Wildlife  It doesn't mean that hunting is not allowed on Federal land. Hunting is one of many permitted practices on wildlife refuges, and this rule does not prevent hunting on any wildlife refuge. What is permitted on refuges under this law is the indiscriminate killing of bears and wolves in an attempt to boost populations of moose and caribou.  Unfortunately, this is exactly how Alaska has been managing its wildlife since 1994 on State and private lands, when it adopted an intensive management strategy for its wildlife that is specifically designed to artificially reduce populations of predators so hunters might have more prey, more animals to kill.  In Alaska, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the State work together to manage wildlife within the National Wildlife Refuge However, when any State's wildlife management approach is in direct conflict with the goals of the refuge system, the Federal Government has the authority--indeed the obligation--to step in and ban certain practices. This is exactly what the Fish and Wildlife did last year when they issued their rule prohibiting this inhumane killing method on 16 Federal national wildlife refuges in  It is important to note that the predator control practices I have described, some of which are currently allowed on certain State and private lands in Alaska, have never been allowed on national wildlife refuges in This rule simply clarifies that these practices--even those explicitly authorized under State regulations in Alaska--are never to be used on Federal wildlife lands in Alaska, regardless of what is decided to be allowed under this State law.  I have heard concerns from my colleagues in Alaska that they believe the Fish and Wildlife Service rule triggers a State sovereignty issue by dictating which practices can and cannot be used on Federal refuge lands in However, I don't believe this rule conflicts with any of Alaska's State sovereignty. The Fish and Wildlife Service has clear statutory and constitutional authority to prohibit wildlife management practices that are incompatible with the objectives of national wildlife refuges in Alaska, as well as other States, including New  I have also heard the concerns of my Alaska colleagues that this rule threatens the many Alaskans who rely on subsistence, hunting of deer, moose, and caribou, to feed themselves and their families. I have sympathy for that concern and believe again that this subsistence hunting is not affected.  We know these predator control practices have never been done on Alaskan refuges before. This argument makes no sense. It is not affecting the subsistence hunting of deer and moose and caribou for them to feed their families. It has never been allowed to go on in the first place. How can these practices be necessary to preserve subsistence hunting when they have never been done before on Federal wildlife refuges? I want to be clear about something. Alaska is free to manage its wildlife on State lands and private lands however Alaska chooses. This point is not up for debate, not up for discussion. It is not the subject of the Fish and Wildlife Services rule in question. The rule only applies to federally owned and federally managed wildlife refuge land, which must be managed for the benefit of the American public, including the requirement to manage for national diversity of wildlife.  As former Fish and Wildlife Director Dan Ashe announced in a press release in August, ``Whenever possible, we prefer to defer to the State of Alaska on regulation of general hunting and trapping of wildlife on national wildlife refuges unless by doing so we are out of compliance with Federal law and policy. This regulation ensures that we comply with our mandates and obligations.''  Let's move beyond talk of mandates and obligations. The hunting practices banned by this rule are flatout inhumane. They are an anathema to the type of thoughtful, humane wildlife management that should be taking place on national wildlife refuges.  In a committee hearing, I asked management experts about this rule last[[Page S1879]]week, and they agree that these practices were not necessary on wildlife refuges. In fact, the U.Fish and Wildlife Service Acting Director Jim Kurth--who was the former manager for many years of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge in Northern Alaska--testified that the service did not find that the practice prohibited by this rule was in any way necessary.  Another witness, Brian Nesvik, Chief Game Warden with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department--again, a Republican-invited witness--testified that Wyoming has a different perspective on utilizing national wildlife refuges in their The practices discussed in this rule, he said, are not used in Wyoming's wildlife refuges, nor did he make an appeal to use these inhumane practices because they are not necessary. Killing a mother bear or mother wolf when she has young cubs virtually guarantees that those cubs will not survive, creating the potential for much broader negative impacts on the overall population.  The baiting of grizzly bears, which involves putting piles of food out to attract bears in unusually high numbers at the start of hunting season, is literally akin to shooting fish in a barrel. Bear baiting often occurs when bears are desperately searching for those extra calories to store energy for hibernation. It is an inhumane practice and is recognized so by many experts.  The use of aircraft hunting--using a plane to track wild animals and then landing to kill them--violates the principle of fair chase in every sense of the word. In fact, killing wolves from aircraft or on the same day that air travel occurred was already prohibited on refuge lands prior to this new rule being issued. The new rule merely extends that same protection to bears.  Finally, the use of snares--these are these choking traps--and steel traps to kill the bear is a practice that is particularly troubling, and I am not alone. A statewide poll of Alaskans themselves shows that nearly 60 percent of Alaskans oppose trapping and snaring bears in their  Charles Darwin called the leghold trap one of the cruelest devices ever invented by man, stating:       Few men could endure to watch for five minutes an animal      struggling in a trap with a torn limb.       Some who reflect upon this subject for the first time will      wonder how such cruelty can have been permitted to continue      in these days of civilisation.  That was Charles Darwin decades and decades ago in 1863. I echo that again today, more than 150 years later. Such cruelty should not be permitted on Federal wildlife refuges of all places, and the Fish and Wildlife Service was absolutely right to permanently protect bears from such cruelty on Alaska's wildlife refuges.  I would like to take a few more moments to talk about the animals that are subject to this rule. Grizzly bears and wolves are the top predators in North Predators in any ecosystem play a critical role in maintaining populations and in preventing problems like we have actually seen in New Jersey by the overgrazing and disease that can occur when deer, moose, and caribou grow in high numbers.  These charismatic animals also attract huge numbers of tourists to national parks, refuges, and other wild lands in the United All across the country, nearly 72 million Americans spend over $50 billion on wildlife watching.  In Alaska, wildlife watchers outnumber hunters by nearly five to one, and they also contribute more than four times as much money to the State's economy as hunting does. Put another way, even considering the issue from an economic perspective, these animals are worth far more alive than they are dead, killed by these savage inhumane practices.  There are few values as deeply entrenched in the American culture as conservation. This legacy is our American heritage, and the coexistence of people, wildlife, and wild lands remains a key objective for our public lands today.  Americans interact with nature in many different ways on public lands, some through consumption uses, like hunting and fishing, and others through more hands-off activities, like camping and wildlife watching. No single use is more important and more valuable than another. So public lands should be managed in a way that minimizes conflict across those different uses while allowing for natural diversity.  The Fish and Wildlife Service rule does just that. Our wildlife refuges are not game parks, and they should not be managed as though they are.  The cruel practices this rule prohibits--killing mother animals and their babies and the trapping, snaring, baiting, and aerial hunting of bears--are practices that I believe do not align with who we are as a country. They are practices that have no place on our national wildlife refuges in Alaska or any other  I want to close with something that my friend Senator Heinrich already mentioned. Many people know that Teddy Roosevelt was an avid hunter, a naturalist, a wildlife enthusiast. When he was President, Roosevelt went on a bear hunting trip in Roosevelt's hunting party cornered a Louisiana black bear. They tied it to a willow tree and suggested the President shoot it.  Viewing this as an extremely unsportsmanlike way to kill a bear, Roosevelt refused to do it. A political cartoonist heard the story and drew a cartoon that celebrated President Roosevelt's decision. A Brooklyn candy shop owner saw the cartoon and decided to create a stuffed toy bear and dedicated it to the President, who refused to engage in this kind of inhumane hunting of a bear. He called it a ``Teddy bear'' or ``Teddy's bear,'' and little children for generations have been loving them ever since.  Teddy Roosevelt knew that using certain methods to kill animals was immoral and wrong. We know this too.  With all of the issues going on right now--from healthcare to tax and all of the issues and urgencies, such as infrastructure--why are we about to consider a CRA that would literally, on our Federal lands, allow the cruelest types of killing to go on of bears and wolves and their pups in dens.  Why, with all that is going on, would we, as Americans, violate our culture and history by allowing the most inhumane, cruel killing practices to go on? Why, with all that we have to do, are we going to allow this to happen?  Well, I will not support it, and I stand against it. Our national wildlife refuges--our refuges for wildlife--have never allowed these cruel practices, and we should not start now.  We should not CRA this rule. I stand strong and firm in honor of our traditions and stand against this  I yield the floor.

Born in 1921, Warren grew up near Alma, AR, and knew the harsh realities that many Americans encountered during the Great He graduated from Alma High School and went on to join the Army during World War During the war, he served as a combat medic with the 67th Evacuation His unit landed at Normandy just days after the Allied forces stormed the beaches on D-day and went on to follow the Allies as they marched through Warren was promoted to first sergeant while serving in Europe, and he received several awards and commendations, including two Bronze Stars, the Superior Unit Award, and the Combat Medical  I am so thankful for his service alongside so many others in the ``greatest generation'' as they risked their lives in the defense of freedom.  Even after he left the service, Warren spent the rest of his life giving back to his community and advocating for causes he believed in.  After returning home from the war, he attended the University of Arkansas and earned a bachelor's degree in business. In his professional life, he was vice president and general manager of the Derrel Thomas Company in Van Buren, Still, Warren found time to participate in numerous civic organizations within the community. He was an active member of the Alma United Methodist Church for decades and served on the Methodist Health and Rehabilitation Board for 41 years. Additionally, Warren served on various other boards and organizations and was a pillar in the community. Perhaps most notably, he was a member of the Rotary Club--first in Van Buren and then in Fort Smith--for 54 years and maintained perfect attendance. This is just one example of Warren's dedication to serving and giving back to  While Warren never sought recognition for the work he did on behalf of his community, his contributions were noticed and recognized by the city of Alma, as well as on the regional and State levels. He was inducted into the Arkansas Senior Hall of Fame in 2013. In 2015, I had the honor of participating in the ceremony where Warren was inducted into the Arkansas Military Hall of Fame on the basis of his honorable military service and exceptional State and community service. This was yet another reminder of how loved and valued Warren was by so many people whose lives he touched.  As active as he was, Warren always enjoyed spending time on his ranch tending to his livestock. In fact, he was also a talented auctioneer who would lend his skills to various charitable auctions and events.  A devoted follower of Christ, a wonderful father and family man, a respected humanitarian, and a rock within his community, Warren will be greatly missed by many. We wish his family, friends, and loved ones comfort as we all mourn his loss, but we also take great joy in knowing just how profound an impact Warren had on the lives of so many others. He leaves behind an incredible legacy of love, devotion, and service that will last for many years to come.  I very much appreciate Warren's service and even more his friendship, encouragement, and the amazing example he set. I will miss him and the vital role he played in his community and in He leaves a huge void that will be hard to fill, but I hope all those who witnessed his committed service to his fellow man will join me in resolving to live and love more like Warren as a way to honor him and his legacy.

When cars became popular in the 1920s, the company seized the opportunity and began making large billboard frames.  When its parent company wanted to sell the plant, Mr.Heddles wasn't impressed by any of the potential buyers. He knew how important this plant was to his community. So Mr.Heddles organized a management buyout and eventually became the owner of the company, known today as Tiffin Metal  Under Mr.Heddles' leadership, Tiffin Metal Products continued to demonstrate the kind of adaptability and creativity that enables a company to grow and thrive. Today Tiffin Metal Products remains one of the two main manufacturers of large billboards in the country, while also making custom products and a popular brand of specialty lockers for law enforcement.  Mr.Heddles took pride in his role in American manufacturing and in keeping his company true to its Ohio roots. Over the years, Tiffin Metal Products has provided good jobs to hundreds of people in Tiffin and Seneca County, and those workers have shown the world that Ohioans know how to make things and make them well.  Will Heddles also took pride in his community, giving generously to local service programs and the arts and helping establish the Seneca Industrial and Economic Development Corporation, a private nonprofit organization working to drive positive economic and community development in the area.  He will be missed by his family, church, community, and the men and women who have been a part of Tiffin Metal Products, a great Ohio manufacturing success story.

Around the globe, only polar ice caps contain more freshwater than do these five Great  Lake Erie is one of the biggest lakes in the world. From the boats and barges that moved goods along the Ohio River and the Erie Canal to the ships that leave Lake Erie and export grain and steel to the world, my State of Ohio has a rich history of cultivating this vital natural resource. In Ohio, families and businesses rely on Lake Its waters are critical to farming and to clean energy development and industry and regional economic competitiveness, to fishing and recreation and so much that people do every day in my  From tourism in Catawba and Put-in-Bay, to fishing at Marblehead, to vacations and family reunions at Maumee Bay State Park, Lake Erie benefits our communities and creates jobs in our State, but for more than a half century, keeping our lake healthy has been a constant struggle. Lake Erie is the shallowest of the Great In the Western Basin off the shore of Toledo, it is only 30 feet deep--much shallower in contrast with Lake Superior, which is 600 feet deep on average.  I remember how polluted Lake Erie was when I was growing up. As a child, it was obvious the water shouldn't look quite the way it looked. While improvements have been made, today's problems are different and in many ways more urgent.  Harmful algal blooms are a constant threat. Because the Western Lake Erie Basin near Toledo is the shallowest part of the lake, it is uniquely vulnerable to these blooms, the same way that much of Lake Erie, 60 or 70 or 80 feet deep, is more vulnerable to pollution.  In August 2014, a bloom left 500,000 Ohioans in Lucas County in Northwest Ohio, in the Toledo area, without safe drinking water for nearly 3 days. We know these blooms are caused by excess nutrients in our water. This comes from untreated sewage, it comes from urban runoff, and it comes from farm field runoff. Heavy rains lead to more combined sewage overflows, more nutrient runoff from our fields, and to larger and more harmful algal blooms.  Algal blooms leave our lake looking like this. This may be a beautiful painting in your living room or a striking photograph of something, but this color here is more the regular, natural color of Lake Erie, the dark here in the wake of this boat. This green is the algal blooms, and you can see what this has done to pollute one of the greatest bodies of freshwater in the world. Would you want to fish there? Likely not. Would you take your children out on water that looks like this? Of course not. Does this water look like what you want coming out of your faucet when you turn on the faucet in Toledo or in Lorain, where I lived for 10 years, or in Sandusky or Cleveland or Ashtabula or any city along the Great Lakes?  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, we[[Page S1883]]know that one effect of climate change in the Great Lakes region has been a 37-percent increase in gully washers, or heavy rain events that contribute to blooms. Hotter summers will only make these blooms worse. The effects of algal blooms like that have profound effects on the entire ecosystem.  Protecting our lake is one of the biggest environmental challenges our country faces. We have made progress over the last 8 years, thanks in large part to the Great Lakes Restoration We have continued to clean up Lake Erie and its tributaries, we have increased access to the lake, and we have improved habitats for fish and wildlife in the region.  Because it is shallow, this Great Lake, Lake Erie, only one of five Great Lakes and the Great Lake with actually the least water--almost 50 percent of all the fish in the Great Lakes live in this Great So you can see what these algal blooms do to aquatic life, to our way of life when you have these kinds of algal blooms.  We know that the bipartisan Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is working. As we celebrate Water Week this week, we should recommit ourselves to strengthening this program and building on our success. But in President Trump's budget proposal this week, the administration proposed entirely eliminating this important program that has been so successful--entirely eliminating this program that has been so successful. It is basically a surrender to the algal blooms. It is the administration--our country, if he speaks for our country--surrendering and just saying: Give up; we are not going to make the fight.  We have cleaned up Lake Erie because of the Federal EPA, because of the State EPA, because of the cities and the counties along the lake, places like Toledo, Lorain, Sandusky, Cleveland, and my wife's hometown of We have cleaned it up, but it is a constant struggle because so many people live along this very shallow, very vulnerable to pollution Great That is why we don't give up.  We are not just talking about cutting funding for a program; the administration budget completely cuts this program, completely ends it. Taking an axe to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative will cost Ohio jobs, jeopardize public health, and will put our drinking water at risk and reverse the progress we have made. It is simply something you don't do in a country like ours. It is unacceptable. I will fight like hell to protect the Great Lakes, I will fight like hell to protect Lake Erie, and I will fight like hell to protect the entire lake ecosystem.  The fact is, these five Great Lakes are a natural resource like none other in the world. Here is what is at risk if the administration's budget plan becomes a reality: Forty percent of the funds used to protect the lake from Asian carp would just disappear like that; 1.8 million more pounds of phosphorus would enter the Lake, making algal blooms like this more likely, just like that; and the cleanup of toxic sediment in habitat restorations in some of our most polluted rivers would grind to a halt. Why would they do this? Why would they eliminate this program? Neither party here wants them to do this. Senator Portman stands with me on this. Most of the Republican House Members stand with Democrats like Congresswoman Fudge and Congresswoman Kaptur, who represent much of the area along the Great  There are projects across Ohio that simply couldn't take place without this program. In Ashtabula, a cleanup project has removed sediment containing 25,000 pounds of toxic material, transforming the lower two-thirds of the Ashtabula A $61 million project never would have gotten off the ground without the Great Lakes Restoration Look at the new Lake Erie Bluffs Park in Perry Township--they used $1.6 million from the initiative to leverage other sources of funding to restore and protect this shoreline.  My Ohio colleagues of both parties have made it clear that zeroing out the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is not an option and that they will not stand for it.  It isn't just this initiative on the chopping block; the budget makes deep cuts in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which monitors these algal blooms. Scientists at Ohio State's Stone Lab play a key role in protecting our lake, and the reported NOAA cuts would nearly eliminate the grant funding that supports Stone Lab's mission. I have been at Stone I see the work they do. I see the dedicated dozen or so naturalists, not well-paid--Federal employees or State employees not particularly well paid. They love nature, they love Lake Erie, they love our State, they love its natural beauty, and they love all that it does for us.  When I was young, people wrote off Lake Erie as a dying lake. It was polluted, it smelled bad, and it looked bad. It was a dying lake. Over the past century, people have had a habit of trying to write off my We have proved them wrong time and again.

11911,topic-id,960,"Mr.President, I rise to speak in opposition to the resolution which uses the Congressional Review Act process to overturn a Fish and Wildlife Service resolution prohibiting certain inhumane methods of killing bears and wolves within the 16 national wildlife refuges in Alaska, which cover about 20 percent of the State of  I understand the opponents of the Fish and Wildlife Service rule argue that States' rights issues are at hand, and they are responsible for the management of fish and wildlife in the That is certainly true within the State, but on Federal national wildlife refuge land, the U.Fish and Wildlife Service is in charge--just like at Mount Rainier or Olympic National Park, where the National Park Service is in charge. I am sure there are times when Pierce County or even Seattle would like to make rules related to Mount Rainier, but they are not allowed because it is part of our National Park Similarly, the Fish and Wildlife Service manages our national wildlife refuge system.  The rules in this proposal only apply to those national wildlife refuge lands in They don't cover any other lands in the So this isn't about States' rights. It is about how we can manage these wildlife refuges to the degree that agencies believe are necessary for the preservation of the wildlife.  Managing these national wildlife refuges--the 16 Federal refuges in Alaska--is about ensuring the management policies are consistent with the purpose of the wildlife refuge. It is not about prohibiting hunting. In fact, hunting has been allowed, and will continue to be allowed within these refuges in Alaska, as is the case with most national wildlife refuges throughout the United  As the Senator from New Mexico pointed out earlier, this is about what people want to see when they go to a national wildlife refuge. Do they want to see the inhumane killing of bear cubs in their den or would they like to see the bears and the other fish and wildlife activity that exists in so many of these beautiful areas?  Another argument that has been raised is that this rule will stop Alaskans from hunting for subsistence purposes--Native Alaskans who depend on subsistence hunting. The rule says nothing about this. It does not affect subsistence hunting. This rule is only about prohibiting certain methods of predator control in our wildlife refuges. Some people think this is contrary to responsible wildlife management practices in other But this rule only applies to national wildlife refuges in the State of  The actions that Alaska has authorized on their State lands are so aggressive, that permitting them on Federal wildlife refuge land would be counter to the purposes of these national wildlife refuges. I know one of my colleagues was here citing what they think is already prohibited under state law, but the Alaska Administrative Code does allow for carbon monoxide cartridges to be used in humane euthanizing in these wolf dens and the killing of young animals.  Mr.President, let me read from the relevant provision of the Alaska Code, which is 5 AAC 92.110, Control of Predation by wolves. Subsection (h) states that ``carbon monoxide cartridges may be used to humanely euthanize wolf young in the den in areas under a predation control implementation plan.''  The next subsection, subsection (i) states that ``the killing of wolf young in the den, commonly known as `denning,' is prohibited unless the commission authorizes the killing of wolf young in the den in areas under a predation control implementation plan.''  That is in the Alaska Administrative Code today, and it is something that the U.Fish and Wildlife Service does not want to see happen in national wildlife refuges. The killing methods authorized by the State of Alaska include killing bear cubs or mothers with cubs, killing brown bears, including grizzly bears, using bait, killing brown bears using traps or snares, killing wolves or coyotes and their pups during the denning season, and shooting bears or wolves from aircraft or helicopters, using the aircraft to track down the bears or wolves, then landing and shooting them.  When you see the list of prohibited actions, you have to wonder why anybody would oppose this rule. Who is advocating for the slaughtering of wolf pups or bear cubs in their dens, shooting them from aircraft or using snares to catch them by their necks and kill them? I think my colleague from New Mexico had a picture of such an event. Who is advocating for this kind of method?  This is why the U.Fish and Wildlife Service policy makes sure that if predator controls used, that they are based on science and not these inhumane actions. The wildlife rule is not a case of regulating sportsmen for traditional hunting practices, but it is making sure that they are doing so in a humane way.  The law requires that the Alaska wildlife refuges be managed to conserve fish and wildlife populations in their natural diversity, but Alaska's predator control practices are not consistent with that management requirement. They are directly opposite to conserving the natural diversity and are instead promoting the wholesale killing of predator species. So that is why we oppose this override of the regulation. I hope my colleagues will turn it down.  If we want to make improvements to the U.Fish and Wildlife Service rule, we can do so by legislation, or by working to change the rule. But by overturning this rule, you are also prohibiting the agency from fulfilling their job of protecting the wildlife refuge.  I want to make sure that all our colleagues understand that this is about protecting wildlife refuges in a humane way, allowing hunting practices, but doing so in a way that preserves the species.

At a recent House Armed Services Committee hearing, the vice chief of staff of the Army told members that of the 58 brigade combat teams, only three are ready to ``fight tonight.'' The vice chief of naval operations, Admiral William Moran, recently testified that more than half of all Navy aircraft are grounded due to maintenance issues and an inability to acquire the necessary parts. Our nuclear force is aging, even as our adversaries continue to make advancements in their own nuclear forces and capabilities. Our Air Force is the oldest, smallest, and least ready it has ever been.[[Page H1605]]  These stories and shortfalls, Mr.Speaker, exist across nearly every aspect of our military. America's fighting men and women are the greatest fighting force and the greatest force for good our world has ever known. They deserve the resources to do their job.  We have prevailed over great challenges in the past, from our unlikely and miraculous founding, through our Civil War, two world wars, the Cold War, and the early years of the war on terror. We must, Mr.Speaker, marshal our forces to do so again. To prevail, Congress--this Congress--must do its job.  That job begins with passing this 2017 Defense Appropriations bill. Then, Mr.Speaker, we must repeal the Budget Control Act and end sequestration. There is a rational and responsible way for us to undertake defense budgeting. The process in place today is neither.  The last time our military was able to assess the threats we face and then recommend the necessary funding levels to defeat those threats was fiscal year 2011, over 6 years ago. We must return to this standard budgeting process. In describing the effects of sequestration several years ago, our current Defense Secretary put it this way: ``No foe in the field can wreak such havoc on our security as mindless sequestration is achieving today.'' We must end this practice with all speed.  This should not be a partisan issue, Mr.It has not been in our past. Since World War II, every American President, Republican and Democrat alike, has understood the importance of American military superiority of ensuring a world in which America and our allies set the rules.  Threatened by the Nazis and the Japanese, Franklin Roosevelt and George Marshall knew America had to be the ``arsenal of democracy.'' At the beginning of the Cold War, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and John Kennedy roused the Nation to defeat freedom and liberty against communism. John Kennedy knew America had to be ``the watchmen on the walls of freedom.'' In the 1980s, President Reagan oversaw the defense buildup we are still benefiting from today. He knew that ``war comes not when the forces of freedom are strong, it is when they are weak that tyrants are tempted.'' And in the aftermath of 9/11, it was George Bush and Dick Cheney who kept us safe, who knew we could not win this war on defense, who understood we had to have a military strong and capable enough to deny terrorists the safe havens from which they plot and plan and launch attacks against our fellow citizens.  Mr.Speaker, now it is our turn. Across the globe, our adversaries challenge us, from China to North Korea, to Iran, to Russia; across the Middle East, in Syria, Iraq, and Thirty-four years ago, Ronald Reagan described our duty at another time, against another enemy, this way:       It is up to us in our time to choose, and choose wisely,      between the hard but necessary task of preserving peace and      freedom, and the temptation to ignore our duty and blindly      hope for the best while the enemies of freedom grow stronger      day by day.  Mr.Speaker, we can no longer ignore our duty while our enemies grow stronger. We must take the first step today to begin rebuilding our military. H.1301 is that first step. It increases defense spending, provides a full pay raise for our servicemen and -women, and begins to address our readiness shortfalls. This bill provides funds based on our military's priorities for fiscal year 2017 and gets us off the cycle of continuing resolutions, which are doing real damage to our readiness and capacity.  Therefore, I urge support for the rule to allow for consideration of H.1301, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

We must also repeal the Budget Control Act and end sequestration if we are going to truly address our shortfalls. We must return to a rational budgeting process at the Pentagon, where spending is based upon defending the defeating threats to this Nation, not arbitrary and devastating across-the-board cuts.

A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

11843,topic-id,1574,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and, frankly, I want to thank her for taking on this rule and the role she plays in this She came to Congress with an extraordinary expertise in national security, probably unsurpassed by any new So she is not only a valuable member of the Rules Committee, she is an important voice for the security of the United States of America in a very dangerous era.  Before I begin, I want to actually agree with my friend from Massachusetts on a couple of very important points that he made. First, I want to agree with him that this should have been done earlier. My friend is exactly right about this. This could have been done, in my view, in November and We should have gotten it done then. We would have avoided a lot of problems that come with a continuing resolution.  I am very pleased that we are moving it now, but earlier would have been better, no question about it. And that is true with every other bill, and my friend made that point as well. We really should make sure that each of the appropriations bills are passed. All of the problems associated with the continuing resolution are so evident for our military, are evident, frankly, in every other department. So I would hope my leadership continues to do what they are doing today and that is move these bills forward.  My friend is also right, in my opinion, about the authorization of the use of military force. This is something we have agreed on, even when we disagree on other things. This is a congressional responsibility. The President has announced he is going to announce a new strategy going forward on I would suggest to my side of the aisle and to the administration, now would be a great time to come to the Congress so we could have this robust debate on deploying and using our military and discharge our constitutional responsibilities.  I am less persuaded by my friend's arguments about the spending levels here. I just point out for the record this is well below what former Secretary of Defense Gates, when he was Secretary in the Obama administration, recommended we should be doing at this time. Frankly, that is because the last administration dropped the ball and simply didn't listen to its own experts as to what the appropriate level of our forces should be.  The underlying legislation here is an excellent bill. My friends have already talked about it in detail. I am going to take a 30,000-foot look at the bill and remind our listeners and our colleagues, there are three important objectives that this bill achieves:  The first is stopping the erosion in end strength, something that went on for years under the last administration that somehow thought we would be safer if our military got smaller. That was a bad assumption.[[Page H1607]]  The second is to restart the procurement cycle. We have fallen far, far behind what we should be doing in terms of replacing, upgrading, and improving the weapons systems and the communication systems, every system that we move into war with and that we ask our men and women to use.  And finally, this actually begins to address a problem that my friend from Wyoming discussed in great detail: readiness. We simply are not ready now to fight with the effectiveness. Now, I don't have any doubt, if we had to deploy massively, that our forces would do well and they would win, but a lot of people would die because they hadn't had the appropriate training, the appropriate time on task to get ready.  The other great objective that this bill meets is that we finally match up spending with the authorization. Last year, we had an excellent authorization bill out of the House Armed Services Unfortunately, that doesn't get you very far if the money doesn't match the policies and the recommendations that they advanced. This now takes care of that problem.  I also remind our colleagues that passing this bill is only a first step. As my friend from Wyoming pointed out, we are going to need a supplemental later this year, just for this year. We are going to need a robust increase in the fiscal year 2018 authorization and appropriation, something that the President has committed to and something I hope we can advance on a bipartisan basis.  Finally, again, as my friend pointed out, real military buildups take years, not months and weeks. We are going to have to be at this task for several years to restore and strengthen, frankly, what we allowed to decline, what the last administration allowed to decline over several years.  So this is an extraordinary first step, but it is only a first step; and I would hope my colleagues would join us on a bipartisan basis, while we have differences, but come together and put the defense of the country in a very dangerous time ahead of all else that we do.  Mr.Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill and the underlying legislation, and I urge the passage of the rule.  Again, I want to thank my friend from I want to thank my friend from We sometimes disagree, but he makes very valuable and very important points in some of the critiques he offers, and I hope that we heed them well.  With that, again, Mr.Speaker, I urge the passage of the underlying legislation and the adoption of the rule.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for his kind words and for understanding that it is inappropriate for Congress to continue these wars without having a vote on an I hope that that changes, but I appreciate his support, and there is bipartisan support for having this body actually do its job. That shouldn't be a radical idea, but, unfortunately, nowadays, doing our job seems to be something that a lot of people don't want to do.  Mr.Speaker, at the very beginning of the year, the Republican majority adopted a rule to explicitly exempt the cost of any bill that repeals or amends the Affordable Care Act from a requirement that it not increase spending by $5 billion. They effectively adopted a legislative blindfold to completely ignore the cost of repeal.  Let me show you the poster of the language, and I am happy to provide this to my colleagues on the Republican side. I will even give you my bifocals if you want to read it, because I think it is important that people understand what it says. It says:       Point of order: It shall not be in order to consider any      bill that would cause a net increase in direct spending in      excess of $5 billion.       Limitation: This subsection shall not apply to any bill      repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Mr.Speaker, as you can see, with this act, the majority declared that they were not going to let the rules of this House, which are purportedly in place to ensure fiscal discipline, stand in the way of repealing the Affordable Care Act no matter how much it would cost American families.  But, Mr.Speaker, it gets even worse. As we stand here today, Republicans have taken their head-in-the-sand approach to the Affordable Care Act to a new low. Right now, both the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees are considering Republican legislation to repeal healthcare reform without providing any analysis from the nonpartisan experts at the Congressional Budget Office on the cost of their legislation.  So let me put this another way. Earlier this year, the Republicans said: It does not matter how much it will cost to take health care away from millions of Now they are saying they don't even want to know how much it will cost or what impact it will have on American families.  Mr.Speaker, we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget That office costs nearly $50 million a year. We pay them to advise us precisely at times like this. Republicans have talked about repeal and replace for 7 years. Acting like they had not enough time to weigh the cost of their actions would be laughable if it were not so irresponsible.  Now, we Democrats care about health care and we care about costs and we demand to know what the impact of this repeal bill will be. Members should not be asked to vote on this legislation until they know the full weight of their decision.  Mr.Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would require a CBO cost estimate to be made publicly available before any legislation that amends or repeals the Affordable Care Act may be considered in the Energy and Commerce or Ways and Means Committee or on the House floor.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of that amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Austin Scott of Georgia). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?  There was no objection.

12051,topic-id,835,"Mr.President, I wish to speak in support of the Main Street Fairness Act, which will help to create tax parity for passthrough companies, the significant majority of which are small businesses. I was very pleased to be joined by my friend and colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson, in introducing this bipartisan bill.[[Page S2173]]  Small businesses are our Nation's job creators. According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses employ more than half of all workers and have generated two-out-of-three net new jobs since the 1970s.  Small businesses also make an outsized contribution to our Nation's economy, generating half of our Nation's GDP, 54 percent of all U.sales, 41 percent of private sector payroll, and one-third of our Nation's export value. Their success is critical to the health of our economy.  Unfortunately, our Nation's small businesses face a higher tax burden that affects their ability to compete with large firms in the marketplace. In fact, a recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, found that concerns about Federal taxes on business income ranked third on the list of the top 10 problems facing small businesses.  Nearly all of our Nation's small businesses are organized as passthroughs, meaning that their profits are passed on to their owners and reported on individual income tax returns. This means that small business income is subject to taxation at individual rates, which can be as high as 39.6 percent at the Federal level and can exceed 50 percent in some If we want our small businesses to grow and create jobs, we must reduce these high marginal rates.  I believe Congress should undertake comprehensive tax reform to make our Tax Code simpler, fairer, and more progrowth. As we do so, we must make sure American businesses of every size are given the opportunity to compete. Aligning the tax rate for passthroughs with our corporate tax rate will ensure small businesses are not left behind. That is why Senator Nelson and I introduced the Main Street Fairness Act, which will link the tax rates of passthrough entities and large corporations, to ensure that small businesses never pay a higher tax rate than large companies.  This simple change will help make sure that small businesses remain healthy and strong, so they can continue to serve as our Nation's job creators, as they have for so many years.

Susan Collins,     U.Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington,     Bill Nelson,     U.Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington,       Dear Senators Collins and Nelson: On behalf of the National      Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's      leading small business advocacy organization, we write in      strong support of 707--The Main Street Fairness This      legislation would reduce taxes on pass-through businesses and      make them more competitive, and ensure that all businesses,      large and small alike, compete on a level playing field going      forward.       The vast majority of small businesses are organized as      pass-through entities, which pay tax on business income at      the individual tax rates, which are currently as high as 39.6      percent, and not at the corporate tax rate, which is      currently as high as 35 percent. Such entities include any      company organized as a sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC,      or S-The Main Street Fairness Act would ensure      that those pass-through businesses never pay a higher tax      rate than businesses organized as C-Corporations, and      immediately reduce the tax rate on pass-through businesses      currently paying more than 35 percent.       Small businesses are the major source of growth and job      creation in our economy. In fact, according to the Small      Business Administration (SBA), small businesses account for      64 percent of the net new private sector jobs created in      America and make up 99.7 percent of U.employer firms. The      high tax burden currently facing small businesses holds back      investments, growth, hiring, and entrepreneurship. One in      five small businesses struggles with cash-flow, which is      needed to not only run their businesses but also support      their families. Specifically, after-tax income is an      especially important source of capital for small businesses.      High tax rates mean less money that small business owners      have to reinvest back into their business.       Because of this, small businesses strongly support tax      reform that simplifies the tax code, lowers tax rates on      businesses, and promotes economic growth. The Main Street      Fairness Act will help ensure that all businesses, regardless      of how they organize, enjoy the benefits of any reduction in      tax rates that would be included in tax reform. We appreciate      your continued leadership on this key issue and look forward      to working with you as Congress considers tax reform.

I represent a coal-producing district whose economy has been devastated by the former President's and his renegade of unelected bureaucrats' war on coal.  Last year, a Presidential candidate boasted among a liberal political crowd that she would put a bunch of coal miners out of work. She went on to say that the government would then essentially come in and put those hardworking, out-of-work coal miners on welfare.  Well, Mr.Speaker, my coal miners don't want to be on government welfare. They want the government to get out of their way and let them work.  Because of senseless, onerous regulations like the stream protection rule, the liberals in Washington have succeeded in putting most coal miners out of work.

Throughout her time in the district, Debbie has been a key leader, instrumental in the successful completion of many projects like the John Bassett Moore Intermediate School and the School Special Services As she steps down from her position as superintendent in June, I join the many Delawareans she has worked with in thanking Deborah for her diligent efforts to improve the education system for Delaware's children through hard work and diligence.  A native of Smyrna, DE, and educated in the same school system that she serves so faithfully, Debbie has always been a champion for students, teachers, and the local community. Being a champion to Debbie means helping to instill values of integrity, compassion, perseverance, respect, and responsibility--values visible in the hallways and classrooms of the schools in Smyrna and in the hearts of its graduates.  Debbie's success can be attributed not only to a commitment to instill essential values in district students, but also to a genuine passion for the betterment of her community. Her ability to develop and foster community relationships essential to the district's long-term educational success can be seen in numerous completed projects and building upgrades, as well as the annual ``I Love Smyrna School District Day,'' which has drawn close to 7,000 attendees in recent years.

The sensitive/critical technology is primarily in the      design, development, production and manufacturing of the      components (integrated circuits and assembly), and the      integration methodology required to integrate those      components onto an assembly to process embedded data (the      software--algorithm--working parameters).

11923,topic-id,446,"Mr.President, I say to my friend from Florida that I think there has been a lot of false advertising and scaremongering taking place around the country in trying to convince people that, somehow, they are going to lose their coverage, which is not the case.  We believe we can do better than ObamaCare, which has created a one-size-fits-all healthcare package and has basically denied people the right to choose the kind of coverage that suits them best at a price they can afford.  In Texas alone, a person making about $25,000 a year could spend up to 30 percent of his gross income under That is a young person, and it is no surprise that many of them have opted out of ObamaCare and simply decided either to pay the penalty or to just become noncompliant because it is unaffordable.  I am sympathetic, certainly, to the genuine concerns of anybody in one's getting appropriate healthcare coverage, but I sure hope people do not succumb to the scaremongering taking place in parts of the country that tells people they are going to be left high and dry.  For example, my friend and colleague said that Medicare was going to be gutted under the House bill. That is not true. Right now, Medicaid is an uncapped entitlement. It is one of the fastest growing sources of Federal Government spending. The bill in the House proposes not to cut it but to restrain its rate of growth. Right now, it is the third largest budget item in the Texas budget. My friends in the Texas Legislature tell me that it crowds out all other spending, including education, law enforcement, and other things--that it just eats up so much money because it is uncapped. What we would propose to do is to leave Medicaid at the current levels but then make sure that it grows according to the Consumer Price Index--and a rather generous one--in medical inflation.  I will say what I said earlier, which is that I do not recognize the bill that my friend from Florida has described. If the House did not pass a bill and if the Senate did not pass a bill, we would still be here, talking about the meltdown of the Affordable Care Act because many insurance companies have simply pulled out of the marketplace. Many people do not have choices. They are forced to deal with, perhaps, the one remaining health insurance company, and in some places they are going to have all insurance companies pull out of the individual market.

11925,topic-id,2549,"Mr.President, I would welcome that any day and every day. The only way we get things done around here in any sort of durable fashion is on a bipartisan basis. But so far, I have seen zero indication from our friends across the aisle that they are interested in working with us. I hope that is a misunderstanding on my part, and I hope going forward we will be able to come up with some bipartisan bills.[[Page S1875]]  The truth is that, given the constraints of the budget process, we are not going to be able to do everything we want to do in this bill that is going to pass the House on Thursday and which we will take up here in the Senate next week. So there is going to be a necessity to do some more, and I hope we can do that on a bipartisan basis.  We also know that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, is working from a regulatory standpoint to try to do everything he can to stabilize the insurance market and to make sure that people continue to have some choices.  I think this is fundamentally a test of our principles regarding whether we actually believe in more choices and competition, and my firm conviction is choices and competition improve the quality of a service and the quality of a product. That is really one of the foundational principles upon which our economy is based. I think it also works in healthcare, but we haven't had that since ObamaCare passed.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, I want to speak a little bit about the important hearing on the judicial nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the U.Supreme Court that is taking place in the Senate Judiciary Committee even as we speak.  We know that President Trump nominated Judge Gorsuch at the end of January to a seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Justice Scalia was a lion of American law. He was bigger than life. His intellect, his writing, and his wit inspired a lot of young lawyers and not-so-young lawyers and judges and law students over the past decades, and reminded us that judges have a distinct and special and important role in our system of government, but it is decidedly not to be a legislator or a policymaker because they are ill-suited for doing that.  First of all, Federal judges are appointed for life. Judges are not supposed to take public opinion polls to figure out how to rule in a case.  I asked Judge Gorsuch today: Is it proper for a judge to decide in a case in front of him or her who he or she thinks should win and then try to work backward to justify it in a judge's decision?  He said: Well, it is actually just the opposite. What you try to do is to take the facts and the law and you apply them and you respect the outcome, even if sometimes it is not an outcome you would prefer if it were a matter of your personal preference.  What he described, really, is called the rule of law, which has distinguished the United States of America from most of the rest of the world and which has given us our competitive advantage. When people know that we are going to have a legal system that doesn't depend on personalities, doesn't depend on politics, but rather on a written law or Constitution, then people can take confidence in their investments, in their plans, and our economy has been the winner.  There is a Peruvian economist who wrote a book called ``The Mystery of Capital.'' I will just summarize, briefly. I was intrigued by the book and by his thesis. Basically, his argument is the United States is no more entrepreneurial than other parts of the world, but what distinguishes us from much of the rest of the world is what I just said a moment ago: It is the rule of law. For example, if you buy a house and get a title to that house, then you have a legal right to it, and you can defend it against all other claimants or people who might try to say: No, that is really my house. I know that sounds so basic, and we take it for granted, but it really does distinguish our country from others, where the law is really not about law, but it is about politics. It is about who is in power. Well, our laws are designed to protect people who are not in power, including people in political minorities.  I think the greatest legacy of Justice Scalia was a strong belief that the words in the Constitution and laws passed by the Congress matter. He believed judges should apply those texts and not just pronounce their policy preferences in deciding cases. He understood, as I do, that a careful adherence to text ultimately protects our democracy, which is the intention of our Founding  I have spent time, like many of my colleagues, talking about the type of judge we need to fill this vacancy--someone who understands the lessons that Justice Scalia taught us--and will apply them faithfully, without regard to persons or personalities or politics. I believe there is no question that Judge Gorsuch is the man for the task. I am confident that the hearings this week will make that clear to the rest of  It is interesting to listen to some of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who want to talk about everything other than Judge Gorsuch and his qualifications. They want to talk about President They want to talk about abortion. They want to talk about same-sex marriage. They want to try to get Judge Gorsuch to prejudge some future case that may come before the U.Supreme Well, no judge worthy of that title will tell anybody: Well, if you confirm me as a judge, I promise you this outcome. That is a violation of the most fundamental ethics of a judge, because a judge is not, again, a policymaker, a judge is not a politician; judges aren't about outcomes, but rather a commitment to the rule of law and due process of law in reaching their decisions.  So far, in almost two days in the Judiciary Committee, I think Judge Gorsuch has performed admirably and demonstrated no reason why our colleagues across the aisle can't support him. As a matter of fact, my view is that if you can't vote for somebody like Judge Gorsuch, there is probably nobody that would be nominated by this President that you would vote to confirm. It is hard for me to imagine the nomination getting much better.  We have already learned a lot about the judge. We know of his intellect. We know of his sterling qualifications and his extensive experience. I particularly appreciated his testimony today about access to justice and his concern that people of modest means--low income, the so-called little guy that our friends across the aisle keep talking about. The little guy in America is essentially denied access to our courts because it costs so much and it takes too long, and there have to be mechanisms in place for us to resolve our differences that everybody has access to or else the statement carved in the marble over the U.Supreme Court that says ``equal justice under law'' is just a pathetic joke.  So we have a lot to do in terms of providing access to justice. I think somebody with Judge Gorsuch's background--someone who actually has practiced the law and who has represented clients in court and who has been thoughtful about this and so many other topics--is just the type of person that can help us get our legal system back on track, so that saying, that model, ``equal justice under law,'' is a reality.  We know that Judge Gorsuch has spent a decade on the bench and about 10 years in private practice, and he has also worked at the Department of Like Justice Scalia, he is a steadfast believer in the Constitution laws and that they should be interpreted based on their text; that is, what they actually say.  I asked Judge Gorsuch today: If you don't believe that you ought to interpret the law based on what the law actually says, what would you use as your guide? If you are not going to interpret the Constitution based on what the Constitution says, what are you going to use as your guide?  Well, some of our friends would talk about a living Constitution or judges knowing better than perhaps the elected representatives of the people. To me, that is just misguided. Judges are not philosopher kings or queens. Judges, as I said at the outset, hold a very important but finite role in our system of government. It is our job as the legislature to make the policy. It is the executive--the President's job--to execute the policy. And if we don't like the law, then it is our job to change it, not to look to the Court to say: I am going to let the Congress off the hook, and we are just going to write an opinion and render a judgment that changes the law under the guise of actually judging, actually engaging in more policymaking.  Well, the great thing about somebody like Judge Gorsuch is that the people who admire him also include people who differ from him politically but have seen him in action--people like the former Solicitor General under[[Page S1876]]President Obama, who said he is ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century,'' and someone who ``has always put aside his personal views to serve the rule of law.''  In other words, Judge Gorsuch is the type of judge that we should all be able to get behind, and he is exactly the kind of nominee we would hope to see from any administration. That is why he was previously confirmed by the U.Senate 10 years ago when he was nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in He was confirmed by voice vote. For people who may not be familiar with the practices of the Senate, that essentially is by unanimous consent, by unanimous agreement, including the Democratic leader, the Senator from New York, Mr.He thought Judge Gorsuch was good enough for the Tenth Circuit Court of I would challenge him to identify a reason why he is not well suited for the United States Supreme Court, unless it is based on some political calculation.  As the Judiciary Committee this week considers his nomination, I want to make crystal clear the purpose of the hearing. It is not about pinning the nominee down or asking trick questions or asking the judge to prejudge cases that might come before the We know there have been outside special interest groups who have criticized Judge Gorsuch for failing to rule in favor of one sympathetic constituency or another, but, again, that is not what judges do--or what they are supposed to do. Are they really supposed to find the most sympathetic party to a lawsuit and say: I am going to decide that case for them, and I will figure out the justification for it later. That is not what judges are supposed to do. Judges are supposed to apply the law impartially and fairly and decide the facts and apply the law and render judgments on cases or controversies that become before the court, not write policy at large.  So I think some of these attacks are pretty silly, but they also are a reminder of the importance of these hearings because I really believe this is one of those opportunities to help acquaint millions more Americans with our unique founding story and the unique nature of our Constitution and our Nation of laws.  I see my friend from Tennessee here. I remember something he told me once about telling his constituents that one of the important functions of the Senate was to remind people what it means to be an Well, being an American means believing in the rule of law and equal justice for all.  I will close on this because I see my friend from Tennessee here waiting to speak. This is another kind of an interesting statistic I found pretty amazing, and the Presiding Officer, a distinguished lawyer in his own right, can marvel at this as I do.  Judge Gorsuch is no radical. He follows the law wherever it leads: sometimes for the police, sometimes for a criminal defendant; sometimes for the government, sometimes against the government. That is the way the rule of law works. He noted that about 97 percent of the thousands of cases he has decided have been unanimously. As the Presiding Officer knows, the circuit court sits in three-judge panels. The idea that 97 percent of the cases he decided were decided unanimously is pretty remarkable, and he sided with the majority 99 percent of the time. This is nobody out of the mainstream. This is a mainstream judge. So let's be honest and open about it.  I hope our colleagues across the aisle, after this nominee is voted out of the Judiciary Committee, will allow us to have an up-or-down vote on this nomination. It wasn't until the Presidency of George Bush in 2000 that somehow the tradition of allowing an up-or-down vote for nominees went out the window and instead some people got together and decided, well, we are going to come up with a rationale to raise the threshold to 60. In other words, a President won't be able to see his nominee confirmed unless not just a majority votes for it but 60 people vote for it in the Senate because of the Senate's rules on cloture closing off debate. That period of our history during the George Bush administration was an aberration, and I would hope no one would want to repeat that--again, politicizing the judicial nomination process.  People can vote any way they want, but denying the opportunity for the Senate to vote up or down on a nominee, particularly to the U.Supreme Court, is certainly not a road I would hope our colleagues would go down. As they presumably learned this year, after Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, led his conference into the nuclear option, which basically changed the Senate rules by breaking the Senate rules--that is what allowed us to confirm the President's Cabinet with 51 votes, and that is what will allow us to confirm all lower court judicial nominees with 51 votes. So we would think they might have learned the lesson that what goes around comes around and that while you are in the minority one day, you might be in the majority in the not too distant future. What you force the Senate to do in order to do its job may end up biting you in the future. So I hope they seriously consider allowing Judge Gorsuch an up-or-down vote when his nomination comes to the floor sometime around or after April 3.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

11901,topic-id,623,"Mr.President, I come to reflect on the 1-year anniversary of rain and winter storms that swept across the State of Illinois, causing widespread flooding and devastation.  In the midst of the holidays, heavy rainfall of over 7 inches a day in some areas caused water levels on rivers in Illinois to reach record, or near record, heights. The Mississippi River at Thebes reached its highest crest level on record at 47.7 feet.  Flooding forced many communities to evacuate their homes for their own safety. Damages to property in these Illinois communities totaled more than $15 million.  Sadly, these storms were so severe that flooded roadways tragically claimed the lives of 10 people whose vehicles were swept away by flooding.  Alexander and Randolph counties were two areas most impacted by this flood. I went to visit two towns in these areas--Olive Branch, IL, and Evansville, IL--and I saw miles of flood damage to agricultural lands, homes, and businesses. What I saw was heartbreaking.  I spoke with residents who were concerned about being able to recover from the flood and resulting damages and who were concerned about what could happen if levees overtop and breach again in the future.  People like Bruce Ford, from Olive Branch, IL, worked day and night to clean out debris and move equipment back into their businesses, but he worried about how long he would be out of business and whether or not he would be able to rebuild in the event of another disaster. And he is not alone--many residents in these communities worry that they will not have the means to fix properties and businesses all over again.  The Governor declared 23 counties State disaster areas, and State and local emergency responders were dispatched to affected areas. I supported his request for a Federal disaster declaration for 21 counties in the  The State disaster declaration allowed people in affected communities whose homes and businesses were damaged to start repairs and receive the help they needed.  And I want to say thanks for the hard work and dedication of James Joseph, head of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency; he was there when his constituents and communities needed him the most.  The State provided over 997,000 sandbags, over 4,000 tons of sand, and 117 Illinois Department of Transportation trucks for flood mitigation and response efforts.  The Small Business Administration also made loans available to homeowners and businesses in Christian, Iroquois, Ford, Kankakee, Macon, Montgomery, Sangamon, Shelby, and Vermilion  I want to acknowledge the dedication of the State and Federal employees who pitched in at every level, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers to the Illinois Emergency Management  Finally, I can't overstate how proud I am of the volunteers, National Guard members, and local law enforcement agencies who came forward to keep our communities safe. Before flooding began, local law enforcement and emergency responders went door-to-door to advise residents to evacuate and move to higher ground, saving the lives of many who heeded the call and sought out shelter with family and friends before the flooding began.  There is still work to be done, but the people who live and work in the damaged communities have made incredible progress rebuilding. Thousands of volunteers have helped with the cleanup. People from all over the State pitched in to help their neighbors and even strangers get back on their feet. Hearing these kinds of stories make me proud to be from  Our thoughts remain with the many people who lost their loved ones, their homes, and other property last year.  I want to thank everyone who has been engaged in the rescue and cleanup.  We are rebuilding--as Illinoisans always do--and we will be stronger for it.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgS151-2.txt,326,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,2017.0,9.0,March
12072,topic-id,1250,"Mr.President, it was 16 years ago when I introduced the DREAM The DREAM Act was a response to a call I received in my office. A young woman had been brought to the United States as an infant, at the age of 2, from She lived in the United States and grew up here. When she became an accomplished pianist and was accepted at some of the best musical schools in the Nation, she started to apply but didn't know what to put down in terms of her citizenship. She called and asked, and it turned out that her mom and dad had never filed the papers that would have allowed her to become a citizen of the United She was undocumented. Through no fault of her own--brought to the United States--her papers weren't filed.  She grew up in Chicago, went to school, and did well, despite having a family of modest means. As I said, she developed a skill as a pianist and now had an opportunity of a lifetime and wanted to know what her legal status was. We checked the law, and it was pretty clear. She was undocumented, and the laws of America said you have to leave for 10 years, go outside of the United States, and petition to come back.  It didn't seem fair or reasonable that a child, an infant of 2, would be held responsible for mistakes made by their parents, so I introduced the DREAM The DREAM Act said that if you are one of those kids and you finish school and you don't have a serious criminal record, we will give you a chance--a chance to become legal in America, a chance to become a citizen.  Those kids grew up going to school in our classrooms, pledging allegiance to that same flag we pledge allegiance to. They believed they were Americans, but it was not so in the eyes of American law.  I introduced this bill 16 years ago. It passed the Senate in one form, the House in another. It has never become the law of the land. A few years ago I wrote to President Obama and said: As President, can you find a way to protect these young people until we do what we are supposed to do in Congress?  He did. He created something called By Executive order, these young people could apply, pay about $500 in a filing fee, go through a criminal background check, and if they had no problems--no threat to this country--be allowed to stay here on a temporary 2-year basis. They could go to school but with no Federal help, no Federal assistance for their education. They could work and renew it every 2 years. That is  Over 750,000 kids signed up. These were kids just like the one I described earlier--now young people who are going to college and doing important things with their lives. I have come to the floor over 100 times to tell their stories because political speeches, as inspiring as they are, usually don't move people. When you hear about these people and who they are, it can make a difference.  I want to introduce one today. It will just take a few minutes. I see a couple of my colleagues on the floor.[[Page S415]]  This is Belsy Garcia When Belsy was 7 years old, she was brought by her family to the United States from She grew up in a small town in Georgia and became an extraordinary student. She graduated third in her high school class with a perfect 4.0 grade point average.  During high school, she was a member of the National Honor Society, was on the tennis team, and was a member of the mock trial team. She even earned a black belt in Tae Kwon She went on to attend Mercer University in Macon, GA, where she was a Presidential scholar for 4 years. This award is given to students in the top 10 percent of their class.  Belsy was a member of a number of academic honor societies and the premed club. She worked as a researcher in their biology department. She was a leader of her college's Habitat for Humanity chapter and worked as a resident assistant in the student dorms and a tutor for high school students.  In 2013, Belsy graduated from Mercer University with a bachelor of science degree in biology, with minors in chemistry and math. She is now in her second year at the Loyola University Chicago School of That is where I met her.  Like many States across the country, my home State of Illinois faces a shortage of physicians in the inner cities and in the downstate rural communities. As a DACA student at Loyola medical school, Belsy has promised that after she graduates and becomes a doctor, she will work for several years in underserved areas in my home State of  Even with her busy medical school schedule, Belsy volunteers as a translator at Loyola medical clinic. She is a member of Viva la Familia, a group which educates families on healthy lifestyles, and she mentors undergraduate students who are interested in medical school.  She wrote me a letter and said:       DACA means the world to me. It has allowed me to continue      the arduous journey of becoming a physician, and without it,      I would not be where I am today. All I've ever wanted was the      opportunity to prove myself and to further my education so      that I can give back to those who need it the most. I am so      close to achieving my dreams and finally making a difference      in the community, but if DACA is repealed, those dreams might      never become reality.  If DACA is eliminated, what happens to Belsy? If it is eliminated, she loses her right to legally work in the United States and may have to drop out of medical school, and that alone--the clinical experience in medical school--requires actually working. If she can't work, she can't pay for her education.  Aside from State of Illinois financing opportunities, Belsy doesn't qualify for a penny in Federal assistance to go to medical school. It is an extraordinary hardship on these students, but they are so darned determined, they do it anyway.  I have been encouraged recently because statements made by President Trump, as well as yesterday his press secretary and earlier in the day his chief of staff, lead me to believe that he understands the seriousness of this problem.  Young people like Belsy, thousands of them across the United States, are simply asking for a chance to have a good life, to make this a better nation. We could use her. We could use her medical services and talents as a doctor in my State of Illinois, in the State of Texas, in the State of North Dakota, and virtually every State of the Why would we want to lose a great potential doctor like her? We need her, and we need people like her.  I hope my colleagues and President Trump will join me to continue the DACA program. I hope this administration will work with Congress to pass the BRIDGE Act, a bipartisan bill I have introduced with Senator Lindsey Graham to create a transition for those like Belsy, protected by DACA, so that until this Congress--as it should--passes comprehensive immigration reform, we would protect these young people from deportation.

11995,topic-id,1737,"Congressman, thank you for that introduction, and thank you for your service to the Congress and the great people of  I think it is really important tonight to focus on a few key things about what is happening in One is that 20 million people stand to lose their healthcare coverage. Many have never had it, and the Republican majority is set to snatch it from their hands. That is really sad.  One of the people who come to mind is actually a young woman who works on my staff. Her name is Abby, and she is a young woman who has her whole life to look forward to, but as a young person, when she was born, she had a disease called toxoplasmosis. She doesn't mind me talking about it because what Abby would tell you if she were here is that it was tough growing up.  She had a lot of medical attention growing up. She was a good student, and she really braved all of the medical care she needed with tremendous courage, and her family was there with her the whole time. But she had numerous surgeries growing up, and she also came close to death's door on more than one occasion.  One thing that she says--and says to anybody who is willing to listen--is that the Affordable Care Act helped save her life. Why? Because Abby has a preexisting condition, a pretty serious illness. And she had insurance companies that have lifetime limits and annual limits on coverage and care.  Without the Affordable Care Act and with the provisions that preceded the Affordable Care Act in the insurance industry, she simply was uninsurable, therefore, not in a position to get the care she needed. By some miracle, she made it to adulthood with the status quo before the Affordable Care Act, but the Affordable Care Act made the difference between her being with us and not.  I was talking to a physician who operates an institution in my district called the Hennepin County Medical Center, HCMC, who said: Look, if you were to stack up all of the diseases in our country that end in fatality, you would have to put up there car accidents, you would have to put up there heart disease, you would have to put up there pulmonary illnesses and cancers, of course. But, he said, if you stacked those illnesses up on a list, the most fatal in a given year, he said, the third one would be uninsured, people dying because they don't have insurance.  And our Republican majority is here to tell us they are okay with that. It is hard for me to believe, but it is true.  Right in front of us, we know that this repeal will relieve wealthy individuals of paying taxes. If they are able to repeal the Affordable Care Act, people with a lot of money are going to have more of it, and people who needed health care will have less of it.  People who need help dealing with the doughnut hole and need to be filled in with the moneys that come from the Affordable Care Act won't have that anymore. Now they will go back to the status quo of Medicare part D, which is where they get help up to a certain amount, then there is no help, then they have got to spend up to start getting help again. The Affordable Care Act filled in the doughnut hole, and seniors who can barely afford their prescription drugs now will have even more trouble.  Seniors who need Daraprim, which was a medication that cost about 13 bucks until this guy Shkreli bought the patent for it and jacked it up to about 700 bucks, people who need even things like insulin, people who need all kinds of medications now are going to be staring at that doughnut hole all over again.  I mean, we can get up here and talk about the toll, the human tragedy, the pain and suffering that people are looking at, but none of it seems to penetrate the minds of our colleagues. They seem to be deaf to the pleas of people like Abby and so many other people like that.  I was here when my colleagues on the other side brought forth I think as many as 60 attempts to repeal the Affordable Care We would come forth and we would say: People are getting lifesaving treatments that they never could afford before; people are getting treatments that are literally keeping their families intact, keeping their lives intact; people are getting coverage they never had; people have something more than the emergency room to turn to. Our colleagues would just say: Well, we are just going to get rid of it anyway.  In fact, I remember, Mr.Speaker, when the Republicans shut down the government for 16 days because we refused to cooperate with their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Ted Cruz occupied time and demanded that we repeal it. We said we would not turn people like Abby and others back to the tender mercies of the insurance industry. They said: Well, we will shut down the entire government unless you do it. We said no, and, well, here we are.  It is true that we never thought we were going to lose this election. We never thought we would be this deep in the minority, but we now have gotten in a position where the Democrats[[Page H2008]]don't hold the We have a President who ran on the promise of repealing the Affordable Care Act, and we have two Houses of Congress that are committed to doing it.  The last line of defense really is the American people, Mr.The last line of defense is the American people standing on the most fundamental of rights, the First Amendment, which guarantees them the right to redress grievances, guarantees them the right to petition their government, guarantees them the right to freedom of assembly, guarantees them the right to freedom of faith, guarantees them the right to receive information from a free press.  We are relying on that amendment, Mr.Speaker, to stop these Republican efforts to snatch healthcare access out of the way, out of the hands of We are relying on Americans to stand up and say: We will not tolerate this--going to community meetings, going out on the street, using their rights as Americans to express their right to have health care. This is what the moment calls for.  Governors, even some Republican Governors, are saying: Wait a minute. This Medicaid expansion, you know, we used it. It is not so bad. It is helping us.  Their pleas are being ignored as well. We are at a critical moment: Will the American people continue to make the same advances that people all over the developed world have made with regard to health care?  You know, Europeans look at us and think there is something wrong with us. Even our northern neighbors look at us and say: Wait a minute. Health care is not a right down there?  You get it if you can pay; and if you can't pay and answer somebody's bottom line, you are just out.  We pay the most for health care in the whole wide world, Mr.We pay the most--the most--and yet we don't have the best outcomes. We don't have the best indicators of health. Yet our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to return us to a day when the number one reason that people would declare bankruptcy was medical debt. That is the world we are looking at, and it is really, really something.  Now, many people have said--you know, Democrats say to me all the time, and I am sure they say it to Mr.Raskin of Maryland: Hey, look, you know, there are things we would change in the Affordable Care  We are not saying that it fell down from tablets in the sky. Of course, there are reasonable amendments that might be made. But I am here to say to you, Mr.Speaker, that the Republican caucus has never said: We will talk about how we are going to make reasonable amendments to make it better. They have only said to repeal, repeal, repeal.  They have also said replace, but everyone knows you cannot repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act because, if you repeal it, you are repealing all of the taxes that go along with paying for it. And if you repeal the taxes, you are going to tell me that a Republican caucus is going to levy a tax? They think tax is a four-letter word if somebody with a lot of money has to pay it.                              {time}  2000  Now, they are okay with fees and pushing down regressive taxes. They do that every day and all the time. If somebody with real means has to pony up, even though they are already wealthy, you could never see a Republican do that. It is just not something they are going to do.  The ACA has provided coverage to more than 20 million people. That is 20 million more people who have better patient care, access to doctors and medicines, and are no longer turned away because of preexisting conditions.  The Republican proposal puts the brakes on the progress we have made. People will lose access to insurance coverage. The Republicans gut the preventative health fund, which literally funds programs to invest in keeping people healthy.  Who do Republicans help?  Insurance and pharmaceutical corporations. They get huge tax breaks at the expense of the help and the future of the American people.  The Republican bill doesn't stop there. It is an outright attack on Seniors out there should know that the Republicans are attacking They are attacking  Medicaid is one of our most effective antipoverty programs and provides lifesaving care to millions of elderly, children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities. Republicans want to dismantle the program as we know it and kick people off and leave States to pay for the bill.  This bill takes away health care from women and shifts costs to the older, sicker people. It compromises the Medicare trust fund. It destroys Medicaid and gives tax breaks to corporations and millionaires. It is wrong, and the American people need to oppose it. And I oppose what they are trying to do.

11997,topic-id,1400,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.Raskin) for being so clear on the issues in front of the American people. It is so important that we have these Special Order hours so that we can really help the American people understand what is at stake; and what is at stake literally is the health and security of our  When we talk about security, usually people think about law enforcement and military. There is also the security that families can expect, the security of your health. In this situation, the Nation's security of health and family security is absolutely on the chopping block.  Let me give you an example of what I mean. In the district I represent in Minnesota--which I am so proud to represent the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Minnesota--we used to have an uninsured rate which we thought was low. It was 10.9 percent. If you remember, in the pre-Affordable Care Act days, 10.9 percent was pretty low. Well, now it is 6.6 percent. That means literally thousands of Minnesotans can now go and get regular doctor care rather than just show up at the  Part of the way that we used the Affordable Care Act in Minnesota in the Fifth Congressional District is that the folks at HCMC set up something called Hennepin What Hennepin Health does is it says: We are going to take some of these Medicaid dollars and we are going to help people who are chronic users of the ER system. We are going to work with other agencies and other providers in the community to help house them stably and then do regular medical surveillance with them.  Do you know what has happened with this program?  The costs at the ER have dropped through the floor. The money has been[[Page H2010]]saved because of the Affordable Care Not only is it about the money--because if you talk to our Republican friends, all they want to talk about is money--something even more important has happened.                              {time}  2015  When you talk to the people who would go to the ER all the time, they are saying: I have somewhere to live. I have somebody who helps me stay on my medication. I am beginning to rebuild relationships with my family again. Schizophrenia can be very devastating to your mental health; and I was all out of control when I was off my meds, and I used to end up in the ER within an inch of my life. But now, because of the Affordable Care Act, I can get the care that I need, I can be stably housed, I can be productive in my community, I can be a participating family member again.  It has improved their lives.  I don't understand what the Republicans don't understand. It is a good thing to have people to have an option other than the  I heard one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say, well, in America, if you show up at a hospital, there is a Federal law that says they have got to take you.  It is true that if you show up at an ER, somebody is going to have to let you in there. They may move you from one hospital to another, but, eventually, the law does say you will end up with somebody seeing you.  Guess what the medical professionals say about it? It doesn't work. It is the most expensive care. It is usually left to people who have allowed an illness to fester and to go on and to advance, which makes it more difficult to treat, more expensive to treat. It is the wrong way to run a healthcare system.  Yet, people have a straight face and say things like, well, you know, you can go to the doctor if you need to. It is called the  This is absolutely not the right thing. And so here we are again, right at this hour where, really, things look kind of grave, and we need the American people to stand up and object. I tell you, we need people to say that they insist upon a humane society where a person suffering from schizophrenia, who is so afflicted by their illness that the only thing they can do is make it through the day and then, if they get sick, maybe somebody will take them to the  We should have a society where that person can get the care they need, can get housing that they need, can be cared for, and can be a participating member in our society with just a little bit more help.  I think that is what makes us That is the difference between us and them. We care about people. We believe people are inherently valuable and all have dignity, and we don't believe that you are only as worthy as what is in your pocket or your bank account. We reject that idea out of hand and believe that people must be--if you are too poor to work, too sick to work, too old to work, we believe our society should care for you; and I don't make any apologies to anybody for believing that.  I believe the government should do everything it can to make sure there are enough good-paying jobs for everybody. Lord knows we have got enough work to do around here, potholes here and there, school kids need help. We have got plenty of work to do. That is not the problem.  We have also got plenty of wealth. We have got plenty of wealth in our society. And I believe that if you live in this greatest of all countries in the world--and I believe that, I am so proud to be an American--and you are allowed to make a profit, which I believe in that, I am a former businessperson myself--I don't think it is asking you too much to put a little bit in the pot so some people who can't afford it can go to the doctor.  I don't think it is asking you too much to put a little bit in a pot so a kid can go to school, or so that a senior can get medication, or so that we can have clean water. I don't think it is too much.  But some people think it is too much to say that, even though I have been blessed by being an American and being able to pursue my economic dream, I don't want to give them anything. This is all for me.  I just don't--we are just not on the same page with that. We think that it is all right to make sure that we fund the basic necessities that people need to have a thriving, humane society, and that includes health care.  So tonight, I just want to say to people that it reminds me of a question that a lady asked Benjamin Franklin when Benjamin Franklin walked out of the Constitutional Congress in Philadelphia, way back so many years ago. The lady said to Benjamin Franklin: What do we have, Mr.Franklin? He said: A democracy if we can keep it.  Part of being a democratic society in this country right now means that we should have health care for people because this society can afford it. Part of what it means to have a civilized democracy in this moment means that people can rise up and lift their voices up to defend their right to have decent health care for all in this society; and we urge people to do that because it is the right thing to do, and this is the right time to do it.  So I want to just yield back to my friend from I will be taking my leave at this point, but I want to thank the gentleman for holding down this very important Special Order because the Affordable Care Act is worth fighting for.  As you said, Mr.Raskin, the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. What piece of legislation ever was?  We have amended the 1964 Civil Rights We have amended the 1965 Voting Rights We amend laws all the time because, as society changes and times change, the needs come up. But to just repeal and then not come anywhere close to replacing, it is wrong, and we must oppose it.

It guarantees access to affordable, high-quality health care as a right for all Backing out of this commitment is irresponsible, inexcusable, and reprehensible.  As a Member from a congressional district that houses some of the largest hospitals in the country, health is a crucial issue for my constituents. Under the ACA, millions of Americans now have access to affordable health care through individual marketplaces and Medicaid expansion. Children in New York can remain on their parents' plan through the age of 29. An insurance company cannot discriminate against patients with preexisting conditions.  Repeal will be detrimental to our healthcare systems and medical research community. Without a plan to[[Page H113]]replace the ACA, Republicans are openly gambling with the health care of millions, many of whom will be affected, like the elderly and disabled who cannot afford to return to the old system of skyrocketing costs.

An agency is required to look to see what regulations are out there that may be duplicative under the executive order. This requires them to tell us about it. Why would they want to hide from the American people that they are creating a duplicative regulation?  This is a simple transparency amendment that improves the quality of the underlying bill, improves the amount of information accessible to the public, and holds executive branch agencies accountable to make sure they are not putting unnecessary and duplicative burdens on the American people.

I appreciated the gentleman from Florida's comments, but I would just ask him: Why is the Republican leadership 5 months late in bringing a defense appropriations bill to the floor?  We could have done this months ago. So if there was this urgency, it seems to escape the Republican leadership.  I want to take issue with the gentlewoman from Wyoming when she says that what is important today and what we are debating today is only this Defense Appropriations bill.  As you know, we are currently debating the rule, and the rule is a tool used to set the House agenda and to prioritize consideration of legislation. For that very reason, this is, in fact, the appropriate time for us to explain to the American people what legislation we would like to prioritize, what is of grave concern to us, and what agenda we would like to pursue in this  The fact of the matter is that, as we are speaking, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee are marking up TrumpCare, which we know, in all likelihood, is going to result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance. We also are concerned that it is going to cost the American taxpayer a boatload of money.  What we are simply saying here today is that the Congressional Budget Office, which we fund and we rely on, ought to be able to give us a cost estimate, ought to tell us how much this is going to add to our deficit, how much it is going to cost the American people, how many people are going to lose their health care.  Why in the world would you rush a major piece of legislation through committee and onto the floor without even knowing what you are talking about?  I mean, this process constitutes mindless legislating. This is not doing your job, and that is all we are requesting.  We can argue over whether or not you like the Affordable Care Act or you don't. But whatever you are going to do, we ought to bring it to the floor with everybody's eyes wide open and knowing what the impacts are going to be.  Talk about lack of transparency, this TrumpCare bill was under lock and key until just a couple of days ago. It was the best-kept secret in the world. For 7 years, my friends have been talking about a replacement bill. No one ever saw it. But all of a sudden, it is brought out before the American people at a press conference and, again, in a way that doesn't answer a lot of questions. It is being rushed through committee, and it is going to be rushed onto the House floor. That is not a good process.  I will remind my colleagues that when the Affordable Care Act was considered here in the House, the House held 79 bipartisan hearings and markups on the health insurance reform in 2009 and 2010. You have held no hearings. There has been no expert testimony, no healthcare professionals, no doctors, no patients, no nurses, no families, nothing. There have been no hearings. The bill went right to markup.  House Members spent nearly 100 hours in hearings, heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle, considered 239 amendments, both Democratic and Republican, accepted 21 amendments. Again, there have been no hearings.  In markup, the Energy and Commerce Committee adopted 24 GOP amendments. In markup, the Education and the Workforce Committee adopted six GOP amendments. The original House bill was posted online for 30 days before the first committee began their markup and more than 100 days before the tricommittees formally introduced their merged bill in the  House Democrats posted their first House bill online for the promised 72-hour review. The Senate bill voted on in the House was online for 3 months, and the reconciliation bill was online for 72 hours of review before the final vote.  House Democrats heard and answered questions from constituents at more than 3,000 healthcare townhalls and public events. Tens of thousands of emails, calls, and letters were logged in congressional offices to register public comment. My friends are busy trying to avoid public town meetings.  I am just simply saying that we are raising this issue because we are deeply concerned about the prospect of millions of Americans losing health care and about you adding God knows what to our deficit. I don't think it is too much to come together in a bipartisan way to say: Let us know what the costs are going to be, let us know what the impacts are going to be. And if you still want to vote for TrumpCare, you can vote for it, but you ought to know what you are voting for.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Last month, Russia secretly deployed two batteries of new nuclear-capable cruise missiles. North Korea test-launched four ballistic missiles just this week, and China continues to bolster its military presence in the South China Sea, while going toward a naval fleet that may surpass 351 ships by 2020.  Meanwhile, our own Navy is the smallest it has been in 99 years, satisfying only 40 percent of the demand from regional commanders. Fifty-four percent of the Air Force's major weapons systems now qualify for antique vehicle license plates in the State of  The Army, to quote the Vice Chief of Staff, is ``outraged, outgunned, and outdated.''  These are the bitter fruits of defense sequester; defense sequester which must be pulled out, root and branch.

It is also dangerous. So today, while I speak in support of this rule and this bill, I applaud the Appropriations Committee for its critical work, and I urge my colleagues to support final passage.  This is just the first step. We will not have fulfilled our first and foremost constitutional duty to keep the country safe until we have completely eliminated defense sequester and truly begun the process of restoring peace through strength.  Einstein's words are as true today as they were in 1931, when he said of America: ``The part of passive spectator is unworthy of this country and is bound in the end to lead to disaster all around.''  If we do not act now to rebuild and modernize our military, if we continue to play the role of passive spectator, not only will it lead to disaster, at some point we will no longer be worthy of global leadership.  So to my colleague, I will say that this is our job. This is our most basic job. So let's do what the American people sent us here to do to keep the country safe, restore peace through strength.

When it was first discovered, it started bringing people out to the West, out to Colorado, to a place now known as Confluence Park, where the two rivers come together.  At Confluence Park in Denver, if you look, there is a plaque on one of the walls there that has a poem written on it from Colorado poet laureate Thomas Hornsby It is a poem known as ``Two Rivers'' describing the settlement of the The poem ends with this:       I wasn't here, yet I remember them.       That first night long ago, those wagon people       Who pushed aside enough of the cottonwoods       To build our city where the blueness rested.  ``Where the optimistic blueness of our Colorado skies rests against the mountains and the plains'' is a good description of our great We are reminded about how incredibly diverse our great Nation is, its people and its geography. Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court helps recognize the diversity in geography, the diversity of our country, and it helps to recognize that indeed there are highly qualified jurists who reside west of the Mississippi  Judge Gorsuch is a fourth-generation He is a skier. He is a fly-fisherman. He serves on a court that represents 20 percent of our Nation's landmass.  Once confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will be only the second Coloradan to have ever served on the Nation's highest The first Coloradan to serve on the High Court was Justice Byron Justice Byron White also led the NFL in rushing, which is something Neil Gorsuch won't be able to claim when he is confirmed but is certainly something that makes his confirmation as the second Coloradan unique in our history. Should he be confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will also make history as he represents the first Generation X Justice of the U.Supreme Court, the emerging generation of American leadership.  Judge Gorsuch was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court unanimously by voice vote in this Chamber in 2006. In fact, 12 current Democratic Senators did not oppose his confirmation, including three distinguished members of the Judiciary Ranking Member Feinstein, Senator Leahy, and Senator Durbin are all members of the Judiciary Committee who supported, through voice vote, his nomination. Eleven years ago, Senator Graham presided over an empty committee dais as Neil Gorsuch faced his confirmation in 2006. No one showed up. What a difference a court can make. The level of bipartisan support for his 2006 nomination is almost unheard of in today's political climate, but when you look at his record, his writings, and his statements, it is easy to see why Judge Gorsuch has such overwhelming support.  Judge Gorsuch is not an ideologue. He is a mainstream jurist who follows the law as written and doesn't try to supplant it with his own personal policy preferences. As he said, ``Personal politics or policy preferences have no useful role in judging; regular and healthy doses of self-skepticism and humility about one's own abilities and conclusions always do.''  Judge Gorsuch is not an activist judge but, rather, a faithful adherent to and ardent defender of our Judge Gorsuch said that judges have a ``foundational duty'' to ``do more than merely consider [the Constitution]. . . . They take an oath to uphold it.''  The judge recognizes that the judiciary is not the place for social or constitutional experimentation and that efforts to engage in such experimentation delegitimize the As he said, ``This overweening addiction to the courtroom as the place to debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the judiciary. . . . As a society, we lose the benefit of the give-and-take of the political process and the flexibility of social experimentation that only the elected branches can provide.''  Judge Gorsuch has a deep appreciation and respect for the constitutional principle of federalism and the separation of powers prescribed by our Founding As he stated, ``A firm and independent judiciary is critical to a well-functioning democracy.''  Judge Gorsuch understands the advantage of democratic institutions and the special authority and legitimacy that come from the consent of the governed. As he said, ``Judges must allow the elected branches of government to flourish and citizens, through their elected representatives, to make laws appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the day.''  Judge Gorsuch appreciates the rule of law and respects the considered judgment of those who came before him. As he said, ``A good judge will seek to honor precedent and strive to avoid its disparagement or displacement.''  It is this appropriate temperament, this fidelity to the Constitution, this remarkable humility that has made Judge Gorsuch such a consensus pick among Colorado's diverse legal and legislative communities.  Former Colorado Senator, Democrat Ken Salazar, Secretary of the Interior under Barack Obama, in praising Judge Gorsuch's temperament, said during his circuit court confirmation:       [A] judicial nominee should have a demonstrated dedication      to fairness, impartiality, precedent, and the avoidance of      judicial activism--from both the left and the right. I      believe that Mr.Gorsuch meets this very high test.  A very prominent Colorado lawyer and former adviser to President Bill Clinton said:       Judge Gorsuch's intellect, energy, and deep regard for the      Constitution are well known to those of us who have worked      with him and have seen firsthand his commitment to basic      principles. Above all, this independence, fairness, and      impartiality are the hallmarks of his career and his well-     earned reputation.  Hundreds of prominent liberal and conservative Colorado attorneys support Judge Gorsuch, writing this bipartisan letter of support praising the judge:       We hold a diverse set of political views as Republicans,      Democrats, and Many of us have been critical of      actions taken by President Nonetheless, we all agree      that Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally well qualified to join      the Supreme He deserves an up-or-down vote.  The people who know him best in Colorado--they have worked with him[[Page S1872]]in the Tenth Circuit Court, and they have worked with him in private practice--believe that he deserves an up-or-down vote, believe that he is exceptionally well qualified to join the Supreme  One of the individuals, one of the lawyers, one of the Democrats who signed that very letter, who wrote this phrase, was a Democrat who was the cochairman of the host committee for the Democratic National Convention in Denver in 2008 that saw the nomination of then-Senator Barack Obama to be the Democratic candidate for the 2008 ticket.  Colorado's former Democratic Governor Bill Ritter and former Republican Attorney General John Suthers jointly said:       It is time to use this confirmation process to examine and      exalt the characteristics of a judge who demonstrates that he      or she is scholarly, compassionate, committed to the law, and      will function as part of a truly independent, apolitical      judiciary. Judge Gorsuch fits that bill.  Judge Gorsuch has a consistent record of applying the law fairly, and his reputation among his peers and lawmakers is evidence of it.  According to the Denver Post, Marcy Glenn, a Denver attorney and Democrat, recalls two cases before Gorsuch in which she represented underdogs, and she said: ``He issued a decision that most certainly focused on the little guy.''  That same article cited another example. ``Judge Gorsuch can't be pigeonholed as either pro-prosecution or pro-defense,'' said Peter Krumholz, a Denver appellate attorney who reviewed the nominee's criminal law record. ``He is very independent and will not hesitate to rule in favor of a criminal defendant's rights when he thinks it's warranted by the Constitution.''  For all these reasons cited today and the many reasons that have been cited over the past several weeks, I am certain Judge Gorsuch will make Colorado proud and that his opinions will have a positive impact on this country for generations to come.  I look forward to Judge Gorsuch receiving a fair hearing today, tomorrow, and after that, to working with my distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle to expeditiously confirm his nomination.  Thomas Hornsby Ferril, a great poet laureate, wrote another poem. This one is memorialized on a mural painted in the rotunda of the Colorado capitol. It ends with these words: ``Beyond the sundown is tomorrow's wisdom. Today is going to be long, long ago.''  The wisdom of Neil Gorsuch, guardian of the Constitution, will serve our Nation well for generations to come.

In reality, the only thing President Obama tried to protect was the jobs of bureaucrats at the expense of hardworking This rule adds no new environmental protections. It only duplicates what Federal and State regulators are already doing to protect the environment.  Additionally, this rule could close off as much as half of the U.coal reserves for mining. The bureaucrats writing this rule did not truly understand the impact of this because, in the 7 years they took to write it, no one bothered to visit an actual mine.

12048,topic-id,1023,"Mr.Pisesident, I have fought for years toprotect our Nation's seniors from abuse and exploitation, initially, as former Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, formerChairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and more recently, as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary  This past June, Ichaired a Judiciary Committee hearing on Protecting Older Americans from Financial At the hearing, we heard aboutnumerous scams in which seniors were targeted time after time, resulting in their being defrauded, often with devastatingconsequences. We also heard that many older Americans don't report instances of elder abuse or exploitation due toembarrassment, a refusal to acknowledge that they were victimized, or reliance on the perpetrator as their caretaker.  Sadly,these accounts of elder abuse are nothing new. What has changed is that the scams targeting seniors are becoming increasinglysophisticated. That is one of the reasons why elder financial exploitation has been dubbed ``the crime of the 21stcentury.''  I have made it a top priority to get the Federal Government to step up its efforts to fight the abuse, neglect,and financial exploitation of our Nation's seniors.  Last year, I called on the Justice Department to outline its efforts toprevent and respond to instances of elder abuse. First, I sent a letter to the Department to find out what it's doing to protectseniors from a new and particularly troubling form of exploitation: the photographing and online publication of nursing homeresidents in embarrassing and compromising situations.  I also sent a letter to inquire about the Department's efforts tofight imposter scams, in which fraudsters pose as employees of the IRS or another government agency, in order to depriveordinary Americans of millions of dollars of their hard earned money. And as tax season approaches once again, it's criticalthat folks watch out for these deceitful scams.  I also asked about the data the Department is collecting on financialexploitation, as well as how this data is being used to support Federal efforts to protect America's seniors.  In its responseto my inquiries, the Justice Department effectively admitted that it falls short in several respects. The Department said thatit ``does not collect data on the prevalence of elder financial exploitation nationwide.'' Further, the Department said that itcan't provide statistical information on the number of cases it has prosecuted for elder financial exploitation.  What allthis means is that we are not getting the full picture of elder financial exploitation.  We do know that some older Americans'trusting and polite nature, combined with their hard-earned retirement savings, make them particularly attractive targets forfraudsters. We also know that the abuse and exploitation of older Americans is on the rise and it can take manyforms.  Financial exploitation is the most widespread form of elder abuse, costing America's seniors between an estimated $2.9billion and $36 billion annually. But, sadly, its costs aren't limited to the negative effect on seniors' bank accounts. Victimssuffer all sorts of negative effects, including diminished health, loss of independence, and psychological distress.  It isestimated that up to 37 percent of seniors in the United States are affected by some form of financial exploitation in any 5-year period.  In my home State of Iowa, so-called grandparent scams are on the rise. In these scams, fraudsters presentthemselves to an older American as a grandchild in distress, hoping to convince the grandparent to send cash or give out acredit card number.  Con artists are also using sweepstakes scams to steal money from seniors. A senior is called and toldthey have won a prize or sum of money. But before they can claim the supposed prize, the victim is required to pay taxes orprocessing fees. Once the money is paid to cover the taxes and fees, however, no prize ever materializes.  Other instances ofelder financial exploitation are more personal in nature and have especially devastating effects. Some victims are pressuredinto signing over a deed, modifying a will, or giving a power of attorney. Americans have lost their farms, homes, and lifesavings to this form of fraud.  In short, elder abuse and exploitation is a serious problem, and it demands a strong response.It requires all of us to work together in a collaborative way.  So, today I am proud to introduce the Elder Abuse Preventionand Prosecution I thank my colleagues--Senators Blumenthal, Tillis, Klobuchar, and Cornyn forcollaborating with me on this comprehensive and bipartisan bill's development and for joining as original cosponsors. It takes amulti-pronged approach to combating the abuse and financial exploitation of our nation's senior citizens.  We have heard aneed for specialized prosecutors and more focused efforts to combat abuse and exploitation. That is why the bill directs theAttorney General to designate at least one federal prosecutor in each U.Attorney's Office to serve as an Elder JusticeCoordinator for that district.  To ensure that elder abuse is a priority for the Federal Trade Commission and the JusticeDepartment, the bill also calls for each agency to have an Elder Justice  We also need to send a strong messagethat efforts to target our Nation's seniors won't be tolerated. That is why the bill enhances elder victims' access torestitution and increases penalties for criminals who use telemarketing or email in their schemes to defraud seniors.  Thebill also requires that the Justice Department partner with the Department of Health and Human Services to provide training andtechnical assistance to State and local governments on the investigation, prevention, prosecution, and mitigation of elder abuseand neglect.  Finally we have heard about the need for more data on financial exploitation[[Page S362]]and the government'sresponse. Gathering accurate information about elder abuse is not only crucial to understanding the scope of the problem, but itis also essential in determining where resources should be allocated. So, the bill helps to accomplish that.  It requires thatdata be collected from federal prosecutors and law enforcement in cases where an older American was the target of abuse orexploitation.  These and other reforms included in the bill are the product of a truly bipartisan effort, as well as insightfrom key stakeholders and those who've been battling elder financial exploitation on the front lines.  This 21st century crimerequires a 21st century response. The Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act takes a strong step toward protecting ourNation's seniors, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-20-pt1-PgS361-3.txt,457,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1301, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE",2017.0,20.0,March
11785,topic-id,545,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong opposition to this resolution, which would put coal company profits ahead of clean water and public health. The stream protection rule has been in development for 7 years and puts in place modest, commonsense protections for people who live near coal mines.  This isn't just a rule to protect streams. This is a rule to protect people's health, to protect people's homes, and to protect the clean water that they rely on. These folks felt strongly enough about this rule to submit public comments.  The rule is designed to protect people like Donetta from West Virginia, who nearly lost her life when chemicals from coal fields found their way into her water supply and interacted with her medication in such a way that it nearly destroyed her liver.  The rule is designed to protect people like John from Alabama, who reports lakes that have turned gray and streams that have turned orange.  This rule is designed to protect people like David from Tennessee, who watched a creek near his grandmother's home become lifeless due to strip mining nearby.  This rule is designed to protect people like Josh from North Carolina, who can no longer fish in the streams near a family home and wants coal companies to be held accountable for the damage that they did.  This rule is designed to protect people like Jonita from Kentucky, a coal miner's daughter whose water supply is tainted with heavy metal and other toxins from coal sludge. She wrote: ``Coal put the food on my table. It also put the poison in my water. Reasonable trade-off?''  I don't believe that Jonita or anyone else should have to make that trade-off. No one's water supply should be sacrificed in the name of higher bonuses for coal company Those coal executives have made it their overriding goal to kill this regulation; and after spending nearly $50 million on political campaign contributions over the past 6 years, they now have a Congress and a President to do it.  So for the first time in 16 years and just the second time ever, Republicans are going back to Newt Gingrich's playbook and trying to successfully use the Congressional Review Act simply because the coal industry feels like it shouldn't be held accountable.  But as we know, this is only the first of five regulations that we will be repealing just this week. Later today, they are going to get rid of the rule[[Page H841]]that requires increased transparency on the part of oil, gas, and the mining industry. Later this week, we will be fighting for the right of oil and gas companies to pollute the air with methane.  This is the Republican agenda in the age of Trump; an attack on clean water, an attack on clean air, an attack on transparency, and an attack on human health. If you are a CEO or a wealthy Republican donor, this is great news; and you will love the next couple of years. But if you are an ordinary American that depends on their government to hold companies accountable through tough but fair enforcement of regulations, you should be extremely worried.

Clean drinking water is a fundamental health need, and meeting that need is one of our most basic responsibilities in this We must not put special interests ahead of the health of our constituents.  The stream protection rule is very simple:  It strengthens and clarifies existing water quality protections with respect to mining.  It requires that affected streams be restored when mining is finished.  It gives communities accurate information about water quality so they can best protect themselves from pollution.  Mr.Speaker, these protections are not onerous, but their benefits are vast.  We have seen in Flint, Michigan, and elsewhere the painful consequences when people lack access to safe drinking water. We must do more to prevent that kind of suffering and damage. Nixing this rule would, instead, mean that we are doing less.  The stream protection rule is the product of a careful year's-long process.

The CRA was going to cause significant and lasting harm.  If successful, two things are going to happen: the regulation is void and the agency is prohibited from issuing another similar rule ever again.  I mention that because this is about health. It is about the health of the people living around those mining operations and it is about mountaintop removal and the documented analysis[[Page H846]]that proves that it is a danger to health. It contaminates water and it is destructive to the environment.  It is curious that we had 13 hearings--I stand corrected--and an investigation that went on in perpetuity, it seemed like. Yet, once the rule was finalized and published in 2015, we never had another hearing on the item again, which begs the question: If the whole point was to delay and prevent this rule from ever taking effect and, more importantly, make it susceptible to the Congressional Review Act, mission accomplished for the majority.  But the long-term consequences of using the CRA on a rule that is designed to protect people's health, on a rule that is designed to make coal companies be transparent and disclose to the public, on a rule that every scientific analysis and the science is clear that this rule was indeed there to protect both people and communities, I think that is the permanent harm being done by this action today--denying the people in those communities to return to past practices that created the problem that we are dealing with and that this rule attempted to address that created that problem.  Now we return to those times where unregulated mountaintop removal causes the destruction to both human beings and the environment that we see as a legacy. I think it is not only disrespectful to the people of those regions, but it, again, puts their health and the well-being of both the environment and humanity in that area at major risk.

11817,topic-id,373,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.DeFazio), my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I have been involved for 28 years on the Natural Resources Committee on these issues.  What we are talking about today is simple here. Yes, it is cheaper. If you blow the top off a mountain and you dump it in the valley and you bury a stream, it is cheaper.  Is that what we are all about here? The most destructive, least environmentally responsible, but cheapest way of doing things?  If we are going to set the precedent here, I can think of a whole lot of other areas that relate to clean water, clean air, and things that are important to the American people and the sustainability of our environment that will go away because it would be cheaper. If we can just dump the waste out the back door of the factory, that is cheaper.                              {time}  1500  If we can just put whatever we want up the stack and people wear gas masks, that is cheaper. That is the major argument we are hearing today. This rule, a 100-foot buffer--a 100-foot buffer--for toxic materials around streams is too expensive. It is cheaper to blow the top off the mountain, get the coal out, and take all the overburden and other assorted stuff and dump it in the valley and bury the stream.  The only problem is then it rains. What happens when it rains? Well, you can either cap that whole thing and make it impermeable and then have big runoff downstream or, as it generally happens, the water percolates down through all the waste and becomes a toxic flow.  Now, you say, well, these are only seasonal streams. Well, seasonal streams run into other streams. What happens when you get those toxic flows is you kill the other streams. I am seeing this actually in my district, not from a coal mine, but from a foreign corporation which improperly mined and went bankrupt and left us with the waste. I have seen the miles of stream that are killed from the toxics that are leaching out from the overburden from the mining that is done. This is an absurd place to say we are overregulated.

11906,topic-id,1539,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to oppose this effort by my good colleague from Alaska and by congressional Republicans to, in my view, turn back the clock 100 years on the management of our native wildlife on our national wildlife refuges in  Since 2002, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has embraced what some have called a politically driven and even unscientific regime of intensive predator control. I think it is helpful to look at the views of a former Governor of Alaska, Tony Knowles, who recently commented in High Country News:       The most disappointing thing is that the balance of the      views on the Board of Game has disappeared. I tried to work      with a balanced board that reflected subsistence hunters,      sport hunters, guides and conservationists, but now the board      is made up of people who want to make hunting ungulates the      priority for wildlife management.       There's been a focused effort to dramatically reduce      populations of wolves, coyotes, and bears, and the methods      and means they've used are both unscientific and unethical.  That is not my quote, but that of former Governor Tony Knowles of  In addition, in the past decade, the Alaska Board of Game and the department have turned their back, I think, on a long history of not only working together between Federal and State agencies but embracing ethics as central to wildlife management--not just to maintain the viability of that management but to maintain the support of the public for that management.  This relatively new approach that actively seeks to eschew the long history of embracing sporting ethics can best be summed up by a quote from Doug Vincent-Land, the former director of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Division of Wildlife He said: ``The professionals at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game did not feel it was our role to judge the ethics of these practices.''  The result of this ethics-free approach is now glaringly obvious, when considering some of the methods of take that have been approved over time for native predators in Shooting mother grizzlies with cubs, aerial gunning of wolves, killing wolf pups in their dens, using spotlights at bear dens, baiting of bears, and allowing the wanton waste of black bear meat are a few of the practices that Alaska's Board of Game has approved.  Aldo Leopold, the father of modern wildlife conservation, once said: ``Ethical behavior is doing the right thing[[Page S1867]]when no one else is watching--even when doing the wrong thing is legal.''  Now, I know it has become fashionable in some hunting circles recently to ignore the importance of ethics to our way of life. Yet, if our greatest leaders are any indication, that is, at best, a slippery slope to irrelevance.  This cartoon is a good reminder. It is from the early 20th century, at a time when President Teddy Roosevelt was invited down to Mississippi for a black bear hunt. When he wasn't successful, they tied a black bear to a tree. I think that cartoon from that period is a good reminder of how T.viewed the importance of sportsmanship and ethics in hunting as central to what maintains our credibility. Today, politicians jump at the chance to embrace his reputation, but too often they have not followed his example. So while shooting down grizzlies with cubs may be legal, I suspect the public will never view it as ethical. I have to wonder what good old T.would have to say about recent decisions to allow things like unlimited bag limits on black bear cubs or baiting of bears and shooting female grizzlies with cubs.  So why does all of this ethics stuff matter so much to hunters? Why does it matter to me? It matters because hunters like me are a small minority of the population in this country. We are less than 5 percent, by most counts, and we are able to carry on this great tradition because the vast majority--the nonhunting public, which is 95 percent of the population--sees us as effective and ethical stewards of our country's native wildlife. We have embraced the North American model of wildlife conservation that has literally brought elk, deer, wild turkey, and species we think of as common today--Canada geese, for example--back from the brink of extinction, and that public shares in that success when they enjoy wildlife. That is true, even if they never hunt, never pick up a fishing poll. We as hunters also have the trust and the respect of the public because we are willing to literally spend billions of dollars of our own money to protect, conserve, and manage those resources with the best available science.  The Alaska Game Board's decision to ignore the latest science on the importance of predators to healthy prey populations is indicative of a desire to effectively turn caribou and moose populations into livestock and to manage for maximum numbers and maximum tag revenue.  Now, ironically, that approach has certainly been ineffective at boosting and maintaining historically high caribou and moose numbers.  This is an example of a graph of moose population over time. We can see back in 2002, when these sorts of intensive take measures went into place: intensive predator control, preintensive management, and postintensive management. If you can discern a consistent correlation of an outcome of higher moose numbers there, you are doing better than  This would all be fine if this was just happening on State lands in Alaska, perchance. But, unfortunately, the Alaska Game Board now seeks to suppress healthy predator populations on our national wildlife refuges--the very places set aside to protect and preserve our native wildlife--even predators, even black bears and grizzlies and wolves. Let that sink in for a moment.  This is about embracing unscientific wildlife management on the very refuges that belong to each and every American citizen--not Alaska State land but our national wildlife refuges.  People save up for years--sometimes decades--to travel thousands of miles to go to places like the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge so they can see a grizzly bear fish for salmon. Does it make sense to allow these kinds of extreme measures of take to allow for grizzlies with cubs to be killed in those refuges? Will these policies actually benefit the hunting public? I would argue that they do not.  Not one of my colleagues can deny how much I love to hunt and fish. Many of my life's best memories have been forged around the campfire with my friends and family at elk camp. Just this past Christmas break, both of my boys joined me for what would be my son Carter's very first elk hunt. This is the picture of us in the Continental Divide Wilderness Study  After days of hard hunting, hiking miles through the rough and tumble backcountry of the Continental Divide WSA, my son Carter harvested his first elk.  He soon learned that the real work starts after you pull the trigger. He labored long and hard to make sure that every scrap of meat from that animal made its way from the wilderness to our freezer. Anything less would be unethical and disrespectful to that magnificent animal. My son takes great pride in the meals that elk provides for our family and our friends. He also knows that hunting is conservation and that we have a responsibility to hand these wildlife resources off to the next generation unimpaired. I am proud that even at 13 he takes that responsibility very seriously.  Some of my son's classmates in school are vegetarians. Too many of those who do eat meat think that it is created, as my colleague from Alaska said, on a Styrofoam platter wrapped in cellophane. Carter knows better. As someone who hunts and fully embraces the ideas of sustainability and ethics, the next generation of sports men and women couldn't have a better ambassador to this new generation of millennials for why hunting is actually critical to the future of wildlife.  That, my friends, is what this CRA before us, in my view, puts at risk.  When you vote to put the Federal stamp of approval on methods of take that the public views as objectionable--even unethical--when you allow that ideologically driven style of game management to even permeate the sanctity of our national wildlife refuges, I don't think that is standing up for hunters. I fear that it is endangering the future of something that is critical to culture and way of life.  As I said before, the number of active hunters in the United States today sits, I think, at around 5 percent, or maybe a little lower--I hope not. By voting for this CRA, we are risking the confidence of the general public in our ability as hunters to be the best stewards of our wildlife resources. That is a risk that I am not willing to take.  So I would urge all of my colleagues to stand up for our Nation's wildlife, to stand up for our national wildlife refuges, and to vote no on this proposal.  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

11782,topic-id,987,"Mr.President, I come here again today on what is a sad day and really a sad week for law enforcement in North Dakota, for the community of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, and certainly for the family of Colt Eugene  Colt was a deputy in the Rolette County Sheriff's Office who tragically lost his life in the line of duty last Wednesday night near Belcourt, Colt joined in a high-speed chase with several fellow officers Wednesday evening after a report and identification of a stolen vehicle. As the stolen vehicle was coming to a forced stop, shots were fired, and the call came over the radio that shakes all of North Dakota law enforcement and our entire State to the core: ``Officer down.''  Colt never got back up that evening, succumbing to his injuries not very far from the small community where he grew up. He leaves behind five beautiful young children, including a stepdaughter; his fiance, Alexandria; his grandparents, Gene and Rita Allery, who raised him; his family, his friends, and a community that will miss his constant smile and playful attitude.  He also leaves behind his fellow deputies and colleagues in the Rolette County Sheriff's I know this is an incredibly tough time right now for Rolette County Sheriff Medrud and his deputies as well. I know that the people across the State of North Dakota and I have your back during this difficult time.  This is now the second time in less than a year that I have come to the floor of the U.Senate to talk about the heroism and service of one of North Dakota's peace officers--one of those peace officers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.  It is heartbreaking to have to stand here yet again to make one of these speeches in recognition of a North Dakota peace officer. In fact, during my 8 years as North Dakota's attorney general, I saw two deaths, two violent deaths of peace officers in my In less than a year, we have two.[[Page S416]]  Talking to many of my friends in law enforcement in my State, they will tell you that the business of law enforcement and the work of law enforcement in our State have become more and more dangerous and more and more challenging. As I have said many times--and I will say it again here today--North Dakota has the finest peace officers in the entire country. Colt Allery personified that dedication of our peace officers to protect and serve their communities.  Losing an officer in the line of duty is always devastating, but in States like North Dakota, where we often say we know everyone, Colt's loss is being felt in communities across the Colt and his family will know that the entire State mourns his loss and that we had his back in this life and we will have theirs as they struggle with this incredible and unimaginable loss.  Growing up in John, ND, and as an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, Colt never strayed far from home. And he made a commitment to do more than just be part of his community, he made a commitment to protect his community as a peace officer.  Colt started out as a corrections officer for Rolette After graduating from law enforcement training academy, he started work in the Rolla Police He then went to serve his fellow tribal members as a tribal police officer of Turtle Mountain before recently moving to the Rolette County Sheriff's  In North Dakota, we have a proud history of peace officers like Colt serving their State and local communities with distinction. I have had the privilege over my years in public service to work with law enforcement officials, from highway patrol, to State and local officers, to various Federal officers and our tribal police, and I will tell you again that these are some of the finest men and women I have ever worked with. These are the men and women--just like Colt--who could have chosen a different path. Instead, they chose to take the oath to protect and serve. They chose to selflessly put themselves in harm's way so they could make North Dakota a safer place for each and every person who lives there or who may by chance be passing through. They chose to put the needs of others before their own needs and, in fact, before their own families' needs. They chose a more difficult path to tread than most of us would be willing to follow.

They have been meeting now for over 24 hours, without sleep, without rest, without reflection, and with no opportunity, Mr.Speaker, for the American people to see what is going on. In the dead of night, out of the sight of the public, they are hiding their bill and rushing to judgment.  Why? Because they know, as they have seen in town meeting after town meeting after town meeting--that is, of course, those Republicans who have had town meetings--that the American public is extraordinarily concerned and worried they are going to lose the health care that they receive through the Affordable Care  They are concerned about the premiums and deductibles that they have to pay skyrocketing because of the Republican bill that is being proposed. They are concerned that Medicare and Medicaid are going to be decimated and the life of Medicare reduced in terms of its ability to pay the benefits promised.

They haven't had any hearings on this bill, but they have had town meetings, and every American has seen the reporting on that, angry Americans fearful that they are going to lose benefits absolutely critical to them and their families.  They continued marking up this bill through the night, using the very same tactics they claimed we were using when considering the Affordable Care We had over 79 hearings not in the middle of the night, but during the day. We had over 181 witnesses. That is opposed to zero--zero--witnesses on this bill. It gives a lie to the representation of transparency and openness and accountability that our Speaker has said he would operate this House to ensure that those happened.  They used the same tactics that they claim, as I said, that we were considering. In fact, here is what Tom Price, who was then a member of the House of Representatives, now the Secretary of the Health and Human Services, said: ``The negotiations are obviously being done in secret and the American people really just want to know what they are trying to hide.''  He said that on January 6, 2010.  180 witnesses, 79 hearings, a year and a half or more of consideration, yet we have a bill that was introduced Monday night. Today is Monday night it was introduced, and no hearings. Wednesday, deep into the night, and this morning this bill is being marked up.  Kevin Brady, the chairman of the Committee on Way and Means, who held a markup until 4:30 a.m., said this: ``I think there is never a more critical time for the American public to weigh in on an important issue than on health care today and there is a lot about this bill we don't know.''  He said that in a townhall August 10, 2009. Well, now he is chairman of the committee, and apparently he has decided that the American public doesn't need to know now. When we were in charge, he thought the public needed to know, and that is why we had those 79 hearings and 181 witnesses and townhalls, thousands of meetings and townhalls around the country on the Affordable Care But Mr.Brady apparently doesn't think that is applicable when he is in charge of the committee.  Then Speaker, now former Speaker John Boehner said this: ``Can you say it was done openly, with transparency and accountability? Without backroom deals struck behind closed doors, hidden from the people? Hell, no, you can't.''  But now the shoe is on the other foot, and my Republican colleagues are in charge. They are full speed ahead, and the doors are closed, the windows are shuttered, and the blinds are drawn.  The process we had in 2009 and 2010 to write and adopt the Affordable Care Act included, as I said, 79 hearings versus zero hearings on this bill. 181 witnesses that I have referred to. Zero witnesses, zero Americans included from the public in this process. We had a 2-year process that was open and recognized how consequential the[[Page H1955]]legislation would be, ensuring that Americans from all over the country, including doctors, healthcare organizations, providers, insurance companies, average citizens could weigh in.  Now in their rush to pass their repeal, Republicans are doing everything they said was wrong and much more. Republicans are terrified that the American people will find out what is in this bill. The problem they have is a lot of their Members have found out what is in this bill, and they don't like it. Hardly any newspaper in America likes it. We think the public is thinking they are moving too fast and are going to hurt them. They are afraid, however, of having to face angry constituents who will see that this bill will take healthcare coverage away from 20 million Americans and cause out-of-pocket costs to go up for millions more. This bill could destabilize even the employer-based insurance market. That is people who know nothing about the exchange, but they have insurance through their employer. This bill will destabilize their insurance as well.  The point is, Mr.Speaker, we don't know for sure how bad it is. We know it is bad, and that is information we ought to have before being asked to vote on the floor or in committee on such consequential legislation. My Republican friends say, well, we will have a CBO score by the time we consider it on the floor. But they don't want that information out for very long because it is going to be very negative.  Democrats will continue, Mr.Speaker, to do everything in our power to slow down this process and throw back the curtain Republicans have pulled over this bill and this process in an attempt to hide the details of their dangerous plan from the American people. We are ready, as I said, to turn the lights out in this Chamber before we let the Republican repeal bill turn the lights out on coverage and care for millions of our fellow I do not yield my conviction to oppose this bill as strongly, as long as I possibly can.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1954.txt,566,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF,2017.0,9.0,March

11791,topic-id,316,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this attempt to politically override the Interior Department's stream protection rule.  Much like the destructive mountaintop removal practice that this rule is designed to prevent, this Republican assault on the environment and the health of coal mining communities is a crude and dirty process.  Using the Congressional Review Act, a single hour in Congress is going to be enough to remove a rule that reflects 7 years of national public debate, including at least 30 stakeholder meetings, over 100,000 public comments. This blows up the regular legislative and regulatory process, ignores science, marginalizes public health, and puts communities at risk.  Let me be clear: when the coal dust settles on this devastating resolution, it certainly won't be Members of Congress who are left drinking polluted drinking water or battling lung cancer, heart disease, and birth defects.  Much like the coal executives who profit from exhausting and polluting the natural resources of these communities, the GOP will move on to the next target and look for the next way to let business off the hook, to let them externalize their costs to the environment, to local communities, and, ultimately, to the U.taxpayers who have to clean up the mess.  But communities in the Appalachian Mountains, vital salmon streams in Alaska, and much-needed water supplies across this country will be left dealing with the aftermath, while our Republican colleagues boast about having provided so-called regulatory relief.  For all the talk about coal jobs from Republicans and our new President, you would think they would care just a little about protecting the health of these coal miners and their families and their communities. And yet, when given a chance to protect the water quality of 6,000 miles of streams in coal country, this House is choosing to side with the polluting industry instead.  That is shameful, and we should oppose this wrong-headed resolution.  ",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgH840.txt,2101,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF,2017.0,1.0,February

12121,topic-id,796,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  Simply put, Mr.Speaker, this amendment restricts the President from making public statements to promote his own business interests in the same way that the bill restricts statements by agencies on pending rules. If we intend to hold agencies accountable for their statements, we should certainly be willing to hold the President of the United States to those same standards. Donald Trump's enormous web of business interests and conflicts of interest make it clear that it is necessary to explicitly expand this restriction to the  It is deeply disturbing, Mr.Speaker, that the President has refused to release his tax returns or create a blind trust for the proceeds of his assets. Numerous U.Presidents have placed their financial holdings into a blind trust that is managed by a trustee without any input from the This allows for the President to minimize any conflicts of interest and any suggestion that the Presidency of the United States is being used for his own personal profits.  This President, however, has avoided those calls for him to sell his assets or place them into a blind trust. Instead, documents obtained through public records requests show that President Trump has moved the assets over, just in name, to his son and a longtime employee, but that Trump himself, the President of the United States, is the sole beneficiary of all of those trusts.  In other words, there is no wall erected between his businesses and his Presidency, and anyone who wants to buy influence can simply do so openly. His entire Presidency can be seen as a promotion of his business interests and be used by domestic and foreign governments to curry favor and produce benefit to his personal empire.  Trump Tower in D.is one example of this. The building, which is leased to him by the Federal Government, stipulates in its lease that ``any elected official of the Government of the United States'' may not derive any benefit from that agreement. At 12:01 p.m. on Inauguration Day, Trump was in violation of this clause. That lease should be terminated effective immediately.  Just last week, the Kuwaiti Embassy held its annual event to celebrate the country's national day at the President's D.hotel. The event was initially scheduled to take place at the Four Seasons, and, in fact, a ``save the date'' went out with the Four Seasons location. But Kuwait canceled that reservation just a few days after the election, and moved the event to the President's hotel after that happened.  These are not isolated instances. They constitute a pattern of conflicts of interest every time a foreign government holds a reception or rents a room at a Trump property, a problem so important to this country that it was put into the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution of the United States of  The American people should also be deeply concerned about conflicts of interest at the President's Mar-a-Lago resort. On January 1, 2017, just 2 months after the election of Donald Trump, the exclusive resort doubled its membership initiation fee from $100,000 to $200,000. When Trump took Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe there, it created even more free publicity for the resort as several social media posts were made throughout the weekend.  Conducting government affairs in public settings not only has serious national security concerns, but indicates that anyone who wants to be a member of the club will have access to the President of the United States, and the President will personally profit off of their membership.  Mr.Speaker, the American people have a right to know what the entire web of conflicts of interest are, but we have yet to get this information because we have not received--we have yet to get any information from this President, his tax returns, or any of the documents that help us to ensure that he is complying with the Constitution of the United States of America, that document that he swore to uphold and protect, so that we can make sure that he is not using the highest office of this land to profit.                              {time}  1100  The American people have the right to demand that this President put their interests first rather than his own business interests.

On Saturday night, Sergeant Anderson was just doing his job. He went into a barbershop in search of a suspected rapist. Sergeant Anderson lost his life. A line of law enforcement vehicles escorted his body from the scene, and their flashing blue lights lit up the dark night.  It has been a tough few months for our law enforcement families in We have buried six officers who were shot and killed simply because they were wearing a badge.  In January, Westwego Police Officer Michael Louviere stopped to help at a traffic accident, and he was shot in the back of the head. Michael was not even on duty. He was driving home and saw an accident and immediately stopped his car to help. That is the kind of person he was.  The Presiding Officer and all of those listening to me today, no doubt, saw the news footage as to what unfolded along a busy Baton Rouge highway last summer. July will no longer be just about hot dogs and fireworks for us in The shootings that took the lives of three law enforcement officers shattered our summer and broke our hearts.  Just a month earlier, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Deputy David Michel was shot three times in the back--not once, not twice, but three times--and he died in His killer, apparently, shot him because the killer did not want to return to jail.  I would ask all of those who wish to, to join me in saying a prayer for these law enforcement officers and their families. They were sons and they were fathers and they are going to miss out on holidays and birthdays and graduations. They were men who sacrificed their lives so we could sleep a little bit better at night.  Let us also, while we are praying for these brave men--and, yes, women too--pray for an end to the violence.

The issue before us is far more basic than one's view on the Affordable Care I recognize that there is a philosophical difference about the Affordable Care Act: on our side of the aisle, we think it is good legislation; on the opposite side of the aisle, they have concerns. But the issue is whether the American people, whether taxpayers, ought to know the cost of the repeal legislation, whether they have the right to know how much a legislation introduced in this House costs.  Now, here is the irony: the Speaker of the House, the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin, made his entire career demanding that we know numbers behind legislation. That was his mantra in his time of service in the  You talk to Doug Elmendorf, who was the former Congressional Budget Office Director, and he said that the one thing he respected about the Speaker is that he would actually insist on the numbers, that he would want to know how much we are adding to a $20 trillion deficit. That is why it is incomprehensible to me that, in this Congress, under this Speaker, we would ever be asked to vote on legislation without knowing the financial impact of that legislation.  These are basic issues:  How much is the repeal legislation going to add to our deficit?  How much is it going to finance tax cuts for the wealthy?  How many people will it leave out of insurance or how many people would it add to insurance?  There just ought to be a transparent discussion.  Now, it is not just Democrats who want this transparent discussion; actually, a Republican, the gentleman from Ohio, a founder of the Freedom Caucus, has expressed similar concerns. He has expressed concerns that this repeal legislation will balloon the deficit and explode the deficit, and he wants to know the numbers.  We can have as much respectful disagreement about how to cover people and whether the Affordable Care Act is[[Page H1608]]a good piece of legislation or not, but what we should not be debating is the public's right to transparency. That is why I urge my colleagues to reject the previous question so that we can hold an immediate vote on requiring the Congressional Budget Office to score the repeal legislation and provide the American people with the basic financial costs of the legislation.                              {time}  1300  ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgH1604-3.txt,99999999999999,0915,2017.0,8.0,March

11792,topic-id,327,"Mr.Speaker, on December 20, 2016, the stream rule was finalized in the last days of the Obama administration by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Ostensibly, the rule is about keeping American waterways clean. In reality, it is a power grab aimed at giving Federal regulators more authority to make coal too expensive for anyone to mine or use.  But no one should be surprised. In 2008, then candidate Barack Obama told the San Francisco Chronicle that while people would still be free to build a coal-powered electricity plant under his energy policies, it would bankrupt them because of the high costs his regulations would impose. And that is exactly what President Obama has tried to do.  Under the stream protection rule, Federal regulators will have expanded power to draw up new standards that make it harder to get a coal mining permit. OSM's Federal water standards would suddenly take precedence over the State standards that have long governed the industry under the Clean Water The Fish and Wildlife Service would also gain the power to veto coal permits.  The aim is to take permitting power from States and impose a one-size-fits-all standard. When this process started, 10 States signed on to Interior's rulemaking process as State cooperating agencies. But 8 of the 10 later withdrew because Interior wasn't interested in what they had to say.  The subcommittee I chaired held 13 hearings to expose the flaws behind this rule. The rule provides no discernable environmental benefits, while duplicating extensive existing environmental protections at both the Federal and State levels.  In fact, the rule's only purpose appears to be to support the environmental lobby's ``keep it in the ground'' platform, locking away up to 64 percent of our domestic coal reserves, putting tens of thousands of Americans out of work, and raising energy costs for millions of  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review  ",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgH840.txt,1834,0915,2017.0,1.0,March
11848,topic-id,700,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for H.1301, which will fund our national defense for fiscal year 2017. This bill is a vital first step as we begin to work on rebuilding our military. The best way to look at defense spending over time is as a percentage of U.gross domestic product.  Since World War II, we have spent an average of 5 percent of our GDP on defense during peacetime. Despite a world that has gotten more dangerous, the defense drawdown in recent years cut defense spending from 5 percent of GDP to 3 percent of And in a $17 trillion economy, that is real money.  Meanwhile, since Vietnam, we have spent an average of 21 percent of the Federal budget on defense. Today, we spend well below that, about 15 percent of the overall budget.  Things are so bad today--and I don't have time in 2 minutes to go into all the details--that we are actually at risk of losing more American lives than we should in the event of another war.  The next step is to pass a robust defense supplemental and then to fund defense for fiscal year 2018 at a minimum level of $640 billion. Anything less will not keep Americans safe and will not allow us to rebuild our military as we desperately must do.  Congress must deal with sequestration. Trying to fund defense at BCA levels is like trying to put a size 10 foot into a size 7 shoe. It simply doesn't work and it is dangerous for our own security and it is dangerous for the world.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to say to my colleagues on the other side: I know you don't like me talking about health care. If I were you, I wouldn't want to talk about health care either. This is a serious matter, and it is a matter of security for millions and millions of Americans in our country.  Again, maybe somebody over there can tell me: How much is this new TrumpCare bill going to cost? How much is it going to add to the deficit? How much are the American taxpayers going to have to pay for it? Does anyone know how many people will lose their coverage? Hello?  I guess I would ask the questions: Why do we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget Office, who we pay $50 million a year to be able to give us these estimates, if we are not going to utilize them? Why are we doing this?  It seems to me that before we do something that could harm millions of people in this country, before we could do something that could result in an increase in our deficit, why don't we ask the experts? And we all acknowledge that they are experts and we pay them lots of money. Why don't we get their advice?  This whole process seems backwards. You ought not to be marking up bills when you don't know what their impact is going to be.  Part of our job as Members of Congress, in addition to holding hearings and listening to experts and listening to citizens tell us their perspective--which, again, has been totally ignored in this process of the repeal of the healthcare bill--is also to make sure that when we are voting, we know what the impact is going to be, we know whether or not it is going to have a positive impact or whether it is going to have a negative impact.  Again, one of the reasons why I want to defeat the previous question is so that we can vote in a, hopefully, bipartisan way to get a CBO score so we know what is what.  I get it. I know my colleagues don't want to talk about health care. They would rather talk about something we should have done months ago. That is what we are doing now, we are doing old work now.

11909,topic-id,823,"Mr.President, last Thursday the Trump administration submitted its first budget blueprint to The President called it ``America First, A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again.'' The title would seem like a ``Saturday Night Live'' skit if the topic were not so serious. Like some of the President's tweets, his budget is a hasty list of appallingly unbalanced, shortsighted, and, I believe, politically driven priorities.  He proposes to eliminate or drastically cut programs that benefit the middle class and safeguard its most vulnerable citizens, programs that protect our environment, programs that promote our interests overseas but also security at home. Instead, he wants to spend billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars on a misguided wall along our southern border and increased spending for the  He says his proposal causes ``strength, security and resolve.'' He couldn't be more wrong. You don't want to make America ``great again'' at the expense of middle-class families and the most vulnerable among us. We are not a ``great'' nation if we abandon our shared desire to cure cancer, the desire to bring an end to Alzheimer's disease or diabetes. We don't do that by slashing billions for the National Institutes of You can't switch complex and promising medical research off and then say: Well, maybe someday later we will just turn it back on again.  We are not a great nation if we eliminate heating assistance for the 6 million vulnerable households that receive Some 21,000 of those households just had to dig themselves out from a historic snowstorm in my State of And we are not a ``great'' nation if we don't protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.  You don't make America stronger by eliminating the very programs that strengthen our alliances around the world and make our Nation more secure. We are not a strong nation if we simply pour more money into the Pentagon but then renege on commitments to international peacekeeping and security alliances or slash funding to respond to humanitarian crises or cut our diplomatic presence around the world. Interesting enough, when the other body spent millions of tax dollars to investigate a lack of security in Benghazi and came up with nothing, this budget slashes huge amounts that could be spent on security in our embassies, just as they voted to cut out hundreds of millions of dollars from a Senate budget that would have improved our security.  The President says he prefers hard power to soft power, but it is not either/or. The notion that soft power is weak or wasteful is mindless. If you are cutting programs that feed millions or prevent AIDS or treat tuberculosis and malaria, well, that doesn't help. It makes the world less stable, less secure.  I am afraid the budget proposal is divorced from reality. It has a lot of partisan campaign promises. He promises infrastructure investment--and all of us would agree with that--but then it cuts critical Federal funds for proven successful State transportation projects. He claims it will save rural America, but he cuts those Federal programs that spur rural economic development. That is not a budget with vision.  We need a serious budget proposal--a proposal that acknowledges the devastating effects the Budget Control Act and sequestration have had in our country and a budget that charts a path forward, rather than doubling down on further cuts on programs for the middle class. We need a budget proposal investing in our citizens and in our military, not a proposal that pays for one at the expense of the other.  We have a lot of work to do.

12019,topic-id,2866,"Mr.President, last week the junior Senator from Texas spoke about Secretary of State Kerry's recent speech explaining the administration's decision to not veto U.Security Council Resolution 2334 and supporting a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the The Senator asserted that Secretary Kerry ``equated'' Israel and Hamas, that President Obama and Secretary Kerry are ``relentless enemies of Israel'' who ``consider the existence and creation of Israel to be a disaster.'' He said their actions toward Israel were intended to ``facilitate assaults on the nation of Israel.'' He also accused them of ``turning a blind eye'' to terrorism.  Anyone who reads Secretary Kerry's speech will recognize the fallacy of those baseless and inflammatory accusations. To the contrary, Secretary Kerry eloquently and compellingly and with a foreboding sense of urgency about the receding prospects for a two-state solution reaffirmed the administration's condemnation of terrorism and incitement, its unprecedented support for Israel's security, and his own longstanding commitment to Israel's survival as a democratic state, living in peace with its Arab neighbors.  I urge all Senators to read his speech and to arrive at their own conclusions.

Throughout his Administration, President Obama has been      deeply committed to Israel and its security, and that      commitment has guided his pursuit of peace in the Middle      This is an issue which, all of you know, I have worked      on intensively during my time as Secretary of State for one      simple reason: because the two-state solution is the only[[Page S152]]     way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and      It is the only way to ensure Israel's future as      a Jewish and democratic state, living in peace and security      with its neighbors. It is the only way to ensure a future of      freedom and dignity for the Palestinian people. And it is an      important way of advancing United States interests in the      region.       Now, I'd like to explain why that future is now in      jeopardy, and provide some context for why we could not, in      good conscience, stand in the way of a resolution at the      United Nations that makes clear that both sides must act now      to preserve the possibility of peace.       I'm also here to share my conviction that there is still a      way forward if the responsible parties are willing to act.      And I want to share practical suggestions for how to preserve      and advance the prospects for the just and lasting peace that      both sides deserve.       So it is vital that we have an honest, clear-eyed      conversation about the uncomfortable truths and difficult      choices, because the alternative that is fast becoming the      reality on the ground is in nobody's interest--not the      Israelis, not the Palestinians, not the region--and not the      United       Now, I want to stress that there is an important point      here: My job, above all, is to defend the United States of      America--to stand up for and defend our values and our      interests in the world. And if we were to stand idly by and      know that in doing so we are allowing a dangerous dynamic to      take hold which promises greater conflict and instability to      a region in which we have vital interests, we would be      derelict in our own responsibilities.       Regrettably, some seem to believe that the U.friendship      means the U.must accept any policy, regardless of our own      interests, our own positions, our own words, our own      principles--even after urging again and again that the policy      must change. Friends need to tell each other the hard truths,      and friendships require mutual respect.       Israel's permanent representative to the United Nations,      who does not support a two-state solution, said after the      vote last week, quote, ``It was to be expected that Israel's      greatest ally would act in accordance with the values that we      share,'' and veto this resolution. I am compelled to respond      today that the United States did, in fact, vote in accordance      with our values, just as previous U.administrations have      done at the Security Council before us.       They fail to recognize that this friend, the United States      of America, that has done more to support Israel than any      other country, this friend that has blocked countless efforts      to delegitimize Israel, cannot be true to our own values--or      even the stated democratic values of Israel--and we cannot      properly defend and protect Israel if we allow a viable two-     state solution to be destroyed before our own eyes.       And that's the bottom line: the vote in the United Nations      was about preserving the two-state solution. That's what we      were standing up for: Israel's future as a Jewish and      democratic state, living side by side in peace and security      with its neighbors. That's what we are trying to preserve for      our sake and for theirs.       In fact, this Administration has been Israel's greatest      friend and supporter, with an absolutely unwavering      commitment to advancing Israel's security and protecting its      legitimacy.       On this point, I want to be very clear: No American      administration has done more for Israel's security than      Barack Obama's. The Israeli prime minister himself has noted      our, quote, ``unprecedented'' military and intelligence      cooperation. Our military exercises are more advanced than      ever. Our assistance for Iron Dome has saved countless      Israeli lives. We have consistently supported Israel's right      to defend itself, by itself, including during actions in Gaza      that sparked great controversy.       Time and again we have demonstrated that we have Israel's      back. We have strongly opposed boycotts, divestment      campaigns, and sanctions targeting Israel in international      fora, whenever and wherever its legitimacy was attacked, and      we have fought for its inclusion across the UN system. In the      midst of our own financial crisis and budget deficits, we      repeatedly increased funding to support In fact, more      than one-half of our entire global Foreign Military Financing      goes to And this fall, we concluded an historic $38      billion memorandum of understanding that exceeds any military      assistance package the United States has provided to any      country, at any time, and that will invest in cutting-edge      missile defense and sustain Israel's qualitative military      edge for years to come. That's the measure of our support.       This commitment to Israel's security is actually very      personal for me. On my first trip to Israel as a young      senator in 1986, I was captivated by a special country, one      that I immediately admired and soon grew to love. Over the      years, like so many others who are drawn to this      extraordinary place, I have climbed Masada, swum in the Dead      Sea, driven from one Biblical city to another.       I've also seen the dark side of Hizballah's rocket storage      facilities just across the border in Lebanon, walked through      exhibits of the hell of the Holocaust at Yad Vashem, stood on      the Golan Heights, and piloted an Israeli jet over the tiny      airspace of Israel, which would make anyone understand the      importance of security to Out of those experiences      came a steadfast commitment to Israel's security that has      never wavered for a single minute in my 28 years in the      Senate or my four years as       I have also often visited West Bank communities, where I      met Palestinians struggling for basic freedom and dignity      amidst the occupation, passed by military checkpoints that      can make even the most routine daily trips to work or school      an ordeal, and heard from business leaders who could not get      the permits that they needed to get their products to the      market and families who have struggled to secure permission      just to travel for needed medical care.       And I have witnessed firsthand the ravages of a conflict      that has gone on for far too long. I've seen Israeli children      in Sderot whose playgrounds had been hit by Katyusha rockets.      I've visited shelters next to schools in Kiryat Shmona that      kids had 15 seconds to get to after a warning siren went off.      I've also seen the devastation of war in the Gaza Strip,      where Palestinian girls in lzbet Abed Rabo played in the      rubble of a bombed-out building.       No children--Israeli or Palestinian--should have to live      like that.       So, despite the obvious difficulties that I understood when      I became Secretary of State, I knew that I had to do      everything in my power to help end this conflict. And I was      grateful to be working for President Obama, who was prepared      to take risks for peace and was deeply committed to that      effort.       Like previous U.administrations, we have committed our      influence and our resources to trying to resolve the Arab-     Israeli conflict because, yes, it would serve American      interests to stabilize a volatile region and fulfill      America's commitment to the survival, security and well-being      of an Israel at peace with its Arab neighbors.       Despite our best efforts over the years, the two-state      solution is now in serious jeopardy. The truth is that trends      on the ground--violence, terrorism, incitement, settlement      expansion and the seemingly endless occupation--they are      combining to destroy hopes for peace on both sides and      increasingly cementing an irreversible one-state reality that      most people do not actually want.       Today, there are a similar number of Jews and Palestinians      living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean      They have a choice. They can choose to live together in one      state, or they can separate into two states. But here is a      fundamental reality: if the choice is one state, Israel can      either be Jewish or democratic--it cannot be both--and it      won't ever really be at peace. Moreover, the Palestinians      will never fully realize their vast potential in a homeland      of their own with a one-state solution.       Now, most on both sides understand this basic choice, and      that is why it is important that polls of Israelis and      Palestinians show that there is still strong support for the      two-state solution--in theory. They just don't believe that      it can happen.       After decades of conflict, many no longer see the other      side as people, only as threats and enemies. Both sides      continue to push a narrative that plays to people's fears and      reinforces the worst stereotypes rather than working to      change perceptions and build up belief in the possibility of      peace.       And the truth is the extraordinary polarization in this      conflict extends beyond Israelis and Allies of      both sides are content to reinforce this with an us or--     ``you're with us or against us'' mentality where too often      anyone who questions Palestinian actions is an apologist for      the occupation and anyone who disagrees with Israel policy is      cast as anti-Israel or even anti-      That's one of the most striking realities about the current      situation: This critical decision about the future--one state      or two states--is effectively being made on the ground every      single day, despite the expressed opinion of the majority of      the people.       The status quo is leading towards one state and perpetual      occupation, but most of the public either ignores it or has      given up hope that anything can be done to change it. And      with this passive resignation, the problem only gets worse,      the risks get greater and the choices are narrowed.       This sense of hopelessness among Israelis is exacerbated by      the continuing violence, terrorist attacks against civilians      and incitement, which are destroying belief in the      possibility of peace.       Let me say it again: There is absolutely no justification      for terrorism, and there never will be. And the most recent      wave of Palestinian violence has included hundreds of      terrorist attacks in the past year, including stabbings,      shootings, vehicular attacks and bombings, many by      individuals who have been radicalized by social media. Yet      the murderers of innocents are still glorified on Fatah      websites, including showing attackers next to Palestinian      leaders following attacks. And despite statements by      President Abbas and his party's leaders making clear their      opposition to violence, too often they send a different      message by failing to condemn specific terrorist attacks and      naming public squares, streets and schools after terrorists.       President Obama and I have made it clear to the Palestinian      leadership countless times, publicly and privately, that all      incitement to violence must stop. We have consistently      condemned violence and terrorism, and even condemned the      Palestinian leadership for not condemning it.       Far too often, the Palestinians have pursued efforts to      delegitimize Israel in international fora. We have strongly      opposed[[Page S153]]     these initiatives, including the recent wholly unbalanced and      inflammatory UNESCO resolution regarding And we      have made clear our strong opposition to Palestinian efforts      against Israel at the ICC, which only sets back the prospects      for peace.       And we all understand that the Palestinian Authority has a      lot more to do to strengthen its institutions and improve      governance.       Most troubling of all, Hamas continues to pursue an      extremist agenda: they refuse to accept Israel's very right      to exist. They have a one-state vision of their own: all of      the land is Hamas and other radical factions are      responsible for the most explicit forms of incitement to      violence, and many of the images that they use are truly      appalling. And they are willing to kill innocents in Israel      and put the people of Gaza at risk in order to advance that      agenda.       Compounding this, the humanitarian situation in Gaza,      exacerbated by the closings of the crossings, is dire. Gaza      is home to one of the world's densest concentrations of      people enduring extreme hardships with few opportunities. 1.3      million people out of Gaza's population of 1.8 million are in      need of daily assistance--food and shelter. Most have      electricity less than half the time and only 5 percent of the      water is safe to drink. And yet despite the urgency of these      needs, Hamas and other militant groups continue to re-arm and      divert reconstruction materials to build tunnels, threatening      more attacks on Israeli civilians that no government can      tolerate.       Now, at the same time, we have to be clear about what is      happening in the West The Israeli prime minister      publicly supports a two-state solution, but his current      coalition is the most right wing in Israeli history, with an      agenda driven by the most extreme elements. The result is      that policies of this government, which the prime minister      himself just described as ``more committed to settlements      than any in Israel's history,'' are leading in the opposite      direction. They're leading towards one state. In fact, Israel      has increasingly consolidated control over much of the West      Bank for its own purposes, effectively reversing the      transitions to greater Palestinian civil authority that were      called for by the Oslo       I don't think most people in Israel, and certainly in the      world, have any idea how broad and systematic the process has      become. But the facts speak for themselves. The number of      settlers in the roughly 130 Israeli settlements east of the      1967 lines has steadily grown. The settler population in the      West Bank alone, not including East Jerusalem, has increased      by nearly 270,000 since Oslo, including 100,000 just since      2009, when President Obama's term began.       There's no point in pretending that these are just in large      settlement blocks. Nearly 90,000 settlers are living east of      the separation barrier that was created by Israel itself in      the middle of what, by any reasonable definition, would be      the future Palestinian state. And the population of these      distant settlements has grown by 20,000 just since 2009. In      fact, just recently the government approved a significant new      settlement well east of the barrier, closer to Jordan than to      What does that say to Palestinians in particular--but      also to the United States and the world--about Israel's      intentions?       Let me emphasize, this is not to say that the settlements      are the whole or even the primary cause of this conflict. Of      course they are not. Nor can you say that if the settlements      were suddenly removed, you'd have peace. Without a broader      agreement, you would not. And we understand that in a final      status agreement, certain settlements would become part of      Israel to account for the changes that have taken place over      the last 49 years--we understand that--including the new      democratic demographic realities that exist on the ground.      They would have to be factored in.       But if more and more settlers are moving into the middle of      Palestinian areas, it's going to be just that much harder to      separate, that much harder to imagine transferring      sovereignty, and that is exactly the outcome that some are      purposefully accelerating.

The founders of our country recognized the power of the purse as one of the most important tools Congress has to ensure our system of checks and balance and to conduct oversight of the Executive and Judicial branch, but it is much more than that. The Appropriations Committee is also where we translate the priorities of a nation into the realities of the people.  Our country is not a business, where we allocate resources only according to the bottom line. We do not invest in order to make a profit, or a one-for-one dollar in return. We invest in those areas where it is uniquely right for government to take the lead. We invest in the areas that make a difference in the everyday lives of Americans and that help build the foundations of our country and our economy--infrastructure, national security, our environment, education, health care. The Appropriations Committee is where we fund nutrition programs to ensure that children do not have to sit through class hungry and remain healthy so they can develop and grow. It is where we allocate the resources to clean our lakes and our streams and make investments in growing our communities and promoting jobs. It is where we invest in research to cure cancer. It is where we can define who we are as country.  I have been a member of this Committee for almost my entire tenure in the Senate, and just a few short months ago, I became vice chair. I am proud to serve on this committee, and I feel honored to join in the ranks of its leaders.

Anyone with a computer can go to Google Earth and see the tremendous scars on the landscape from mining companies that blast the tops off mountains and then dump the waste into the valleys below. But largely invisible to the naked eye is the suffering of people who live in the nearby communities because of these harmful practices.  The stream protection rule will protect hundreds of vulnerable families and children who live near these sites from lung cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, birth defects, hypertension, and other health problems.  If the majority has a problem with this final rule, as they say they do, they should hold a hearing in the Natural Resources Committee to discuss its merits. There we would have an opportunity to talk to the administration and hear from those who are most affected by mountaintop removal mining.  Instead, they have decided to bypass regular order, go straight to the Congressional Review Act, which will take a chainsaw to this commonsense pollution rule. This is a reckless approach.

12109,topic-id,367,"Mr.Chair, my amendment is simple.  It would require an executive agency to report any new rule or regulatory action that would duplicate or otherwise overlap with existing agency rules and regulations.  So much of government's excess is created by unelected officials who wield enormous influence over our everyday lives.  Last year, Federal agencies issued 18 rules and regulations for every one law that passed  That is a grand total of 3,853 regulations in 2016 alone. In 2015, Federal regulations cost the American economy nearly $1.9 trillion --T, trillion dollars--in lost growth and productivity.  Think about that for a second. A $1.9 trillion tax, a government burden on the American people. That means lost jobs, stagnant wages, and decreasing benefits for workers.  When the House passed the REINS Act in January, I offered an amendment to require at least 1 rule be overturned for every new rule finalized by the executive branch.  President Trump recently took that one step further by issuing an executive order which required at least 2 rules be overturned for every new rule.  My amendment builds on those initiatives by requiring any agency issuing a duplicative regulation to indicate as much when making the online disclosure required by the underlying bill.  The truth is, the federal government is all too often a fountain of unnecessary regulations.  And while some may debate the merits of any given regulation, few would agree the federal government should issue identical iterations of the same regulation multiple times over.  Mr.Speaker, it is past time we stop bureaucratic abuse and shift the balance of power from government back to the people, where it belongs.  That can start today by passing the Regulatory Integrity Act and putting our government on a path to reduce the amount of red tape that our businesses and the American people deal with every day.

12085,topic-id,811,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.1004 is sponsored by Representative Tim Walberg, my colleague from Cosponsors include Representative Farenthold, Representative Meadows, Representative Gosar, and myself.  I rise today in support of H.1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017.  Every year, agencies promulgate thousands of new regulations and impose billions of dollars in regulatory costs on the American public. Those rules are conceived of, developed, written, and imposed by unelected agency officials--bureaucrats.  In return for the authority to issue regulations, Congress and the American people require two simple things from agencies. First, agencies must inform the public about their intended regulatory actions--early and accurately--to provide ample time for thoughtful feedback and consideration from the public. Second, we want the agencies to listen to what the public has to say about the proposed regulatory action.  Making sure the public has an opportunity to participate in this process is key. The public comment period is an essential part of upholding our democratic values. It ensures Americans have a voice heard in the Federal Government's regulatory process.  H.1004 helps preserve and strengthen the integrity of the public comment process in several ways. First, the bill defines the parameters of how an agency should communicate when asking for and offering a proposal and asking for public feedback. H.1004 requires the agency to identify itself in communications on the proposal. Imagine that. We ask them to identify themselves. The agency must clearly state whether it is accepting comments or considering alternatives.  Most importantly, agency communications during this process must use a neutral, unbiased tone. This bill requires agencies to do only what you would expect them to do if the request for feedback was genuine and sincere. This bill will uphold the purpose and value of the notice and comment process enshrined in the Administrative Procedures  When issuing new regulations, agencies must provide notice of the regulation and accept comments from the public before finalizing the regulation. Often, regulated entities, small businesses, and subject-matter experts can provide new insights and perspectives agency officials simply do not have and do not understand. The notice and comment period allows the public to provide valuable insight to the agencies to help them make better regulations, more effective regulations, and minimize the adverse impacts.  However, not every agency takes this opportunity to really listen to the public. Often, agencies develop a proposed regulation and assume it is the end of the story. In effect, agencies reduce the notice and comment process to checking the box.  A perfect example, unfortunately, is when EPA developed the waters of the United States rule, known as WOTUS, EPA's behavior during the notice and comment period indicated that the EPA had little interest in listening to the public. Quite the contrary.  EPA used Thunderclap, an online social media platform, to disseminate government-sourced messages through unaffiliated individuals to encourage the public to provide positive comments. They did not identify themselves and used a third party to source comments that would support their[[Page H1470]]perspective. The goal was clearly to pad the administrative record with positive feedback rather than soliciting genuine input in an effort to measure the rule's effect on the public.  In fact, the Government Accountability Office found the EPA undertook a covert propaganda campaign by soliciting social media comments in support of their proposed rule. Let me say that again: a covert propaganda campaign.  GAO also told EPA to report this violation to the President and Congress because the agency's appropriations were not available for those prohibited purposes. They spent taxpayer money--our money--on something that was prohibited.  H.1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, seeks to shine a light on how agencies are communicating about pending regulatory actions. This bill simply tells agencies they need to keep to the facts and avoid soliciting support when they ought to be soliciting comments.  H.1004 also establishes transparency requirements for the agency in how it communicates to the public. The bill requires agencies to post on their website some basic information about each communication about a pending regulatory action. For each communication, the public will be able to see a copy of the communication, the intended audience, the method of communication, and the date it was issued--simple transparency expectations. Additionally, H.1004 requires agencies to post information online about each of their regulatory actions.  Mr.Chairman, the Regulatory Integrity Act will bring integrity back to the rulemaking process with transparency and simple guidelines for effective and appropriate communication.  The Regulatory Integrity Act is a good, bipartisan bill. This bill received support in the previous Congress, and the House of Representatives passed the bill last  On February 14, 2017, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform approved this bill without amendment.  I thank Congressman Walberg for his leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

12091,topic-id,363,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, one thing is clear to me, even as a freshman: we need to correct the record here.  My colleague from the minority suggests that somehow, magically, the GAO just determined they were the police officer, they cried foul, they stopped them.  Let's be clear about this. First, the GAO intervened because they were asked to do so by Chairman They investigated after the chairman asked them to look into it because of the concerns; not in advance, not because they found it independently, but because it was such a significant and egregious action that the chairman of the committee said: We need to look at this. And they did so.  Second, it was after the fact. What they found was that it was so extraordinarily egregious, they actually cited them for inappropriately spending taxpayer money.  Now, let's talk about what they did. We talk about chilling communication. Knowingly, why would you put out something on a social media site such as Thunderclap sourcing messages, not identifying yourself, if for any other purpose but to create propaganda? Why would you do that?  H.1004 simply requires--and I will repeat them, because the minority seems to have a problem understanding this--the agency identified itself in its communication on a proposal: hello, this is the We are talking about this problem.  They make clear they are accepting public comments for and against: What do you think about it; what are the problems; will this work? Imagine that concept.  They require that agencies provide feedback on the comments that is genuine and sincere and not have already written the final bill--as my colleagues says, the perfunctory process.  That is what it requires. I have a difficult time understanding how that chills input from the public. And to be absolutely blunt with you, if it chills a few bureaucrats from deciding what they think is best rather than what this body believes is best, or, frankly, what the courts believe is best, then we have achieved our objective here today.

11908,topic-id,2533,"Mr.President, there have now been two speakers on the floor this afternoon speaking to H.69, which is the disapproval resolution on Alaska fish and wildlife refuge rule. I have come today to speak in strong support of this resolution, which will effectively overturn a rule imposed by the previous administration related to fish and wildlife management on millions of acres of refuge land in the State of  I would like to start my comments by acknowledging Senator Sullivan, for his lead on this initiative, and Congressman Young, as he moved this measure through the House just a couple of weeks ago. What we saw in the House measure and the final vote was a bipartisan vote that secured passage through the House, and I thank Congressman Young for his able leadership there.  I also want to thank Senator Sullivan for his comments and for really doing an excellent job in outlining and explaining why this Fish and Wildlife Service rule is bad for Alaska, bad for hunters, bad for our Native peoples, and bad for  Like my friend and colleague, I am here to encourage Members of the Senate to see this rule for what it really is. It is a clear departure from Federal law. It is unwarranted regulatory overreach, and, from all accounts, it is a direct attack on States' rights.  Now, we will have discussion back and forth on the floor about various hunting practices, and we will see beautiful shots of wildlife and suggestions that, somehow or other, this is about a specific hunting practice. This is bigger than wildlife refuges in the State of This is an issue that is not just isolated or contained in the State of This resolution is specific to Alaska, but I would suggest to[[Page S1868]]my colleagues that for all of those of us who care about States' rights, who care about the promises made to our States about how they operate and how they manage activities in their States, this is something that we must all pay attention to because this is a direct attack on States' rights.  I look at this and suggest that this rule is a solution in search of a problem. Again, there are those who would say: Why is the Senate spending 10 hours to debate practices within a refuge in the State of Alaska? Is this not just so parochial an issue that it ought not take our time? However, I would contend that this foreshadows what is in store for the rest of the country if we are not adamant in ensuring that this rule be repealed by  Now, for those who may not be familiar with Alaska or gaming management laws within our State or within our national wildlife refuges in general, I think it is important to cover some basic facts and perhaps a little bit of history here to illustrate why this rule is so flawed. Alaska, like every other State in the Nation, holds primary legal authority to manage its fish and its wildlife, including on Federal refuge lands.  So let's not get confused here and think that because we have Federal lands, somehow or other the States do not have primacy when it comes to management of fish and wildlife. Alaska holds legal authority to manage the fish and wildlife within its borders. This is clear. This is unambiguous. Congress explicitly provided that authority specifically to our State in not one, not two, but three separate laws. The first of these is the Alaska Statehood Act; then the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act--ANILCA; and the third authority was through the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration In three separate authorities, Congress made it clear: Alaska, you are to manage the fish and wildlife within your borders.  Our Statehood Act gave Alaska the right to manage its fish and its wildlife as soon as the State could assemble a department of fish and game, which we actually did in our first year of Then, in 1980, ANILCA, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, affirmed twice that nothing within its text was ``intended to enlarge or diminish the authority of the State of Alaska for management of fish and wildlife on the public lands.''  Again, it is very clear, not only within the Statehood Act, but within ANILCA, that management would be left with the The authority to manage our fish and our wildlife--through decisions based on sound science and that make sense for our local communities--is something that we in Alaska take very, very seriously. For us, State management of fish and wildlife is practically sacrosanct. I cannot emphasize that enough. It is one of the key reasons the State of Alaska voted to join the Union, so we have pretty good reason for the emotion and the passion that come with this authority to manage our fish and our wildlife.  I am proud to acknowledge that not only am I the first Senator to serve in the Senate who was born in Alaska; I was actually born in the territory. My parents and my grandparents were engaged in the battle for Some think it was about the land. For most of the discussion that I recall from my family, it was all about fish. It was all about the salmon. One of the reasons we fought for Statehood was management of our fisheries. The Federal management of Alaska salmon fisheries prior to Statehood was absolutely appalling, with salmon stocks falling from 113 million in 1934 to just 25 million in 1959. We saw the management from the Federal side, and that experience left Alaskans absolutely committed to State management and the preservation of both fish and game, so we negotiated that for ourselves. We put it into law; we enshrined it into law in several different places. And we expect our Federal agencies to abide by that.  Those were the terms of the deal when we entered the Union as a State: Alaska is to manage the fish and wildlife within our borders. It is our right and our responsibility, and we take that responsibility very seriously. We have an entire department of fish and game dedicated to it and, as Senator Sullivan rightly noted, a department that has been recognized for the good work they do, the strong science they utilize. We are proud of the efforts they make to ensure that this management is done for sustained yield, the principle we stand by in our State's constitution. For decades now, we have done just that, until the National Park Service in 2015 and the Fish and Wildlife Service in 2016 took it upon themselves to propose regulations to take control away from Alaska, despite what was contained in our Statehood agreement, in ANILCA, and in the National Wildlife Refuge Administration  The National Park Service's rule is outside the reach of the Congressional Review So while, in my view, that also deserves repeal, it is not the focus of our debate today. Instead, the resolution we are discussing focuses on the Fish and Wildlife Service rule that was finalized over the protests of Alaskans in August of last year. The rule itself was packaged perhaps innocently enough. The Fish and Wildlife Service spoke of clarifying ``existing mandates'' for conservation and biological diversity, and the agency claimed it was outlawing a few methods of predator control, couched its rule as a victory for public participation, and then promised us that it did not change Federal subsistence regulations or impose new regulations on subsistence users.  On the face of it all, it sounded as though it was going to be not so bad--if you take the agency's description at face value. Many who are outside of Alaska are looking at this and saying: Why are you making such a big deal about all of this? The Department of the Interior is just clarifying some hunting rules, so it can't be that big of a deal.  But the answer on that is: This is a big deal.  Some of our opponents will allege the repeal of this rule will legalize brutal predator-control practices. What the Senate should know is that it is already illegal for hunters to use certain practices--gas against wolves, traps to harvest bears. You cannot do this on national wildlife refuges in So those arguments are false and, unfortunately, serve mostly to distract from what this rule is really about. As I mentioned at the outset of my comments, what this is really about are the States' rights, States' authorities, and, effectively, States' control.  First and foremost, I am here to defend the rights of my home State and all of the States to manage fish and game within their boundaries. The game management rule severely erodes the authority of Alaska to make these decisions, and I think it sets a terrible precedent for the other 49 If you think, this rule is just about Alaska, that this is not something you need not worry yourself about--well you really actually ought to be worried. Especially so if you have Federal lands within your Your State could be the next one where Fish and Wildlife Service comes in and says: No, it's not going to be you, State, that has this management authority. We're going to come in and tell you what can and cannot be done.  The Fish and Wildlife Service freely admits its rule will impact 54 million acres of refuge land inside the State of This is an area 10 times larger than the size of the State of This is not insignificant. Really, this is truly the camel's nose under the tent.  If Congress allows this rule to stand, it will effectively override U.Supreme Court rulings from 1896 and 1979, which held that the States have the power to ``protect and conserve wild animal life within their borders.'' The States' power in this area is subject only to specific Federal authorities articulated by Congress, such as the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection  The precedent being set for Alaska--and every other State--should be sufficient reason for us to oppose this rule. But I also need to speak to some of the particulars included within it, especially the Obama administration's claim that it would not change or restrict subsistence uses.  This regulation made significant and substantive changes to regulations related to the hunting of bears. While I realize that not everyone may agree with hunting, I urge you to listen to what my colleague from the State of Alaska said in his comments and what[[Page S1869]]he outlined in terms of subsistence to Alaska Natives, subsistence to those who are in areas so remote that ``rural'' is not even the right way to describe it. We call it Bush There are no stores, there is no Safeway, there is no Whole Foods, and there is no Stop-N-There is no place where you can go to get your meat, to get your fish. In many areas there just isn't even a store, much less a store where you can buy Hamburger Helper or whatever it is that you are going to provide for your family. That model just does not exist in certain parts of our State, so what the people who live there do is hunt. That is how they provide for their families. They hunt and they fish and they gather. That is subsistence. That subsistence is not only nutritional sustenance, but for many, it is also their cultural identity, whether you are the ``People of the Caribou,'' the ``People of the Whale,'' or the ``Salmon People.'' The Native people who have been part of this corner of the world for millennia relate to their food source, making sure that not only their traditional diets can continue, but how they are able to practice this subsistence lifestyle matters greatly.  The regulation we are talking about today jeopardizes the ability of many of those Alaskans to sustainably harvest wildlife, to hunt, to feed themselves and their families. So when we think about the Alaska model of management and how it works to achieve healthy populations, this rule we are dealing with right now upsets that balance. It makes significant changes to the types of activities allowed when hunting bears without the support of the State or the traditional user groups. In updating regulations governing public notice and participation, the rule eliminates tools and obligations necessary for meaningful engagement with affected It curtails the use of local knowledge and insights for refuge management. It relies on an arbitrary and unscientific interpretation of the agency's national biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health policy.  The sustainability of Alaska's ecosystem depends on good, sound management--expert management--of fish and game populations. But under this regulation, well-established best practices employed by wildlife management professionals are more vulnerable to what could be unscientific or certainly bureaucratic second-guessing. That has sweeping implications for wildlife populations and for those who depend on them. If left in place, this rule will be applied to the entire refuge system either unilaterally or through litigation, placing our Nation's fishing and hunting traditions at even greater risk.  Those who actively participate in the sustainable management of our Nation's fish and wildlife populations understand the dangers presented by this rule, and they are overwhelmingly opposed to it. Senator Sullivan mentioned a list of the organizations that have voiced their support. I will not repeat many of the names, but it includes the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, which represents all 50 It includes subsistence users, guides, outfitters, tourists, hunters, anglers throughout the country, and dozens of conservation groups, from the Alaska Outdoor Council and the Alaska Professional Hunters Association to Ducks Unlimited, Safari Club International, the National Rifle Association, and the Boone and Crockett When you have a coalition that is this strong, that is this broad and yet united against a Federal rule, you know something went terribly awry with the regulation.  I would encourage the Senate to see through some of what I consider to be misleading arguments that some of the outside groups are making against us and to really see this rule for what it is--that this Fish and Wildlife Service game management rule for Alaska refuges is the very definition of Federal overreach. It defies the will of Alaskans, while disregarding sound scientific game management principles. It will result in less stable populations of fish and wildlife within our It will harm our subsistence users who hunt, not for sport but for their literal cultural sustenance, their nutritional sustenance, and, again, so much of their identity.  I again want to thank those that have been leading on this issue. This is a bad rule that deserves repeal. I would encourage all of my colleagues to look carefully at this. Look carefully at this, not just as a rule that is parochial and limited to just Alaska alone, but look to it within the context of what this does and what it says when it comes to States' rights and States' ability to manage fish and wildlife within their own State borders.  I yield the floor.

11916,topic-id,2374,"Mr.President, we have seen TV clips about various Members and Senators around the country having townhall meetings. For example, three of our colleagues this past weekend--Indiana was one of them--had tremendous townhall meetings with a good exchange of information.  With this looming House of Representatives healthcare bill, which I refer to as TrumpCare, since the President has endorsed it, I wanted to see a particular group in our society who is extremely vulnerable and those are the older Americans who are not 65--not old enough to be eligible for Now, be careful because there are people lurking in these halls and the administration who would like to raise Medicare eligibility from age 65 to 67. But that is not what is confronting the House of Representatives; it is what is going to happen to those people below the age of 65 for their healthcare. Under current law, once they hit 65, they are eligible for  I reached out to a particular group of These are folks whom I did not know that our offices in Florida had become aware of because they had written about the healthcare debate that is going on and, in many cases, had described their circumstances.  Yesterday, the group of 8 or 10 whom we had in my Orlando office were all in the age range of 50 to 64. I want to tell the Senate about this group of people because, if approved in its current form, the House healthcare bill, TrumpCare, would dramatically increase healthcare costs for folks in that age group, 50 to 64. Those are folks who either get their healthcare through expanded Medicaid or they get their health insurance through healthcare.gov, which is the exchange, whether it be on the State exchange or the Federal exchange because the State does not participate. According to the Congressional Budget Office, a 64-year-old making $26,500 could see their[[Page S1873]]healthcare costs go from $1,700 a year, which they pay now under the Affordable Care Act, all the way up to $14,600 a year under the House plan, That is a dramatic jump, obviously. Do we think that is really too much of an extreme example?  I want to tell you what these people said. If you look at what the House is proposing, the dramatic rise in cost is due in large part to two provisions contained in the House bill, one that would allow insurers to charge older Americans up to five times as much as younger people; the second one caps the Federal tax credits meant to help seniors pay for the rising cost of health insurance. Federal tax credits is a fancy way of saying ``subsidy.'' So if you are a senior and you are above 138 percent of poverty, which for a single individual is approximately $16,000 a year--by the way, who making $16,000 a year can afford health insurance? That is why we need the remaining 19 States, my State of Florida included, to expand Medicaid up to that 138 percent of poverty. But if someone is between that level and all the way up to 400 percent of the poverty level, which for a single individual is about $46,000, $47,000 a year--in that zone of 138 percent of poverty up to 400 percent of poverty, there are these tax credits or subsidies. The one with the lower income gets more of a subsidy in order to buy private health insurance on the private marketplace through the exchange. As they get up to 400 percent, a person making $46,000 or $47,000 a year--can they really afford health insurance? Not the real cost, unless it is some huge deductible plan that doesn't give them much. That is why these folks need some assistance. That is in place. That is the law. That is the Affordable Care Act, which has been so maligned over the last several years.  Aside from health insurance, there is the expansion of Medicaid that has helped a lot of people. There are still 4 million people in this country who would benefit if those 19 remaining States would expand Medicaid up to 138 percent. They are left in the cold. They are not getting health insurance; they are not getting healthcare. They are eligible to have it, and the Federal money is there to draw down to enable them to have that Medicaid, but 19 States, including my State of Florida, have decided not to expand it.  With all of that as background, I asked these folks to come in. According to the AARP, there are millions of Floridians in that age group of 50 to 64 who currently receive Medicaid or tax credits to help them pay for the insurance through healthcare.gov; there are millions who are eligible. So the group came in, and here's what I learned. I am going to give you some personal vignettes.  Marshall Stern is a 61-year-old heart transplant survivor who lives in Kissimmee, Marshall has had a serious heart condition since he was a young man. Three years ago, his condition worsened, and it resulted in several hospitalizations, after which he was told he would need a heart transplant. Since he is on full disability, he was told that he had to enroll in Medicaid or he would not be eligible for the transplant. Just the medication for the posttransplant operation costs around $100,000 a year, which, obviously, Marshall would not be able to afford without Medicaid coverage. He also is going to have to take this medication for the rest of his life if he is going to live. He worries that the House TrumpCare bill will turn Medicaid into a block grant program, which is a fancy way of saying: We are going to cut it off, and you are not going to get any more money, and you are going to have to finance it from your own State resources. Governors and State legislatures are going to have to share more of the burden of healthcare costs. He is worried that if that House bill passes and Medicaid is threatened as we know it, he is not going to be able to have the medications he needs to stay alive. This is what Marshall told me, and it was very dramatic. He said: ``It is as good as saying that I die.''  For the rest of us who are not facing that, imagine having a fellow tell you that. This is serious business.  Let me tell you about Susanna She is a 62-year-old living in Altamonte Susanna's husband lost his job in 2009, and she lost her employer-provided health plan during the recession. The couple blew through their IRA, and they ended up selling nearly everything they had.  They eventually moved out of the country to save money, but in 2014, they decided to move back. Why? Because the Affordable Care Act passed, and the ACA made it possible for them to afford health insurance again. This is what Susanna said:       If they shred [the ACA] like they're [threatening] to,      we're going to be hightailing it out of here, because dealing      with the health care [costs] and insurance makes you sick.      We're getting by, but if the ACA goes away, and if they make      these changes they're talking about, we'll be uninsured      again.  I was going to show you a picture. These are the folks whom I met with yesterday. I will not point out the individuals, and I am going to talk about some of the others, but you can see almost everybody. There is one person who is outside the photograph. But we sat down for an hour's conversation, and I heard their stories.  I wish every Senator and every Member of Congress would go out and talk to people who are real people with real problems and understand how petrified they are. These folks look like our neighbors and our friends. They look like the people whom we go to church with. They look like the people who have children or grandchildren whom we play with, and they are petrified. They are scared to death that they are not going to have healthcare.  So let me tell you about another one of these ladies. Terri Falbo is a 59-year-old living in the Orlando area. She moved to Florida back in 2012 to take care of her elderly mother and disabled sister. For 25 years she had good health insurance through her employer where she lived up north, and she rarely used health insurance. After losing her job in 2006, as we went into the beginnings of the recession, she purchased an individual insurance policy that cost her $500 to $650 a month. Prior to the ACA, she had to make withdrawals from her retirement account. She had to max out her credit cards to pay for the premiums. As a result, she depleted all of her reserves and all of her retirement funds. Since the Affordable Care Act was implemented, she has had an affordable policy because she qualifies for the monthly subsidy of over $600, bringing her premium payments to $70 a month with a zero deductible. She could have gotten a policy with a $5,000 deductible for $3 a month. At her age, she needed assurance that she would be able to have the healthcare she needed, so she paid $70 a month because of the subsidy. Yet that is not what is protecting her in the House TrumpCare bill.  Under that proposed healthcare plan, her maximum subsidy would be less than $300 a month, which means she would end up paying $4,000 more per year--an amount that she simply cannot afford. That is what she told me: ``I cannot afford it.'' She said she would have to go without health insurance instead. Before the ACA, she was desperately trying to have health insurance, and she depleted all of her retirement funds.  There is another lady who is sitting around that table in the picture I showed, Nancy She is a 51-year-old self-employed actor who is living in She is active. She is healthy. She chose to pursue a career in the arts. The unstable nature of her profession has often left her unable to afford health insurance. So she has gone without it most of her adult life as an artist, as a performer.  Since the ACA took effect, however, she has, finally, been able to afford health insurance, thanks to the subsidies. She told me that it has been a relief for her to be able to go to the doctor not only for checkups but, actually, when she has a problem, to fix it.  If Congress passes the House TrumpCare bill, her premiums are going to go up. She has no doubt that she will, once again, be unable to afford health insurance and healthcare. She told me that she fears simple health issues will fester, becoming serious, chronic, and expensive to treat. Remember, I said they were petrified--that they were scared to death. There is an example. Finally, she has health insurance after all of these years of going without because she did not have an employer who paid for her.  Let's take another one. Marilyn Word is a 63-year-old retiree living in Marilyn lives mainly off of Social Security payments but is not[[Page S1874]]old enough to qualify for She is under that magic year of age 65, at which one is eligible.  After retiring, Marilyn enrolled in an insurance plan through the ACA exchange, and she is eligible for annual tax credits to help her pay for her insurance. Marilyn told me that she was extremely worried about the increased premiums that she would likely have to pay under the House TrumpCare plan.  I will give you another example of a lady who is sitting around that table. Sharon Brown is a 58-year-old widow. She lives in the Orlando area. Since her husband's death, Sharon has been dealing with several medical issues and pulling money out of her retirement account to pay for her current plan. She has a nest egg from her husband's life insurance money, but due to her health condition, she will likely need long-term medical care. This is what she told me:       My premium's pretty high because I've got multiple medical      conditions that make it so I cannot work. I've done a lot of      reading on this . . . and the cost of my healthcare [under      the TrumpCare plan] will amount to double what I make right      now in income.  She looked at me with this pained expression on her face and said: ``It's very scary, and the anxiety that goes along with this happening right now is making it worse.''  Sharon told me that she is a lifelong registered Republican--she volunteered this--and she said that the bill being considered now is forcing her to reconsider her party. She said:       I'm changing my political affiliation to independent. I      want to vote my conscience.  When one puts faces to these stories--to these people about whom I have just talked and about whom we just talked yesterday--the House TrumpCare plan ends Medicaid as we know it because it cuts off the amount going to the  I understand that in the House, in trying to fix up some things just last night, they filed an amendment in an attempt to address some of the problems. One of the things they were trying to fix would allow States to choose between capping or block-granting the Medicaid Under either proposal, the Federal Government is going to be contributing less to the States, and that means more money will have to be picked up--the tab--by the Just ask the Governors how much more they can pick up.  I urge our House and Senate colleagues to join all of these people whom I have talked about and vote as Sharon said--with their consciences on what they are going to do to folks like them. Gutting Medicaid and forcing struggling, older Americans to pay more for health insurance is simply not the right thing to do. For a change, we ought to be trying to do the right thing.

This is the type of common sense that we need more of in  There are 2.3 million small businesses in Florida, employing around 43.2 percent of the State's workforce. They are the primary engine of job growth in the country, and are a proven means for economic mobility.  Under most circumstances, small businesses are subject to the same rules as large corporations but are treated differently under the Tax They already have a hard enough time competing with large multinational corporations, which can hire an endless stream of high-priced tax lawyers to shift their income abroad and avoid U.taxes.  We should be doing all we can to put small businesses on a more level playing field. Part of that starts with this bill, but it doesn't end here. We need to do comprehensive tax reform.  This bill should be part of that conversation, as one way we could help small businesses. It is not the only way, and I am certainly open to other ideas, but we need to have a serious talk about how we are going to freshen up the Tax Code and help the economy grow.  I know a lot of my colleagues have different ideas about what tax reform should look like, but I think we should all be able to agree that it needs to be real reform, not just a temporary tax cut. It needs to support a technology-driven economy and help us transition to a greener, fairer economy--with a lot less disparity.  Tax reform should also generate enough added revenue to pay for the infrastructure we desperately need. That includes the crumbling roads and bridges that threaten the safety of millions of Americans and are a tax on small businesses. We also need to invest in our water infrastructure, energy infrastructure, ports, railways, public schools, and affordable housing infrastructure.  At the same time, tax reform needs to be deficit neutral. You might ask, how are we going to pay for all this? Well, we can start by getting rid of outdated special interest tax breaks that are no longer needed or don't make sense in the 21st century.  We can also eliminate tax loopholes that allow companies to shift profits abroad and lead to corporate inversions.  This bill, the Main Street Fairness Act, is a good start, but it shouldn't end here. We need to have a serious, deliberative effort to develop a bipartisan tax reform package.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-03-pt1-PgS2172-3.txt,859,GOP ACA REPEAL,2017.0,3.0,February

11875,topic-id,618,"Mr.President, I want to talk briefly about a nomination that is coming before us this week. This is for Elaine Duke to be the Deputy Homeland Security  This is an incredibly important job. Some of you remember the Homeland Security Department was made up of about 23 different departments and agencies coming together. It is a huge management challenge. The key job of the Deputy Secretary is to try to manage all of that.  We are very fortunate that Elaine Duke is willing to step forward and take on this responsibility. My hope is that we will have a bipartisan vote here on the floor of the Senate for her confirmation and that we do it quickly this week because they need her there.  She came before our Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs last month. We had a very productive hearing. I had the honor of introducing her to the committee because she has Ohio roots. We are very proud of those Ohio roots.  She has had a long, distinguished career all across the country in the Federal Government, but she still calls Ohio home, and much of her family continues to reside in Her dad, Frank Costanzo, is a first-generation American who still lives in Cleveland, I have also known her uncle, Dominick Costanzo, for over 25 years. He is a friend and a neighbor. Boy, he is very proud of his niece, as is her whole family.  This family has instilled in her a midwestern work ethic that you see in the great work she has done for the Federal Government over the past 28 years. She has worked as a senior member of various administrations. We are really fortunate that she is willing to now continue to serve.  She started her career as a GS-7 contract specialist for the U.Air Over the next 28 years, she assumed bigger and bigger responsibilities in the Air Force, the Navy, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Smithsonian, and finally, the Department of Homeland  In 2008, she was confirmed unanimously by this Senate to serve as the Under Secretary for Management at In this latest role, she, of course, was a key member of the DHS leadership team for both Secretary Chertoff and Secretary Napolitano, and they strongly support her.  She has earned a reputation for being an expert on issues of contracting, on acquisitions, on procurement, on property management, on organizational change, and on human resources. All of these, as I said earlier, are key issues right now at the Department of Homeland Security, so she will help it to be managed better, which will protect all of us.  Serving in these administrations--both Republican and Democrat--she did earn the respect of folks from both sides of the aisle. I find it interesting that all five previously confirmed DHS Deputy Secretaries have unanimously and strongly recommended her confirmation--all five of the previously confirmed ones. They said in their letter:       Elaine is extraordinarily well-qualified to serve in the      position for which she has now been nominated. . . . Elaine      knows She has been a senior leader at DHS under two      presidents. She sets an unwavering standard of excellence for      all who consider themselves committed to public service.  I look forward to having this vote. I hope we will have resounding support on a bipartisan basis for the nomination.  Secretary Kelly is doing a good job. General Kelly has an incredibly distinguished career. We are fortunate that he has stepped up as Secretary also. He needs her. He needs his deputy in place to help him run the Department, and the men and women serving in DHS today need her on the job.

11994,topic-id,791,"Mr.Speaker, I am going to yield to my colleague from Minnesota, Mr.It was 7 years ago in March 2010 that President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law extending access to affordable health insurance coverage to more than 20 million previously uninsured  Insurance companies under the new law could no longer deny you insurance because you had a preexisting condition, and, surely, that makes sense. The fact that you have a preexisting medical condition should be the reason that you get health insurance, not the reason you get denied health insurance.  Also, under the new ACA, young people up to age 26 could stay on their family plans, which helps families like mine because I have got a 22-year-old, a 20-year-old, and a 25-year-old. And believe me, they would not have health insurance if not for the Affordable Care Act, and I think my situation is that of millions of people across the country.  But today, the ACA is in mortal danger. The House GOP finally unveiled their plan for repealing and replacing the ACA with something else, which I call the unaffordable care act, that will cost millions of people their health insurance, increase everybody's premiums, reduce everybody's coverage, and bring incoherence and chaos into the system.  Mr.Speaker, I am going to yield to Mr.Ellison in just a moment to talk about what is going on with this legislation. But I do want to say something about the process by which we arrived here, because back when the Affordable Care Act was being debated--and I[[Page H2007]]wasn't in Congress then, so I approach this just as a historian--there were multiple complaints from the GOP Members about how fast things were going, how the legislation was being rammed through.  For example, our now-Speaker Paul Ryan said about the ACA: ``Congress is moving fast to rush through a healthcare overhaul that lacks a key ingredient,'' he said, ``the full participation of you, the American people.''  Greg Walden, the Energy and Commerce chairman from Oregon, said: On a bill of this significance, you would think we would at least allow people to come in who are affected by the extraordinary changes in this bill, and have a chance to let us know how it affects them.  And the Ways and Means Committee chairman today, Kevin Brady, said: The Democratic Congress and White House simply aren't listening. The Democrats are ramming it through over the public's objections.  Well, let's go back and look at how long it took the Democrats to get the Affordable Care Act passed and how much public participation and debate there really was.  Here in Congress, there were 79 hearings--I repeat, 79 hearings--on the Affordable Care  There were 181 witnesses, both expert witnesses and members of the public, citizens coming to testify about the need for expanded health insurance coverage for the American people because of the high expenses of health insurance and the rip-offs of various insurance companies.  There were multiple scores that were received from the Congressional Budget Office during that time, as there was constant attention to the budgetary and fiscal implications of the Affordable Care  Now, fast-forward to today. We took a year-and-a-half to get to the Affordable Care How about them? Well, let's see.  The Republicans introduced their bill on They passed their bill in the dead of night, at 4:30 in the morning, 3 days later. There have been no hearings on the bill. There have been no witnesses to testify on the bill. There have been no expert witnesses. There have been no witnesses from the public.  There is no analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on how much the bill will cost American taxpayers, American citizens, on their plans or how many Americans will lose their health care at all.  In other words, the party that complained about how fast the Affordable Care Act came into being, which was over the course of a year and a half with dozens of hearings, and dozens and dozens--more than 100 witnesses and lots of public debate where we went back to our districts and had townhall meetings, where there was orchestrated opposition against the plan, but we still stood there and we engaged in the dialogue, and we stood up for the Affordable Care The people who said that that was too fast are now ramming through, at unprecedented, breakneck, lightning speed, a bill that will wreak devastation on the healthcare rights of the American people.  That is what is taking place. If you have got a contaminated, clandestine, secret, closed process, it will produce a terrible, undemocratic, and unhealthy result. That is what we are going to describe to you tonight.  I am delighted to yield to my colleague from Minnesota (Mr.Ellison.)

11996,topic-id,1785,"Mr.Speaker, I hope the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Ellison) will stick around. I want to salute him and congratulate him on his new position, not only as a leading Member of the United States House of Representatives, but now as vice chairman of the Democratic National  All of your colleagues are beaming with pride about your accomplishments and about your national political leadership, and we are delighted that the rest of the country is going to get to share in your leadership now in your new aggressive role out organizing opposition to what is taking place in Washington today.  I want to take a little break from railing about this unaffordable care act that is going to drive everybody's rates up and throw millions of people off their health insurance.  I want to say a couple of good things that President Trump said as a candidate because he attacked ObamaCare, but he said he wanted a system that covered everybody. He's been quoted many times speaking in favor of a single-payer plan that would cover every citizen. Now, that talk has completely dried up. It has vanished and disappeared.  I urge President Trump to go back to his original instinct, which is that, if you are going to repeal and replace ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act, as he keeps saying--let's replace it with the kind of system they have in Canada, they have in Europe, and just cover everybody. That would be the direction to go in. But to go backwards to throw millions of people off their health care is precisely what the American people don't want.  Now, here is another proposal that President Trump mentioned in passing when he stood in this Chamber the other night. He said: Let's repeal the special interest lobbyist provision that was snuck into Medicare part D, saying that the government could not negotiate for lower drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies.  Again, that was a very popular talking point for Donald Trump when he was running for He campaigned like Williams Jennings Bryan, but he is governing like William McKinley; that is, a cabinet filed with CEOs and billionaires. He did mention that. That was one tiny crumb, a remnant of the populist campaign he ran.  I urge my Republican colleagues to throw this terrible bill that they are going to waste everybody's time on, that cannot pass, which their Freedom Caucus is totally opposed to; and, instead, focus, at least, on something we can agree on, which is that the 25 or $30 billion that that special interest provision is costing us should be saved. We should allow the government to negotiate for lower drug prices in the Medicare program the way we are allowed to negotiate for lower drug prices in the Medicaid program and in the VA program.  So we can work together in a bipartisan basis. However, we are not going to allow anybody to throw millions of Americans off of their health insurance plan while driving up everybody else's rates and bringing the whole healthcare system to the brink of ruin.  When I got elected to Congress, I went down to the basement of the Longworth House Office Building after I was sworn in to sign up for my health care because we get health care as part of our jobs as Members of We pay for it through the local ACA healthcare exchange in the District of Columbia, but we are guaranteed the right to get that because of the Affordable Care  When I went down that morning, I was signing up and I was looking[[Page H2009]]through the memo about what we would be doing during my first week in Congress here. Sure enough, I saw that the GOP leadership had put on there a procedural proposal to set the stage for the dismantling of the Affordable Care  I looked up to see a line of my new colleagues waiting to come and sign up for their health care. Some of them I recognized as my Democratic colleagues, and some of them I recognized as my new distinguished Republican colleagues. And I said to myself: Wait a second. Please tell me that we are not going to have new Members of Congress come in here and sign up for their own health care that they get as part of their job as Representatives in the United States House of Representatives and then go upstairs to this floor to vote to strip millions of people of their health care.  Surely that is not what democratic representation means in the 21st century; that we get to have health care through our jobs, but we are going to take away the health care that other people have. But, my friends, I am sorry to say that is the reality that we are in this week.  Congressman Ellison is right, we are not taking the position that the Affordable Care Act is perfect. Far from it. I wasn't in Congress then. I don't know if the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Ellison) was. I wasn't in Congress then. But had I been in Congress, I would have been fighting for a single-payer plan.  I am on legislation this session to support a single-payer plan. In other words, the Affordable Care Act, for me, doesn't go far enough in guaranteeing that everybody has health care and in dramatically reducing the role of the insurance companies so we can spend more money on health care and less money on red tape and bureaucracy.  So the Affordable Care Act, which I support with all of my heart right now against all the attacks to dismantle it, was a compromise. It was a very carefully crafted compromise. Remember, we had more than 100 witnesses come and testify about it. They had zero on their crash-and-burn legislation this week. We had dozens and dozens of hearings where we had witnesses come and testify about it. They have had zero on their crash-and-cash legislation--crash the system and give cash to the insurance companies and the wealthiest people in the country. So we had an open process, and it was a compromise.  I remember very clearly as a State senator in Maryland watching President Obama on TV saying, if we are starting from scratch, he would be in favor of a single-payer plan. He said that would be the logical way to go. It is what they have in It is what they have in Canada and  He said we are path dependent. We are on a particular path. We understand the role that the big insurance companies play, and they have got a lot of political power, and we have got everybody on the GOP side screaming and shouting for the insurance companies. So he said let's figure out a plan where we keep the insurance companies involved.  Guess what? That plan was hatched at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, much beloved and revered by the GOP Members of this body. It was the exact same plan that Governor Mitt Romney, their standard bearer running for President a couple of elections ago, put into place in  The Affordable Care Act was the compromise. Now everybody is on their case because they are hiding under their desks, they are running away from their constituents, and they are canceling their townhalls. Nobody could get a plan out of them.  Suddenly they pull a plan out of their sleeve in the middle of the night. They rush it through this body. They voted on it at, I think, 4:30 in the morning after a 27-hour hearing. Everything is meant to be under the cloak of darkness, and people are making fun of them about how silly it is.  I sympathize with them because there is nothing they can do because the Affordable Care Act was the compromise. Now, they wanted to name it ObamaCare, of course, because they couldn't stand the idea that President Obama would get the political credit for bringing tens of millions of Americans health insurance. So they had to name it on him and then make up all of these stories about how terrible it was.  Guess what? They wake up today. Nobody is calling it ObamaCare anymore. President Obama is doing his own thing. They are calling it the Affordable Care Act, and people are defending it all over the country in 50 States in every congressional district.  You have got indivisible groups that have grown up all over the place, and my dear colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle are afraid to face their own constituents. They are canceling their townhalls, they are hiding under their beds and behind their office sofas, which, in many cases, are the exact same pieces of furniture because they sleep in their offices here. They don't want to face the people and the fact that we do not want to turn the clock back and go backwards and wreck this system. It is a lot easier to destroy things than to build things.  So we urge the GOP: If you want to meet to make real substantial improvements, expansion of the Affordable Care Act to include more people, to reduce the cost of the bureaucracy, let's do it. But your plan is a terrible plan. Your plan is one that is going to throw millions of people off of their health insurance. Your plan is one that is built around a huge tax break and transfer of wealth upwards in the country--one of the biggest transfers of wealth in the country ever to go in the northward direction.  It is an amazing thing that that is how they have designed their plan.  So it is a huge tax break to the insurance companies and to the wealthiest people, and millions of others are thrown off of their insurance plans. Everybody else's premiums are going to be soaring, and the whole system is likely to come crashing down.  If a foreign government like Russia, for example, were trying to do this to us, we would consider it an act of aggression, an act of war against the American people in our health care. But this is, instead, coming from what used to be one of our great political parties, the party of that President who talked about government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  We have, instead, a wrecking ball targeted right at you, the American people, coming after your health insurance, your health care, your ability to participate as a citizen in our healthcare system. That is a remarkable thing to be taking place in 2017.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the thoughtful gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Ellison).

11999,topic-id,1480,"Mr.Speaker, I just want to tie up some loose ends by exploring a few of the points that Mr.Ellison raised. But one of the very messy features of this legislation that is barreling through Congress this week is that the GOP leadership understood how popular the ban on denial of coverage for preexisting conditions is. That is going to be a mainstay of American life.  People should not be denied health care because they have a preexisting condition. That is the reason they should get health care, because they have a preexisting condition and they need it.  So they don't want to get rid of that. They understand that that is politically toxic. But they don't want to have the mandate for individuals to have to purchase insurance under the Affordable Care That has been the major problem they have with the That is their major anathema. They can't stand that.  But guess what? You can't have one without the other. And if they believe in economics and they are being honest, they will have to concede that. Why?  Well, if I am a healthy young person, as I used to be, I will say to myself: Wow, an insurance company has got to cover me, even if I have got a preexisting condition, and I am perfectly healthy now, and I don't have to buy the insurance. So I am just going to go on my merry way, la-di-da, until maybe 1 day I have got a problem, I am in an accident, or I get some kind of diagnosis. At that point, I go to an insurance company, and they are going to cover me.  So they have kept the preexisting condition provision of ObamaCare, which is wildly popular in the country now. They are terrified to touch it now, although they were opposed to it before. But their proposal gets rid of the individual mandate, and it doesn't work. It will bankrupt the entire system. It is not going to work.  Now, another thing is that they are ignoring the extraordinary success of the Affordable Care With whatever flaws it has got, it has been extraordinarily successful. It has dramatically reduced the number of uninsured people. It has insured more than 20 million people who did not have insurance before, and, therefore, it has dramatically reduced the number of people[[Page H2011]]showing up at the hospital in the emergency room with no insurance, and the hospitals have been obligated to see them.  And who pays for that? Guess who pays for it? You do, I do, the American public does when people show up without insurance. But the Affordable Care Act reduced, in a very significant way, the number of people showing up like that.  Now, in my home State of Maryland, we have seen extraordinary reductions in the numbers of people showing up in the emergency room without insurance because of the We have cut the uninsured rate by more than one-third in We had a rate of 10.6 percent. Now it is down to 7 percent since the ACA was implemented.  All of the people who run the hospitals and our healthcare system are terrified that, if the GOP bull in the china shop wrecks the Affordable Care Act, what is going to happen is we are going to have hundreds of thousands of more visits every year in emergency rooms by people who are not covered by insurance, which means that the taxpayers get stuck with the bill again.  Now, let me tell you about my congressional district, the beautiful Eighth Congressional District, of which I am very proud. Everybody loves their district, but I do have the most beautiful, the most extraordinary district in the country. In Montgomery County, Maryland, in Frederick County, Maryland, and in Carroll County, it is gorgeous. Please come out and visit us in Bethesda, in Rockville, throughout Carroll County, throughout Frederick Come to Middletown, go to Thurmont, check it all out. It is beautiful. Come and visit us.  Look what has happened in the Eighth Congressional Well, as I said, we have reduced the uninsured rate by a third. We have 444,600 people in the district who have health insurance that covers preventive services today, like cancer screenings and flu shots, without any copays, without any coinsurance or deductibles, and they now stand to lose this access if the majority succeeds in eliminating the ACA provisions requiring health insurers to cover preventive services without cost-sharing.  We have got more than a half a million people in my district with employer-sponsored health insurance who are at risk of losing important consumer protections like the prohibition on annual and lifetime limits, protection against unfair policy rescissions, and coverage of preexisting health conditions if the ACA is entirely or partially repealed.  We have 21,400 people in the district who have purchased high-quality marketplace coverage, who now stand to lose their coverage if the marketplaces are dismantled.  We have 16,000 people in the district who got financial assistance to purchase marketplace coverage in 2016, who are now at risk of coverage becoming unaffordable, if they have their way and they eliminate the premium tax credits, and so and so forth.  Everything is dismantling the protections you have, making your premiums go up, throwing millions of people out of health insurance, and transferring lots of wealth upwards through the tax breaks that they want to give to wealthy people and insurance companies.  By the way, as I understand it, there is a provision that they want to repeal which capped the tax deductibility of insurance company executive salaries beyond a half a million dollars. They want to repeal that, so that would continue to be tax deductible. You could pay them millions of dollars, and they get the tax break because, of course, that is going to be their first priority, making the wealthiest executives in the health insurance companies whole.  Who cares what happens to everybody else, whether they lose their insurance, their premiums go sky-high? They know exactly where their bread is buttered. And that is just the icing on the cake.  Mr.Speaker, I don't think that their legislation can pass because the American people are too smart for it and will not stand for it. I don't think it will pass.  The President is already distancing himself from it. We all started calling it The word went out that he didn't want it called We think he knows that it is not going to pass, or, if it does pass, it is going to be a debacle of historic significance and moment.  None of them want it to be named after them. We have offered RyanCare, we have offered None of them want to be associated with it.  I don't think it is going through. I understand that the Freedom Caucus, which thinks that there should just be a total free market, is going to vote against their plan, which they say is worse than ObamaCare, which they hated from the beginning. Although they are ideologically opposed to it, they know that ObamaCare is working, and they know that lots of people are being covered on it. And now they are going to be throwing millions of people off of ObamaCare, but they don't get what they want, which is a total free market.  Of course, a free market in health care doesn't work because health care is not a social domain where the market operates.                              {time}  2030  If you get sick or if you get injured, then you are just taken to the hospital. You don't have a lot of time to shop around for the best hospital or the best doctor. You just need to go in, which is why the civilized countries of the world that can afford it have gotten to the point of a single-payer plan. But they want to take us from the Affordable Care Act backwards. They want it to be a dog-eat-dog medical care system.  The American people are not going to accept that. They don't have a majority in Congress to do it, and it is the job of the minority in Congress which represents a majority of the people. Remember that the Democratic candidate for President received 1.9 million votes more than the Republican candidate for So it is the job of the minority which represents the majority of the American people, and it is the job of the people of the United States to say that we reject this sloppy, terrible plan that they are trying to rush through If they want to have discussions about actually improving things, we are very happy to do it. Otherwise, this cannot be accepted, and the American people need to pay very close attention to what is taking place in Congress this week.

12086,topic-id,1005,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I am delighted to be with my distinguished colleague from Michigan on this legislation, which is part of a package of bills brought forward by the majority, which we believe undermine the ability of Federal agencies to effectively promote the public interest.  To begin with, it is quite clear that this legislation is unnecessary. Current law already bans the use of agency funds for ``publicity or propaganda purposes.'' Current law also currently bars agency employees from grassroots lobbying campaign designed to pressure Members of Congress to support or to oppose agency proposals.  So, at the very least, all of this is duplicative, which wouldn't be so bad just to add another level of red tape and legislation, except for this: If you look at the legislation, under Restriction, part 2, it says:  ``Any public communication issued by an Executive agency that refers to a pending agency regulatory action, other than an impartial communication that requests comment on or provides information regarding the pending agency regulatory action, may not--  ``(A) directly advocate, in support of or against the pending agency regulatory action, for the submission of information to form part of the record of review for the pending agency regulatory action. . . .''  So let's parse that for a moment. What they are saying is that the agency may not directly advocate to the public: Please tell us whether you are for or against this regulation and why.  They are not trying to prevent a viewpoint-specific propaganda intervention by the agency. This would actually stifle the ability of the agency to solicit anybody's point of view to go out on Facebook and ask, ``What is your position about this,'' and to use social media to solicit the public's input.  So although the legislation masquerades as an attempt to promote government transparency, it actually radically undercuts government transparency and the ability of the agencies to solicit the widest possible input.  It also says that the agency may not appeal to the public or solicit a third party to undertake advocacy in support of or against the pending agency regulatory action.  Now, I would have no problem if what they were trying to do is simply restate the current ban on one-sided propaganda inquiries by an agency to get one side to come out and support or oppose an agency rulemaking, but that is already against the law.  What they are trying to do is to cut off the ability of the agency to solicit any public input on all sides of the issue.  Why would we place that kind of duct tape over the Administrative Procedure Act?  Well, one thought, if you look at this proposal in the context of everything else they have brought forward this week, they want to try to reduce everything to a cost-benefit analysis. That is, what would the cost to polluters be? What would the cost to the violators of the public interest be?  They never look at what the benefit to the public is of the regulations, and they want to do it behind closed doors and then prevent the agencies from going out and aggressively soliciting the input of the public on all sides of the issue.  So we don't see what the need for this proposal is. We believe that it will have a severely chilling effect on the ability of agencies to do their job. They continually talk about one case, the WOTUS case, the waters of the United States case, where I cheerfully and readily admit that the agency went too far in terms of campaigning for its proposal. But they were called on that. The GAO already determined that they ran afoul of the prohibitions.  So they have one case which was dealt with completely legitimately within the law, and they have not cited another case.  I would gladly yield my time to my distinguished colleague from Michigan if he can invoke one other case where there was a problem or explain why the resolution of this problem was not sufficient in this case, because I think everybody understood that the agency had gone too far. It was dealt with. The problem is over.  So now we have a so-called cure, which is far worse than the underlying disease because the so-called cure is going to stifle and chill the ability of every Federal agency in the United States Government to go out and aggressively solicit public input. That is what we want in the agency process.  Now, yesterday, they just voted to create a new roving supercommission that would pore through the rules of all the different Federal agencies and bring back a package and then ask us to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down so they can just more readily dismantle public regulation.  Let's be very clear about it. We're talking about regulation that protects clean air. They rejected an amendment that would carve out the Clean Air Act from that bill. We're talking about regulation that protects clean water. We're talking about regulation that protects the purity of our food and our drugs. We're talking about regulations that advance our interests in a clean environment and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.  So it seems like they want to put the whole Federal regulatory process into a straitjacket, prevent the public from being involved, and prevent the agencies from going out and soliciting public input. That doesn't sound like giving government back to the people. That sounds like giving government over to billionaires, special interests, and big corporate powers that have all the lobbyists in Washington and know how to get things done behind closed doors.  Mr.Chair, I invite my distinguished colleague from Michigan to address any of the questions I have if there are any examples that he can provide of problems that would yield the need for such a dramatic shutdown on the ability of agencies to solicit public input.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgH1469-2.txt,99999999999999,SECRETARY OF STATE KERRY'S SPEECH ON A TWO-STATE SOLUTION TO THE,2017.0,2.0,March
12090,topic-id,757,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again, the advocates for the legislation returned to this one single case, which we all agree about. The GAO ruled that the EPA ran afoul of the prohibition on propaganda and on campaigning.  So the law worked there. The GAO blew the whistle on that. They shouldn't be coming out on one side of an issue and running a propaganda campaign. The government should not be engaged in propaganda. We all agree to that.  This legislation does something completely different. This legislation, rather than just saying a good day's work to the GAO for blowing the whistle, it says: Now we are going to tell all the Federal agencies and departments that have been out soliciting public input on all sides of issues, saying there is a regulation that has come up about clean air, about clean water, about food, about drugs, about the disposal of nuclear waste, about radioactive materials, and it tells them you can't do that anymore. You can't go out and solicit public input.  It places a complete chill on the ability of the government to go out and invite public participation in our government. Why? They keep returning to one case where the GAO blew the whistle where everybody agrees they were out of bounds.  A flag was thrown on the play, but now they want to use that in order to essentially impose a gag rule on Federal agencies across the land who are doing our work. The much reviled regulation that the agencies are engaged in is an attempt to flesh out the laws that we pass in this body because we don't want to be setting all of the particular rules about exactly how many pollutants can be in this water, in this[[Page H1472]]stream, in this river, in this creek, and so on, because we are not scientific experts on how many pollutants can be put into the air here and there. So it is delegated to government agencies.  But when they go through the Administrative Procedure Act and they have a rule and comment process, they should be able to go out and invite the public to participate.  Again, I invite my distinguished and thoughtful colleagues on the other side to cite one other case. Can they cite one case where the GAO did not blow the whistle? Can they cite some other litany of examples where there has been a real problem with government agencies being overzealous where it has not been corrected by the GAO?  The silence is deafening.  They have used the example of one problem that was caught, that was corrected, in order to try to demolish the ability of Federal agencies to go out and solicit the public's input.  To me, that is a familiar experience now, because I have been in the House of Representatives for just 2 months, and, in the committees I serve on, we continue to vote on bills where we have not had a single public hearing. We are not hearing from any of the groups.  I have a letter here objecting to this legislation that has been signed by the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, American Association for Justice, American Association of University Women, Americans for Financial Reform, Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, Autistic Self Advocacy Network, BlueGreen Alliance, Center for Biological Diversity, Clean Water Action, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, Demand Progress, Earthjustice, Economic Policy Institute, Environment America, Environmental Working Group, Food & Water Watch, Greenpeace, Homeowners Against Deficient Dwellings, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, International Union of United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers, League of Conservation Voters, National Association of Consumer Advocates, and on and on and on.  I would like to have heard from these people in this process, but it seems like all we are getting from the other side is an attempt to have a curtain of darkness fall over all public process. We would like to have hearings. We want groups to be involved. But these people were not invited to testify. They didn't have a chance to opine on this.  Mr.Chair, in general, the problem here is that, rather than making government more transparent, we are making government more opaque. Rather than making government more open, we are making government more closed. Rather than reaching out to the public and inviting it into the rulemaking process, we are shutting the door and closing the blinds on it.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

12092,topic-id,337,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I think we are finally having some light here on the subject.  My distinguished colleague and fellow freshman from Michigan is most concerned about what did take place in the Waters of the United States case. He praises the GAO for responding to Senator Inhofe's inquiry.  We all agree that the GAO determined that the EPA ran afoul of existing prohibitions in law on propaganda, on taking a side in an issue. A flag was called on the play and the problem was dealt with.  If you find a kid shoplifting a candy bar, and you catch him, you remove him from the store, you tell him not to do it again. You don't then go pass a law saying that anybody under 18 cannot enter any commercial establishment in the country. The law worked in that specific case.  But, you see, they have taken a sledgehammer to a mosquito, and the mosquito was already killed. So now what they are busting up is the ability of agencies across the country simply to use the social media to go out and to solicit and invite public input into the rulemaking process. What are we afraid of?  Justice Brandeis said that sunshine is the great disinfectant. We want the public involved. We want the public's engagement.  So, again, I invite my thoughtful colleagues on the other side to cite one case of an agency doing this that was not dealt with by the I can cite you countless examples of cases where Federal agencies have gone online to invite public input in a completely objective and neutral way. Now we are creating a chill over that process because of this ban on soliciting advocacy from the public on either side of the issue.  So I simply don't get it, and I am puzzled why they continually talk about one case which was happily resolved under existing law.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  0945  ",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgH1469-2.txt,99999999999999,REPLACE ACA EXCHANGES AND MEDICAID EXPANSION,2017.0,2.0,March

Coaltion for                                          Sensible Safeguards,                                                February 28, 2017.     Re House floor vote of H.1004, the Regulatory Integrity                Dear Representative: The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards      (CSS), an alliance of over 150 labor, scientific, research,      good government, faith, community, health, environmental, and      public interest groups, strongly oppose H.1004, the      Regulatory Integrity       The bill is a brazen attack on the public's right to know      by micro-managing the type of information that agencies are      allowed to communicate to all of us when taking actions to      protect the public, our economy, and the environment. An open      government that prioritizes democratic public participation      requires agencies to be able to effectively convey      information to the public and make agency policy positions      clear to the public. This bill will make our government less      open and less democratic and should therefore be rejected.       H.1004 will significantly inhibit federal agencies'      ability to engage and inform the public in a meaningful and      transparent way regarding its work on important science-based      rulemakings that will greatly benefit the public. As a      result, the bill will lead to[[Page H1473]]     decreased public awareness and participation in the      rulemaking process in direct contradiction of the      Administrative Procedure Act and agencies' authorizing      statutes, which specifically provide for broad stakeholder      engagement.       Substantial ambiguities in the bill threaten to create      uncertainty and confusion among agencies about what public      communications are permissible, and thus risks discouraging      them from keeping the public apprised of the important work      that they do on its behalf. In an era when agencies should be      increasingly embracing innovative 21st century communications      technologies needed to reach the public, including social      media, H.1004 sends exactly the wrong message.       The legislation strictly prohibits agencies from issuing      ``public communications'' that ``emphasize the importance''      of a particular agency action unless the communication has      the ``clear purpose of informing the public of the substance      or status'' of the particular action. The legislation applies      to a wide swath of regulatory actions including rulemakings,      guidance, policy statements, directives and adjudications.       While H.1004 assumes that the distinction between      informing the public of an agency action and emphasizing the      importance of that action is self-evident, in practice the      distinction is anything but clear. As a result, agencies are      likely to avoid any public communications that risk running      afoul of this ambiguous prohibition, no matter how      informative the communication might be for the public.       For example, various executive orders and statutes compel      agencies to conduct cost-benefit analysis on their pending      rulemakings, and thus to determine whether the rule's      benefits outweigh its costs. As currently written, the      Regulatory Integrity Act could potentially prohibit an agency      from communicating the results of such an analysis when it      concludes that a particular rule generates net benefits.      After all, that conclusion is tantamount to declaring that      the rule makes society better off on balance. Instead, the      agency would likely be forced to simply share the basic      information that they had conducted a cost-benefit analysis      of the regulation without being able to share the further      crucial information that the regulation's benefits exceeded      the costs. Given that many of the bill's sponsors      enthusiastically endorse the expanded use of cost-benefit      analysis in the rulemaking process, these kinds of arbitrary      prohibitions on communications concerning cost-benefit      analysis seem especially peculiar.       Agencies would encounter this problematic scenario when      deciding to share vital information, such as:       How many lives would be saved by a regulation;       How much property damage would be averted;       How much money consumers would save; and       Any of the other myriad public benefits that regulations      are designed to provide.       The stark absence of any clear bright-lines in the      legislation delineating what is and what is not prohibited      public communications is sure to have a chilling effect on      agencies, with the predictable result that agencies will be      less willing to share crucial information with the public and      that the public will be less informed about government      activities.       H.1004 also will severely impede, rather than enable,      agency use of new communication technologies, most notably      social media platforms, to reach the public. Regulatory      experts and scholars agree that agencies should be using      social media forums and platforms.       Agencies will find it difficult, if not impossible, to      communicate with the public through social media under H.     1004 since the bill prevents any usage of social media that      both conveys information about a regulatory action but also      promotes the importance of that action.       For example, the U.Department of Interior operates a      Twitter and Instagram account that is very popular with the      public because it regularly features photos of beautiful      landscapes and wildlife from national parks across the United      Under the Regulatory Integrity Act, the Department      might be prohibited from posting such photos on Twitter and      Instagram because they are not solely informational in nature      and could be interpreted as promoting the importance of the      department's work in environmental and wildlife preservation.       Enactment of H.1004 will lead to less transparency in      the government, make it more difficult for agencies to use      new communication technologies popular with the public, and      generally chill agency communications with the public on      important matters due to the lack of any bright-line      standards for agencies to follow.       We strongly urge you to oppose H.1004, the Regulatory      Integrity           Sincerely,                                              Robert Weissman,                                                        President,     Public Citizen                                  ____                                League of Conservation Voters,                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2017.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members,      the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) works to turn      environmental values into national, state, and local      priorities. Each year, LCV publishes the National      Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of      members of Congress on environmental legislation. The      Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters      nationwide, and the media.       LCV urges you to vote NO on H.998, the SCRUB Act, H.     1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act, and H.1009, the OIRA      Insight, Reform, And Accountability LCV joins our      partners in the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards--an      alliance of consumer, public health, labor, good government,      environmental, and scientific groups--in strongly opposing      this trio of extreme bills that have far-reaching and      damaging consequences for vital public health and      environmental safeguards.       H.998, the SCRUB Act, would jeopardize critical      environmental safeguards that have been in place for decades      and would make it extremely difficult to develop new      standards in response to threats to public health and the      environment. This legislation creates a regulatory review      commission that would disregard the public benefits of      environmental safeguards and only consider the costs to      industries. By creating a misguided ``cut-go'' system for      safeguards, this bill would result in key public health      protections being eliminated.       H.1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act, would      significantly hinder communications between federal agencies      and the public and would discourage agencies from using      social media platforms. This legislation would reduce      government transparency and would leave the public less      informed about government activities. The vague guidelines      about what public communications are allowed would result in      agencies being less willing to share key information with the      public.       H.1009, the OIRA Insight, Reform, And Accountability      Act, would endanger clean air and clean water protections by      opening them up to more litigation. The bill would      effectively rewrite dozens of laws in which Congress mandated      that agencies prioritize public health, safety and the      preservation of clean air and water over concerns about      industry profits.       LCV urges you to REJECT H.998, 1004, & 1009 and will      strongly consider including votes on these bills in the 2017                Sincerely,                                                   Gene Karpinski,                                      ____       Good Morning Everyone: I am writing to express the      opposition of the American Association for Justice (AAJ) to      the three anti regulation bills that will be voted on on the      House floor this week. The Searching for and Cutting      Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act of 2017      (SCRUB Act); The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017; and the      OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act all impede the      ability of federal agencies to appropriately protect the      health, safety and well-being of the American public. As a      result, we urge your boss to vote NO on all three bills. See      below and attached for additional information on each bill.      Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

In addition, the bill      provides for a blanket percentage reduction in the cumulative      regulatory cost to industry without adequately considering      the benefits bestowed upon the public by these same      regulations. Under the severe SCRUB Act regulatory cost      considerations, targeted regulations could be repealed even      when the benefits of these rules are significant, appreciated      by the public, and far outweigh the costs.       The SCRUB Act also contains entirely ineffective cut-go      provisions. Under the bill's cut-go provisions, an agency      would be required to remove an existing regulation of equal      or greater cost from its cut-go list before it can issue a      new regulation. As a result of these provisions, agencies      will be unable to respond to any emerging hazard with any new      public regulatory protections or guidance.            H.1004, The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017       The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017 significantly limits      the types of communications federal agencies can have with      the public regarding pending regulatory actions and prohibits      agencies from soliciting support for its regulatory actions.      These inappropriately restrictive provisions have two goals:      stymieing important public protections and preventing the      public from knowing about the positive impact pending      regulations may provide.      H.1009, The OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act       Lastly, the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act      creates yet another duplicative and unnecessary commission to      provide for the repeal of regulations, while also providing      for numerous additional hurdles in the regulatory review      process. It would codify the numerous burdensome regulatory      review requirements and make them subject to judicial review      which would provide for extensive challenge and delay of      important protections. More concerning, this bill would[[Page H1474]]     severely damage the impact of dozens of Congressionally      passed public interest laws that require agencies to      prioritize public health and safety and protecting the      environment and instead focus on cost to industry. It also      would make federal agency science much more vulnerable to      judicial review. Lastly, the bill would effectively undermine      Congressionally chartered independent agencies by putting      them under the influence of the Office of the  ",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgH1469-2.txt,99999999999999,0915,2017.0,2.0,March

Executive Order 13563, which was issued by President Obama, requires each agency to ``periodically review existing significant regulations to determine whether any such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed, so as to make the agency's regulatory program more effective or less burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.''  Because there is little doubt that this executive order covers the review and elimination of duplicative and overlapping regulatory actions, there is no need for the additional reporting requirements that this amendment would redundantly impose. More importantly, this amendment simply fails to address the profound flaws in the underlying bill. It fails to provide the bright lines for what an agency can communicate to the public safely within the stringent new guidelines. It fails to eliminate the unnecessarily burdensome and onerous requirements in the bill that seem to have no purpose but to reduce the amount of information agencies would be able to release to the public and invite from the public.                              {time}  1000  The amendment fails to eliminate the prohibition against agencies making public communications that directly advocate for or oppose the submission of public comments or expert analysis of a pending rule. The amendment fails to remove the serious impediments this bill places in the way of agency use of social media platforms. Most importantly, the amendment does nothing to cure the serious chilling effect that the bill would have on agency communications and the negative effects that this imposition would have on the ability of agencies to educate millions of Americans about the costs and benefits of a particular regulation and to invite their input into the rulemaking process.

11929,topic-id,993,"Mr.President, today I rise to speak in support of the President's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who, right now, is about two-thirds through his second day of hearings--better described perhaps as a grilling.  Simply put, I think the President made an extraordinary selection. Currently, Judge Gorsuch serves on the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which includes my home State of  Our State has seen firsthand how Judge Gorsuch interprets the law. He has had an outstanding judicial record while serving on the court. What is more, he is highly respected and supported by individuals in the judicial community who align on all sides of the political spectrum--except, inexplicably, the U. Judge Gorsuch's qualifications are not only noteworthy but extremely impressive. He graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law He received a doctorate in legal philosophy from Oxford, as a recipient of the Marshall Scholarship, one of the most prestigious scholars programs in the country. He has litigation experience from his time as a law partner, and he has clerked for not one but two Supreme Court  Examining his record during his time on the Tenth Circuit gives us some insight into the judge's approach to interpreting the law. When we read his opinions, we know he is a judge who follows the law, applying the text of the Constitution and statutes impartially. Of primordial importance to this body is his critique of the executive branch's tendency to assume the roles of the judicial and legislative branches.[[Page S1880]]  No matter which political party controls the executive branch, this body--the Senate of the United States--must protect its ability to legislate and create laws. The Founding Fathers intended for the separation of powers to remain inviolate.  Judge Gorsuch understands the role of the judicial branch and the significance of maintaining that balance of power. He has made it absolutely clear that he will not legislate from the bench. I repeat. He has made it clear that he will not legislate from the bench. That might just be the problem for those who would like to vote for a judge who would legislate from the bench.  I, along with many of my colleagues here in the Senate today, confirmed Judge Gorsuch over 10 years ago. Judge Gorsuch's record was so noncontroversial, the Senate unanimously supported his nomination. That includes the minority leader, Senator Schumer, and then-Senators Obama, Clinton, and  I repeat. Judge Gorsuch has received support from across the entire political spectrum. His judicial record over the past 10 years has made him even more deserving of the Senate's full support.  The American people went to the polls in November, knowing the next President would have the distinct honor of nominating the next Supreme Court The American people have spoken. As the Senate, it is now our responsibility to see through this nomination and appoint the judge to the High  The Wall Street Journal summed up what is happening within its editorial page today in pointing out that Senators want Judge Gorsuch to declare how he would vote in specific areas of the law--questions that every Supreme Court nominee declines to answer. Quoting from the editorial: ``At the 1967 hearings for Thurgood Marshall, then-Senator Edward Kennedy called it a sound legal precedent that any nominee for the Supreme Court would have to defer any comments on any matters which are either before the court or very likely to appear before the court.'' The Journal's editorial went on to say that in the 1993 confirmation hearings, Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg emphasized: ``A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecast, no hints; for that would show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would also display disdain for the entire judicial process.''  I regret to say that profound advice apparently does not apply today.  One of my colleagues serving on the Judiciary Committee pretty well summed up the dilemma we have in the Senate when he said to the judge: ``If you fail to be explicit and forthcoming, the committee would have to assume his views were in line with Mr.Trump's.''  And there is the rub. Judge Gorsuch has written 789 opinions, with only 15 dissents from other judges. The apparent burr in the minority's saddle--the Democrats' saddle--has nothing to do with Judge Gorsuch or his qualifications. The problem is that Mr.Trump is now President  My question is this. All right, we know you feel that way. In every committee hearing that we have, we know you feel that way. When will this end? When will we get back to what is referred to as regular order? That question lies squarely with my colleagues in the minority.  I am really disheartened to hear the rhetoric coming from across the aisle in the days since the new President took office. The minority has taken extraordinary lengths to extend the confirmation process of the President's nominees--from shying away from our constitutional responsibilities and not voting on nominees in committee hearings to using unprecedented amounts of time to speak on this floor, disapproving of the President and his nominees, or anything else. These stall tactics are unbefitting of the world's greatest deliberative body. We have fallen from bipartisan deliberation, worthy of public opinion and support, to engaging with poisonous arrows of political procrastination.  With the nomination of Judge Gorsuch, we now have an opportunity to fix this sorry state of affairs. This is the opportunity we should seize to restore comity to the The people of this great Nation deserve nothing else.  I am hopeful that the minority will recognize the superlative qualities Judge Neil Gorsuch possesses and provide him with a fair and swift confirmation process.  That is not happening as of today. But hope springs eternal, even within the Senate as it now exists.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

It is outrageous that today, more than four decades later, President Trump and my Republican colleagues have made restricting choice their first order of business.  Yesterday, President Trump signed an executive order banning health organizations that receive U.funding from even mentioning abortion as a medical option for their patients. And today, this House is launching a radical assault on women's health care that penalizes women and small businesses that choose private health insurance plans that cover abortion services.

11905,topic-id,3378,"Mr.President, I rise to encourage my colleagues to rescind a recently promulgated regulation by the Obama administration and to support the corresponding resolution of disapproval that the majority leader just brought up and that we unanimously moved forward to debate, H.69.  There are few, if any, people in the world who love their lands and wildlife more than In Alaska, our land is the lifeblood that sustains us, that feeds our bodies, our families, and our souls. It is a deep and enduring part of our culture.  Our hunting traditions are very much alive in Alaskans hunt for food for cultural reasons and even for survival. There are people in my State whose families have called our beautiful and rugged lands home for thousands of years, living side-by-side with more recent arrivals. Alaska has also the well-earned reputation of having one of the best managed, most sustainable fish and game populations anywhere in America or anywhere in the world, for that matter. We have an abundance of wildlife that most States and most countries can only dream of. We do this year after year, generation after generation, through rigorous scientific processes that allow and encourage public participation through our Board of Game, Board of Fisheries, and our Fish and Game Department to make sure we manage our fish and game for sustainability, as required by the Alaska constitution, and that we take into account the needs of our citizens--the needs of It is not an easy process. It can be contentious, but all Alaskans take this very seriously.  In Alaska, we respect the land and everything in it. That special connection and our ability to manage our own lands and resources was explicitly recognized in Federal law when Alaska became a The Alaska Statehood Act passed in this body in 1958, specifically granting Alaska the authority to manage fish and wildlife on not only State lands but on Federal lands, unless Congress passes a law to the contrary. By the way, that is the same authority granted to all It is granted to Ohio, New Mexico--all States in America have this authority.  Further, in 1980, this body, the Congress of the United States, passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, designating 100 million acres of land, in my great State, as Federal conservation units, including over 70 million acres--I believe larger than the State of New Mexico--as wildlife refuges in one  Many Alaskans didn't like this bill. Several saw this as a massive Federal usurpation of our land, but our congressional delegation fought to include explicit provisions in this Federal law that made it abundantly clear that the State of Alaska still had primacy in managing fish and game throughout the entire State--State lands and Federal lands.  When that act was passed, it explicitly stated: ``Nothing in this act is intended to enlarge or diminish the responsibility and authority of the State of Alaska for the management of fish and wildlife on public lands. . . .''  That is pretty clear language, and it is very important language to ANILCA is the statute we are talking about, and that is what we call it in That Federal law that passed in 1980 made numerous other commitments to Alaskans about how the Federal Government would not usurp the power of the State or our citizens to live the life we have in How quickly the Feds forget. How quickly the Feds forget what this law requires.  On August 5, 2016, the Obama administration's Fish and Wildlife Service finalized a rule that, 1, restricted certain State-approved fish and game management practices; 2, limited public input in the wildlife management process; and, 3, expanded closure procedures on refuges in Alaska, making it easier to keep people shut out of these Federal lands in our  This rule is not based on sound science. Thousands of Alaskans and other Americans opposed it, tried to work with the Feds to get them to moderate it or rescind it, to no avail. It is not based on established wildlife management principles, and it is certainly not based on Federal law. The Fish and Wildlife Service didn't take this action because Alaska's sustainable and abundant populations of fish and game or their habitats were being threatened; it took this action because it wanted to control Alaska's fish and wildlife and because it subjectively disapproved of the way Alaska's game was being managed by our Department of Fish and Game and by the Alaska Board of Game, but the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service does not have this authority.  To make this clear, we are proceeding today with this resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, H.69, to rescind that August 5 Obama Fish and Wildlife Service rule.  The House has already passed this measure under Congressman Don Young's leadership. So I want to encourage all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to vote in favor of this resolution. It is backed by the force of law, the principles of federalism, and respect for the Alaskan Native people who have been hunting and fishing, subsisting off the land in Alaska for generations. It is also supported by millions of Americans across the country and wildlife professionals in every State in the Union who are committed to the conservation of the abundant species of wildlife in my home State and in theirs.  Why should my colleagues support rescinding this Fish and Wildlife Service regulation? Well, first and foremost, as I have already mentioned, it clearly usurps power from the States[[Page S1865]]and it ignores Federal law. Unfortunately, faced with a Federal law it disagreed with, the Fish and Wildlife Service took the route other Federal agencies have been taking over the years by simply writing a reg to bypass the will of Congress and the American people, by simply moving forward with their preferred policy preference via regulation and ignoring the law. That is an issue every Member of this body, whether you are a Democrat or Republican, should be concerned about and vigilant to reverse.  It is not a partisan issue. It is a federalism issue. It is a States' rights issue. That is why my State of Alaska, led by a Governor who is an Independent and a Lieutenant Governor who is a Democrat, sued to overturn the Obama administration's litigation. This litigation that my State brought against the Federal Government cites Federal laws like ANILCA, which declares that the State of Alaska ``has jurisdiction over the management of fish and wildlife on public lands throughout the State.'' That is the Federal law.  The law is clear, and of course it makes sense from a management perspective. Alaska is a patch of many different ownerships of our land--State, Federal, and Native lands. The moose and bear in our great State don't know these borders. One agency needs to be in charge, and that is the State agency.  While it might be true that this Obama administration regulation, as written, only applies and impacts Alaska, it is a precedent that should trouble every Member of this body and every State in the Union because if it can be done in Alaska, it can be done anywhere. That is why the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, State agencies charged with managing wildlife in all 50 States and territories from California, New Mexico, to New Jersey all support this resolution. They all support overturning the Obama administration's Fish and Wildlife reg. All 50 States, the people who know these issues, support what we are doing on the Senate floor right now.  A second and related reason for the broad bipartisan support not only in Alaska but across the country for rescinding this Fish and Wildlife regulation is because it significantly reduces the public participation in managing lands and wildlife in Before this rule came out, the harvest of fish and wildlife on Alaska refuges was governed by Alaska's Board of Game and Board of Fish, and the process was highly sensible. I have been to Board of Game meetings. It is open to the public and responsive to the public, but this new regulation gives the Federal Government a veto over State regulations issued by the boards, with no public process and no public input.  The rule also makes closures of Federal lands subject more to the whims of Federal officials than to the input of the people they serve. It shuts down the public process, which is critical to the successful stable management of fish and game in my  This Federal regulation also undermines subsistence. In Alaska, ``subsistence'' isn't just a word, a catch phrase, or a slogan. It is not what people do for the benefit of tourism. It is critical. The public participation element is critical to the healthy management of fish and game, and it also enables the professionals to learn from the people--particularly the Native people in my State--what we call traditional knowledge in As I mentioned, ``subsistence'' in my State isn't just a catch phrase or a slogan. Subsistence encompasses the customary and traditional use of fish, wildlife, plant resources, preserving cultural traditions, supplying basic necessities such as food, firewood, and clothing. It provides for barter, trade, and income for subsistence in the cash-based rural economy. It is serious business in my Subsistence in Alaska is life, literally, and it has been so for thousands of years. In so many of my State's villages, there is no grocery store, there is no Costco, there is no Whole Foods market. If one doesn't get a moose in the fall or have enough salmon in the summer that someone catches, they might have trouble surviving in the winter. This is serious business.  In other places in Alaska, where we do have small grocery stores, the costs are often more than twice to four times the national average for basic necessities. President Obama, when he visited Alaska in 2015, went out to the rural communities, and once he saw it, he understood this. When he came to Alaska, he said, ``You're looking at prices that are double, in some cases, or even higher for basic necessities like milk, like orange juice, like other produce. . . . That's part of the reason why the subsistence economy [in Alaska] is so important.''  This is the former President of the United States making this comment.  One wonders why this Fish and Wildlife Service then issued a reg that attacked subsistence. But to be honest, most Americans and certainly most Senators do not fully understand this. Again, due to the tenacity of Alaska's congressional delegation--former Senators, such as Ted Stevens, and current Members, such as Don Young in the House--Federal law recognizes the importance of subsistence in  The protection of subsistence rights in ANILCA and other Federal legislation is listed throughout our Federal laws. Specifically, ANILCA states:       The opportunity for rural residents engaged in a      subsistence way of life must continue to be so.  It further goes on to state that the Federal Government's actions in Alaska should have ``the least adverse impact possible on rural residents who depend on subsistence uses of the resources of such lands.''  This issue of subsistence is important to thousands of my constituents. It is not a theoretical issue, it is critical, but it is now more important to the Alaska Native populations in my State, which is close to 20 percent of my  In 2014, the Alaska Federation of Natives ratified a resolution that criticized a proposal from the Federal Government that was similar to the one we are debating today, and they stated the following in their resolution:       Alaska Natives have served as the stewards of their      traditional lands and resources, maintaining healthy and      productive ecosystems for thousands of years, and maintain      the belief that human beings are an integral part of      naturally functioning ecosystems, not separate from them.  That is what all Alaskans believe. Yet, despite Federal laws that emphasize the importance of subsistence to all Alaskans and pleas and letters from hundreds of Alaska Natives who ask the Federal Government not to negatively impact their subsistence way of life and opportunities with this new Fish and Wildlife Service regulation, the Fish and Wildlife Service persisted. They promulgated this regulation in the face of opposing voices in Alaska and Federal law that says they do not have the authority to do this.  You know it is targeted for subsistence because in the Fish and Wildlife Service's initial rule, that rule stated that the law and the policy had to ``take into consideration the fact that humans are dependent on wildlife refuge subsistence resources.'' That was the original draft rule. Subsistence matters. That was in there, a nod to Federal law. Guess what happened with the final rule? That entire section on subsistence was removed by the Federal Government, which showed that this law is an anti-subsistence law, which violates Federal law. They did not want Alaskans to subsist off their lands as required by Federal law.  Alaska's attorney general, Jahna Lindemuth, who was appointed by an Independent Governor from my State, said:       These federal regulations are not about . . . protecting      the State's wildlife numbers. These regulations are about the      federal government trying to control Alaskans' way of life.  Hunting is a way of life in The Presiding Officer is a hunter and understands that it is cultural and that it provides subsistence and even protection for our citizens.  Let's be clear. The Fish and Wildlife regulation at issue today, which we are debating, is an anti-hunting rule, pure and simple. That this is the case became very clear when the former Fish and Wildlife Service Director, Dan Ashe, who promulgated this regulation, questioned the ethics of our hunters in Alaska in a Huffington Post column. He said that some of Alaska's practices are ``wholly at odds with America's long tradition of ethical, sportsmanlike, fair-chase hunting.'' That is from the former Fish and Wildlife Service One knows where he is coming from on this.  Along these lines, I anticipate some of my colleagues on the other side of[[Page S1866]]the aisle--I see one of them down here already--are going to come down and start touting this parade of horribles, spurred on by anti-hunting groups to convince our colleagues to vote against this resolution of disapproval--what we want to have passed. You might hear phrases from them like Alaska's practices constitute a ``war on wolves'' or a ``black eye for ethical hunters,'' with the implication that my constituents are not ethical hunters. One might even see my colleagues repeat the false and misleading claims that have been run on TV by certain groups about alleged unethical hunting and game management practices in I would like to make a suggestion or two to my colleagues who are coming down here to speak against this resolution of disapproval.  First, please let them try to do so with a sense of humility and a sense of history. Yes, one or two of them may have been accomplished hunters in their own right or are still accomplished hunters in their own right. I respect that. I love to hunt. But that does not mean one has as much or any knowledge or understanding of my State's long history and distinguished record of fish and game management. One might prefer his meat wrapped in cellophane at the grocery store. That is fine, but I ask that one doesn't criticize the thousands of Alaskans who have to hunt for their food and who value hunting as a deep part of their culture.  I would also caution one from making claims that Alaska's wildlife officials allow for unethical hunting and management practices that require the Federal Government to intervene in my State's long history of distinguished fish and game management. Such an argument would be at odds with the consistent and numerous awards the State of Alaska has received for its outstanding management of fish and game year after year after year--American Fishery Society awards, awards from the Department of the Interior, the Wildlife Society, and the Association of Fish and Wildlife Those who manage wildlife in Alaska are the best in their field. It is not just Alaskans who take issue or who will take issue with such statements that I am sure we are going to hear on the floor.  Let me read a list of hunting and conservation groups that support this resolution of disapproval, groups that, in other words, support the overturning of the Fish and Wildlife rule at issue today. It is a very long list, and it is actually longer than this: Ducks Unlimited, National Wild Turkey Federation, Pheasants Forever, Quail Forever, Boone and Crockett Club, Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, Delta Waterfowl Foundation, Alaska Outdoor Council, Alaska Professional Hunters Association, American Outfitter and Guide Association, Territorial Sportsmen, National Rifle Association, Safari Club The list goes on and on.  These groups represent millions of hunters, conservationists, wildlife enthusiasts, and wildlife scientists who represent millions of Americans who are focused on the model of conservation that we all are supportive of, and they are the backbone of habitat and species conservation in our country. These groups--every one of them--are supportive of what we are trying to do on the Senate floor today. These groups certainly do not consider themselves unethical hunters. To the contrary, they care deeply about conservation and abundant wildlife populations not only for themselves but for the generations of Americans to come, and they have dedicated their lives to this. They represent Americans from across the 50 States--Montana, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Their values, like the values held by Alaskans with regard to conservation and hunting, should not be doubted and I certainly hope are not going to be attacked on the Senate floor.  In closing, I believe in respectful and informed debate. Sometimes it certainly requires reaching beyond one's own experience to listen to others with opposing views. I took the opportunity to do that just the other day. I had a conversation with the president and CEO of the Humane Society about the issue and resolutions we are discussing today. I know that he and others are leading the opposition to this, but we had a very respectful conversation. We heard each other's views, and although we likely will not agree on this issue, I hope he felt that I talked to him with respect and listened to him because that is what I did.  Perhaps my colleagues who are going to speak against this resolution today should do the same. I would hope that those who come down to the floor to oppose overturning this rule would have picked up the phone and maybe called Alaska's Department of Fish and Game, or talked to a biologist there, or maybe talked to the chairman of the Board of Game and asked if he is an ethical hunter, or maybe called a store in remote Alaska to ask about food prices, or made some inquiries about the lack of stores in dozens of villages that rely on subsistence, or called an Alaska Native leader to see how important subsistence is to his life and his culture.  Maybe my colleagues would have called one of my constituents who wrote in opposing this rule. He is an Alaska Native who lives in rural Alaska and whose grandfather taught him to hunt and fish. Here is what he wrote to us:       Please do not pass these types of regulations that will      change my future. These lands are dear to Alaska Natives, and      I feel that some of the Fish and Wildlife workers are biased      as well as listening to the wrong people. By the ``wrong      people,'' I mean Fish and Wildlife officials who do not      understand my subsistence rights, who do not work in the      villages, who want to take away my right to hunt.  This is about the rule of law, primacy, federalism, and it is about much more than that; it is about real people--people like my constituents.  I urge my colleagues to support our resolution of disapproval and rescind this regulation that violates the law, undermines subsistence in Alaska, and will do harm to my State and other  I yield the floor.

So I think that is the starting point.  The principle of federalism.

11852,topic-id,704,"Mr.Speaker, this bill gives a well-deserved pay raise, enhances health care, and eases the burden our Nation demands on military families moving forward. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in support of this bill.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I surely want to make sure that we support our warfighters. My problem with the Defense bill is that we are spending so much money on things that I think are questionable. I would rather spend money on supporting our troops more than spending $1 trillion over the next 3 decades building more nuclear weapons. We have more nuclear weapons than any other country in the world, and we ought to be talking about limiting nuclear weapons and eliminating them altogether.  I want to support our men and women who we put in harm's way, but I want this Congress, I want Members of this House, to do their job. It doesn't take any courage to sit back and have troops deployed all over the world, in harm's way, and we don't even take the time to actually debate an authorization for the use of military force. We are too afraid to talk about those issues.  So when we talk about supporting our men and women in uniform, people ought to do a little bit of reflection on how we have not been doing our job.  Again, I note my friends don't want to talk about health care. My colleague actually said she would like to talk about health care more.

Right to markup; trying to rush it to the floor before we find out the true cost to the American people about what this TrumpCare bill is going to be all about; when they find out how many of them are going to lose their care; how it is going to cut Medicare; how senior citizens are going to see an increase in their healthcare costs; how average Americans are going to pay more for health care and get less protections; how people who are struggling in poverty are going to be out of luck because they are going to do away with the Medicaid guarantee to  Health care ought to be a fundamental right in this country, and they are taking that right away, and they are doing it in a fashion so that CBO, again, 200 employees at the Congressional Budget Office that Congress appropriates $50 million a year to support so they can do their expert work, they are doing this in a way so we are not even asking for their expert advice.

11931,topic-id,1544,"Mr.President, we are here to consider another joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review This one, H.69, repeals the U.Fish and Wildlife Service's regulation and would allow extreme and inhumane hunting practices on National Wildlife Refuges in  My first concern about this measure is that it is a distraction. It benefits special interests to the detriment of the American people at a time when Congress should be focused on much more pressing issues.  Mr.President, 24 million Americans are at risk of losing their healthcare. Clean air and clean water protections are threatened. The President is proposing to cut Meals on Wheels, Head Start, the arts and humanities, and the National Institutes of Each day we learn more details about the President and his team's connections to Russia and about Russia's involvement in our elections.  The American people want Congress to work together to rebuild our Nation's infrastructure and boost our economy. Instead, Congress is wasting time and energy using the Congressional Review Act to repeal commonsense rules that protect people, places, and iconic species. These rules have been vetted over months and years through a thorough public process, but if we repeal them using the CRA, these measures will be permanently blocked unless Congress passes a new law directing the government to act.  My second concern is just as serious. I support responsible hunting practices. Many New Mexicans hunt for sport and for food, but the vast majority of hunters also recognize that some practices are counterproductive, unsportsmanlike, cruel, and they can even wipe out species and the diversity of wildlife in certain regions. The Fish and Wildlife's rule deals with that issue, and it carries Congress's express direction that the Service protect natural diversity at national wildlife refuges in  We are talking about national wildlife refuges. These are the country's refuges. The Service bars a few extreme practices for hunting bears, wolves, and coyotes that are totally inappropriate on national wildlife refuge land. These extreme practices include targeting and killing black bears and brown bears and their cubs, and wolves and coyotes and their pups during denning season; baiting Grizzly bears with food so they are easier to kill at point-blank range; trapping brown and black bears with steel-jawed traps that shut on the animal's leg, leaving them to suffer indefinitely; and shooting bears from aircraft or killing them same-day from spotting them with aircraft. Many of these practices violate ``fair chase'' ethical standards established and used by sportsmen across the country. Alaska voters actually oppose these practices.  We are not talking about private hunting land. This is Federal refuge land. Fish and Wildlife's rule is based on sound science and appropriate wildlife management standards. The rule doesn't change or restrict the taking of fish or wildlife for subsistence purposes, which some Alaskans count on to feed their families, and it doesn't restrict sport hunting. Fish and Wildlife's rule is not an anti-hunting rule. It is a commonsense guideline that ensures bear and wolf populations, as well as caribou, elk, and moose, are sustained for generations to come.  Let me reiterate that. Like the vast majority of New Mexicans, I support hunting and sportsmen's access to public lands consistent with State and Federal law and sound wildlife management practices. Fish and Wildlife's rule[[Page S1881]]doesn't affect these uses at all in any way. Fish and Wildlife's rule carries out Congress's intent in three longstanding pieces of legislation that are now law: the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, or ANILCA; the 1966 National Wildlife Administration Act; and the 1964 Wilderness Importantly, none of these laws prevents reasonable hunting. Together, those acts establish national wildlife refuges and provide for their management, and they establish the 76 million acres of national refuges in Alaska accounts for over 85 percent of our National Wildlife Refuge System, so this is not a State or parochial issue. The rule governs the vast majority of refuge lands designated for protection by  Again, none of these laws prevents reasonable hunting on national refuges. National wildlife refuges are established for the benefit of ``present and future generations of Americans'' and for the whole nation. Every American has an ownership stake in and a right to enjoy public lands and the astounding scenic, cultural, and natural qualities that make these places so special.  The first listed purpose of ANILCA is to ``conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats in their natural diversity.'' The words ``natural diversity'' are important to this discussion. My uncle, Congressman Mo Udall, was the floor manager for the House when ANILCA passed in 1980. On the House floor, he said the term natural diversity meant ``protecting and managing all fish and wildlife populations within a particular wildlife refuge system unit in the natural `mix,' not to emphasize management activities favoring one species to the detriment of another.''  He also said that in managing for natural diversity, Congress's intent was to ``direct the U.Fish and Wildlife Service to the best of its ability . . . to manage wildlife refuges to assure that habitat diversity is maintained through natural means, avoiding artificial developments and habitat manipulation programs; to assure that wildlife refuge management fully considers the fact that humans reside permanently within the boundaries of some areas and are dependent . . . on wildlife refuge subsistence resources; and to allow management flexibility in developing new and innovative management programs different from the lower 48 standards, but in the context of maintaining natural diversity of fish and wildlife populations and their dependent habitats for the long-term benefit of all citizens.''  Fish and Wildlife's rule carries out congressional intent by managing the national refuges in Alaska for natural diversity through natural, not artificial means, by continuing to allow for subsistence hunting, and by managing the law for the benefit of all--exactly what Representative Mo Udall said the act was intended to accomplish.  Maintaining natural diversity means promoting the health of all fish, wildlife, and plants in the ecosystem, not favoring certain species and harming others, and not interfering with natural ecosystems. Protecting bears and wolves and other apex predators is essential. It helps maintain predator-prey relationships and the health of Alaska's Arctic and sub-Arctic ecosystems.  Federal and State laws overlay management of public lands, including national wildlife refuges. State law on fish and wildlife management applies on national refuge land as long as it is consistent with Federal law. The Fish and Wildlife Service in the State of Alaska worked together for years to manage fish and wildlife on Alaskan refuges, and Federal requirements ensured that hunting was balanced with conservation of wildlife and their habitat.  Alaska law did not conflict with Federal law until an Alaskan administrative agency, the Alaska Board of Game, adopted rules allowing for extreme hunting practices on national wildlife refuges within Alaska's borders. The Board of Game said it targeted reduction of wolf, black bear, and brown bear to increase the moose, caribou, and deer populations for harvesting. But the indiscriminate killing of bears and wolves to provide more game hunting is contrary to That law directs the preservation of the ``natural diversity'' or ``natural mix'' of wildlife. The Board of Game regulation allowing extreme hunting practices is not consistent with the law.  As I said earlier, while the Fish and Wildlife's rule does not allow extreme hunting practices, it does not change the rules for subsistence hunting or sports hunting. It even authorizes a process for predator control to benefit prey species and to meet refuge purposes. The process is based on sound science, an evaluation of alternatives, and an assessment of impacts to subsistence uses and needs. Again, Alaskans don't support overturning the Service's rule to allow indiscriminate killing of apex predators. A February 2016 Remington poll found that Alaska voters oppose the extreme hunting practices banned under the Fish and Wildlife's rule by wide margins. Alaska voters don't want to see unsporting and cruel practices used to kill bears, wolves, and coyotes on National Wildlife Refuges in their  Wildlife watching is an important part of Alaska's economy. Each year, thousands of tourists visit Alaska's national wildlife refuges to see iconic wildlife. According to a Fish and Wildlife report, wildlife watching on the National Wildlife Refuge System contributed over $2 billion to Alaska's economy in 2011. That same year, hunting contributed approximately $425 million.  Congress's repeated use of the Congressional Review Act with no public hearing, no record or evidence, no use of science, and no stakeholder involvement is a bad way to legislate. It makes government opaque and inaccessible, and what people want to see is transparency and openness, which we didn't have here. It caters to special interests behind the scenes and outside of public view. It makes the swamp murkier than ever.  Fish and Wildlife's rule carries out what Congress wanted when it established the wildlife refuges--to conserve our wild American land and wildlife for generations to come. The rule prohibits the most extreme of hunting practices--against grizzlies and black bears and their cubs and against wolves and coyotes and their pups--and protects the natural diversity. We should not rush to undermine this important, national, long-term goal for short-term political gain--to benefit select special interests.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Regardless of the chatter that I believe simply confuses what we want to do in good government, this bill, H.1004, is a good government transparency bill that is simple in nature and seeks to preserve the integrity of the regulatory process; specifically, the public comment period.  Whether it is EPA or the Department of Labor or any other agencies or departments, they have their purpose, but they have to follow the law. The public comment period is an essential part of upholding our democratic values because it ensures that Americans will have their voices heard in the Federal Government's regulatory process.  Agencies must take the comment period seriously. Unfortunately, we have seen instances where agencies seem to believe that the regulatory process is simply a perfunctory act that the agency must undertake in order to reach a prearranged outcome.  This became abundantly clear during the EPA's Waters of the U.S., or WOTUS, rulemaking process.

National Association of                                                Home Builders,                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2017.     Timothy Walberg,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Walberg: On behalf of the 140,000      members of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB),      I am writing to express NAHB's strong support for H.1004,      the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017. This legislation would      force agencies to follow an open and transparent federal      regulatory rulemaking process by making all aspects of a      rulemaking publicly available and preventing federal agencies      from illegally influencing the public in order to generate      support for a rulemaking.       Federal agencies are prohibited, by law, from engaging in      lobbying, grassroots, and propaganda activities designed to      advance a policy agenda. However, in recent rulemakings, the      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has ignored these      restrictions and used social media platforms to perpetuate      propaganda campaigns that advance their rulemakings. These      actions only support the notion that the agency is not      interested in a transparent and fair rulemaking process.       An excellent example of this is when the EPA created a      social media campaign on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to      counter opposition to its ``Waters of the US'' rulemaking.      The agency concealed the fact that its social media messages      were coming from within the EPA and deceptively engaged in      lobbying efforts designed to kill legislation that was not      favorable to their proposed rulemaking. In December 2015, the      Government Accountability Office released a report outlining      how the EPA participated in covert propaganda and grassroots      lobbying and condemned the agency for violating federal law.      Federal agencies must respect and uphold the law, and the      passage of H.1004 will help to ensure that federal      agencies are not lobbying against America's small businesses.       For these reasons, NAHB urges the House Oversight and      Government Reform Committee to support H.1004, the      Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, in order to bring      transparency and neutrality to the regulatory process.       Thank you for giving consideration to our views.           Sincerely,     James Tobin                                  ____                                         Michigan Farm Bureau,                             Lansing, Michigan, February 13, 2017.     Jason Chaffetz,     Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House          of Representatives, Washington,     Elijah Cummings,     Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,          House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings:      Michigan Farm Bureau strongly supports the Regulatory      Integrity Act of 2017. The bill is a step in the right      direction to hold government agencies accountable and for      citizens to maintain trust in the government that serves      them. Introduced by Tim Walberg, the bill is scheduled      to come before the House Oversight and Government Reform      Committee later this week.       Last year, we heard about an EPA grant being used to fund      whatsupstream.com in the state of This initiative      used the following billboard message: ``Unregulated      agriculture is putting our waterways at risk'' to urge the      public to contact state elected officials. In a similar      campaign, GAO issued a legal opinion that EPA violated      federal lobbying laws by funding advocacy efforts on the      Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. Michigan farmers      are frustrated when they read about federal agencies trying      to sway the public in a way that promotes their own proposed      rule before all stakeholders have had a chance to weigh in      the rule's merits. These examples only undermine the trust      our members place in the agencies meant to serve and protect      our citizens.       We believe it is critical that Congress pass the Regulatory      Integrity Act of 2017. We urge all members of the Committee      to support this bill.           Sincerely,                                                        John Kran,                           Associate National Legislative  ",CREC-2017-03-02-pt1-PgH1469-2.txt,1855,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF,2017.0,2.0,January
12089,topic-id,230,"The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office concluded the EPA overstepped and issued a report saying the EPA violated the law and undertook ``covert propaganda'' and grassroots lobbying during the process.  My bill simply seeks to preserve the spirit and purpose of the regulatory process by simply telling agencies that they need to keep to the facts and not solicit support when they ought to be soliciting constructive comments.  H.1004 simply requires an agency to; one, identify itself as the source of information; two, clearly state whether the agency is accepting public comments or considering alternatives; and, three, and most importantly, speak about the regulations in a neutral, unbiased tone.  People need to have the confidence that the Federal agencies, regardless of whether it is a Republican or Democrat administration, are open to their insights an constructive criticism.  H.1004 will restore the integrity to our regulatory process by ensuring agencies are honestly asking for feedback, constructive criticism, and dialogue about how to improve upon the agency's existing thoughts, not advocating for a predetermined outcome.  Mr.Chairman, this is a bipartisan issue. This bill passed the House last Congress with bipartisan support. In fact, a similar version was offered by my colleague, Representative Peterson from Minnesota, as an amendment to H.5 earlier this year. That amendment was approved with strong bipartisan support.

11988,topic-id,3514,"Mr.Speaker, we see so much on I was watching the President's press conference a little while ago. We see so much discord out there, and this opportunity that we have in the afternoon to really delve deep into the issues is so valuable to me. It is one of the only opportunities that the American people get to see us delving deeply into the issues.  You and I know that we are in the committee room, we are behind closed doors in a bipartisan way grappling with all of the hardest issues that face American families, but folks don't see it and they don't feel it. Why it is we celebrate the discord instead of celebrating the discourse is a mystery to me.  I bring, Mr.Speaker, today some stories about the Affordable Care Act from my district at home. It is not going to be a surprise to you that these are stories of challenges.  In Cumming, Georgia--it is up in Forsyth County, Georgia, just north of[[Page H1293]]Atlanta--I heard from a single mom. She has two kids, ages 11 and 13. They have a family physician that they want to hang on to.  She says: I work part-time as a paralegal. I earn $25,000 a year, and I also receive child support payments.  She said that she was encouraged by a health insurance company to go out and enroll in Medicaid instead, but neither of her children's doctors accept  How often do we hear that?  The solution for everything is to dump everyone into Medicaid is not a healthcare system. It is a healthcare payment system. You have to find a doctor who will accept a payment. This young woman's doctors do not.  She said she went on healthcare.gov, filled out an application, and was offered a plan for $464 a month with a $12,600 deductible. She makes $25,000 a year, and what we have offered her is a $500-a-month policy, $464 a month, with a $12,000 deductible. That is not affordable, she said. She called an insurance broker and looked for a similar policy. They were priced the same way.  She said: I have decided to pay the ObamaCare fines instead.  Mr.Speaker, I tell this story because I know that every single Member of this body wants to serve the constituency that sent them here. Every single Member of this body wants to find solutions for folks back home.  As we look at the numbers across the country, we find that more Americans that we purported to help with the Affordable Care Act have decided to pay a fine instead of join the exchange system.  Mr.Speaker, we have more Americans opting out of the system than opting into the system because we have failed those very people we purported to help.  From Buford, Georgia, Mr.Speaker: I'm a full-time student with a part-time job that doesn't offer health or dental insurance. I can't get health insurance through my parents because they are on I shopped for health plans, but all of the ones on the exchange are out of my budget. I shouldn't have to pay a fine because I can't afford health care.  Now, think about that, Mr.This young student says: I shouldn't have to pay a fine because I can't afford the health care. If I can't afford the health care, I certainly can't afford the fine.  These are the people that we purported to help with the Affordable Care Act, and they are not being served.  Back in Cumming, Georgia, Mr.Speaker: Today I have been in my office for hours trying to find affordable health care that accommodates my primary care physician. Prices start for me at $750-plus. Before ObamaCare, I was paying $365 with more access to doctors.  It is not just about the money, Mr.These networks, as you know, are closing. More than one-third of the counties in America have no choice of insurance whatsoever. The networks are narrowing. Folks are not just finding it hard to pay for care, but they are finding it hard to choose their physician.  A retired couple in Peachtree Corners, Mr.Speaker: I retired last year, and my husband retired this year. Both of us are in our sixties. We knew we would have to pay a lot for health insurance, but I was stunned when we signed up for the Affordable Care Act to the tune of more than $1,200 per month. I recently received a notice from our insurer that premiums for 2017 will go to over $2,000 per month.  This family played by the rules their entire life, Mr.They retired, needed access to health care, and went to the exchanges that were purported to help people find affordable health care. They found a $1,200-a-month policy that this year rises to $2,000 a month.  I say this to the young people planning for their retirement and thinking about putting something away for a rainy day: This couple pays $2,000 a month simply for their premium.  Another family in Cumming, Georgia, Mr.Speaker: Six years ago, we had a perfectly acceptable high-deductible plan with an HSA for $300 a month. As ObamaCare has been implemented, it has gone from $300 to $450 to $950 per month, and our only remaining option is a $1,450-per-month plan that provides effectively the same coverage.  Mr.Speaker, I added that one because these folks weren't looking for help. These folks weren't uninsured. These folks didn't have a problem finding insurance. They had it under control themselves. In the name of helping the uninsured, the Affordable Care Act came in, re-regulated the entire insurance industry, even for people who already had health care, and drove this family's premiums from $300 a month to $1,400 a month.  Mr.Speaker, who defends these things? Who defends these things?  I tell you, I will not have a colleague from the Democratic side or the Republican side who would say that any of these consequences were intended when the Affordable Care Act was passed. They might have been inevitable, but they were not intended.  So we can agree there is a problem. We can agree there is a problem. And if you don't think that we can agree, let me refer first to former President Barack Just last fall, he said this: Despite this progress, too many Americans still strain to pay for their physician visits and prescriptions, cover their deductibles or pay their monthly insurance bills. They struggle to navigate a complex, sometimes bewildering system, and they remain uninsured.  That's right. They remain uninsured. The trillion-plus dollars that we spent to solve the issue of the uninsured solved nothing. We continue to have a problem with the uninsured, yet we have added problems to those who are insured.  Democratic Governor Mark Dayton from Minnesota in October of last year, Mr.Speaker: The reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.  The reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable--these are words of folks who supported the Affordable Care  Former President Bill Clinton: ``So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled with their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world.''  There is a group of people, mostly small-business owners and employees, who make just a little too much to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can't get Affordable Care Act premiums in a lot of places.  Former President Bill Clinton says that there are guys out there busting 60 hours a week trying to make it work for their families, and we have failed them.  It is not that they had a problem to begin with. Many of these folks had insurance that they liked to begin with. We failed them when we re-regulated them into problems instead of solving problems.  Mr.Speaker, the broken promises began right away. You will remember the fact check organization that named ``If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan'' as the Lie of the  Overpromising and underdelivering has been the nature of We were promised premiums would decline by $2,500. The average family premium has increased by $4,300. We were promised the cost of health care would go down, but deductibles have risen more than 60 percent. We were promised you can keep your doctor, but 70 percent of us find ourselves in narrower networks today than we did before. Middle class Americans were promised we wouldn't see a tax increase, but as we just heard from this young student, when you can't find a plan that meets your needs, then you are fined by the You are paying taxes right then.  Now, Mr.Speaker, I am not blaming these systemic problems on President I am not blaming these systemic problems on the Affordable Care What I am doing is pointing out that we passed the Affordable Care Act with $1 trillion in new tax increases and with a re-regulation of all of the insurance plans that people liked before in the name of solving these problems, which we did not solve.  I will take you to my home State of Georgia, Mr.On average, 32 percent is the increase that we are seeing in premiums on our exchange--32 percent this year alone. Of the folks[[Page H1294]]who are participating in the exchange, Mr.Speaker, 80 percent of them receive a government subsidy.  Let me say that again: Of the folks who participate in the $1 trillion Affordable Care Act exchange program in the State of Georgia, 80 percent of them do so because the government is paying for their health care. That is a pretty good incentive to get in the system. If you're going to get a subsidy payment, folks are in the system. Eighty percent require that subsidy in order to be enticed into the system.  As you know, Mr.Speaker, more people rejected going into the system opting instead for no health care than went into the system with the Affordable Care  The average wage earner in Georgia, Mr.Speaker, gets no subsidy from the government. Four hundred percent of the poverty line, as you know, is where that subsidy kicks in. That is about $48,000 a year in the State of I am telling you, if you earn $48,000 a year, you have bills, obligations, and responsibilities, and you find yourself in one of these $2,000-a-month premium situations that this retired couple in Georgia did, you cannot afford health insurance--or at least you cannot afford the health insurance that the government today is requiring that you have.  Let's think about those requirements, Mr.The government, in its wisdom, decided it was going to force folks into plans that it deemed appropriate. Many of those came in the form of healthcare CO-It was certainly a reasonable idea: let's allow folks in States back home to join together and provide health insurance.  We sucked folks into those CO-OPs, Mr.Again, an unsustainable system, this death spiral of One million folks were sucked into CO-OPs that went belly up, Mr.They lost their insurance once when ObamaCare came into business, and they lost their insurance again when these CO-OPs failed.  As you can see on this map, the orange CO-OPs have failed. Only a few remain in business today. It remains to be seen if they will make it through the year.  When we talk about choice, Mr.Speaker, five States have only one insurer in the exchange. That was the whole point of the exchange. That is why we spent literally billions upon billions to set up these exchanges so that consumers could compare and choose.  Now, two things went wrong. Number one, we set up this list of mandates that every insurance plan had to comply with, which disincentivized folks to join those plans to begin with. Then, number two, by setting up what you had to have in a plan, you, by definition, restricted the choice of individuals to choose what they want. So you end up with five States with only one insurer under  Now, that is before the announcement this week from Humana that it is withdrawing from all of the ObamaCare plans at the end of 2017. That was before the announcement this week from the Aetna CEO that he sees the death spiral that ObamaCare is involved in--his words--and it remains to be seen whether they will participate next year or not.  I don't need to find consensus among 218 Members or even 435 Members about whether or not ObamaCare is succeeding or failing.                              {time}  1745  What I need is for folks to look at the 19 million uninsured Americans who had an opportunity to go into this trillion-dollar system; an opportunity to reach for the golden ring, as it was described by its authors and its proponents, and they said: They said: It doesn't work for me. They said: It is not the right thing for me. They said: It doesn't fit into my families' needs and desires and expectations.  Of these 19 million, Mr.Speaker, 6.5 million paid a tax penalty. That is 6.5 million Americans failed by their government in a trillion-dollar healthcare regulation, failed by their government in an expansion through ObamaCare and Medicaid, and failed by their government yet again when they received a bill because the trillion-dollar program we put together didn't work for them and their families.  Can't we agree that if our goal was to solve the problem of the uninsured American, having 19 million Americans who would rather stay uninsured than participate in the Affordable Care Act is the definition of failure?  We can do better. There is a better way, Mr.Speaker, let there be no mistake about that.  I know there is a lot of anxiety out there. I don't want to minimize that. Fear is a corrosive emotion to have. I want to do my very best to allay the fear of anyone in America, Mr.Speaker, who is benefiting from the Affordable Care As these numbers have demonstrated, there are not many. But if you spend a trillion dollars and re-regulate an entire industry, I certainly hope there is at least one family out there who got something out of it. I know that there are.  I quote Greg Walden, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr.Speaker, who, as you know, has wide jurisdiction for re-regulating health care. He says this in January of this year: ``We want to make sure that people with pre-existing conditions continue to get covered.''  Mr.Speaker, it is a myth that Congress didn't care about preexisting conditions. It was Republicans in Congress, led by Republican Newt Gingrich of the great State of Georgia, who abolished preexisting conditions in every federally regulated plan back in 1996. He did that in partnership with Bill  What you have heard from our chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee is that we are committed to dealing with preexisting conditions. Take that anxiety off your list.  From Tom Price, now the Secretary of Health and Human Services: ``Nobody is interested in pulling the rug out from anybody.''  We believe that it is absolutely imperative that individuals who have health care be able to keep health coverage and move, hopefully, to greater choices and opportunity for them to gain the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and their families.  There has been a lot of talk about individuals losing health care. That is not our goal, nor is it our desire, nor is it our plan. The new Secretary of Health and Human Services said that this year.  Now, Mr.Speaker, I don't want to overpromise and underdeliver. ObamaCare is failing. The exchanges are failing. Insurance companies are leaving. Plans are being canceled.  I am not saying that if you like your plan, you can keep it. Your plan may be one of the overly regulated, overly priced plans that is collapsing across this country. What I am saying to you is, our commitment is to help and not hurt in that area.  I cannot prevent ObamaCare from failing. I cannot prevent your plan from going away, but I can provide an off ramp for you and your family so that you can find, as Secretary Price says, better choices and better opportunities.  From the United States Senate, Mr.Speaker, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: ``There will be a stable transition period, and once repeal is passed we will turn to replacement policies that cost less and work better than what we have now.''  Some contend that, by fulfilling our promise to the American people, we are somehow going to go back to the way things were before ObamaCare, which we all know is untrue.  If your family grappled with preexisting conditions because your State didn't address it the same way the Federal Government did back in 1996--folks are committed, if you are playing by the rules, to stick with you and your family through this transition.  If your family benefits from the raising of the lifetime caps that was a part of the Affordable Care Act, you have won that debate. You needn't worry as we go through this transition.  If you like the fact that your kids are unemployed and staying on your policy until they are 26 years old, I think you have won that debate. I think that is absolutely going to be a part of that conversation in this transition.  If you have a fear, if you have a worry, if you have a concern, I don't want to minimize it. I want to allay it. But come and share it with your Member of Congress, share it with your United States We have a group of leaders committed to addressing those concerns.  Finally, Paul Ryan, our Speaker of the House: ``We can and should have a[[Page H1295]]system in this country where everybody can have access to affordable health care, including people with pre-existing conditions.''  There are things that unite us in this body, and one of those things is caring for people, caring about people, wanting folks to get a fair shake. If you have played by the rules, you deserve a fair shake. That brings us all together in this institution.  I don't want any family to find themselves in fear that they are being forgotten in this transition, but there is a very real fear that, if you are in an Affordable Care Act plan today, that plan will fail.  Mr.Speaker, there are two things we can do. We can pretend that failure is not imminent. You can look at all the insurers withdrawing from ObamaCare, you can look at all of the rate increases going up in double digits, you can look at all of the folks who are opting out because it has gotten too expensive and doesn't serve their families' needs.  You can see the failure of But the number of options that we have, the number of plans under discussion to replace it is numerous, Mr.We have got the Better Way healthcare plan, we have got the American Health Care Reform Act, we have got the Empowering Patients First, we have got our Rules Committee chairman's The World's Great Healthcare Plan Act, the Patient Freedom Act, the ObamaCare Replacement  Mr.Speaker, we have options. To begin to get to those options, we need to be honest with ourselves, whether we opposed ObamaCare from the beginning or whether we hoped it was going to be the best thing since sliced bread, that ObamaCare has failed.  With that recognition, we can repeal those costly mandates, we can repeal those constrictive agreements, we can repeal those things that have isolated us from choice, that have separated us from our doctors, and we can begin to restore a patient-centered, family first system.  Mr.Speaker, I have no doubt that you are a smart man. I have no doubt that you work hard from dawn to dusk every day. But no matter how hard you work, I promise you that you will not know better than the families in my district which healthcare plan is best for them, and I appreciate you not trying to second guess them.  I cannot make everybody in America happy, Mr.Speaker, but I can give everybody in America the choice to make themselves happy. I can't empower families in America to make their own choices, their own decisions about what works best for them.  Put your mind at ease. For folks who have concerns, we hear you. For folks who have been hurt, we are coming for you. And for folks who know there is a better way, we stand with you.  It is going to be a long spring and summer, Mr.Speaker, because this is only heavy lifting, but it is the right thing to do, and we have got the right group of men and women here to do it.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgH1292.txt,2008,HONORING THE LIFE OF ED MOORE,2017.0,16.0,March
11803,topic-id,510,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this dangerous effort to block the stream protection rule, a commonsense proposal that has the potential to save lives and will improve the health, outcomes, and well-being of families over time throughout coal country.  This bottle of--I guess you could call it a liquid--wasn't taken from an industrial waste site or from the runoff of a landfill. This came from the drinking well of the Urias family's home in Pike County,  Despite what it looks like, there is water in there along with chemicals, toxic minerals, and known carcinogens, all present in this family's drinking water because of mountaintop removal.  The mountaintop removal process begins with beautiful mountains that look just like this. These are Appalachian Mountains near the West Virginia-Kentucky border.  First, they raze an entire side of the mountain, tearing trees from the ground and burning down any plant growth. From there, they use explosives to blast the tops off the mountains and push rock and dirt out, ultimately filling the surrounding streams and waterways with debris, blast materials, and other dangerous elements and minerals that end up in the drinking water of the Urias family and countless others throughout coal country.  This is what is left.  As we have noted during our fight for funding to help the families of Flint, Michigan, dealing with water contamination, this should not happen here in America in the 21st century; yet families in coal country have been dealing with this for 40 years. So you can imagine how many people's health has been jeopardized by this practice.  The stream protection rule that the House is about to block would serve as one of the only safety measures that would protect these families from poisonous drinking water, higher rates of cancer, lung disease, respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, birth defects, and the countless negative health effects that plague this region.  If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to block the safeguards of the stream protection rule, they should at least consider supporting my legislation, the Appalachian Communities Health Emergency Act, or ACHE I introduced this bill earlier today with Representative Slaughter to suspend new mountaintop removal permits until the Department of Health and Human Services can conduct a comprehensive Federal study of the health effects of this reckless mining method used in my State of Kentucky and throughout coal country.  I believe mountaintop removal should be banned, but at a minimum, we should halt all new permits until the safety of the residents in the surrounding communities is assured. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose today's effort to block this potentially lifesaving rule and support the ACHE  We have failed to protect the families in these communities, and passage of this bill will inflict another blow to their health and well-being. They deserve far better.  I will make a final offer to my colleagues on the other side.
