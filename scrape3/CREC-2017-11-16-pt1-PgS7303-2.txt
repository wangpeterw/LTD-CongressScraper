SENATE RESOLUTION 336--RECOGNIZING THE SERIOUSNESS OF POLYCYSTIC OVARY 
  SYNDROME AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF THE MONTH OF 
    SEPTEMBER 2018 AS ``POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME AWARENESS MONTH''

  Ms. WARREN (for herself, Mr. Perdue, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. 
Booker, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Isakson) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions:

                              S. Res. 336

       Whereas Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (referred to in this 
     preamble as ``PCOS'') is a common health problem among women 
     and girls involving a hormonal imbalance;
       Whereas there is no universal definition of PCOS, but 
     researchers estimate that between 5,000,000 and 10,000,000 
     women in the United States are affected by PCOS;
       Whereas PCOS can affect women from the onset of puberty and 
     throughout the remainder of their lives;
       Whereas the symptoms of PCOS include infertility, irregular 
     or absent menstrual periods, acne, weight gain, thinning 
     scalp hair, excessive facial and body hair growth, numerous 
     small ovarian cysts, pelvic pain, and mental health problems;
       Whereas women with PCOS have higher rates of psychosocial 
     disorders, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, 
     and eating disorders, and are at greater risk for suicide;
       Whereas adolescents with PCOS often are not diagnosed;
       Whereas PCOS causes metabolic dysfunction and insulin 
     resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular 
     disease, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver 
     disease, and endometrial cancer at a young adult age;
       Whereas PCOS is the most common cause of female 
     infertility;
       Whereas PCOS in pregnancy is associated with increased risk 
     of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced 
     hypertension, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, 
     miscarriage, and fetal and infant death;
       Whereas women with PCOS are at increased risk of developing 
     high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, heart 
     disease--the leading cause of death among women--and have a 4 
     to 7 times higher risk of experiencing a heart attack 
     compared to women of the same age who do not have PCOS;
       Whereas women with PCOS have a more than 50 percent chance 
     of developing type 2 diabetes or prediabetes before the age 
     of 40;
       Whereas women with PCOS may be at a higher risk for breast 
     cancer and ovarian cancer, and have a 3 times higher risk for 
     developing endometrial cancer, compared to women who do not 
     have PCOS;
       Whereas up to 80 percent of women in the United States with 
     PCOS are overweight or have obesity;
       Whereas an estimated 50 percent of women with PCOS are 
     undiagnosed, and many remain undiagnosed until they 
     experience fertility difficulties or develop type 2 diabetes 
     or other cardiometabolic disorders;
       Whereas the costs involved with the diagnosis and 
     management of PCOS to the healthcare system of the United 
     States is over $4,300,000,000 per year during the 
     reproductive years of patients;
       Whereas that amount does not include the costs associated 
     with the treatment of comorbidities, including high blood 
     pressure, sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 
     cardiovascular disease, obesity, and cancer;
       Whereas the cause of PCOS is unknown, but researchers have 
     found strong links to significant insulin resistance, which 
     affects up to 70 percent of women with PCOS, and genetic 
     predisposition; and
       Whereas there is no known cure for PCOS: Now, therefore, be 
     it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) recognizes the seriousness of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome 
     (referred to in this resolving clause as ``PCOS'');
       (2) supports the goals of PCOS Awareness Month--
       (A) to increase awareness of, and education about, PCOS 
     among the general public, women, girls, and healthcare 
     professionals;
       (B) to improve diagnosis and treatment of PCOS;
       (C) to disseminate information on diagnosis and treatment 
     options for PCOS; and
       (D) to improve the quality of life and outcomes for women 
     and girls with PCOS;
       (3) recognizes the need for further research, improved 
     treatment and care options, and a cure for PCOS;
       (4) acknowledges the struggles affecting all women and 
     girls residing within the United States who are afflicted 
     with PCOS;
       (5) urges medical researchers and healthcare professionals 
     to advance their understanding of PCOS in order to research, 
     diagnose, and provide assistance to women and girls with 
     PCOS; and
       (6) encourages States, territories, and localities to 
     support the goals of PCOS Awareness Month.
