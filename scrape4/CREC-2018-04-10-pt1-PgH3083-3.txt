 CONGRATULATING HILLSIDE FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE ALL-STAR BASKETBALL TEAM

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Hillside 
fifth and sixth grade all-star basketball team for winning their 
championship game in overtime to become the 2018 Jersey Basketball 
Association Gold Division champions.
  This was the first year that Hillside had a fifth and sixth grade 
team at all. In fact, some of the players on this talented team had 
never even touched a basketball before signing up this year. Their raw 
talent, positive attitude, willingness to learn, and parental support 
helped drive the players toward victory.
  Under Coach Nikko Velez and his father, Coach Nick Velez, the team 
achieved a 13-1 regular season record and a 4-0 postseason record. The 
only team that they lost to in the regular season was the team they 
beat in the championship game.
  I ask my colleagues to join me to congratulate the Hillside fifth and 
sixth grade all-star team for its winning season.
