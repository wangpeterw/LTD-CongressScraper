                          SAVE NET NEUTRALITY

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last week the FCC 
abdicated its responsibility to serve the public interest and put at 
risk the free and open internet that we have all come to depend on when 
its three Republican commissioners voted to repeal the Obama-era net 
neutrality protection.
  Net neutrality keeps access to the internet equal for everyone. It 
protects free speech. It protects equal access to the marketplace of 
ideas. It has been the fundamental principle underpinning the massive 
innovation and opportunity that the internet has unleashed. But that is 
all at risk now.
  Fortunately, Congress has a say. I am proud to support Congressman 
Mike Doyle's resolution to overturn the FCC's decision and restore our 
net neutrality protections. I also believe the House Oversight and 
Government Reform Committee should investigate the reports and 
allegations of fraudulent public comments.
  Repealing net neutrality will inhibit innovation, stifle competition, 
and threaten free speech. It is time for Congress to overturn this 
decision.
