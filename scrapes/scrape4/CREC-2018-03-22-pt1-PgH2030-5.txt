                 HONORING THE LIFE OF JESSICA KLYMCHUK

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Jessica 
Klymchuk.
  Jessica was the mother of three daughters and one son. She was an 
educational assistant, bus driver, and librarian at St. Stephen's 
School in Valleyview, Alberta, Canada, for 4 years.
  She went to the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1 with her 
fiance, Brent. The couple had recently been engaged and looked forward 
to their wedding.
  Jessica always put her family first and loved camping with them. She 
is remembered for being a loving woman who always worked hard and 
dedicated her life to her children.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Jessica's family and 
friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, 
and the whole country grieve with you.
