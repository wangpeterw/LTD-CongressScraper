                         TRIBUTE TO NELL PAYNE

 Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I wish to commend Nell Payne for 
her distinguished career in public service.
  For the past 16 years, she has served as the director of government 
relations for the Smithsonian Institution, where she has been a 
tireless advocate for the Smithsonian. She has worked to advance the 
institution's mission of promoting the increase and diffusion of 
knowledge.
  Her professionalism, expertise, and integrity have helped the 
Smithsonian improve on its reputation as the premier museum system in 
the world. Her leadership and vision have directly benefited the 
millions of Americans and international travelers who enjoy Smithsonian 
exhibits and programs each year.
  She also served our country in the U.S. Senate on the staff of the 
Budget Committee and in the White House as a special assistant to the 
President.
  I congratulate Nell Payne on her retirement and thank her for the 
important contributions she has made to the Smithsonian Institution and 
throughout her professional career.

                          ____________________
