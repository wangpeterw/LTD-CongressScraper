                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, we thank You for giving us another day.
  Send Your spirit upon the Members of this people's House to encourage 
them in their official tasks.
  Assure them that in the fulfillment of their responsibilities, You 
provide the grace to enable them to be faithful in their duties, and 
the wisdom to be conscious of their obligations to fulfill them with 
integrity.
  As the Congress looks to the upcoming holy celebrations of millions 
of Americans, may they, and may we all, be mindful of Your love for us. 
May we be faithful stewards not only of Your creation, but also Your 
desire that all people would be free from whatever inhibits them to be 
fully alive.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
