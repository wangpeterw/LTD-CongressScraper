The 435 of us represent 320 million With a population that large and that diverse, we are going to have our differences. We are going to disagree which direction the Nation needs to go. With a free and open democracy, we all have that right. Vigorous discussion makes us stronger.  However, despite our differences, we are all still Americans, we want what is best for our country, and we must keep our debates respectful. We are all Americans first before we are Republicans, Democrats, Independents; and we can't forget this.  As Americans, we do have major issues facing us; and the world is looking to us to be leaders and find solutions. We must remain civil to each other to achieve this goal. Let's not forget that ISIS will never ask if we are Republicans or The unemployment line doesn't ask if we are Republicans or Democrats either. The Federal deficit doesn't care if we are Republicans or These are shared issues, and we are all in this together.  Politics is a contact sport, or so I am told.

5052,topic-id,270,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman Mike Johnson from Louisiana, for helping coordinate this effort.  When I got here to Washington for orientation, I will never forget very early on, one of my colleagues, Congressman Jodey Arrington from Texas, came up to me and said: I want to introduce myself. And he did.  He was the first Republican that came up to me and said: I want to get to know you on a personal level. I want to be your friend because we are going to be working together.  I have to tell you how impressed I was that somebody was reaching out across the aisle because they wanted to develop a personal relationship, knowing that we would be able to work together.  Later on, I got to meet the rest of my colleagues at Harvard, where they have a bipartisan program that is a wonderful program and gives you an opportunity to help build these relationships, which I think is so important, especially today in our time.  We just got off one of the ugliest elections in history where it really felt as if civility disappeared. Today it[[Page H1163]]sometimes still feels that way, which is why I think this is such an important effort.  As Members of Congress, we need to set an example of statesmanship for younger generations of Americans to follow. We must remember that every person should be respected.

5053,topic-id,249,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the freshman class's commitment to civility.  Before the Revolutionary War, a 16-year-old George Washington copied 110 rules for civil behavior out of his school book. The last of Washington's rules of civility, as they are now called, is this: ``Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.''  Conscience: That should be our guide in everything we do, both here in Congress and back home--for me, in Michigan's First Conscience is why, as a Member of the freshman class of the 115th Congress, I have made a commitment to open and civil debate.  We are facing many challenges in our country. And the folks here and back in Michigan, all across the land, on both sides of the aisle, have many different ideas about where we need to be and what we need to do to get there. That is democracy at work.  Being civil means that the best and most effective ideas have a real chance to be heard. If we truly desire to move forward as a country, we have to do it together. We must treat each other with dignity and respect. We must be civil.  This freshman class has dedicated itself across party lines to setting the example for ourselves and for our colleagues here in Congress and for all of our constituents.  Mr.Speaker, I will uphold these standards, and I trust that my colleagues will also do the same.

4916,topic-id,2319,"Mr.President, I am honored to follow my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island who has been such a champion for working people and economic progress in manufacturing and economic fairness so that our country as a whole can advance together.  I am proud to be a Senator who fights to preserve, protect, and strengthen the safety net for all Americans, as my colleague from Rhode Island does, and many of us here do. So I come to the floor to speak on Congressman Mick Mulvaney, with reluctance and sadness, because he is out of the mainstream and, really, an adversary of programs that assure that safety net and basic fairness that is at the core of our great democracy and our economic system.  I oppose his nomination to serve as Director of the Office of Management and Budget, hardly the best known of agencies and not necessarily the most glamorous or glitzy but among the most important. His position is among the most consequential because he serves as an economic adviser, as well as an allocator of funding throughout the Federal Government and a leader on important social programs.  He has proved strongly antithetical to those programs that have made America great: Medicare, Social Security, and other efforts, including the Affordable Care Act, which are essential to our future.  He has broad responsibilities for our Nation's budget. He also has important oversight responsibilities about Federal rulemaking--those unglamorous, sometimes invisible regulations and rules that affect real lives and livelihoods throughout this country. They establish rules of the road in industry. They establish access for people to Federal programs. They provide an essential means of achieving fairness in our democracy--that important process that agencies use to enact safeguards, for example, that keep our air and water clean and our workplaces safe.  Congressman Mulvaney's positions on these vital issues are out of step with American values, out of the mainstream of American popular opinion, and out of the area of acceptability in terms of basic public interest.  Our economic reality is characterized by one simple stark economic fact: Burdens are falling hardest on the people who can least afford them. I am not talking about people at the lowest rungs of income or wealth but middle-class Americans who work hard and who have seen their incomes stagnant over 5 years, 10 years, 20 years. Stagnating incomes and stagnating futures destroy the American dream.  So the Federal Reserve, for example, has reported in 2014 that average incomes have remained flat or fallen for all but the most affluent 10 percent of American families. That is a staggering fact about our economic system and its ability to deliver for Americans generally. That is the context for this nomination. I consistently hear from my constituents in Connecticut that income has failed to keep pace with overall economic recovery. Even as Wall Street has risen, Americans see nothing but stagnant income, sometimes falling economic prospects. Things have gotten better, but good jobs are still out of reach for far too many.  Retirement for increasing numbers of baby boomers makes it all the more vital that we protect and strengthen our safety net. The safety net is not the sole answer to larger challenges that must be solved by robust economic growth. That has to be our priority--economic growth in Connecticut and around the country. But increased opportunity depends on growth for ourselves and for our children--my wife and my four children and our way of life.  In fact, President Trump himself seemed to recognize this economic fact, one of the few areas where we agree, because he pledged during the campaign to keep our Nation's safety net firmly, irrevocably intact--not to make any cuts to Social Security or He pledged and promised.  Now, who is his nominee to be head of the OMB, that crucial agency with responsibility for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid? Mick Mulvaney has an affinity for draconian budget cuts and far-right positions that are completely out of step with this promise and pledge.  The President must have reversed himself or revoked his promise, because Congressman Mulvaney has spent his entire political career crusading against exactly these programs that keep millions of Americans out of poverty. Social Security is one of the great achievements of our American democracy. In fact, it is one of the greatest achievements the world has known because it has allowed this Nation to promise its people that they can avoid crushing poverty if they simply work hard and if they contribute to this program that is a form of insurance.  It is not a gift. It is not really an entitlement. It is an insurance program. It makes us a humane and decent nation. We care for people who have worked hard all of their lives and need to be protected so they need not depend on their children or their grandchildren.  Congressman Mulvaney has called Social Security a ``Ponzi scheme.'' Tell that to the Social Security recipients[[Page S1178]]in Tell that to the working people of He is out of step with working people and middle-class people who know that Social Security does not contribute to the Federal budget deficit, and it is not the Ponzi scheme that Congressman Mulvaney mischaracterizes it as being.  It is fashionable on the far right to use that characterization, suggesting it will run out of money unless severe restrictions are put in place. He has championed those kinds of restrictions--means testing, for example, and raising the retirement age. Those proposals are a disservice to hard-working Americans who reach that retirement age having been promised that they would receive Social Security when they did or work hard to make Social Security work for them, without a means test, without anybody asking them to fill out forms or disclose their incomes and establish standards or tests that make them ineligible.  It is true that there are changes to these programs that may be necessary. In fact, I proposed a plan for enhancing Social Security, making it a stronger insurance program by raising the cap on the payment of taxes that are due and other kinds of reforms that will more properly allocate the burdens but not means-testing, not raising the retirement age, which are radical and draconian favorites of the far right. Lifting the payroll tax cap so the wealthiest Americans contribute their fair share, as I have proposed, will keep this program solvent for decades into the future.  The only reason to reject the commonsense changes I have proposed is a political aversion to raising taxes on anyone at any time, even the wealthiest individuals or the most powerful and profitable companies, which is the mantra of people who have climbed the ladder and want to raise it so that no one else has access to those top rungs. It makes no sense to me that we would ask great sacrifices of our senior citizens but do nothing about eliminating the loopholes that privilege some of the most affluent people and the largest and most profitable companies in the world.  We should not and must not use the Social Security trust fund as a means to pay down the debt or reduce the deficit or gamble with the hard-earned benefits 61 million Americans rely on during their retirement. Those 61 million Americans, who come from all of the States and all over the Nation, are represented in this Chamber, and they deserve better than Mick Mulvaney's far-right radical ideas that would restrict their Social He fails to recognize this reality and would prevent Social Security from continuing to flourish and provide the stability so essential to this great Nation--already the greatest Nation in the history of the world because of programs like Social Security and  Speaking of Medicare, Congressman Mulvaney's proposal for Medicare also betrays the President's promise to leave Medicare intact. He has been vocal, absolutely frank about his support for tearing down Medicare, going as far as to say: ``We have to end Medicare as we know it.'' Do we really have to end Medicare as we know it, tear it down, destroy it? That is what Mick Mulvaney says. That betrays President Trump's promise to keep Medicare intact.  Mick Mulvaney has also supported proposals to privatize this lifesaving healthcare program by turning it into a voucher system, which would effectively gut its promise of guaranteed health benefits. A ``voucherized'' Medicare would be devastating for our Nation's seniors. Many of them are already on fixed incomes. This plan would allot them a fixed amount of funds--fixed funds to purchase all of their health insurance, which would result in higher premiums and increased out-of-pocket costs. Connecticut seniors deserve better than Mick Mulvaney's efforts to restrict Medicare in such a disruptive and destructive way.  Congressman Mulvaney's actions and statements on Medicare point to a future budget director who has no intention of keeping the President's promise to protect this crucial health program. This country counts on its next budget director to prioritize facts and responsibilities and the public interest above political games; to rely on real facts, not alternate facts.  Our budget, our deficit, our national debt are, in fact, fact-bound and fact-based. The world relies on real facts when it looks at the American economy, and the people who work in that economy, whether they are young or old, veterans or civilians, depend on real economic growth. Yet Congressman Mulvaney's reckless approach to fiscal issues has jeopardized this country's stability, causing real danger for the sake of ideology. That approach in the Congress has led to uncertainty and unpredictability, which are the bane of small- and medium-size businesses, which are, in turn, the major job creators in our society and economy.  Congressman Mulvaney's extreme views already have negatively impacted the American economy. While in the House of Representatives, he led efforts to leverage the threat of a government shutdown as a tactic to push for specific demands, which included radical anti-choice policies, measures antithetical to women's healthcare and the right of privacy, including defunding Planned  As one of the most senior economic advisers to the President and the head of OMB, he would have immense responsibility to influence this administration and the His outright disregard for the harm caused by a government shutdown--a tactic that jolts and jeopardizes our economy and disrupts the lives of millions of Americans--should itself alone disqualify him from this critical role within the Federal  He also sought government shutdowns as well to block the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which has helped so many people in Connecticut receive the coverage and care they need. I could spend a lot of time talking about the benefits people in Connecticut have received from the Affordable Care Its future is key to the financial future of this country, but Mick Mulvaney has consistently advanced misconceptions and mistruths about the nature and functioning of this law.  Again, we can agree to disagree on policy, but misrepresenting the truth and relying on alternate facts is exactly what the budget director should not be doing. He is the one whom we rely on for real facts about our economy and our budget.  Even more worrying was Congressman Mulvaney's archaic approach to addressing the debt ceiling. In the face of all evidence, he flatly stated that he did not believe this country would default on its debt as a result of the failure to raise the debt ceiling. Economics 101: The debt ceiling, if it is not extended--that means a default.  Experts across the political spectrum agree that a breach of the debt ceiling, and consequently our Nation's full faith and credit, would be catastrophic. I am absolutely unable to vote for someone who fails to recognize that basic economic truth and takes this threat so lightly.  Finally, Congressman Mulvaney has demonstrated a near reflexive hostility to Federal agencies and the important work they do. As with so many of the President's nominees, unfortunately, he seems to be hostile to the very mission and purpose of the agency he is going to lead--whether it is the EPA or the Department of Labor or other agencies where nominees have taken stands that, in effect, say: Let's dismantle and destroy this agency. Yet they are the ones who are supposed to be leading and inspiring its efforts.  I believe that government could be more efficient and responsive. Waste ought to be eliminated. Fraud ought to be prosecuted. I am eager to work with my colleagues on good-faith proposals to achieve these goals.  Federal agencies remain vital to important public purposes that people cannot achieve on their own. They cannot clean our air and water on their own. They cannot ensure public safety through policing on their own. They cannot make sure our national defense is strong on their own. A whole myriad of functions depend on a functional Federal Commonsense rules that prohibit excessive pollution or unsafe working conditions protect all of us.  As the head of OMB, which includes offices that oversee Federal funding, he has a responsibility to make sure that rules are enforced and that people are protected. Yet he has opposed the existence of the Export-Import Bank, an[[Page S1179]]institution that is critically important to so many of our job creators, big and small businesses in Connecticut and around the country.  He opposed emergency funding for the victims of Hurricane Sandy, despite the devastation caused by this terrible storm, which was unleashed in Connecticut and nearby  He has questioned the need for government-funded research, despite the myriad advances in science and medicine that have come from government laboratories and research institutions.  His record shows that he would be the wrong person for this job, harming our safety net and our fiscal stability. I oppose his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the remainder of my postcloture debate time to Senator  The PRESIDING The Senator has that right.

4923,topic-id,1922,"Mr.President, every day we continue to set new records for how long it takes for the new President to get his Cabinet in power--in office--and the responsibility to carry out the things that the President said that he wanted to do when he was elected.  In the great history of confirming people, from the Garfield administration in the 1880s until Franklin Roosevelt in 1932, the entire Cabinet in that whole period of time was confirmed on the first day. Now we are in the longest period in the history of the country since George Washington was President to try to get a Cabinet in place, not to mention all of the other jobs that go along with confirming the It is a good thing and no wonder that a few years ago the Senate looked at the numbers of people we had taken responsibility to confirm and said: Now, which of those do we really have to confirm and which of those would we only confirm if someone in the Senate believes we have to have a hearing on that level of person and that agency at that time?  We tried to streamline a process that we all know needs to be streamlined, but with only a couple of exceptions, every nominee so far has been the most dangerous nominee of all time for whatever job it is. There must be fill-in-the-blank speeches back there somewhere that go from one to the next: This would be the worst person who could ever possibly hold this job.  In the case of Congressman Mulvaney, it appears to be because he wants to try to do things that allow our entitlement programs to survive; he wants to do things that allow the deficit at some point to be eliminated. And no matter what point that is, that point would be too early for some of our friends on the other side.  Interestingly, as we talk about the Affordable Care Act, which has turned out to be very unaffordable for almost any family on the individual market and many families who had insurance that worked for them before--the Affordable Care Act cut Medicare in the plan by $500 billion over 10 years. We hear speaker after speaker on the other side say: We would never do anything to cut I argued vigorously against those cuts when they occurred.  As we move forward, I think we ought to be very thoughtful that we restore the cuts in areas where clearly it is not working the way people thought the Affordable Care Act would work. The person in charge of the numbers, the person in charge of the balance sheet, the person who calculates the costs should be someone with the capacity to do that. The President has decided, and the Senate, when finally allowed to vote, will determine that person is Mr.                      Nomination of Scott Pruitt  Mr.President, the other thing we hope to do this week is to get to the EPA I have a hard time imagining that anybody had more future damage lined up for the economy than the past Administrator of the Rules like the clean power rule--all these rules almost always have a good name. Clean power, who wouldn't be for that? I am certainly for clean power, but the clean power rule, in virtually every State in the country, would have increased utility rates from the middle of the State of Pennsylvania to the western edge of at least Wyoming, if not beyond that.  Fifty percent of the power produced by coal-powered utility plants, most of which are cleaner than any utility plants that use coal have ever been or are anywhere in the world today, many of which are almost new, many of which aren't paid for--and, of course, who pays for that utility plant, whether you use it or not? It is the family who pays the utility bill. There is no mythical somebody else who will pay this bill. So if you shut down a plant sooner than you should, somebody has to pay for that.  You could write those same rules if your goal were to eliminate coal. That is a different debate. It is a debate we could have at another time. If your goal were to eliminate coal, you could write those same rules. If the rule simply said: When the utility plants you are using right now, which meet all the current standards, which are, in many cases, the cleanest coal-fired plants[[Page S1184]]that have ever been built or are being used anywhere in the world today--when that plant is paid for, here is what you have to do next. Then, when you get your utility bill, you are not paying for the plant you are not using and also paying for the plant you are using. This would be as if there were a new standard--this is the EPA view of this--on automobile mileage, and that standard came out and said: Here is what automobiles have to look like, in terms of standards, on miles per gallon, and, by the way, you have to have that car or that truck right now. If you have a truck or car that you are already driving that doesn't meet that standard, you can't drive it any longer. Of course, you still have to pay for it, but you can't drive it any longer. We have been doing mileage standards in this country that have made a significant difference for a long time, but we have never said: You have to stop driving the car you are driving, and you have to buy a new car. And, of course, you have to pay for the car you are driving or the bank is unlikely to give you the loan for a new car. But that is what the EPA said in the clean power rule.  There is a commonsense way to do things, and the next nominee we will be dealing with, Attorney General Pruitt, is a commonsense guy. He has had great responsibility as attorney general, but he has been willing to challenge these rules that didn't make sense.  On the clean power rule, by the way, Missouri is the fourth biggest user of coal-produced energy. Projections were that the average Missouri utility bill under that rule, if it had been allowed to go into effect--still in the courts because the courts say that EPA really doesn't have the authority to do that; at least the lower courts have all said that. If that had been allowed to go into effect, the average Missouri utility bill would have doubled in 10 or 12 years. It is not hard for a family to figure out. Get your utility bill out, look at it, multiply it by two, and see what happens to the things you were doing before you had to pay, in effect, a second utility bill.  It is time that these agencies had some common sense, whether they are agencies that are being evaluated by the Office of Management and Budget or agencies that are being tasked by the Congress and the President to do certain things. It is time they thought about families. It is time they thought about jobs.  If the economy of the country is better next year, the country will be stronger 25 years from now. I think we spend a lot of time thinking about what America should look like 25 years from now instead of what we can do so that families have better jobs next month and next year. It is time we got some common sense into trying to reach the goals we want to reach, rather than coming up with goals and then reaching them in a way that clearly will not work.  The waters of the United States--that is not a bad title. Water is important. Waters of the United States is important. The EPA talked about the waters of the United States and decided to take a definition that the Federal Government has used for well over 150 years. By the way, the EPA was given control of navigable waters in the Clean Water Act and decided that navigable waters aren't just what for 150 years the Federal Government said they were--from 1846 until just a couple of years ago, more than 150 years--which was something you could move a product on, which meant interstate commerce, which meant the Constitution gave that responsibility to the Federal government, but they said: That is actually any water that could run into any water that eventually could run into navigable waters. That is what the Clean Water Act said when it said the EPA could regulate navigable waters.  This is a Farm Bureau map that has been available for a long time but that the EPA never did challenge during this debate. Only the red part of our State would be covered by the EPA for anything involving water--things like a building permit or things like whether you can mow the right of way on the highway or things like whether farmers could use fertilizer in their field, even if it were 100 miles away from any navigable water. All of those things under the rule could have been under the authority of the Let me mention again, only the part of the map that is red would have been covered by the EPA, the part is that 99.7 percent of the map.  We have a lot of caves in our State and a few sinkholes. I think those white dots, the three-tenths of one percent, are some combination of caves and sinkholes where the water appears to run right back into the middle of the earth, instead of into any water. What a ridiculous rule. It is the kind of rule that the Office of Management and Budget should challenge whenever they are asked to look at the cost-benefit analysis. It is the kind of rule that a reasonable Administrator at the EPA would never let be issued. In fact, I would say it is the kind of rule that this Congress eventually, hopefully, will take this responsibility back and say: We have to vote on these rules. We have to take responsibility for things that cost families their extra income and cost people their jobs.  As we get along with the business of confirming Mick Mulvaney to the Office of Management and Budget--and then after that and before we leave this week--Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the Administrator of the EPA, hopefully both of them will use common sense as their guideline. Both of them will look at, What does this really mean to hard-working families? What does this mean to struggling families? What does this mean to single-mom families? What does this mean to young families who are trying to figure out how they can save for the future of their kids' college or even summer camp? A lot of things go away if you double the utility bill. A lot of things go away if it takes a year to get a building permit. A lot of things go away if we don't have common sense in our government.  I think this nominee, Mick Mulvaney, and the next nominee, Scott Pruitt, both bring that common sense to the jobs they have been asked to do and have agreed to do, if confirmed by the  I see my friend from Massachusetts is here.

4893,topic-id,259,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.37.  President Obama's Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule reinforces employment protections and laws that help veterans, individuals with disabilities, older Americans, minorities, and LGBTQ workers. It protects workers in our country so they receive a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  This rule was passed in response to discovering that billions of taxpayer dollars went to companies that violated Federal workplace laws. A contractor who cheats workers out of their pay, endangers their safety at work, or engages in discriminatory practices should be required at least to disclose this information when bidding for Federal contracts. Taxpayer dollars should not support the exploitation of workers. That is just common sense.  The resolution before us would also remove critical protections for workers that allow them to access our judicial system. The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule bans forced arbitration in workplace discrimination and sexual assault cases for contracts of $1 million or greater, a policy already in place at the Department of Defense that was enacted with broad bipartisan support in 2010. Workers deserve the opportunity to have their day in court to seek justice for their sexual assault and discrimination claims.  I oppose this resolution to disapprove of these protections because it gives serial law violators a free pass at the cost of workers' safety, and it disadvantages the law-abiding contractors in Oregon and across the country who follow our Nation's laws.

4899,topic-id,320,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the chairwoman for yielding, and for her leadership on our committee.  I rise today to offer my strong support for H.37. This legislation is about protecting our Nation's workers, small businesses, and taxpayers.  As a former labor and employment attorney, I have seen the maze that businesses must jump through in order to become a Federal contractor. Well, this rule would only make things that much harder for them.  This regulation, due to the price of compliance, could force small- and medium-sized businesses, who can't afford to hire a massive legal team, out of being able to get contracts with the Federal  This rule will add subjectivity to the Federal procurement process and deprive contractors of due process rights. As an attorney, I take that threat very seriously.  We should be in the business of supporting policies to make it easier for these kinds of businesses to get new work, not harder.  Now, Mr.Speaker, I know my colleagues on the other side say this is just about punishing bad actors. But this rule would require Federal contractors to disclose even alleged violations of wrongdoing, regardless of whether or not there is any credibility to the claims. Right now, there are effective policies in place to prevent bad actors and contractors that break the law from receiving government contracts.  This could be especially damaging for employers who are the target of union organizing campaigns, or in a situation where a competitor files a claim in an effort to gain a competitive advantage. It elevates the risk of frivolous complaints and the loss of business.  Instead of muddying the water and making it harder for our Nation's small- and medium-sized businesses, let's use the current framework, not a new burdensome regulation, to enforce the law and hold any bad actors accountable.  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution to block an overreaching and counterproductive rule.

4934,topic-id,2914,"Thank you, Mr.I rise this evening to speak on the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the Director of the Office of Management and I am going to start by talking in a minute about some of the critical roles that the Office of Management and Budget plays.  Before I do that, I want to go back for a moment to some of the comments of my friend who just preceded me on the floor. Going back 8 years ago, I remember that in the last 6 months of 2008, we lost 2.5 million jobs in this country--2.5 million jobs in 6 months. In the first 6 months of 2009, we lost 2.5 million more new jobs. That is 5 million jobs in 12 months.  Since the beginning of 2010, we have added 16 million jobs in this country. The unemployment rate in this country jumped as high as 10 percent by the end of 2009, and by the beginning of this year the unemployment rate was cut in half. During the first fiscal year of this last administration, the Obama-Biden administration, the deficit, the budget they inherited for that fiscal year ballooned to $1.4 trillion. I am an old State treasurer, Congressman, Governor, and now That's a lot of money. We have had in terms of GDP probably higher deficits than that during World War II, but that is a lot of money.  During the last administration, the debt, deficit as we knew it, dropped by about two-thirds, maybe a little more than two-thirds. Do we have a balanced budget coming into this year? Is it better than $1.4 trillion? It sure is.[[Page S1201]]  The unemployment rate was cut by half, the annual deficit has been cut by two-thirds, and instead of losing 5 million jobs as we did in 2008 and 2009, we added 16 million jobs. Could we do better than that? We have. Have we ever had a longer running economic expansion in the history of our country than the last 7 years? I am told we have not. Can we do better?  Hopefully, in our spending plans and in the regulatory work that we do, we will adopt policies that provide the kind of environment that leads to job creation and job preservation. That is what we do. We don't create jobs here. As my friend who is presiding knows, we help create a nurturing environment for job creation. One of the things we need for that is commonsense regulation.  If you look at the role of the OMB Director, one of those listed on this chart, 2, is regulatory process. The regulatory process is the way regulations are created in this Congress, and as the Presiding Officer and others know, it is dictated by legislation called the Administrative Procedure  If the Presiding Officer were an agency that was considering promulgating a rule or regulation, the agency would basically say to the rest of the world: We are thinking of promulgating a regulation on subject x. It is really a heads-up that they are thinking about doing this. It doesn't mean they are going to, but they are thinking about it, so those who might be affected by that regulation, regulation x, would have a chance to say: Hmm, something might be coming our way, and we have an interest in it--or we don't. This gives them a chance to go to the agency and say: We hear you are interested in promulgating a regulation on this particular subject. Let's talk about it. That is why the agency gives a heads-up, so that those who might be affected by it have the opportunity to talk to the agency, come to their elected officials, and share their opinions.  The agency can accept the comments they get or reject them. The Members of Congress can accept or reject them. We can actually arrange for our constituents who might have an interest in a proposed or possible regulation to arrange for meetings to make sure the agency that is thinking about promulgating a new rule or different rule or regulation has an opportunity to meet with those who would be affected positively or negatively.  The agency, armed with that information--the input they receive from filing a notice of rulemaking--if they decide to go forward, they will eventually propose a draft rule. This is not a final rule or regulation, but a draft. They promulgate that draft regulation under the Administrative Procedure Act, and those who are interested in or affected positively or negatively by the draft regulation again have the opportunity to go back and talk to the folks who promulgated that rule or regulation, stating what it is they like or don't like, proposing changes. They look us up--the Representatives, Senators--and say: Here are our concerns. We think this should be strengthened or weakened or taken out or added.  There is a period of time--a comment period--for the draft regulations. Sometimes those who can be affected by the regulations will come to us and say: We don't think we have enough time to fully understand what the effects of this draft regulation would be, and we would like to have more time to comment. Then what we do as elected officials is reach out to the agency and say: We don't have enough time. We are hearing from too many of our constituents that there is not enough time. How about another week or month or some reasonable period of time? Sometimes we get what we ask for, and sometimes we don't. Sometimes we get half of what we ask for, but that is the way it works.  At the end of the day, the agency may decide that they have enough of a bad response--bad vibrations from those who would be affected, as opposed to picking up good vibrations--and the agency may pull the reg entirely and say: We will do this another time but not now. But they might go ahead and change the drafting to prepare to offer the final regulation.  When the agency is ready to report out the drafted regulation, that is not the end of it because that is where OMB comes into play. There is an agency within OMB called OIRA, which refers to an oversight role that the OMB plays. Essentially, as we used to say in the Navy, if a message or something were sent from one level of command to another to another, we actually say we ``chopped'' it through different levels of command. My colleague who has better experience in the military, as I recall, may have had a similar kind of experience. But the draft regulation that is promulgated has to be chopped through It has to be chopped through They have the final say, and they can kick it back to the agency or not.  Changes may or may not be made, but eventually the final reg is published in the Federal There is a period of time that runs, and eventually if folks really don't like it enough they can basically file a suit and go to court to try to block the regulation. We see that happen from time to time. Faced with a suit, the agency might want to pull it back and make some further modifications. We can join in those amicus briefs or not. If all else fails, Harry Reid, who used to be the majority leader, a Democrat, wrote a law a number of years ago, the Congressional Review Act, which allows the Congress, years from now, to take another look and see if it is something--it is not that old, it had regs come out in the last couple of months--and ask: Is this a good idea or not? And if the majority of the House and Senate, with the consent of the President, say: No, we don't think this regulation is a good idea, it can basically be taken off the field and put on the shelf.  That is the way the process works. Some people don't think that is a very good process. I think it is pretty good. I hope that if Mick Mulvaney is confirmed to this job, this regulatory process is one that will be put to good use.  One of the things Cass Sunstein did, at the direction of President Obama, was begin a look-back policy, saying we are going to look not just forward for new regulations, we are going to look back at the old ones we have and see which ones have maybe outlived their utilization and should be eliminated or modified. I have stopped counting how much money has been saved during the look-back process over the last several years, but it is in the billions of dollars--maybe even in the tens of billions of dollars by now. I hope the next OMB Director will continue it.  We have been joined here by my colleague from I would just ask him if he is pressed for time. I will go maybe about another 10 minutes, and then it is all yours.  Another big job of the OMB Director, not surprisingly, is to help the President prepare in submitting a budget. I want to take just a minute and maybe use another chart to talk about how we spend our money. As my colleagues know, the spending is a pie chart kind of like this, and it is divided into maybe four major areas. One of those is--some people call it mandatory spending. I call it entitlement spending: Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, maybe veterans' benefits. It is spending the people are entitled to by virtue of being a certain age, being disabled, maybe having served in our Nation's military, maybe being disabled in the course of military service, maybe they earned a GI bill. Those are the kinds of things that are being considered as entitlements or mandatory spending. As a percentage of the budget, if we look at the green colors here, it adds up to a little more than half the budget.  Another maybe 5 to 10 percent of the budget is this sort of beige color or gray--this area right here. It is about 5 to 10 percent of the budget. It is debt service, principal interest on our Nation's debt. Fortunately, our interest rates are low. If they ever go up, ``Katy, bar the door.'' Then the principal on the debt service will go up a whole lot. We have been blessed with low interest rates. It will not be that way forever.  So entitlement spending, a little over 50 percent; debt service, principal interest on the debt, 5, 10 percent.  The rest is called discretionary spending. It is defense spending so it is about 40 percent discretionary spending. That is the spending that is done by our Appropriations Committee, about a dozen Appropriations subcommittees, including Agriculture,[[Page S1202]]Armed Services, Housing, Transportation, you name it.  Over half of the amount of spending that is called discretionary spending, right here in the blue, more than half of that is defense spending and less than half of that is called nondefense discretionary spending.  As it turns out, we could eliminate, I am told, every bit of our nondefense discretionary spending, and we would still have a budget deficit. That would be everything from agriculture to the environment, to transportation, law enforcement, prisons, you name it; the whole kit and caboodle, everything other than defense. I don't think we want to get rid of all that. We might want to find more efficient ways to spend that money. God knows we can find more efficient ways in spending defense money.  One of the ways we can do that is to take a page from something that happened today in the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and with our governmental affairs hat on, we had the leader of the Government Accountability Office with us. We also had a couple of inspectors general, and we had the head of the Census They came to talk with us and present to us something called the GAO--Government Accountability Office--high-risk list. What is a high-risk list? It is a list of programs that are in danger of wasting a lot of money. It could include roughly $400 billion a year in revenues that we are leaving on the table; owed but not collecting. It could be $300 billion a year in major weapons systems cost overruns. It could be $110 billion, $115 billion a year on something called improper payments, moneys that are paid wrongly, mistakenly--not fraud but just mistaken payments--and it can include a lot of other things. It could be properties that the Federal Government needs to get rid of, and we have done good work on that. Senator Portman and I worked on that, as did Senator Coburn when he was here, and we worked a lot on property reforms. With the help of Senator Johnson last Congress, I think we made pretty good progress.  There are a lot of ways we waste money. What we do in the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, with our governmental affairs hat on, is we use the GAO high-risk list as a to-do list to be able to save money. If you have GAO, in concert with the Office of Management and Budget, working together with the inspectors general in every major Federal agency, working with the oversight committees in the Senate, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and with our counterpart oversight committee in the House--if we all are working together, going in the same direction, we can actually figure out how to save a lot of money in defense spending and nondefense. With all the overpayments that occur in Medicare and Medicaid--it is almost $100 billion just between those two--we could actually make some real progress. Our budget deficit is still too large.  Not that many years ago, when Bill Clinton was President, the last 4 years of that administration, we had 4 years of balanced budgets. We had not had a balanced budget since 1968. Over the last 4 years of the Clinton administration, we had four balanced budgets in a row.  How did we do it? One, we had a good economy, as you all recall. There were more jobs created in those 8 years than any 8 years in the history of the country. I was Governor then, and there were more jobs created in those 8 years in Delaware than any year in the history of our I like to say I didn't create one of them, but we tried to create a nurturing environment for job creation and job preservation. One of those ways--one of the elements that is important--is certainty and predictability.  It has been mentioned earlier today that the concern that a number of people have with Congressman Mulvaney as OMB Director is he allegedly has said government shutdowns are not that concerning. I don't know his exact words. One of the things we were reminded of today by GAO is, businesses need predictability, they need certainty, but the other thing they need--what the Federal Government needs and its employees need are some predictability and certainty as well. Stop-and-go government is painful to businesses, but it is especially painful and wasteful for the Federal Continuing resolutions, government shutdowns--our Federal employees spend a lot of time just preparing for shutdowns. That is wasteful, it is demoralizing, and we can't do that.  I think that is--I will stop there. I see the majority leader is here, and I want to be respectful to him. There are other concerns I have that I will submit, but I hope my colleagues will keep these thoughts and these concerns in mind when we consider the nomination of Mr.Mulvaney to head up  I would say to my friend the majority leader, I appreciate the time we had together in your office earlier this week. I would just ask him to consider one more time, if we had the opportunity for a judge in Oklahoma to make a decision tomorrow on the access to the emails we discussed, I think we could all vote with a clear conscience a week from Monday on the nomination of the Administrator for the I would encourage the majority leader to do that.

5091,topic-id,498,"I thank the chairman for yielding.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.5, the Regulatory Accountability  In response to the previous gentleman's comments, I would just note that none of the regulations that we are consideringtoday--the legislation--is going to do away with regulations altogether or even significantly, especially, regulations that haveto do with people's safety. We are not trying to do anything that is going to affect the safety of the American people. We arejust trying to make sure the regulations are smarter, and that is what this is all about.  I am also pleased that title III of H.5 is a bill that I sponsored last term and in this Congress--the Small BusinessRegulatory Flexibility Improvements The Committee on Small Business, which I happen to chair, and the Committee on theJudiciary have crafted this bill with bipartisan input over many years.  I thank Chairman Goodlatte for working with us on this important legislation, and I thank him for his leadership.  Small businesses are found in every congressional district and in every industry. They provide livelihoods for millions ofworkers and for their families. Small businesses employ nearly half of the private sector workforce and generate two out ofevery three new jobs in the private sector today. The Federal Government should be doing everything it can to encourage thesesmall but mighty job creators. Unfortunately, oppressive red tape has had the opposite effect of discouraging investment,expansion, and job growth. I am not saying that all regulations are bad, but there are too many rules. For too long, agencieshave ignored their true effect, their true impact, on small businesses. Small businesses are at a real disadvantage because theyhave fewer resources and rarely have in-house counsel, the regulatory compliance staff that would be necessary to guide themthrough this maze. Generally, small businesses just don't have that.  So shouldn't regulators, at the very least, examine the effects of new rules on small businesses and consider ways to reduceexcessive burdens?  Of course they should. There is a law, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or the RFA, which requires agencies to conduct thiscommonsense assessment when they regulate. Even though the law has been on the books for over 36 years, agencies too frequentlyjust ignore its requirements.                              {time}  1430  The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, which is title III in this bill, eliminates loopholes thatagencies like the Internal Revenue Service have used to avoid compliance with the It also forces agencies to analyze notonly the direct, but also the indirect effects of rules on small businesses, just as agencies are required to do whenpromulgating major rules affecting, for example, the environment. It gives small businesses additional opportunities for earlyinput on proposed rules and regulations and strengthens the RFA's requirements for agencies to periodically review old rules.  Nothing in our legislation today takes away an agency's ability to issue a rule or a regulation, but it will force therulemakers to think carefully before they act. It is great legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH323-2.txt,186,"DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE GENERAL",2017.0,11.0,January

5124,topic-id,412,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I offer this amendment to address a longstanding problem: agencies not fully analyzing the effects of regulations on smallbusinesses.  Under the current Regulatory Flexibility Act, an agency may certify a rule if it expects that the rule will not have--and Iam quoting the current law here--``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''  When an agency certifies a rule, it does not need to perform a full regulatory flexibility analysis. This provision makessense because not every rule affects small businesses.  Unfortunately, agencies appear to be abusing this provision. According to a recent study, agencies only prepared analysesfor approximately 8 percent of rules finalized between 1996 and 2012.  A recent example of this occurred with the controversial waters of United States rule. The Environmental Protection Agencyand Army Corps of Engineers certified that rule despite the significant and direct consequences for farmers, ranchers, and homebuilders. Most of those are small businesses.  Although the Small Business Administration Chief Counsel for Advocacy sent a letter to the agencies stating that thecertification was improper and urging them to withdraw the rule, the agencies ignored the Chief Counsel and proceeded tofinalize it anyway.                              {time}  1530  This amendment addresses this problem by requiring agencies to include--and I am quoting my amendment--``an economicassessment or a summary thereof that is sufficiently detailed to support the agency's certification.'' This will be published inthe Federal Register as part of the detailed statement and certification for the proposed rule.  This approach mirrors the one used in the National Environmental Policy When an agency finds a project to have nosignificant impacts on the environment, it is required to provide an environmental assessment or a summary of it. Since agenciesare required to provide a threshold analysis when they issue a finding of no significant impact for actions that could affectthe environment, it just makes sense to extend the same type of requirement to rules that could affect small businesses. Smallbusinesses, after all, are the folks that are responsible for creating two-thirds, or about 70 percent, of the new jobs creatednowadays. So anything that burdens these small businesses is something that is, by definition, bad for the economy and bad forjob creation.  This particular amendment, I think, improves the underlying legislation. It makes sense. I urge my colleagues to supportthis amendment, which will further strengthen the RFA and ensure that agencies' decisions are supported by data.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

First, before speaking in opposition to this amendment, I would note that the ranking member, Ms.Velazquez, and I worked very much in a bipartisan and cooperative manner on a whole range of issues. We have done thatwhen she chaired the committee and I was the ranking member, and we do that now that I am the chair and she is the rankingmember. I commend her for that cooperation. We have actually gotten a lot of things done in the Small Business Committee onbehalf of small businesses all across the country in both Democratic and Republican districts.  That being said, I would also note that this particular language, in essence, replaces our H.5, title III, with Ms.Velazquez's version. She mentioned that hers is bipartisan. Ours is as well. Mr.Cuellar was a principal cosponsorof this particular legislation, so, by definition, it is bipartisan. I would also note that we have dealt with this a number oftimes over the years, and we have included a significant number of Democratic amendments already in our underlying bill as well.So it truly is bipartisan.  The gentlewoman from New York's amendment would essentially strike title III of the bill, and it would replace it withalternative language. While I am heartened that she agrees that the Regulatory Flexibility Act needs to be improved, thisamendment just does not go far enough to address, in my view, most Federal agencies' habitual disregards for small businesses.We know that the bureaucracy does disregard small businesses time and time again.

The bureaucracy has grown far too large over the years.  That money comes from somewhere. Where does it come from? It comes out of the hardworking taxpayers of our country. A lot ofthose folks are small business folks, and they are folks that[[Page H351]]have gotten the short end of the stick far too often.  Hopefully, this Congress will move legislation that comes out of this body in a direction where, rather than throwroadblocks, hindrances, and more problems in the pathway of small businesses, we are going to help them. I know the last thingthey want to hear is: I am from the government, and I am here to help you.  The fact is the government does exist, and to the extent we can help them, we ought to do that. But most of the smallbusinesses that I talk to, what they say is: just get the heck off my back. Quit telling me how to do what I know how to dobest.  So we are not anarchists over here. We are not saying that we don't need any bureaucracy, we don't need any government, andwe don't need any regulations. We do need some regulations, but we overregulate now.

That is all this does.  We are saying: How is this going to affect small businesses? Seventy percent of the new jobs created in America are createdby small businesses? Should we care about what the bureaucrats are doing, how it affects those folks that are creating all thesejobs?  Common sense says yes, we ought to do that.  This bill already includes a reform to prepare those agencies to prepare regulatory flexibility analyses when they aredeveloping changes to resource management plans to determine how small businesses and small communities would be affected.                              {time}  1715  Striking this provision from the bill would do away with a needed reform for small businesses, such as farmers and ranchersand their small communities, especially those located in the Western United States, which contains the vast majority of  I would also note that my esteemed colleague talks about Republicans trying to destroy health care in this country. That isobviously absurd. We are trying to save health care. We are trying to make sure that Americans aren't forced to pay a heck of alot more and have higher deductions, things they can't afford. Plans right now they are in, they are paying for plans andoftentimes get zero health care out of those plans because the deductibles are now so high under ObamaCare that they can't evenuse it.  I think there are a whole lot of people, when this was forced through this Congress on a purely partisan vote by mycolleagues, the Democrats at that time, and by this President, there were a lot of Republicans who would have loved to havejoined with them to do something to help people get health care who didn't have it. That is a worthy cause. But that could havebeen done without screwing up everybody else's health care in this country. That is what they failed to do when they did this.We are hoping, in a bipartisan way, we can work together to improve health care for lots of folks in this country. We will seeif that is going to work out or not.  I would also note that there is nobody on this side of the aisle who thinks we need no government at all, we need noregulations, we need no rules; but we don't want to overregulate the job creators in this country so that they can't createjobs. Those jobs[[Page H362]]that people don't get, those are real people; or people who get knocked out of that employment are realpeople, and they have families. We ought to be supporting them. Overregulation kills those jobs.  I would finally note, relative to climate change, what we are saying is that if we are going to do something, let's do it ina smart manner. Let's not try to save some things and then knock thousands, probably millions of Americans out of their jobs.There is a smart way of doing it and there is a wrong way of doing it.

4882,topic-id,980,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the resolution.  During the past 8 years, the number of newly issued regulations and the costs of those regulations have surged. By the prior administration's own estimates, Federal regulations promulgated over the last 10 years alone have imposed a cost of more than $100 billion annually on American taxpayers.  H.37, which we are considering today under the Congressional Review Act procedures, represents an important step toward rolling back this tsunami of rules. Once a CRA resolution of disapproval for a rule is enacted, agencies cannot reissue the rule or any substantially similar rules in the future.  H.37 revokes the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule, otherwise known as the blacklisting rule.  I want to thank Chairwoman Foxx for her leadership on this resolution of[[Page H908]]disapproval. I also want to recognize my fellow original cosponsors, Mr.Chabot and Mr.Mitchell, for their leadership on this issue as well.  I want to highlight the impact of this rule on the Federal acquisition system as well as contractors. This rule requires Federal contractors to report violations and alleged violations of 14 Federal labor laws and undefined equivalent State labor laws for the previous 3 years. Contractors must collect and report this information every time they submit a proposal for a contract and then every 6 months during the contract performance. Then Federal contract officers consult with their agency's newly created agency labor compliance adviser before determining if a contractor is eligible for a contract award.  There are a number of reasons this rule should be revoked. The Federal acquisition system is already a very complex, inefficient system. This contractor blacklisting rule is exactly the type of requirement an already complex Federal acquisition system does not need. The rule adds another contractor clause to an increasingly long list of clauses in every Federal contract. It slows down a process that already has trouble delivering goods and services in a timely manner. It increases the burden on Federal contract officers who have to review and assess the significant volume of information and take on the role of labor law experts.  The rule imposes significant costs on contractors, which means the government, which ultimately means the taxpayers. The rule itself is estimated to cost contractors and subcontractors more than $458 million in the first year and $413 million in the second year of its implementation. Some experts believe the government underestimated these costs.  The cost to establish a new information collection, reporting, and assessment system to comply with the rule would be prohibitively expensive for most contractors, especially the small contractors. Mr.Speaker, this is where the rubber meets the road. It is these small contractors.  In fiscal year 2016, the Federal Government spent more than $470 billion contracting for goods and services. We need to be looking for ways to reduce, not increase, spending in this area.  The rule discourages competition and reduces access to innovation. The last thing we need to do for the Federal acquisition system is to discourage competition and innovation, particularly for first time participants who want to join the Federal marketplace. There are already so many barriers to entry, particularly for these small businesses. So think about the small business at home. They want to compete for these Federal contractors. They may be a very small organization.  Even after we pass the resolution of disapproval, there are still rules, there are still laws, and there are still a lot of burdens that they have to deal with. But I want to cite some Bloomberg data about the number of first time Federal vendors. We have fallen to a 10-year low--down 24 percent in 2007 to only 13 percent in 2016.  What that means is the big are probably getting bigger, but the small guy, the mom, the pop, and the woman who is starting a new business and wants to compete for these Federal contracts don't have a fighting chance. For the Federal Government to put more burdens on there, especially things that haven't been substantiated, is just not fair, and it is just not right.                              {time}  1445  The rule duplicates existing labor enforcement mechanisms to hold contractors accountable and, therefore, I believe, is not necessary.  Revoking this rule will not leave Federal contractors free to violate labor laws. To the contrary, the Department of Labor has significant oversight and investigation resources to enforce the Federal labor law.  Further, if there is a bad-apple contractor not complying with the law, contract officers already have the authority to refer contractors for suspension and disbarment.  This rule raises due process and First Amendment concerns. One of the most disturbing parts of the rule is that contractors would be required to report alleged violations--not confirmed--just the alleged violations of the 14 Federal labor laws, and the undefined equivalent of State labor laws.  It deprives contractors of their legal rights to challenge such allegations. The reporting requirement covers non-final administrative merits determinations without regard to the severity of the alleged violation.  Contractors would have to disclose National Labor Relations Board complaints, OSHA citations, EEOC non-final letters of determination, even though these cases have not been adjudicated and the record is incomplete.  Contractors challenged this rule in Federal Court, and the judge, in granting a preliminary injunction for the rule, found this reporting requirement could also impact contractors' First Amendment rights. The judge said that the rule could result in compelled speech by requiring contractors to report allegations that would cause a reputational harm, particularly if after adjudication the allegation is found to be without merit.  This rule increases costs, complexity, and reduces competition in the Federal acquisition system. We are having trouble getting new entrants in to compete as contractors, and, therefore, I urge the support of the passage of H.37.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

It requires the administration to provide meaningful information aboutupcoming regulations online before those are actually issued. Early online disclosure will create the need for transparency sothe public can see what is on the horizon.  Each month, Federal agencies will be required to list all regulations expected to be proposed or finalized within thefollowing year. For each regulation on the list, the issuing agency is required to provide basic information to the public aboutthat regulation. This includes the objectives of the regulation, the legal basis for the regulation, and where it stands in therulemaking process.  If the agency expects to finalize the regulation within the following year, the agency is also required to provideinformation about the impact of the regulation. This includes estimates on the costs, the completion date, and the economiceffects of the regulation, including the net effect on jobs--something that doesn't happen now but seems to be just common sense.

5147,topic-id,546,"Mr.Chairman, the bill before us today promises to update the ways that agencies make and enforce their rulesand regulations. But in many ways, it is a solution in search of a problem. When issuing a rule, Federal agencies must alreadyadhere to rigorous analytical process of considering alternatives, justifying the cost of a rule, and considering input fromstakeholders.  Within this framework, agencies have been granted the necessary latitude to react quickly to urgent crises in consumersafety. It has preserved the safety of our food and our drinking water and has protected our families from defects in theproducts that we rely upon every day. However, the passage of this bill would put that safety and that protection at risk.  With H.5, we are getting six reform bills rolled into one. This sweeping regulatory bill would cumulatively add 60 newprocedural and analytical requirements to the agency rulemaking process, invite frivolous litigation against agencies, empowerspecial interests, and emphasize cost-saving over public protection.  If enacted, H.5 will needlessly create such an enormous burden on the rulemaking process that it threatens to hamstringagencies and discourage them from pursuing new rules at all. In its present form, this bill endangers our Nation'senvironmental, public health, workplace safety, and consumer financial security protections.  My amendment would offer critical protection by exempting rules pertaining to the prevention of the transmission offoodborne illness or assistance to food facilities to meet preventive-control requirements for safety.  Protecting consumers from dangerous food contamination is a worthy goal in and of itself. And this amendment would go evenfurther by protecting jobs and businesses. For example, in 2015, Blue Bell Creameries suffered a deadly listeria contaminationcrisis and had to recall 8 million gallons of ice cream. After the company shut down most of its production, Blue Bell wasforced to lay off 1,450 employees from their jobs, or 37 percent of their workforce, and an additional 1,400 employees werefurloughed.  Chipotle is also still reeling from various outbreaks of coli, salmonella, and norovirus over 2015 and 2016, which causedwidespread panic among customers and the company's shareholders. Despite marketing efforts to repair its reputation, Chipotle'ssales have steadily declined, and it plans to open fewer stores in 2017. This, in turn, had a domino effect on Chipotle's paperbowl supplier who laid off 5 percent of its employees because of decreased demand from  Afterward, both Blue Bell and Chipotle took aggressive remedial steps, such as conducting deep cleansing of equipment andfacilities, changing food preparation procedures, hiring food safety consultants, training employees, and temporarily suspendingoperations. The FDA responded by proposing proactive rules, such as having manufacturers come up with a plan to identifypotential food safety problems and how to respond to them. The FDA also proposed a rule to establish standards for growing,harvesting, packing, and handling produce.  Both these rules could greatly assist businesses in minimizing future food contamination and having to deal with theeconomic aftermath of an outbreak. However, under H.5 in its current form, similar such FDA rules could be delayed by yearsor halted entirely. We can't afford to put consumer safety and our economy at risk while Congress entangles any real possibilityfor immediate and preventative action.

Mr.Chairman, these bills are a group of bills that have been considered for many years and have passed on partisan votes inthe What you do when you repeal regulations or make it harder to have regulations is you make it better for business,better for the Chamber crowd, better for the manufacturing folk.  But there is always a cost for everything. I think it was Isaac Newton who said: ``For every action, there is an equal andopposite reaction.'' You take these regulations off, increase business, and make it easier; but there is an equal and oppositeeffect in that Newtonian law as the consumer of the products.  Whether it is food and food safety, whether it is water safety and purity, whether it is air safety, whether it is toys andmanufacturers' defects or automobiles and safety in transportation--it could be airplane transportation--there is always a sidethat loses; and the side that loses is that of the consumers and the folks who will be injured and/or killed because of lack ofregulations.  I don't know how much one life is worth. If it is mine or one of my loved ones or one of my constituents--I am getting alittle political here--it is worth a lot, but it is worth a lot no matter who it is, and there are going to be lots of people whowill not survive some of these regulations.

5139,topic-id,360,"Mr.Chair, I rise today in opposition to this amendment and in strong opposition to the RegulatoryAccountability  This bill is another thinly veiled mechanism for the majority to attack agency rulemaking with which they disagree.  This amendment would prevent agencies from publicly disclosing information that, quote, ``directly advocates, in support ofor against the proposed rule, for the submission of information to form part of the record of review for the proposed rule.''  I am concerned that the way this language is written it could restrict agencies from providing information about thebenefits of a rule and soliciting public feedback.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to solicit public comments on proposed rules except in narrowcircumstances. We should be encouraging agencies to solicit public comments in order to provide businesses, consumer groups, andother members of the public with the opportunity to make suggestions to the agency for improving the proposed rule.  Agency employees are already barred under appropriations bills from engaging in publicity or propaganda.  Agency employees are specifically barred from engaging in ``substantial `grassroots' lobbying campaigns'' when thosecampaigns are aimed at encouraging members of the public ``to pressure Members of Congress to support Administration orDepartment legislative or appropriations proposals.''  While transparency is always helpful in the regulatory process, a requirement that agencies report to Congress everycommunication to the public--including every oral communication from an agency official--would be unnecessarily burdensome andwould not be feasible for agencies.

The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH323-2.txt,1959,REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACTOF 2017,2017.0,11.0,January
5079,topic-id,4174,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in opposition, of course, to H.5, the so-called Regulatory Accountability  Under the guise of improving the regulatory process, H.5 will, in truth, undermine that process and jeopardize theability of government agencies to safeguard public health and safety, the environment, workplace safety, and consumer financialprotections.  It is not a pleasant picture. The ways in which this legislation accomplishes this result are almost too numerous to listhere, but, of course, I will mention a few.  For example, title I of the bill would impose more than 70 new analytical requirements that will add years to the rulemakingprocess.  Is that what we want to do? I don't think so.  Worse yet, many of these new requirements are intended to facilitate the ability of regulated entities--such as well-fundedcorporate interests--to intervene and derail regulatory protections they oppose. And it would function as a ``super-mandate,''overriding critical laws that Congress specifically intended to prohibit agencies from considering costs when American lives areat stake.  Additionally, the bill creates numerous procedural hurdles in the rulemaking process, further endangering American livesthrough years of delay and increasing the likelihood of regulatory capture.                              {time}  1400  For example, H.5 dramatically expands the use of formal rulemaking, a time- and resource-intensive process, requiringformal, trial-like hearings for certain rules. Formal rulemaking has long been roundly rejected for good cause as beingexcessively costly and ill-suited for complex policy issues.  The administrative section of the American Bar Association noted that ``these provisions run directly contrary to a virtualconsensus in the administrative law community that the Administrative Procedure Act formal rulemaking procedure is obsolete.''  I am also concerned that H.5 would impose an arbitrary, one-size-fits-all, 6-month delay on virtually every new rule.Specifically, title V of the bill will prohibit agency rules from becoming effective until the information required by the billhas been available online for 6 months with only limited exception.  Clearly, H.5 fails to take into account a vast array of time-sensitive rules ranging from the mundane, such as thefrequent United States Coast Guard bridge closings regulations, to those that protect public health and safety, such asforthcoming updates to the Lead and Copper Rule by the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce the lead in public drinkingwater.  Finally, title II of H.5 would eliminate judicial deference to agencies and require Federal courts to review all agencyrulemakings and interpretations of statutes on a de novo basis. The unfortunate result of this requirement is that the billwould empower a generalist court to override the determinations of agency experts, regardless of the judge's technical knowledgeand understanding of the underlying subject matter.  By eliminating any deference to agencies, H.5 would force agencies to adopt even more detailed factual records andexplanations, which would further delay the finalization of critical lifesaving regulatory protections.  The Supreme Court has recognized that Federal courts simply lack the subject-matter expertise of agencies, are politicallyunaccountable, and should not engage in making substantive determinations from the bench. It is ironic that those who have longdecried judicial activism now support facilitating a greater role for the judiciary in agency rulemaking.  These are only a few of the many serious concerns presented by H.5, and, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to stronglyoppose this dangerous legislation.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                                       AFL-CIO                                            Legislative Alert,                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 2017.       DearRepresentative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I am writing      to express our strong opposition to H.5, the      RegulatoryAccountability Act of 2017. This sweeping bill,      which packages six anti-regulatory measures passed by the      House in the lastCongress, would upend 40 years of labor,      health, safety and environmental laws, threaten new needed      protections leaving workersand the public in danger. The AFL-     CIO urges you to oppose this harmful legislation.       The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA)is drafted as an      amendment to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), but it      goes far beyond establishing procedures forrulemaking. The      RAA acts as a ``super mandate'' overriding the requirements      of landmark legislation such as the OccupationalSafety and      Health Act and Mine Safety and Health The bill would      require agencies to adopt the least costly rule, instead      ofthe most protective rule as is now required by the OSH Act      and MSH It would make protecting workers and the      publicsecondary to limiting costs and impacts on businesses      and corporations.       The RAA will not improve the regulatory process; itwill      cripple it. The bill adds dozens of new analytical and      procedural requirements to the rulemaking process, adding      years toan already slow process. The development of major      workplace safety rules already takes 8--10 years or more,      even for rules wherethere is broad agreement between      employers and unions on the measures that are needed to      improve protections. OSHA's silicastandard to protect workers      from deadly silica dust took nearly 19 years and the      beryllium standard 15 years. The RAA willfurther delay needed      rules and cost workers their lives.       The RAA substitutes formal rulemaking for the current      procedures forpublic participation for high impact rules and      other major rules upon request. These formal rulemaking      procedures will make itmore difficult for workers and members      of the public to participate, and give greater access and      influence to business groupsthat have the resources to hire      lawyers and lobbyists to participate in this complex process.      For agencies that already providefor public hearings, such as      OSHA and MSHA, the bill would substitute formal rulemaking      for the development of all new rules,overriding the effective      public participation processes conducted by these agencies.       H.5 would subject allagencies--including independent      agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the      National Labor Relations Board (NLRB),Consumer Product Safety      Commission (CPSC), and the Consumer Financial Protection      Bureau (CFPB) to these new analytical andprocedural      requirements. It would be much more difficult for agencies to      develop and issue new financial reform rules andconsumer      protection rules required under recently enacted legislation.       This radical legislation doesn't just apply toregulations;      it would also require agencies to analyze the costs and      benefits of major guidance documents, even though      thesedocuments are non-binding and have no legal force.      Guidance documents are an important tool for agencies to      disseminateinformation on significant issues and hazards      quickly in order to protect the public and workers. For      example, in response tothe Ebola virus threat, the Centers      for Disease Control (CDC) issued critical guidance documents      in order to prevent the spreadof disease, including      recommendations for infection control and protections for      healthcare workers and emergency responders.Similar guidance      was issued was issued to prevent transmission of the Zika      virus. Under the RAA's provisions, CDC would berequired to      assess the costs and benefits of these major guidance      documents, making it virtually impossible to      provideinformation and recommendations in a timely manner.       H.5 also includes a grab bag of other harmful anti-     regulatory measuresthat thwart, weaken and undermine      protections. The Separation of Powers Restoration Act      abolishes judicial deference toagencies' statutory      interpretations in rulemaking requiring a court to decide all      relevant questions of law de novo, allowingcourts to      substitute their own policy judgements for the agencies'      expert policy determinations. The Small Business      RegulatoryFlexibility Improvements Act (SBRFIA) imposes      numerous unnecessary new analytical and procedural      requirements on all agencies.It gives the Chief Counsel of      the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Office of Advocacy,      which in practice operates largelyas a mouthpiece for large      business interests, new broad powers to second guess and      challenge agency rules. The RequireEvaluation before      Implementing Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act) would      automatically stay the implementation of any rule withan      estimated annual cost of $1 billion that has been challenged,      precluding courts from making this decision, and      delayingprotections. Other titles add even more unnecessary      requirements to the rulemaking process.       The Regulatory Accountability Actwould gut the nation's      safety, health and environmental laws, stripping away      protections[[Page H326]]     from workers and the public. Itwould tilt the regulatory      process solidly in favor of business groups and others who      want to stop regulations and make itvirtually impossible for      the government to issue needed safeguards. The AFL-CIO      strongly opposes H.5 and urges you to voteagainst this      dangerous legislation.           Sincerely,                                                   William Samuel,     Director, Government Affairs                                  ____                                             Consumer Reports,                                                 January 10, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,      Dear Representative: Consumer Reports and its policy and      mobilization arm, Consumers Union,urge you to vote no on H.     5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. This dangerous      proposal would do severe damage toprotections consumers      depend on for health, safety, and honest treatment.       Congress has charged federal agencies withprotecting the      public from threats such as tainted food, hazardous products,      dirty air and water, and predatory financialschemes. It      established these agencies, such as the Food and Drug      Administration, Consumer Product Safety      Commission,Environmental Protection Agency, and Consumer      Financial Protection Bureau, so that public protections could      be overseen byprofessional civil servants with specific      technical and scientific expertise. In developing      regulations, agencies must act inaccordance with the statute      and with established rulemaking procedures that require      transparency and full opportunity for publicinput, including      input from the industry that will be subject to the      regulation.       We agree that the regulatory process cancertainly be      improved. We stand ready to support constructive efforts to      reduce delays and costs while preserving      importantprotections.       However, rather than streamlining and improving the      regulatory process, the Regulatory Accountability Act of2017      would make current problems even worse. Under H.5,      agencies would be required to undertake numerous costly      andunnecessary additional analyses for each rulemalcing,      which could grind proposed rules to a halt while wasting      agencies'resources. Collectively, these measures would create      significant regulatory and legal uncertainty for businesses,      increase coststo taxpayers and businesses alike, and prevent      the executive branch from keeping regulations up to date with      the rapidlychanging modern economy.       One of the most damaging effects of H.5 is that it      would, with only limited exceptions, requirefederal agencies      to identify and adopt the ``least costly'' alternative of a      rule it is considering. Currently, landmark lawslike the      Clean Air Act, Consumer Product Safety Act, and Securities      Exchange Act require implementing agencies to put toppriority      on the public interest. H.5 would reverse this priority by      requiring agencies to value the bottom-line profits ofthe      regulated industry over their mission to protect consumers      and a fair, well-functioning marketplace.       H.5 also includesseveral other damaging measures that      have not been included previously as part of the Regulatory      Accountability Thesemeasures would add unjustifiable      costs and uncertainty to the rulemalcing process, and greatly      impair regulatory agencies'work.       Contrary to its name, the ``Separation of Powers      Restoration Act'' (Title II of H.5) would disrupt the      carefullydeveloped constitutional balance between the      legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Courts giving      appropriate deferenceto reasonable agency interpretations of      their own statutes, as reflected in Chevron U.S.A., Inc., v.      NRDC, 467 U.837 (1984),is a well-settled approach that      promotes sound and efficient agency enforcement, with      effective judicial review. Under theChevron doctrine, courts      retain full judicial power to review agency legal      interpretations, but do not simply substitute theirown      judgment for an agency's. Chevron recognizes that agencies      accumulate uniquely valuable expertise in the laws      theyadminister, which makes deference from reviewing courts--     which do not have that expertise--appropriate.       Overturning thisapproach would lead to disaster. It would      severely hamper effective regulatory agency enforcement of      critical protections onwhich consumers depend. As the Supreme      Court stated in City of Arlington, v. F.C.C., 133      1863, 1874 (2013):``Thirteen Courts of Appeals applying a      totality-of-the-circumstances test would render the binding      effect of agency rulesunpredictable and destroy the whole      stabilizing purpose of The excessive agency power      that the dissent fears would bereplaced by chaos.'' Such a      move also would needlessly force the courts to repeatedly      second-guess agency decisions that thecourts have already      concluded the agency is in the best position to make.       The REVIEW Act and the ALERT Act (Titles IV and Vof H.5)      would cause additional needless and damaging delays to public      protections. The REVIEW Act--which would block ``high-     impact'' rules until every industry legal challenge has run      its full course--would tie up agencies in court      indefinitely,potentially making it impossible to address      pressing national problems. The ALERT Act would subject most      new rules to a delay ofat least six months, and require      agencies to waste resources complying with repetitive      reporting requirements.       Like thebill's proponents, we believe regulations should be      smart, clear, and cost-effective. However, H.5 does not      accomplish thisobjective. Instead of improving the regulatory      process, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 would make      it dramaticallyslower, more costly to the nation, and far      less effective at protecting health, safety, and other      essential consumerpriorities.       We strongly urge you to stand up for critical public      protections and vote no on H.5.

Re Oppose legislation on House Floor to undermine          crucialconsumer protections: H.5.       Dear Representative: The Regulatory Accountability Act of      2017(H.5) would handcuff all federal agencies in their      efforts to protect consumers. H.5 is a vastly expanded      version ofprevious versions of the Regulatory Accountability      Act (RAA). H.5 not only significantly and problematically      amends theAdministrative Procedures Act (APA) which has      guided federal agencies for many decades but also now      incorporates five additionalbills that thwart the regulatory      process: the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility      Improvement Act; the Require Evaluationbefore Implementing      Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act); the All Economic      Regulations are Transparent Act (ALERT Act); theSeparation of      Powers Restoration Act; and the Providing Accountability      Through Transparency These titles make an      alreadydamaging bill even worse.       Specifically, the RAA would require all agencies,      regardless of their statutorily mandatedmissions, to adopt      the least costly rule, without consideration of the impact on      public health and safety or the impact on ourfinancial      marketplace. As such, the RAA would override important      bipartisan laws that have been in effect for years, as well      asmore recently enacted laws to protect consumers from unfair      and deceptive financial services, unsafe food and unsafe      consumerproducts.       For example, the RAA would likely have prevented the      Federal Reserve from adopting popular credit card rules      underthe Truth in Lending Act in 2008 that prevented card      companies from unjustifiably increasing interest rates and      fees onconsumers. This is because these far-reaching changes      to abusive practices that were widespread in the marketplace      were not the``least costly'' options that were considered,      although they were arguably the most cost-effective.       The RAA would have achilling impact on the continued      promulgation of important consumer protections. Had it been      in effect, for example, the RAAwould have severely hampered      the implementation of essential and long-standing food safety      regulations, such as those requiringcompanies to prevent      contamination of meat and poultry products with deadly      foodborne pathogens. In fact, the Centers forDisease Control      and Prevention has credited the implementation of regulations      prohibiting contamination of ground beef with E.coli O157:H7      as one of the factors contributing to the recent success in      reducing coli illnesses among U.consumers.' Butsuch      benefits are impossible to quantify before a rule is enacted.       Further, had the RAA been in effect the necessary      childsafety protections required by the Consumer Product      Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) may have never been      implemented. Forexample, between 2007 and 2011 the Consumer      Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalled 11 million      dangerous cribs. These recallsfol owed 3,584 reports of crib      incidents, which resulted in 1,703 injuries and 153 deaths.      As a direct result of the CPSIA, CPSCpromulgated an effective      mandatory crib standard that requires stronger mattress      supports, more durable hardware, rigoroussafety testing, and      stopped the manufacture and sale of drop-side cribs. If the      RAA were implemented, such a life saving rulecould have been      delayed for years or never promulgated at all, at countless      human and financial cost.       The RAA also would adddozens of additional substantive and      procedural analyses, as well as judicial review to the      rulemaking process for every majorrule. It would: expand the      kind of rules that must go through a formal rulemaking      process; require agencies to determine``indirect costs''      without defining the term; require an impossible-to-conduct      estimation of a rule's impact on jobs, economicgrowth, and      innovation while ignoring public health and safety benefits;      and expand the powers of the White House's Office      ofManagement and Budget's Office of Information and      Regulatory Affairs to throw up numerous rulemaking      roadblocks, includingrequiring them to establish guidelines      for conducting cost-benefit analysis. This would further      delay or prevent thepromulgation of much needed consumer      protections.       The new titles of H.5 also add numerous roadblocks to      the promulgationof necessary consumer protections. The      Separation of Powers Restoration Act (Title II) eliminates[[Page H327]]     judicial deference thatagencies are granted when rules are      challenged in court. This allows judicial activism and      political considerations to trumpagency expertise. The Small      Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvement Act (Title III)      would increase regulatory delays andcreate new opportunities      for court challenge to regulations. The Require Evaluation      before Implementing Executive Wishlists Act(REVIEW Act)      (Title IV) would encourage frivolous legal challenges and      infuse the regulatory process with years of delay byrequiring      courts reviewing ``high-impact'' regulations to automatically      ``stay'' or block the enforcement of such regulationsuntil      all litigation is resolved. The All Economic Regulations are      Transparent Act (ALERT Act) (Title V) would also blatantlyand      purposefully lengthen the regulatory process by requiring a      six-month delay in the development of regulations.       We urgeyou to oppose this significant threat to consumer      protection, a fair marketplace, health, and safety posed by      H.5. Ifadopted, this proposal would waste federal      resources, minimize the ability of federal agencies to do      their jobs, grind theregulatory process to a halt, and infuse      the regulatory process with roadblocks preventing the      protection of the public andultimately putting American      consumers at risk.       We strongly urge you to oppose this harmful bill.           Sincerely,                                                  RachelWeintraub,     Legislative Director and General                                  ____                             Coalition forSensible Safeguards,                                                 January 10, 2017.     Re Floor vote of H.5, the Regulatory Accountability Act          of2017.       Dear Representative: The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards      (CSS), an alliance of over150 labor, scientific, research,      good government, faith, community, health, environmental, and      public interest groups, stronglyopposes 5, the      Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (RAA), which will be      voted on this week.       H.5 is a compilationof radical and harmful legislative      proposals that will permanently cripple the government's      ability to protect the public byrigging the regulatory      process against new regulatory safeguards in favor of      deregulation or regulatory inaction. The bill isjust as      dangerous and extreme as the REINS Act (H.26) and the      Midnight Rules Relief Act (H.21).       All of these bills aredesigned to make it as difficult as      possible for federal agencies to implement existing or new      laws that ensure our access toclean air and water, safe      workplaces, untainted food and drugs, safe toys and consumer      goods, and a stable financial system freeof Wall Street      recklessness. On the other hand, deregulatory actions that      repeal existing rules are exempt by virtue of      thelegislation's myopic focus on ``costs'' to corporate      special interests instead of ``benefits'' to the public. In      short, thelegislation will create a double standard in our      regulatory system that systematically favors deregulation      over new publicprotections and ``fast-tracks'' the repeal of      rules while paralyzing the creation of new ones.       The new version of the RAA,introduced in this Congress,      takes the previous RAA legislation and folds in several      destructive pieces of other so-calledregulatory reform bills      including: the misleadingly named Small Business Regulatory      Flexibility Improvements Act, the RequireEvaluation before      Implementing Executive Wishlists Act (REVIEW Act), the All      Economic Regulations are Transparent Act (ALERTAct), the      Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the Providing      Accountability Through Transparency These pieces of      otherbills seek to worsen an already destructive bill and add      several more corrosive layers intending to dismantle our      publicprotections.       The current rulemaking process is already plagued with      lengthy delays, undue influence by regulated industries,and      convoluted court challenges. If passed, Title I of this bill      would make each of these problems substantially worse and      wouldundermine our public protections and jeopardize public      health by threatening the safeguards that ensure our access      to clean airand water, safe workplaces, untainted food and      drugs, and safe toys and consumer goods.       Rather than enhancing protections, itdoes the exact      opposite. It adds 80 new analytical requirements to the      Administrative Procedure Act and requires federalagencies to      conduct estimates of all the ``indirect''costs and benefits      of proposed rules and all potential alternatives      withoutproviding any definition of what constitutes, or more      importantly, does not constitute an indirect cost. The      legislation wouldsignificantly increase the demands on      already constrained agency resources to produce the analyses      and findings that would berequired to finalize any new rule.      Thus, the RAA is designed to further obstruct and delay      rulemaldng rather than improve theregulatory process.       This legislation creates even more hoops for ``major'' or      ``high-impact'' rules i.e., rules that providesociety with      the largest health and safety benefits. It would allow any      interested person to petition the agency to hold apublic      hearing on any ``genuinely disputed'' scientific or factual      conclusions underlying the proposed rule. This provisionwould      give regulated industries multiple opportunities to challenge      agency data and science and thus further stretch out      thealready lengthy rulemaking process.       H.5 would also create a restrictive mandate of a ``one-     size-fits-all'' directive thatevery federal agency adopt the      ``least costly'' alternative. This is a profound change and      effectively creates a ``super-mandate'' for all major      regulatory actions of executive and independent agencies      which overrides twenty-five existing statutes,including the      Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety      and Health Act, and the Consumer Product SafetyImprovement      These laws prioritize public health, safety, and      economic security, not the cost concerns of      regulatedentities.       Title II of H.5 is the Separation of Powers Restoration      Act piece which seeks to destroy the Chevron      deferenceprincipal. It would remove the judicial deference      that agencies are granted when their regulations are      challenged in court. Thiswould be a radical change that      upends one of the fundamental principles in administrative      law, namely that courts should notsecond-guess scientific and      technical expertise at federal agencies. Overly intrusive      judicial review is one of the primaryreasons for regulatory      delay and paralysis and this legislation would make those      problems much worse.       The misleadingly namedSmall Business Regulatory Flexibility      Improvements Act (Title III) is a Trojan horse that would      expand the reach and scope ofregulatory review panels,      increase unnecessary regulatory delays, increase undue      influence by regulated industries and encourageconvoluted      court challenges all in the name of helping ``small      business,'' but so expansively applied that mostly big      businesseswould benefit. Because the bill mandates that these      panels look at 'indirect costs,' which are defined very      broadly, it could beapplied to virtually any agency action to      develop public protections.       The REVIEW Act (Title IV) would make our system      ofregulatory safeguards weaker by requiring courts reviewing      ``high-impact'' regulations to automatically ``stay'' or      block theenforcement of such regulations until all litigation      is resolved, a process that takes many years to complete. It      would addseveral years of delay to an already glacially slow      rulemaking process, invite more rather than less litigation,      and rob theAmerican people of many critical upgrades to      science-based public protections, especially those that      ensure clean air and water,safe food and consumer products,      safe workplaces, and a stable, prosperous economy.       The ALERT Act (Title V) is designed toimpede the      government's ability to implement critical new public health      and safety protections by adding a six-month delay.      Thisamounts to a six-month regulatory moratorium, even after      the often lengthy period required for developing and      finalizing theseregulations. Such delays could extend well      beyond that initial six-month period should the OIRA      Administrator fail to post therequired information in a      timely manner.       This new version of the RAA would override and threaten      decades of publicprotections. The innocuous-sounding act is,      in reality, the biggest threat to public health standards,      workplace safety rules,environmental safeguards, and      financial reform regulations to appear in decades. It acts as      a ``super-mandate,'' rewriting therequirements of landmark      legislation such as the Clean Air Act and the Occupational      Safety and Health Act and distorting theirprotective focus to      instead prioritize compliance costs.       We strongly urge opposition to H.5, the Regulatory      AccountabilityAct of 2017.

Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million working      and retired members of theAmerican Federation of State,      County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to urge      you to oppose the RegulatoryAccountability Act of 2017 (H.     5). This reckless legislation would severely undermine the      nation's ability to ensure thatworkers are safe on the job      and in the marketplace. If enacted, H.5 would effectively      end the federal government's ability toenact new protections      on behalf of the American people. Instead, the Regulatory      Accountability Act looks to protect businessesfrom people as      a platform for policymaking.       The Regulatory Accountability Act would upset the      constitutional balance betweenbranches of the government and      impose new burdens on an already cumbersome regulatory      process. In rulemaking, federal agenciesmust adhere to the      requirements of the statue being implemented, and are often      given a roadmap from From there,federal agencies      must also follow the robust procedural and analytical      requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act,      theRegulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform      Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional      ReviewAct,       The Regulatory Accountability Act adds more than 70 steps      to the regulatory process while giving corporate      interestsmore opportunities to influence and weaken      standards. It would require unnecessary Advance Notices for a      large number of rules,and impose unnecessary new evidentiary      standards as a condition of rulemaking. It would subject the      regulatory process tounneeded rounds of litigation.[[Page H328]]       The Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 will prevent      agencies from growing andaddressing new issues for      environmental, public health, workplace safety and consumer      financial security protections.

4913,topic-id,880,"Mr.President, earlier today the Senate moved forward with the President's nominee to head up the Office of Management and Budget, Congressman Congressman Mulvaney spent years representing the people of South Carolina and has been thoroughly engaged on budget issues during his time in the House of  He has highlighted the fact that the Federal Government is on an unsustainable fiscal path if nothing changes in Washington, DC, and that it is reckless to keep running up the Nation's credit card with trillions in more debt and unfunded liabilities, not to mention the immorality of passing down to the next generation the obligation of actually paying that money back.  So Congressman Mulvaney is actually, I think, a very good choice for this critical role, and I look forward to voting on his confirmation soon.                                 Trade  Mr.President, I want to weigh in briefly on the issue of trade. During the Presidential campaign and since then, there has been a lot of talk about international trade. It has led to a healthy debate about lopsided trade deals--whether bilateral trade deals or multinational trade deals actually are better--and how best to leverage trade to help American workers and consumers.  In my State of Texas, there is no question trade delivers in two ways. One, it helps Texas families stretch their paychecks by providing greater access to more affordable goods. That is a good thing. And two, it helps our farmers, our ranchers, our small businesses, and other manufacturers access more customers around the world.  Texas continues to lead the Nation as the top exporting State, and it has done so for about a decade now. It is one reason our economy has done better than the national economy in recent years. And it is estimated that Texas trade supports more than 1 million jobs currently.  But it is important to understand that our economic partnership with Mexico has been a key part of that success, and that is thanks, in part, to the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, the trade deal between the United States, Mexico, and  Our southern neighbor is our largest export market, with more than one-third of all Texas goods--including ag products and manufactured goods, to the tune of close to $92 billion a year--heading south of our border because of NAFTA and trade. Well, this may not be universally true around the country, but suffice it to say that in Texas, NAFTA has been a big success for our economy. And because Texas has been leading the Nation in terms of economic growth and job creation, I think it is fair to say that it has helped the Nation as a whole not recede into a recession with the anemic growth rates that we have seen since 2008.  It is not just that my State benefits from the deal. The agriculture industry across the country benefits greatly. Mexico is one of the biggest buyers of crops grown in the United States, like corn. In fact, Mexico is the third biggest export market for American agriculture.  NAFTA is not just critical to my State, but for those far away from the southern border, as well, like Ohio and Michigan, which export a majority of their goods to NAFTA partners. I think it is important to acknowledge the fact that roughly 6 million jobs in the United States depend on bilateral trade with  But here is the truth: The world looks a lot different today than it did 20 years ago when NAFTA was negotiated, and there is ample opportunity to work with our partners to craft a better deal for the United We can update it to be even more constructive and an even bigger driver of the U.economy.  Trade is essential to our economy, and I believe the administration agrees with me on that. In my conversations with Mr.Ross, who will head up the Department of Commerce, and others--the trade negotiator and the like--they all tell me that this administration is pro-trade, although they are skeptical of large multinational trade deals like the Trans-Pacific  We have also recently heard the President himself talk about the importance of our relationships with countries like Canada and During the visits of the Prime Ministers of[[Page S1176]]each of those countries in the last week, with both heads of State, the administration continues to stress the importance of robust trading partnerships. And the President has made it clear that he supports those.  I believe that good trade deals help everyone, so I want to be clear that the United States is not retreating from the global economy, as if we even could. With more than 95 percent of the world's consumers outside of our borders, our citizens rely too much on free trade and fair trade to turn inward and retreat.  Texas certainly proves that trade deals can help everyone from manufacturers to farmers, to small businesses, all of whom find more markets for the goods they make or grow. That, in turn, creates more jobs and provides greater access to more goods for consumers. And it is a good example for the broader U.economy as well.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

4931,topic-id,1398,"Mr.President, our Tax Code is a mess. No one voted for it, no one wants it, and no one likes it. I have said many times we should eliminate all of the special interest loopholes in the code and use that money to cut taxes for everyone, including American businesses. We want to encourage them to invest, grow, and create more jobs right here in  I know my colleagues are working on a tax bill, and I want to stress how much I support their efforts. I will, of course, withhold judgment on any proposal until I see the final text, but I also want to say today, I have reservations about one idea that is being considered. It is called a border adjustment tax. It sounds like something from Orwell's  Here is how it would work. We would cut taxes for corporations. To make up for the lost revenue, we would tax businesses whenever they bought something from another country. For instance, every time Ford bought an auto part from Canada, it would pay a 20-percent tax or every time your local grocery store bought bananas from Guatemala, it would pay a 20-percent tax. Whatever money businesses made from selling their products in other countries would be exempt. In other words, what all this would amount to is a 20-percent tax on imports. The proponents of this tax contend it would stop businesses from leaving our country because right now some are moving overseas to avoid paying our corporate tax rate, which is the highest in the modern industrial world. Under this proposal, it would not matter where you put your headquarters, you would be taxed according to what you bought, not where you put down your stake.  The hope is, this arrangement would mean more headquarters, more factories and the jobs that come with them staying right here in America, which of course is a desirable goal, no doubt, but I am not at all convinced this is the best way to do it. Consider this. It is estimated that this one change alone would produce something like $100 billion a year in additional tax revenue. That is a lot of money, and someone has to pay for it. I will tell you exactly who is going to pay: working Americans who have been struggling for decades. A tax on imports is a tax on things working folks buy every single day. I am not talking about caviar and champagne. I am talking about T-shirts, jeans, shoes, baby clothes, toys, and groceries.  I have heard from thousands of Arkansans who are already struggling just to get by. Why would we make the stuff they get at Walmart more expensive? Its defenders say the tax will not increase the cost of imports. What will happen, they say, is our exports will be cheaper because we no longer tax them so then more people overseas will buy our exports from us, which means the dollar itself will increase in value. That means imports will not be expensive because you will be able to buy them with a stronger dollar. So even with the tax added on, you will still come out right where you were before.  This logic reminds me of Orwell again: Some ideas are so stupid only an intellectual could believe them. This is a theory wrapped in speculation inside a guess. Nobody knows for sure what will happen. No one can know for sure because currency markets fluctuate daily based on millions of decisions and events. Just because an economist slaps an equation on a blackboard does not make it real so I am more than a little concerned these predictions will not pan out.  As the old joke goes, after all, economists have predicted nine of the last five recessions. But if that happens, it will not be economists and intellectuals and politicians in Washington and New York left holding the bag; working Americans will get stiffed again.  Finally, I want to say a word about jobs. One of the biggest reasons for fixing the Tax Code is that it would help create more jobs, but if we increase the cost of goods, people obviously can't buy as much, which will hurt retail sales and retail jobs too. Retail companies are the largest private sector employers in almost every Are we really going to impose a huge tax on the livelihood of so many Americans and say: Oh, don't worry. It will all work out in the end.  We have to take a hard look at this proposal right now. Therefore, while I support fundamental tax reform and commit to reserve judgment on any final bill until I read it, today I want to put on the record my serious concerns about a border adjustment tax. Many other Senators share those concerns. We most certainly will not keep our powder dry and see working American's railroaded with a precooked deal that raises their taxes and increases the price of the stuff they buy every single day.  It is February 15. By law, the President is required to submit a budget to Congress by the first Monday of this month. That was over a week ago. Now, being a new administration, we expect him to be a few weeks late as has typically happened in recent times. The difference this year, though, is that President Trump still does not have a budget director. We are 4 weeks into his Presidency, and we are only just now getting around to confirming his nominee.  For those of you keeping score at home, that is the longest delay in recent history. Every one of the last six Presidents had their budget director confirmed by a week's time--as in 7 days. In other words, what we are seeing is a deliberate act of obstruction. Here is the real problem. We have serious work to do. It is that much more difficult for the President to do his job when all he has is a headless horseman bureaucracy.  Senate Democrats might consider this payback. They might consider it their chance to audition for the 2020 Presidential primary, but the American people are the ones paying the price for this obstruction.  I want to say again, this is not a game. This is not a protest. This is our job. This is what the American people sent us to do. It is time we got down to business. In that spirit, I want to say a few words in support of the President's[[Page S1198]]nominee for the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick I don't have to cite or recite Mick's biography for many of you.  He has been representing the good people of South Carolina's Fifth District in the House of Representatives for more than 6 years now. Before that, he led an impressive career as what he called a serial entrepreneur, starting four different businesses. I hear some of them may have even succeeded.  He has worked in fields as varied as law, real estate, homebuilding, and restaurants. He is highly educated and very accomplished. I would like to point out, he is a friend of mine, a trusted confidant, someone whose advice and counsel I have often sought.  I can say with confidence, he will serve President Trump and the American people with dedication and distinction. I believe Mick will bring a needed voice to the President's Cabinet, a voice for fiscal responsibility after so many years of irresponsible sky-is-the-limit spending.  All that experience in the real economy gives him something more than a lengthy resume. He knows from personal experience what it takes to create jobs and create opportunities out of almost nothing. He knows the self-discipline it takes, the hard work, the perseverance. He knows what Americans have to go through every day just to earn an honest dollar. That is why he has been so protective of every taxpayer dollar ever put in his care. That is the kind of man we need as our next OMB  It is only when Washington appreciates what goes into making all of those taxpayer dollars that it will show the taxpayers the respect they deserve.

4883,topic-id,368,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution which would disapprove of the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule that was finalized in August of 2016.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires Federal contractors to be ``responsible,'' to have a satisfactory record of integrity, and business ethics.  The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule would require Federal contractors to self-report on violations of 14 fundamental Federal labor and nondiscrimination laws.  This includes laws like the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA; the Fair Labor Standards Act; the Family and Medical Leave Act; and the Civil Rights  These Federal laws apply to all businesses in the United States, and a vast majority of Federal contractors comply with them as well. Unfortunately, studies by the GAO, the Center for American Progress, and others show that there are a few bad apples that consistently violate these fundamental Federal labor laws, yet continue to be awarded Federal contracts.  That is just plain wrong. Americans' tax dollars should not go to contractors who persistently and willfully violate such laws.  It also puts contractors who do obey the law at an unfair disadvantage because they willingly bear the cost of compliance to provide safe and fair workplaces.  The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule would also improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Federal acquisition process by promoting healthy and productive workplaces.  As the final rule notes, ``Contractors that consistently adhere to labor laws are more likely to have workplace practices that enhance productivity and increase the likelihood of timely, predictable, and satisfactory delivery of goods and services.''  This rule should be a win-win. It helps the Federal Government ensure compliance with fundamental labor and nondiscrimination laws and, at the same time, improve the efficiency of the Federal contracting process.

5085,topic-id,400,"I thank the gentleman.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.5.  Before I go into that, let me be clear. After listening to the leader a minute ago, I thank all of the Federal employees whowork so hard and give so much and who are so often unseen, unnoticed, unappreciated, and unapplauded.  I oppose this unnecessary and potentially dangerous legislation in its entirety. However, I will focus my remarks on title Vof this bill, which is in the jurisdiction of the Oversight and Government Reform Title V, also known as the ALERTAct, is an attack on agency rulemaking, like the rest of this bill.  This title would prohibit the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs from taking into account benefits when providingestimating costs of proposed and final rules. That is not transparency. It is one side of the story.  This bill would also prevent a rule from taking effect until certain information is posted online for 6 months by theAdministrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory The only exceptions to this requirement would be if an agencyexempts the rule from the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act or if the President issues anexecutive order.  That is a 6-month delay in putting any rule in place no matter how big or how small. Right now, there are rules pending toprotect the public from pipeline accidents involving hazardous liquids--those are our constituents, by the way--and to protect theprivacy of patients' records. Again, those are our constituents. This bill would put an arbitrary 6-month moratorium on ruleslike these.  The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards, which is a coalition of over 150 labor, scientific, health and good governmentgroups, sent a letter on January 10, 2017, opposing H.5 to all Members of the House of  That letter read in part:       The ALERT Act is designed to impede the government's      ability toimplement critical new public health and safety      protections by adding a 6-month delay. This amounts to a 6-     month regulatorymoratorium even after the often lengthy      period required for developing and finalizing these      regulations.

This doughnut hole required seniors to pay full price for their prescriptiondrugs after they reach their catastrophic threshold.  Research found, because of this doughnut hole, seniors would put their health at risk because they could not afford to paythe prescriptions, which ultimately lead to higher healthcare costs. Because of the Affordable Care Act, this doughnut hole isbeing completely phased out of the Medicare part D prescription drug program by the year 2020.  Since the ACA passed in 2010, closing the doughnut hole has saved our seniors more than $23.5 billion on their prescriptiondrugs. We know this is working. Florida seniors enrolled in the program are now saving an average of $987 a year because ofclosing the loophole.                              {time}  1830  We know what $987 means to the average senior on We also know that if these coverage gap discounts disappeared,part D enrollees would have to pay $3,725 for the time period they are in the doughnut hole. This $3,725 represents nearly 15percent of a Medicare enrollee's income.  With too many Floridians and seniors across the Nation struggling to make ends meet, I strongly believe that Congress can domore to make sure we do not go backwards and reopen this doughnut hole. No one should ever have to choose between food ormedicine.

4930,topic-id,4213,"Mr.President, pending before the U.Senate is the nomination of Mick Mulvaney, a Congressman who is seeking to be the Director of the Office of Management and  If you were to ask the people of America about the Cabinet positions filled by the President, the one they probably would miss is the Office of Management and It turns out to be one of the more important positions, but it is not as well known historically as Treasury Secretary, Secretary of State, and Attorney It is an important job. It is one of the most consequential jobs because the Director of the Office of Management and Budget is responsible for preparing the President's budget, setting the priorities of the Federal budget, and overseeing the performance of Federal agencies. It is a big and challenging job.  Many other nominees for positions in the Cabinet are well known and have been debated on the floor of the Today I come to say a few words about the record of this Congressman, Mick Mulvaney, who is seeking this directorship of the Office of Management and It is a very interesting record.  It is not unusual for Members of the House and the Senate to have unusual positions on issues. I guess each one of us has something we believe intensely that other people question. When it comes to Congressman Mulvaney, there is a long litany of positions he has taken that are far out of the mainstream of either political party. Yet President Donald Trump decided this is the man, this is the person he wanted to head up his budgeting effort. This is the person he wants to set the priorities for spending in the United States of America during his  If you look at the record of Mick Mulvaney, you will find that he has had an eagerness to dictate large and draconian cuts across the Federal Government in some of our most important and most cherished programs. Let me tell you about a few that highlight his record in Each one of these that I will speak to, if advanced by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, would have far-reaching consequences on families and individuals across the United States, not only in the operation of government but also in the effectiveness of our Federal workforce.  To start with--and this, I think, is the right place to start--Congressman Mulvaney, who seeks the position of Director of the Office Management and Budget, has repeatedly led efforts to shut down the Federal When Mr.Mulvaney and the Republicans succeeded in shutting down the government for 16 days in 2013, it cost the American economy $20 billion. Do you remember that?  Rush Limbaugh got on his radio show and said: If they shut down the government, no one will even notice.  Guess what, Mr.They noticed.  All across America, working families paid the price for that foolish political act of shutting down the government. The real cost of the government shutdown is not just measured in dollars. The real cost is in hardships unnecessarily created, hardships for Federal employees who didn't receive their checks on a timely basis, hardships for people struggling to survive in America, who relied on programs like food stamps. We call them SNAP benefits now. They had their food in jeopardy and endangered because Congressman Mulvaney and his friends thought that a display of political power--shutting down the government--was the right recipe for  These government shutdowns delayed 2 million Federal workers from receiving their checks, real people with real families to feed. Congressman Mulvaney doesn't seem to care about these real-world consequences of a shutdown. Instead, he called the shutdown of the Federal Government ``good policy.'' Those are his words: ``good policy.''  Then, when we finally reached an agreement to reopen the government, he was one of the few Members of the House to vote against the compromise in reopening the government.  In recent years, he has repeated his calls. He is willing to shut down the government of the United States of America to defund Planned This man wants to craft our national budget, and he would shut down the government over one provision in that budget? That is what he said.  Time and again, he has taken extreme positions on the Federal budget. We have a standing tradition in the House and the Since not one of us can predict when the next natural disaster is going to occur, we try to help one another.  I have voted for funds during the course of my congressional career for disasters in probably every State in the union. Do you know why? Because I knew the day would come--and it did, several times during my tenure in the House and Senate--when there would be a natural disaster in my State, and we needed a helping hand, emergency disaster assistance. That is a tradition which has been around Congress--I can go back almost centuries to see it in past history.  Listen to what Congressman Mulvaney did. He tried to block emergency disaster assistance to States that desperately needed the help of the Federal Government in their recovery efforts. He offered a poison pill amendment to the Hurricane Sandy relief package that would have required across-the-board cuts in military spending--military spending--to pay for disaster relief from Hurricane Then he went further and said: Not just military spending, I want cuts in entitlement programs--Medicare, Let's cut the healthcare assistance for Americans to pay for that disaster. That is his idea of social justice.  Despite President Trump's campaign promises to rebuild the Nation's crumbling infrastructure, Congressman Mick Mulvaney has taken an extraordinary and extreme view. He wants to eliminate Federal funding for transportation projects. He cosponsored a bill that would slash the Federal gas tax. That is how we pay for repairing Federal roads and mass transit across He isn't interested in fixing the highway trust fund solvency problems. His solution is to bankrupt it.  This is the man who wants to write the budget for America? His extreme ideology would threaten billions of dollars that my State receives in Federal transportation funds. We put money into the Federal highway trust fund,[[Page S1195]]too, every time we buy a gallon of gas in He would cut back on the resources coming back to my State and others to repair the very roads we drive on.  He has consistently supported across-the-board cuts for the Department of Defense, regardless of those affected. Just a few minutes ago, Senator John McCain, the senior Senator from Arizona, came to the floor to announce that because of Congressman Mulvaney's positions on cuts in the military, he--Senator McCain--would oppose the appointment of Mulvaney as head of Senator McCain said that it is a rare day when he comes out against a Presidential nominee of his own party. But he thinks Mulvaney's record is worrisome, and I couldn't agree more. The positions that Congressman Mulvaney has taken are reckless and would jeopardize the economic security of working families and put our Nation and economy at risk.  Possibly one of the most troubling positions that Congressman Mulvaney has taken is the fact that he is opposed to the Federal Government spending funds for medical research. Last year when Congress was deliberating how to combat the Zika virus, Representative Mulvaney wrote this on his Facebook page: ``Do we really need government-funded research at all?''  Let's think about that for a moment. Do we really need government-funded medical research in the United States? Do we need the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and the Veterans' Administration investing in trying to find new cures for diseases?  Government-funded research in the Department of Defense has produced fascinating insights into the biology of breast cancer that have greatly impacted the treatment of that disease and saved lives in Look at the revolutionary Department of Defense-funded work that led to the development of the innovative drug Government-funded research, which Congressman Mulvaney does not believe we should do, at the National Institutes of Health has accomplished the following. It has cut the U.cancer death rate by 11 percent in women and 19 percent in men. And Congressman Mulvaney says: Do we really need to do that? Is that important? I would guess that his family, like every family in America, has a story to tell about cancer--what it has meant, the devastation it has created, the deaths that have resulted.  But Congressman Mulvaney doesn't get it. He just doesn't understand anything as basic as investing in medical research to save lives. HIV/AIDS is no longer a death sentence in I saw Magic Johnson just a few weeks ago at a farewell party for President I remembered the day in the House of Representatives when I was told that he had We assumed he would die in just a short period of time. But that was over 25 years ago. He has survived because of research that was done at the National Institutes of Health, and he is not alone. There are thousands just like him.  When I was a kid, polio was something every mother and father were frightened of. What in the world was happening? How could your child be infected with polio and end up being crippled for life? Our Republican leader here, Mitch McConnell, went through that in his childhood and has talked about that episode in his life and how devastating it was. He has had a full life since then, but he has overcome the problems of that disease. I remember as a kid in grade school, when they announced that our government research had come up with a vaccine that would protect kids from polio. That, to me, was a breakthrough, and one that I welcomed and our family welcomed.  Congressman Mulvaney questions whether or not medical research should continue, even in the light of the achievements in eradicating polio and small pox and other diseases in our country. These advances didn't just magically happen because of the miracle of the marketplace. They occurred because of sustained taxpayer investment in Federal medical research.  I will tell you this. If he wants to make a referendum in the Senate or the House on medical research a part of his budget debate, I welcome the challenge. I believe that Members of both political parties would stand up for medical research, despite Congressman Mulvaney's extreme positions.  So when someone asks if we really need government-funded medical research, the answer on behalf of cancer patients who are beating the disease, on behalf of HIV/AIDS patients who are living longer and normal lives, on behalf of all those families hoping and praying that some Federal researcher will come up with a breakthrough for Alzheimer's, for autism, or Parkinson's or diabetes--the answer, Congressman Mulvaney, is unequivocally, yes. America needs to invest in medical research. And the fact that you would question it really raises the question of your judgment.  Let me tell you another thing that he is for, which I think is the single most irresponsible budgetary position he has taken. He has been an opponent of raising the country's debt ceiling.  What is the debt ceiling? That is America's mortgage. That is the amount of debt we incur as a nation. It is a mortgage that is incurred for things that we have already spent money on. So when we come and vote for $600 billion for the Department of Defense and the intelligence agencies and we don't have enough money coming in taxes to pay for it, we have to extend America's mortgage to cover it. Congressman Mulvaney says that is the wrong thing to do--extending the debt ceiling of this country. While running for Congress, Congressman Mulvaney, who now wants to manage our Nation's budget, pledged he would never ever vote to raise the country's debt ceiling. He voted against it four different times.  In 2011, when we were just about to breach the debt limit and default on our national debt for the first time in the history of our country, Mulvaney was a leading voice in support of default. He called it a ``fabricated crisis,'' and accused both parties of ``fear mongering.''  I am not sure what is more disturbing--Mr.Mulvaney's willingness to default on our country's obligations, the full faith and credit of the United States, or his lack of appreciation for the devastating economic consequences which would follow. I can tell you what is at risk with that kind of reckless attitude toward our Nation's debt. What is at risk are the savings and investments and retirement accounts of ordinary Americans across the Mr.Mulvaney may be willing to gamble the full faith and credit of the United States; I am not. Forcing the Federal Government to default on the Nation's debt would harm the economy and affect the government's ability to make payments to Social Security and Medicare recipients, military personnel, veterans, Federal employees, defense contractors, State governments, and to the bondholders of the United States, here and overseas.  We would lose our credibility if Mr.Mulvaney had his way and allowed us to default on our national debt. We should not ever consider confirming an OMB Director who has repeatedly risked the economic security of our Nation to score political, rhetorical points.  Throughout his campaign, President Trump promised to protect Medicare and Social Security and make decisions that would ``benefit American workers and American families.'' That is a quote. However, instead of making good on the promise, President Trump has chosen a man to head the Office of Management and Budget who has led calls for devastating cuts to Federal programs that millions of Americans rely on every day.  Mr.Mulvaney has said he wants to ``end Medicare as we know it,'' and he has called Social Security a ``Ponzi scheme.'' He has called for raising the retirement age for Social Security to 70, from the 67 that it currently is. Well, 3 more years at work may not mean much to a Member of Congress, because we sit down a lot in these comfortable chairs and people bring us things when we need them. But 3 more years of working before you qualify for Social Security means something to a waitress, whose hips and ankles and knees have been bothering her for years, but she has no choice but to get up every morning, go to work, carry those trays, and try to bring enough money home to help a family. It means something to someone who works in a coal mine--I guarantee you that--3 more years at work, exposing yourself to the lung diseases and other things[[Page S1196]]that might come with the job. It means something to a truckdriver, spending days and nights on the road. It means something to people who have to move freight around. It is the kind of thing that means a lot to ordinary working people. It clearly doesn't mean anything to Congressman Three more years working, as far as he is concerned, is an acceptable alternative.  He wants to privatize Medicare and turn Medicare back into the loving arms of private health insurance companies, and let's see what seniors end up experiencing. Almost 60 million Americans now rely on In Congressman Mulvaney's point of view, the guarantee of Medicare would end. This is the man President Trump has chosen to head the budget for the United States of Mulvaney has called repeatedly for cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, including a ``cut, cap, and balance'' budget, which would cut each of these programs by 25 percent. When you say the word Medicaid, people have an image in their mind: Oh, that is health insurance for poor people. And that is generally correct, although it also covers disabled But do you know who the major recipients of Medicaid are in America? The largest single group of people receiving help from Medicaid are children--children in poor, low-income families who get medical care through The biggest expenditure for Medicaid is not children though. The biggest expenditure is for the elderly Americans who are living largely at institutional settings, in these care homes, nursing homes. Medicaid keeps them in that place with adequate medical care. So now comes Congressman Mulvaney and says: Let's just cut those by 25 percent. There is one good way to reduce Federal spending.  Really? So that means fewer immunizations for children. What does it mean for your mother or your grandmother in the nursing home when it is announced that we don't have enough money to cover the cost to keep her here in a good, safe, positive environment? For Congressman Mulvaney, it is just numbers on paper. For real families across America, it is the reality of life.  Much like our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Congressman Price, Representative Mulvaney wants to dramatically undermine the Medicare Program for our Nation's seniors. Let's look at what Medicare has meant to our country since it was created in 1965. Before Medicare, only 51 percent of Americans 65 and older had health care coverage. Nearly 30 percent lived in poverty. Today, 98 percent of seniors have health care, and less than 10 percent live below the poverty line. Has Medicare work? You bet it has. It has provided health insurance for seniors, and it has given people dignity and independence in their senior years--something that everyone should value. And, incidentally, the life expectancy of Americans has grown by 5 years since we created It is working. Medicare helps seniors, helps their families, and it helps But Congressman Mulvaney doesn't get it.  This man has been chosen by President Trump to write the budget of Why is Congressman Mulvaney so hell-bent on ending a program like Medicare that 98 percent of our Nation's seniors depend on? Well, I can tell you, if his comments on Medicare scare you, on Medicaid he is even worse. This program, combined with the Children's Health Insurance Program, ensures health coverage for 70 million One out of every five nationwide depend on It helps low-income families, pregnant women, children, and those with disabilities. Currently, if you qualify for Medicaid, you are guaranteed to get health coverage. Congressman Mulvaney thinks he has a better idea. He wants to change that.  Congressman Mulvaney wants to significantly cut the Federal funding for Medicaid and leave States to fend for themselves when it comes to caring for these 70 million Faced with less Federal funding, States would be forced to find ways to cut spending and save money. They might start Medicaid waiting lists or impose work requirements or slash benefits. At the end of the day, the result would be catastrophic.  I just spent the last weekend in Southern We had a roundtable down there to talk about the impact of the repeal of the Affordable Care These hospital administrators from smalltown hospitals came in to tell me that losing Medicaid reimbursement could force them to dramatically cut their workforce and maybe even face closure. Here is Congressman Mulvaney suggesting: Let's just do that across I wonder where he lives. I wonder if there are any small towns or rural areas near him. I wonder if he values those hospitals the way the people living in communities that I represent value them. These are not only lifelines for people who desperately need timely, professional medical care, but they are the source of the best jobs in the community. Congressman Mulvaney could care less: Let's just keep cutting on Medicaid and see what happens.  What will happen will be devastating.  Mr.Mulvaney isn't content with just throwing seniors off Medicare and low-income families off He wants to punish women by taking away their healthcare providers and inserting his own decisions into their medical decisions. Mr.Mulvaney has repeatedly attempted to defund Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide women and men with important cancer screenings, family planning, STD testing, and other important health care services.  The laws of the United States of America provide that not one penny can be given to Planned Parenthood for abortion services--not one penny under the law. Most people, if asked what percentage of the Planned Parenthood budget is actually spent on abortion services would get it wrong. The actual number is 3 percent. Ninety-seven percent of what Planned Parenthood does, in terms of family planning, cancer screening, STD screening, has no relation directly to abortion services, and that is compensated, but abortion services are not under the law. Congressman Mulvaney could care less. He would close down the sources of family planning in small towns and communities around  The concerns I have laid out today are just a few that I have about this nomination. The millions of hard-working Americans who believed President Trump's campaign promises, and as a champion for the most vulnerable, deserve far better than Congressman  There are real problems facing this Far too many people are struggling, and there is a lot of work to do. We cannot afford to risk our economic recovery, the retirement plans and savings of working Americans, the health of our children, the kind of care we want for our mothers and grandmothers--we cannot afford to risk them by appointing OMB Director Mick  I have no choice but to oppose Mick Mulvaney's nomination for Director of the Office of Management and  Mr.President, Mick Mulvaney is a founder of the House Freedom Caucus, which has made repeal of the Affordable Care Act--without a replacement--one of their main causes. This is not about good policy or the real consequences for people around the country. This is about ideology.  Mr.Mulvaney wants to rip health insurance away from nearly 30 million people and deny people the important consumer protections they have come to depend upon. He would once again allow insurers to impose pre-existing condition exclusions and discriminate based on gender and cut off coverage when someone gets sick and needs it most.  His answer to fixing our health care system is ``free-market competition'' and ``crackdown on frivolous lawsuits. Those might make good talking points, but they will not stabilize our insurance market and help people in need.  The Illinois Hospital Association estimates that Republican plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in the loss of up to 95,000 jobs in Illinois--in hospitals, doctor's offices, construction, real estate, and beyond.  Over the last month, I have been going around my State, meeting with hospitals and providers, talking to them about what repeal would mean. They are worried.  You see, Illinois hospitals and health systems generate nearly $90 billion in the State and local economies each year, and 1 in 10 jobs in Illinois is in[[Page S1197]]health care. Hospitals are vitally important to our State's economy and vitally important to patients in need.  Don't just take my word for it, Franklin Hospital CEO, Jim Johnson told me:       In our community, at the time that the hospital in West      Frankfort closed, we [Franklin Hospital in Benton] managed to      stay open . . . they're just eaten up that they don't have a      hospital anymore. It's incredible what the loss of a hospital      can do to a small community. And I'm down there talking to      those guys every day because naturally I like them to use our      hospital . . . but those conversations, it has just torn this      community apart.  In Illinois and nationwide, rural hospitals would be particularly hurt by Mr.Mulvaney and Republicans' prescription for chaos.  In Illinois, 62 of our 102 counties are rural. We have 51 Critical Access Hospitals, which are the hubs of their communities. Rural hospitals typically are more reliant on Medicaid and Medicare, and have tighter operating margins.  So what has the ACA meant for them? In States that expanded Medicaid, like Illinois, rural hospitals have seen greater financial stability thanks to the decrease in uncompensated care--or charity care--costs.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate in rural communities has dropped by nearly 40 percent. This is not only great for those individuals obtaining insurance, it is also great for the rural hospitals who are now getting paid for the health services they provide.  Community Health & Emergency Services CEO Fred Bernstein told me:       You can look at Cairo as the ghost of the future. Because      there is not much left that we have to lose . . . We've lost      the only grocery store, and the only drug store in If      this Affordable Care Act thing isn't resolved and if we go to      block grant in the Medicaid program, there's not going to be      any resolution to those problems down there. We are not going      to be able to stay open. At least 72-74 percent of my      patients depend upon Medicaid . . . Without the expansions of      Medicaid that we've already seen, and without some of the      subsidies that those who can get some insurance will get to      keep that insurance, there's not going to be the ability to      afford any care for most of the people we serve.  Since 2009, the number of rural hospitals in Illinois operating in the red has decreased by 46 percent. Put another way, 16 rural hospitals in Illinois are now on much more solid financial footing thanks to the  I yield the floor.

4904,topic-id,445,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague and ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, Mr.Scott, for yielding.  I stand here in opposition to this resolution, which looks to undo rules that provide safety and fairness in the workplace.  The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule speaks for itself. It ensures that contractors entrusted with taxpayer dollars cannot exploit their workers and that repeated lawbreakers do not get a competitive advantage. This standard does not impose extra regulations on contractors. It simply requires that they follow the law.  These laws make sure women are paid the same wages for the same work. They make sure that employers are paying a fair rate for overtime work. They protect employees with disabilities. And they protect workers who are victims of sexual assault or sexual harassment by ensuring those individuals have an opportunity to be heard.  A 2013 Senate report found that government contractors are often among the worst violators of the workplace safety, wage, and hour laws. Nearly one in three companies with the worst safety and wage violations are Federal contractors. Americans working for Federal contractors lose up to $2.5 billion each year to violations of minimum wage laws alone. This is unacceptable and exactly why this order was executed--to protect workers.  We have a duty to our constituents, and this rule rightfully asks the Federal Government to take another look at contractors who have violated labor laws before awarding a contract. By upholding this order, we can continue to ensure that taxpayers get a fair deal for their money, something my Republican colleagues certainly should be in favor of.  Some Republicans will claim that this order creates a so-called blacklist by preventing companies from receiving Federal contracts. However, the opposite is true. The order, in fact, provides new tools for contractors to come into compliance with the law. This order is in the interest of the people and our constituents who we were sent here to represent. Rolling back these protections would demonstrate that we would rather side with employers who cut legal corners by not paying a fair wage than with our constituents who work day in and day out to provide for their families.  Not only will rescinding this rule hurt our constituents, but it would also hurt law-abiding companies by forcing them into unfair competition with companies that cut corners and knowingly violate the law. As we look to invest in our country's infrastructure, I cannot think of a more important time to ensure that employees working for Federal contractors are treated fairly. This rule is an important safeguard that protects employees, and its rollback will be a disgrace.

We can all agree that our Nation is facing some serious challenges. From increasing opportunity in an evolving economy to keeping our families safe from threats at home and abroad, the list in front of this body is heavy enough, and the last thing we need is to make that problem-solving even tougher. A statement made on the Senate floor last week offered a stark message: it is simply not possible to exist as a nation when half of its citizens hate the other half. If we are willing to end friendships or block our family members because of Facebook posts, we are not heading in the right direction.  Despite the incredible responsibility entrusted to each of us by those whom we represent, this Congress has not been immune to the hardening of political division. However, we must not accept our current discourse as the new normal.  Yet there is hope.

4920,topic-id,776,"Mr.President, as I did last week and as I will continue to do until he is confirmed, I rise to support the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Judge Gorsuch is an accomplished, mainstream jurist. I look forward to helping make sure he receives an up-or-down vote here on the Senate floor.  After meeting with Judge Gorsuch and learning more about his judicial philosophy, I continue to be impressed by his humble respect for the law and by his commitment to service.  Before the Judiciary Committee begins our hearings, I want to highlight aspects of his jurisprudence that qualify him to serve on our Nation's highest Court and make him an ideal candidate to fill such a consequential position.  Earlier this month I spoke about his fitness to fill Justice Scalia's seat, as well as his respect for the separation of powers. Today I would like to focus on his approach to religious freedom.  I have always supported religious freedom as a universal principle. It doesn't matter if we are defending our own First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion here at home or standing up for the religious freedoms of people under repressive regimes abroad, our country has always valued the right of individuals to practice their faith as they please.  Just as religious freedom is part of our national character, it also provides insight into the character and judicial philosophy of a prospective justice. When I had the privilege of meeting with Judge Gorsuch last week, I asked him about his thoughts on religious freedom. I was struck by his ability to plainly articulate his understanding of the law and the He explained his religious liberty opinions by telling me that he simply went ``where the law led him.'' His explanation was indicative of his fundamental approach to interpreting the law. Judge Gorsuch doesn't make the law; he follows the law. He reads the Constitution as the Framers understood it. He interprets laws the way they were written.  Lately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been vocal about the importance of respecting our independent judiciary. I couldn't agree more. They have decried the perils of discriminating on the basis of religious belief. Well, they are in luck. The Supreme Court nominee before us would be a staunch defender of independent courts and religious freedom. All they have to do is help us confirm him.  I don't blame them for wanting to do their homework on a Supreme Court nominee. They should, as should we all. They will find that studying Judge Gorsuch's record will make for enjoyable reading.  On the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Gorsuch has authored a number of judicial opinions respecting the fundamental principles of religious liberty. His most notable was a concurring opinion in the Hobby Lobby case. In this landmark legal case interpreting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Judge Gorsuch ruled that the Federal Government cannot force individuals to assist in conduct that violates their deeply held religious convictions. I note that this law used to be noncontroversial. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was introduced by Senators Ted Kennedy and then Congressman Chuck It was passed almost unanimously in 1993 and signed into law by President Bill  In his concurrence, Judge Gorsuch wrote: ``The [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] doesn't just apply to protect popular religious beliefs: it does perhaps its most important work in protecting unpopular religious beliefs, vindicating this nation's long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance.''  Religious tolerance--that is what our country stands for, and that is what Judge Gorsuch stands for. Judge Gorsuch's position was later vindicated by the Supreme The Court agreed that it is the government's job to protect an individual's ability to practice their religion, not to instruct them on how to practice their religion.  In closing, let me reiterate that I believe Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream jurist who will uphold the Constitution to ensure justice for all, regardless of an individual's religious beliefs or which administration is in power. As someone who embraces religious freedom, it is a privilege to support and confirm a judge like Neil Gorsuch, who respects this central constitutional principle. As I have said before, and I will say again, Judge Gorsuch deserves fair consideration by those who serve in this body, and he deserves an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. He should be confirmed overwhelmingly, and I am confident he will be.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

4885,topic-id,568,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for yielding time.[[Page H909]]  Mr.Speaker, we are here today to stand up for workers, taxpayers, and small businesses.  We all agree employers who do business with the Federal Government should be held to high standards, and their employees deserve strong protections. That is why for decades the Federal Government has had a system in place to deny contracts to employers who violate Federal labor laws.  Time and again, Republicans in Congress urged the Obama administration to enforce the current system to ensure workers receive fair pay and safe workplaces.  Instead, the previous administration did the exact opposite. It went in search of a problem that doesn't exist. It took its eye off the ball, and we are here today to demand better.  The Obama blacklisting rule empowers government agencies to deny employers Federal contracts for alleged violations of various Federal labor laws and similar State laws. That is right. Under this rule, bureaucrats can determine employers are guilty until proven innocent, and then deny them the ability to do business with the Federal  This is one important reason why a Federal district judge recently blocked implementation of the rule because it would have a chilling effect on the due process rights of American citizens. But that is not the only reason why we are here today. Rather than streamline the procurement process to better protect taxpayers and workers, the Obama administration added new layers of red tape on to a system plagued by delays and inefficiencies. Simply put, this rule is a bureaucratic nightmare. It turns our already complex Federal procurement process into a convoluted regulatory maze.  Despite what our Democrat colleagues will claim, this rule will actually hurt workers by making a system designed for their protection less efficient. Law-abiding small-business owners, the backbone of our Nation's economy, will be less inclined to bid on Federal contracts.  As a result, we will see less competition in the Federal contracting process. With less competition, hardworking taxpayers will be forced to pay more for goods and services provided to the U. Perhaps most concerning is the threat this rule poses to our national security. Higher costs and a delayed contracting process will jeopardize the resources our Armed Services depend on to keep our Nation safe. With men and women currently stationed in harm's way, this is simply unacceptable.  If workers, taxpayers, and small businesses stand to lose, then who stands to gain?  The answer is Big Union leaders often file frivolous legal complaints to gain leverage against employers. This is just one more partisan rule that stacks the deck in favor of union leaders.  The facts are clear: this rule is fatally flawed. It is not in the best interest of workers, small-business owners, our military or hardworking taxpayers. It is also unnecessary, but you don't have to take my word for it.  Last October, our colleagues in the Congressional Progressive Caucus--Representatives Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva said: ``The Department of Labor has full authority under current law to hold Federal contractors accountable.''  I could not agree more. In fact, that is what Republicans have been saying all along.  I urge my colleagues to stand up for workers, small-business owners, taxpayers, and our national security by supporting this commonsense resolution. Then let's work together to ensure existing policies are enforced and workers have the protections they deserve.

5017,topic-id,787,"Mr.Speaker, I am rising today to urge my colleagues to support H.1227, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act, which I have introduced with my Republican colleague, a fellow Army veteran and former prosecutor from the State of Virginia, Congressman Tom Garrett, where we are seeking to address our outdated and widely problematic marijuana laws by federally decriminalizing marijuana.  FBI reports have shown that, in 2011 alone, an individual in the United States was arrested for marijuana use, sale, or possession every 42 seconds--every 42 seconds--mostly in poor and minority communities. Our current laws are turning everyday Americans into criminals, sending them to jail, ruining their lives, tearing apart families, and wasting huge amounts of taxpayer dollars to arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate people for marijuana use, a drug that has been proven time and time again to be far less dangerous than alcohol both for individual consumers as well as for the people around them.  Donald Abrams, who is chief of oncology at San Francisco General Hospital, has talked about how, in the 37 years that he has worked and served as a physician, the number of patients that he has admitted to his hospital with marijuana complications is zero. The number of patients that he has admitted due to alcohol use is ``profound.''  So, rather than actually helping people, our current laws are turning them into criminals, forever impacting their future and the future of their families. Over the years, we have spent hundreds of billions of dollars locking people up for nonviolent marijuana offenses, creating strain within our criminal justice system, and clogging court calendars, resulting in further overcrowding of our prisons.  Now, just a few weeks ago, I had the chance to go and visit a number of our prisons and jails in Hawaii, where I saw firsthand the crumbling infrastructure, the extreme overcrowding and facilities in dire need of upgrades, as well as the shortage of services that are actually needed to help rehabilitate people and reduce our recidivism rates.  So whether you personally think that marijuana use is good or bad, whether you would choose to use marijuana or not, the question is: Should we really be sending people to jail and turning them into criminals for it? The answer is no. The fiscal impacts and the social impacts of our current policy are having devastating ripple effects on individuals and our communities and are only continuing to perpetuate the problem.  For example, the contradiction that we see currently between State and Federal laws on marijuana has created a serious problem for many of our local businesses. I have talked with local bankers in my home State of Hawaii who expressed great frustration, and even confusion, about the contradiction between our laws with the fact that even though our State of Hawaii has legalized and authorized marijuana dispensaries to grow, process, and dispense medical marijuana, Federal law prohibits banks and credit unions from offering any type of financial services to both businesses and individuals whose financial transactions have anything to do with marijuana.  So what this means in practical terms is that our State-recognized and licensed medical marijuana dispensary owners as well as their employees can't open a bank account. They can't get a loan from our local bank. The businesses, literally, have to hold thousands, or even millions, of dollars from their transactions and have to conduct their transactions in cash. Businesses that provide services to these medical marijuana dispensaries are also unable to access financial services due to the gaps between Federal and State law.  So as we look at ways that we need to update our outdated drug policies and the need for us to reform a very broken criminal justice system, we need to take into account the growing body of evidence that suggests the medicinal benefits of marijuana, including, preventing epileptic seizures, reducing anxiety, and even halting the growth of cancer cells.  However, the FDA still currently classifies marijuana as a schedule I drug, basically saying that marijuana is just like heroin, LSD, and MDMA, ignoring the fact that at least 28 States, including my home State of Hawaii, have already accepted the medical use of marijuana under State law.  In addition to passing H.1227, we need to require the FDA to remove marijuana from schedule I based on State-accepted medical use. These reforms that we are calling for in this bipartisan bill are common sense and they are long overdue, long overdue changes that will help to reduce the strain on our criminal justice system, create certainty and reduce contradictions and confusion between State and Federal law, and update those Federal laws to actually meet the needs and progress that States are making across the country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2246.txt,2122,REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACTOF 2017,2017.0,21.0,January

We have to repeal the mandates and taxes of ObamaCare and make sure no one falls through the cracks.  Finally, we have to reform our Tax It is far too long and complicated. We have to cut the tax rate from a maximum of 15 to 20 percent.  These policies will jump-start the American economy from a stagnant growth rate to more than 4 percent GNP growth rate.

5074,topic-id,556,"Mr.President, I wish to request that the U.Government officially recognize the last week in March as the Week on the Status of Black During the week of March 27, 2017, as part of Women's History Month and in honor of the United Nations Declaration designating 2015 as the Decade of Afro-Descendants, this week marks the perfect occasion on which to begin an annual recognition and celebration of Black women's contributions to American society.  Black women have long gone above and beyond the call of duty in their contributions to American society through civic engagement, high voter turnout, and serving as leaders in their communities. Even in the face of grave oppression throughout our Nation's history, Black women have continued to stand strong and contribute to the well-being of their families, communities, and our country as a whole. A recognition of the Week on the Status of Black Women by the Trump administration and Congress would send a clear message that the Federal Government recognizes the unique struggles and achievements of Black women in  Black women have consistently played a leading role in shaping our Nation's history, often behind the scenes and with little recognition. Harriet Tubman escaped slavery and bravely returned to the enslaved South over a dozen times to lead her people to freedom on the Underground A century later, Rosa Parks witnessed the oppression of her fellow Black women and took an active role in organizing the Montgomery Bus Boycott, while also taking up Black women's sexual harassment claims. Today, a Black woman, Carla Hayden, is our Nation's Librarian of Recognition of the Week on the Status of Black Women would honor the sacrifices of women such as Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks, who paved the way for so many Black women in public service, business, and other industries today.  Yet even as Black women throughout our Nation's history have been leaders in American civic life, Black women today still continue to face many undue burdens. No one in America should have to choose between earning a paycheck and taking care of their family, but too many Black women who serve as primary family breadwinners are forced to make this painful choice. Black women continue to earn less than their male counteiparts and also less than women who are not Black women remain at the economic margins of society, and we all have a responsibility to help fix that.  This year, a coalition of organizations advocating for the well-being of women and communities of color will partner to elevate the stories, histories, and realities of Black women's lives. Each day of the week, starting on March 27 and continuing through March 31, will focus on a different challenge Black women face in society today, ranging from disproportionate experience with police violence to discriminatory media representation. Exploring these issues and acknowledging the centrality of Black women to our history and social fabric, along with recognizing the unique intersection of gendered and racialized inequities they face, is critical. As we continue to work to extend equal rights to all Americans, we must ensure that Black women are a leading part of this movement.

5078,topic-id,1496,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, it is a new day in For 8 years, the Obama administration has brought us one thing in response to theNation's need for recovery from hard times--failure.  Bold, innovative measures to unleash American freedom, opportunity, and resourcefulness could have brought prosperity'sreturn after the Great Recession, just as under Ronald Reagan following his era's recession.  But the Obama administration responded differently, with measure after overreaching measure, through regulation, taxes, andspending. It was consumed by the folly of trying to force transformation from the American people through command and controlfrom Everywhere it went, it sought to choose the winners and losers.  When Washington tries to choose the winners and losers, we all lose. And lose we have. We have a national debt of $20trillion thanks to the outgoing administration's blowout spending. We have an economy that for 8 years has failed to produceenough good, new, full-time jobs to sustain growth and restore dignity to the unemployed. We[[Page H324]]have 92 million Americansoutside the workforce, a level not seen since the Carter years, and nearly $2 trillion of American wealth is commandeered eachyear to be spent as Washington bureaucrats see fit, through runaway regulation.  But it is a new day in An incoming administration promises a new approach to make America great again. Central tothat approach is regulatory reform. The Obama administration abused regulation to force its will on the American people. Theassembling Trump administration promises to wipe out abusive regulation, freeing Americans to innovate and prosper once more.Today's legislation will give this new administration the tools.  The heart of today's bill, the Regulatory Accountability Act, title I, restores to the people the true right to be heard byWashington's regulators. It commands Washington bureaucrats to listen to the facts and ideas offered by the people and to followthem when they are better than the bureaucracy's own. It calls on regulatory agencies to achieve the benefits Congress hascalled on them through statutes to achieve. But it gives the people full opportunities to offer fresh alternatives for doing soand to vet with the agencies the facts and ideas that work and those that don't.  After the public has fully contributed its say, agencies must choose the lowest cost alternative proven to work, achievingthe needed benefits but rejecting unneeded costs. That leaves resources free to generate the benefits, create the jobs, andyield the higher wages only the private sector, through hard work and ingenuity, can achieve.  The other titles of the bill strongly buttress this reform.  Title II, the Separation of Powers Restoration Act, wipes out judicial deference to agency interpretations of statutes andregulations and restores to our system of checks and balances the rule Justice Marshall declared in Marbury v. Madison that ``itis emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is''--not the bureaucracy. When title II islaw, our courts will no more be rubber stamps for runaway regulatory interpretations that burst the bounds of what Congresstruly intended through statutes.  Title III, the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, provides teeth to existing law written to promptregulatory agencies to tailor flexibility for small businesses into their rules. Small businesses have fewer resources to complywith Washington's mandates. They need flexibility to survive. The terms of existing law for too long have been ignored byWashington bureaucrats. Title III assures the law will no longer be ignored, resulting in freedom and flexibility for America'ssmall businesses, which create the lion's share of new jobs in this country and are pillars of communities across this land.  Title IV prevents one of the most egregious of bureaucrats' regulatory abuses: the promulgation of new rules that imposeover a billion dollars in annual compliance costs, which must then be complied with even while meritorious litigationchallenging their issuance proceeds in court. Title IV, the REVIEW Act, eliminates this abuse, forcingagencies to stay their billion-dollar rules administratively if they are timely challenged in court.  And in titles V and VI of the bill, the ALERT Act and the Providing Accountability Through Transparency Act, thislegislation delivers much-needed, greater transparency for the public about what new regulations agencies are developing andproposing so they can better prepare to comment on what is proposed, shape what is promulgated, and comply with final rules.  With the help of these reforms, we can truly make America more competitive again, put Americans back to work, and freeAmerica's entrepreneurs to innovate and launch more exciting new products and services again.

I would also like to highlight a few Members whose work is inside this bill. First, Congressman Marino, CongressmanRatcliffe, Chairman Chabot, and Congressman Luetkemeyer have all done a tremendous amount of work to make thisbill here today, and I appreciate that.  Mr.Chairman, we have a grave problem in our Federal It undermines our Constitution, it contradicts the will ofthe people, and it is a deadweight on our economy destroying American jobs and costing billions of dollars per year in paperworkand lost opportunities. I am talking about the duplicative and unforgiving Federal bureaucratic state.  But before I discuss the dangers that an overzealous bureaucracy poses to our country, I want to be clear that the House hasalready made great progress. We are engaged in a two-step approach: first, to change the structure of Washington that deprivesthe people of their power; and second, to repeal specific harmful regulations. We will get started on the second part early nextmonth.  We have already passed two bills last week to change Washington's structure, the Midnight Rules Relief Act and the Today, we will pass the third, the Regulatory Accountability This requires agencies to choose the least costly optionavailable to do what they are charged to do and prohibits large rules from going into effect while they are still beingchallenged in court. It also ends something called Chevron deference where courts automatically bend to the agency'sinterpretation of the rules. Under the current standard, that means the agency will win almost every single time in thecourtroom and the people lose.  These three bills are about more than stopping bad regulations from being made. They are about changing the process inWashington that systemically prioritizes government over the[[Page H329]]common good instead of making government serve the commongood.  Mr.Chairman, our Nation is based on a principle that power ultimately comes from the people. Elections are the greatfoundation of our Republic, and, as we saw so clearly this last November, through them, the people can make their voices heard.But something has changed. Some of the most significant decisions in Washington, those that most affect the lives of the public,are made by those who don't stand for election.  What happens when the EPA imposes rules that deprive people of their property rights, when the Department of Health andHuman Services tries to force nuns to violate their religion, or when the VA perpetuates a system that lets veterans die whilethey wait for their care? The people can't vote out bureaucrats who write rules at the EPA or the Department of Health and They can't vote out bad leaders of the  These bureaucrats know it. They know they aren't accountable to the people even as they exercise great power. Withoutelections, the people lose. Washington is brimming with executive employees devoted to preserving the status quo.  Then there is a revolving door of high-level Federal employees who head to major consulting firms and lobbying arms toinfluence the very agencies they came from. This breeds thousands of regulations that further enrich the connected andpowerful--sometimes at the great expense of the average                              {time}  1415  It is our economy and the American workers who suffer the most. Federal regulations written and enacted by thesebureaucracies impose a burden of about $1.89 trillion every year. That number is hard to make sense of or to even imagine. Itcomes to, roughly, $15,000 per U.household, or 10 percent of the American  The Obama administration alone has written regulations that require over 583 million hours to comply with. That is anaverage of nearly 5 hours of paperwork for every single full-time employee in The Federal Register is now the length of80 King James  When bureaucrats and agency heads cannot be held accountable and when they keep their jobs regardless of corruption,incompetence, waste, fraud, abuse, or the backroom deals they make with special interests, that is the problem. That is theswamp, and we need to drain it.  There is a reason the House is restructuring Washington first. It is that we made a commitment to the American people thatwe would drain the swamp.

The facts are plain, the conclusion is clear: the rampant tide of unchecked, unbalanced Federal regulation is overwhelmingjob creators and households all across this Thanks to Washington's endless excess of regulations, hardworking Americansface higher prices, lower wages, fewer jobs, and fewer new business starts; and America as a whole is less competitive, lessinnovative, and less prosperous.  Federal regulations now impose an estimated burden of an amazing $1.89 trillion per year. That burden is burying America'sjob creators and suffocating job opportunities. It equals roughly $15,000 per U.household, over 10 percent of America's GDP,and more than the GDP of all but eight countries in the world.  The Obama administration set new records for numbers and effects of major regulations, over 600 in total, with an average of81 per year. That is roughly one every 3 working days. Through just August 2016, these rules had economic effects of over $740billion and imposed 194 million paperwork burden-hours; and this only built upon the insufficiently checked regulation alreadyimposed by previous administrations.  This problem must be solved, and this bill is the number one solution to this problem.

5115,topic-id,260,"Mr.Chairman, if Congress is effectively to rein in the runaway administrative state, a crucial part of theplan must be to overturn, legislatively, the doctrines of judicial deference to agencies' interpretations of the statutes andregulations they administer. These doctrines, founded in the Supreme Court's decision in Chevron v. NRDC and Auer v. Robbins,have, over the years, turned the courts far too much into a rubberstamp rather than a vigorous check on the self-servingtendencies of agencies to interpret the law to expand their own power.  Title II of the bill, the Separation of Powers Act, delivers this legislative reversal of Chevron and There is onething, though, that still needs to be added to that portion of the bill; that is language to check the potential that once theyare restored--the full interpretive powers that rightfully belong to them--our Article III courts will not engage in judicialactivism.  To put a point on it, judges must not be allowed to use the Separation of Powers Act as a license to interpret ambiguousstatutes always to expand agency power. My amendment, therefore, succinctly but powerfully provides just that. It prohibitscourts from reading ambiguities in statutes to contain implicit delegation of legislative rulemaking authority to agencies orfrom reading those ambiguities expansively to extend agency power.  Although it failed in its task, the Chevron doctrine was originally crafted to help check that kind of judicial activism. Aswe end the failed Chevron experiment, we should make sure we do not go back to judicial activism. I urge my colleagues tosupport this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

5116,topic-id,2659,"Mr.Chairman, I include in the record a list of organizations supporting H.5.  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.[[Page H345]]                           Agricultural Retailers Association,                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.       To AllMembers of the U.House of Representatives: On      behalf of the Agricultural Retailers Association (ABA), I am      writing to urgea vote in support of H.5, the ``Regulatory      Accountability Act'' sponsored by Representative Bob      Goodlatte (R-VA). Thislegislation includes a number of      important provisions designed to reform the Federal      rulemaking process.       All stakeholdershave a right to fair, open, and transparent      rulemaking that respects the proper role of the states and      the intent of Congress.For decades, there have been Executive      Orders issued from both Republican and Democrat      Administrations highlighting theimportance of an open,      transparent, and fair regulatory process. H.5 is an      important step forward in codifying the principlesthat      Presidents of both parties have issued in Executive Order      12004 (Issued in Match 1978), Executive Order 12291 (Issued      inFebruary 1981), Executive Order 12866 (Issued in September      1993), Executive Order 13132 (Issued in August 1999), and      ExecutiveOrder 13563 (Issued in January 2011).       Some of the reforms in H.5 include provisions such as      requiring federal agencies touse less costly regulations,      rather than more costly proposals, to obtain a stated      objective; requiring federal agencies toexplain how their      proposed regulations would impact small business owners,      their employees, and customers; prohibiting any newrules with      a significant economic impact from taking effect until      litigation against such proposal has been fully      settledwithout impacting existing regulations; and requiring      Federal agencies to publish mandatory transparency reports.       CollinPeterson (D-MN) plans to offer an amendment on      the floor of the U.House of Representatives to prohibit      agencies from usingsocial media to sway public opinion in      favor of a pending agency proposal. This common-sense      amendment is necessary to preventactions taken by federal      agencies such as the U.Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA) that the General Accountability Office(GAO) found took      unlawful actions during its `Waters of the United States''      (WOTUS) proposed rulemaking. ARA urges all Housemembers to      vote in favor of the Peterson amendment and to vote ``Yes''      on final passage of H.R, 5.           Sincerely,                                             Gupton,                                            Senior Vice President,     Public Policy &                                  ____                              American Farm Bureau Federation,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Rep.: The House of Representatives will soon take up      H.5 for debateand a vote. This measure contains a number      of important elements that are designed to improve the      Federal rulemaking process.American Farm Bureau urges all      members to vote in favor of this legislation.       For decades, presidents of both parties haveissued      Executive Orders and Memoranda underscoring the importance of      a regulatory process that is open, transparent andfair:       President Carter stipulated in EO 12044 that regulations      should not impose unnecessary burdens on theeconomy.       President Reagan issued EO 12291 in February 1981 to assure      that least-cost alternatives would be used in      regulatorydecision-making.       President Clinton affirmed that regulations should maximize      net benefits (EO 12866, September 1993). Laterin his      Administration, President Clinton issued EO 13132 reaffirming      the importance of federalism and respecting the rights      ofstates.       President Obama underscored the importance of sound science      in his Memorandum of March 2009. He also reaffirmedPresident      Clinton's EO 12866 when he issued EO 13563.       We understand that an amendment to H.5 will be offered      on the floorby Peterson to prohibit agencies from using      social media to sway public opinion in favor of a pending      agency proposal. Thisamendment stems directly from EPA's      conduct in its `waters of the US' (WOTUS) rulemaking, conduct      found unlawful by the GeneralAccountability Office and      scrupulously detailed in a report released by the House      Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,``Politicization      of the Waters of the United States Rulemaking.'' We strongly      support the Peterson amendment and urge allmembers to vote in      favor of its adoption.       All stakeholders--farmers, ranchers, environmentalists,      academics, agency staff, andthe general public--have a right      to a rulemaking process that is fair, open, transparent,      respectful of the role of states in ourFederal system, and      faithful to the intent of H.5 is an important      step in codifying principles that Presidents ofboth parties      have enunciated for decades. This legislation deserves      strong, bipartisan support.       We urge all members to votein favor of the Peterson      amendment and to vote ``Yes'' on final passage of H.5.           Sincerely,                                                      ZippyDuvall,                                      ____                     Associated Builders and Contractors,Inc.,                                  Washington, DC, January 5, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of Associated Builders and      Contractors (ABC), a national construction industry      tradeassociation with 70 chapters representing nearly 21,000      members, I am writing in support of the Regulatory      Accountability Act of2017 (H.5) introduced by Bob      Goodlatte (R-VA). ABC supports this legislation, which would      reform the AdministrativeProcedures Act and strengthen      existing checks on federal agencies, allowing for more cost-     effective regulations through a moretransparent process.       As builders of our communities and infrastructure, ABC      members understand the value of standards andregulations      based on solid evidence, with appropriate consideration paid      to implementation costs and input from affectedbusinesses.      ABC strongly supports comprehensive regulatory reform which      includes across-the-board requirements for departmentsand      agencies to appropriately evaluate risks, weigh costs, and      assess benefits of all regulations. H.5 is an excellent      stepin regulatory reform as it ensures more accountability      from federal agencies and greater stakeholder transparency.       Today,federal regulatory agencies wield incredible power      through rulemaking. They have grown adept at using procedural      loopholes inorder to accomplish narrowly-focused goals. These      agencies operate relatively unchecked and unsupervised,      especially during theearly stages of the regulatory process.      They often disregard and circumvent the will of Congress and      the American public byissuing regulations with poor or      incomplete economic cost-benefit forecasting or other data      analysis, instead of using the bestand most accurate data      that could have created more practical, sustainable rules and      regulations.       Consequently, someregulations that have limited or      questionable benefit result in crippling costs for companies      and often no serious considerationis given for more practical      alternatives. For the construction industry, these      regulations routinely translate into higher costsand are      passed along to the consumer.       Ultimately, these costs impact our industry's ability to      expand and hire more workers.It is particularly alarming that      small businesses, which comprise the vast majority of the      industry, are disproportionatelyaffected by this      irresponsible approach to regulation.       Thank you for your attention on this important matter and      we urge theHouse to pass the Regulatory Accountability Act of      2017.           Sincerely,                                           Kristen Swearingen,                                      Vice President ofLegislative     & Political                                  ____                                            The Associated General                                        Contractors ofAmerica,                                  Arlington, VA, January 10, 2017.     Re Vote ``YES'' on the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017,          H.R.5.     Paul Ryan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear RepresentativeRyan: On behalf of the Associated      General Contractors of America (AGC) and its more than 26,000      commercial constructioncompany members, I strongly urge you      to vote ``YES'' on the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017,      H.5. This legislation iscritical to helping ensure that      regulations undergo thorough economic analysis, are based in      sound science and/or substantialempirical data, and are      transparent with clear and feasible methods and goals.       The current regulatory process allows federalagencies to      promulgate rules based on unconvincing, scant and--     sometimes--just plain wrong evidence. For example, Professor      Sunding, Ph.D., Thomas Graff Chair of Natural      Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley      found that the``errors, omissions, and lack of transparency''      in the Environmental Protection Agency's economic analysis      underlying its Watersof the Unites States (WOTUS) rule to be      ``so severe as to render it virtually meaningless.'' Yet, the      EPA was able to finalizethat rule based on such flawed      analysis.       Federal agencies also write rules that are not feasible for      the constructionindustry to follow. The Occupational Health      and Safety Administration (OSHA) crystalline silica rule, for      instance, put forth apermissible silica exposure limit that      is beyond the capacity of existing dust filtration and      removal technology. Despite thisfact, OSHA finalized this      rule and the construction industry is left liable to      implement.       The Regulatory Accountability Actwill help hold federal      agencies accountable to the facts throughout the rulemaking      process. Under this legislation, the publiccould challenge      the underlying evidence agencies put forth to justify their      rules. Such challenges could occur through hearingsbefore the      agency and before courts, which generally defer to any      evidence put forth by federal agencies currently. As a      result,agencies would be incentivized to undertake more      rigorous and realistic analyses, rather than risk delays as a      result of relyingon cherry-picked studies or self-serving,      internal data.       The purpose of the bill is not partisan. Rather, it is to      ensurethat the regulations federal agencies put forth are      feasible and based in thorough economic analysis and sound      science. To doso, H.5 allows for greater transparency,      more public participation and needed objectivity in the      rulemaking process. As such,AGC again urges you to for in      favor of H.5.[[Page H346]]       Thank you for your consideration.

Re Support forH.5--The Regulatory Accountability Act of          2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington,    Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,       DearSpeaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the CEO      members of Business Roundtable, who lead major U.companies      with morethan $6 trillion in annual revenues and nearly 15      million employees, I am pleased to express our strong support      for H.5, theRegulatory Accountability Act of 2017,      introduced by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob       Business Roundtable CEOshave consistently identified overly      complex and burdensome federal regulations as harmful to      accelerating job creation, jobretention and increased      economic opportunity for American workers and their families.      We support a smarter approach to federalregulation that would      engage regulated parties earlier in the process, improve the      quality of information used to makeregulatory decisions and      consistently apply rigorous cost-benefit analysis to major      regulatory proposals.       We are particularlypleased that H.5 includes the      previously introduced version of the Regulatory      Accountability Act, also championed by ChairmanGoodlatte, the      ALERT Act, championed by Representative John Ratcliffe, and      the Providing Accountability Through TransparencyAct,      championed by Representative Blaine       Overall, the smart regulatory improvements embodied in the      RegulatoryAccountability Act of 2017 will:       Make U.companies more competitive. Usually after      prolonged periods of consideration,federal agencies regularly      issue rules that impose large and often unnecessary burdens      on U.businesses--burdens that foreigncompetitors may not      have to bear. The Act will reduce these burdens.       Enable U.companies to be more innovative.      Americanbusinesses are the world's most innovative, and that      innovation supports America's high standard of living. Rules      that requireparticular technologies or approaches or fail to      keep up with technological evolution can jeopardize future      innovation. The Actwill encourage flexible, non-prescriptive      implementation that preserves the capacity to innovate.       Stimulate investment byenhancing business certainty. If      companies are unsure about what regulators will require or      how to comply with rules, they willbe reluctant to commit      capital to new or expanded productive investments. By      encouraging early engagement with regulated partiesand      improving the transparency and accountability of the      regulatory process, the Act will result in greater certainty      for U.S.businesses and thereby accelerate job growth and      investment.       The Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 would make the      U.S.regulatory system more transparent, accountable and      effective. We endorse this legislation and pledge our full      support to see itenacted into law.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     DemocraticLeader, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi:On behalf of      the 1.1 million members of the National Association of      REALTORS (NAR), I urge the House to approve H.     5(Goodlatte, R-VA; Peterson, D-MN), the ``Regulatory      Accountability Act''.       NAR believes that federal regulations should benarrowly      tailored, supported by strong data and evidence, and impose      the least costs possible on regulated stakeholders.       TheRegulatory Accountability Act embodies these principles      and will contribute to a more transparent and accountable      regulatoryprocess by:       Increasing public participation in shaping the most-costly      regulations at an earlier point in the rulemakingprocess;       Instructing agencies to choose the least costly option that      achieves congressional intent unless they can show acostlier      option is needed to protect health, safety, or welfare;       Requiring public hearings for the most-costlyregulations;       Improving the process for evaluating how small businesses      are impacted by regulations; and       Providing for amore rigorous test in legal challenges for      those regulations that would have the most impact.       The Regulatory AccountabilityAct builds on established      principles of a fair regulatory process and would make the      regulatory process more transparent,agencies more accountable      for their decisions, and regulations better-tailored to      achieve their purpose without unnecessaryburdens on      stakeholders.       The Regulatory Accountability Act would allow Congress and      the public to reassert control over thefederal regulatory      bureaucracy. Therefore, NAR strongly supports the Act, and      urges passage of the bill when it comes to theHouse floor for      a vote.           Sincerely,                                                 William Brown,     2017                                  ____                                             NationalFederation of                                         Independent Business,                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.     Steve Chabot,     Chairman, HouseCommittee on Small Business,     Washington,       Dear Chairman Chabot, on behalf of the NationalFederation      of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small      business advocacy organization, I am writing in support      ofH.33, the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility      Improvements Act of 2017. This legislation puts into place      strong protectionsto ensure that federal agencies fully      consider the impact of proposed regulations on small      businesses.       In an economy wheretwo-thirds of all net new jobs come from      the small business sector, we appreciate that this      legislation would require regulatorsto analyze further the      impact of certain proposals on job creation. As you well      know, the annual cost of federal regulation peremployee is      significantly higher for smaller firms than larger firms.      Federal regulations--not to mention state and      localregulations--add up and significantly increase the cost      of starting and running a small business.       H.33 expands the scope ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act      (RFA) by forcing government regulators to include the      indirect impact of their regulations intheir assessments of a      regulation's impact on small businesses. The bill also      provides small business with expanded judicialreview      protections, which helps ensure that small businesses have      their views heard during the federal rulemaking process,      notafter.       The legislation strengthens several other aspects of the      RFA--such as expanding the small business advocacy      reviewpanel process to all agencies. Currently, the panels      only apply to the Environmental Protection Agency, the      Occupational Safetyand Health Administration, and the      Consumer Financial Protection These panels have      proven to be an extremely effectivemechanism in helping      agencies to understand how their rules will affect small      businesses, and help agencies identify less      costlyalternatives to regulations before proposing new rules.       Finally, H.33 expands the standard for periodic review      of rules byfederal agencies and gives the U.Small Business      Administration's Office of Advocacy increased input into      agency compliancewith the These important protections      are needed to prevent duplicative and outdated regulatory      burdens as well as toaddress penalty structures that are too      high for the small business sector.       NFIB supports H.33 because it strengthens therequirement      for federal agencies to consider both the direct and indirect      economic impact of proposed regulations on smallbusinesses.      We look forward to working with the committee towards      enactment of the Small Business Regulatory      FlexibilityImprovements Act of 2017.           Sincerely,                                                Juanita Duggan,     President and CEO                                  ____                                         Chamberof Commerce of the                                     United States of America,                                  Washington, DC, January 6, 2017.       To the Membersof the U.House of Representatives: The      U.Chamber of Commerce strongly supports H.5, which      includes the RegulatoryAccountability Act, and may consider      including votes on, or in relation to, H.5 in our annual      How They       The Chamber commends the House for acting on regulatory      reform legislation so early in the 115th session, and      forbringing H.5, which also includes important provisions      related to small businesses, to the floor.       The RegulatoryAccountability Act is a long-standing      priority for the Chamber and would update the Administrative      Procedure Act (APA) toimprove how federal agencies promulgate      those rules with the most significant impact on jobs and      economicgrowth.       Modernization of APA is long overdue. While there has been      a dramatic increase in high impact, transformative rulesthat      are slowing economic growth and inhibiting job creation, APA      rulemaking provisions have remained virtually unchanged      since1946 when the law was established.       H.5 would target only the most expensive and burdensome      of these rules for increasedscrutiny by providing greater      transparency, by holding agencies accountable, and by making      sure the data behind the decisions ofregulators are made      publicly available.

5121,topic-id,93,"Mr.Chairman, I just want to say that title I of the bill contains several key requirements for the Office ofInformation and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, to put out high-quality, governmentwide guidelines that all agencies can follow. Theseinclude, for example, guidelines on cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, consistency with the Information Quality Act, andgood guidance practices.  Since the importance of these issues and the need for swift and effective implementation of reform, the amendment'sinstitution of a 270-day deadline for the issuance of these guidelines is very reasonable, very constructive. I urge mycolleagues to support this amendment.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH323-2.txt,446,COMMITMENT TO CIVILITY,2017.0,11.0,January
5126,topic-id,128,"I thank the gentleman for his amendment. Title III of the bill contains important reforms to make sureagencies finally take seriously Congress' directive to write rules with flexible accommodations for small businesses, the sourceof most of our Nation's job creation.  Congress' demands for flexibility began with the Regulatory Accountability Act during the 1980s, but agencies have neverfully complied. One of the key ways agencies have skirted the law's requirements has been to certify their way out of any needto actually provide flexibility by finding that a proposed or final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.  This amendment puts the brakes on an inadequately substantiated certification by requiring certifications to includeeconomic assessment details sufficient to support the certifications.

5137,topic-id,188,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I support his amendment.  Title I of the bill contains critical reforms to the rulemaking process first introduced in the 112th In onesentence, one could say that these reforms have one ultimate goal--to assure a fair rulemaking process that achieves the benefitsCongress seeks and keeps unnecessary costs to a minimum.  The gentleman's amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, responds to an extreme example of rulemaking abuse that played outduring the 114th That abuse was the Environmental Protection Agency's advocacy campaign to skew the informationsubmitted for its administrative record and promote lobbying on behalf of its massive proposed waters of the United States rule.  It is one thing to propose a rule and open the agency's doors impartially to information from all members of the public. Itis quite another to promote public submissions to guarantee the cooking of the administrative record to support the agency'sview and to advocate lobbying of Congress to support that view.  This amendment makes sure that the biased agency activity manifest in the waters of the United States rulemaking neverhappens again.  Mr.Chairman, I support the amendment.

5140,topic-id,186,"I thank the gentleman from Louisiana, and I support his amendment.  Mr.Chairman, many of the reforms in title I of the bill focus on assuring better decisionmaking and cost control for majorrules--typically, those that impose more than $100 million or more per year in costs.  One of these reforms is the commonsense requirement that an agency, when it publishes amajor rule, include a plan for reviewing how the rule is working within 10 years. A focus of that review is to determine whetherit is possible, after the rule has been put into practice, to find new ways to lower the rule's costs.  The gentleman's amendment speeds this process up, requiring review within 5 years, and increases Congress' oversight,requiring reports by agencies to Congress on their reviews. Most importantly, the amendment requires that, if an agency's reportto Congress shows the rule's costs in practice are higher than anticipated at promulgation, the agency must institute a notice-and-comment process aimed at identifying revisions that can lower costs.  This is a measure that can only strengthen the bill's effectiveness and help lower unnecessary burdens on the I support the amendment.

5142,topic-id,189,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman for the time.  I support his amendment. Agency guidance is a crucial part of our regulatory system--flexible because not legally binding,but needed so regulated entities can understand how best to comply with agency rules.  Guidance, if it responds in a timely way to the regulated community's need for it, helps everything to function smoothly.But one thing that does not help is agency heel-dragging in the issuance of guidance as the regulated community comes up againstlegal or practical deadlines by which it needs to implement compliance measures. Too often agencies hurry up and wait to produceneeded guidance, then tell those who waited long and hard for it to hurry up and respond, pronto. That can leave very littletime for the regulated community to act before deadlines hit.[[Page H355]]  To solve this problem, the amendment offers a simple but much-needed solution. It requires that, within ``good-guidance''guidelines to be issued by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under the bill, there be guidelines for agenciesgenerally to assure at least 90 days for regulated entities to institute measures consistent with newly issued guidelines.  I support the amendment.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH323-2.txt,446,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,11.0,January

5174,topic-id,470,"Mr.Chairman, today, this Republican Congress is taking a short break from trying to destroy our healthcaresystem to try to destroy the rest of the Federal  H.5 is nothing more than Republicans seeking to micromanage the regulatory process to death. They claim they only wantgood government. In reality, they want no government at all. They want to wrap Federal agencies in so much red tape that theywon't be able to move to protect our health, our safety, or our natural resources.  Language in title III tries to prevent Federal land managers from actually managing Federal lands. This language would makeland managers jump through the same procedural hoops over and over again just to put a new land management plan in place. Thesenew requirements are completely redundant, which is, of course, the point.  Federal land management plans already go through extensive review, including by the public, before they are ever evenimplemented. One way we know this is that the House Republicans complain constantly about how long it takes Federal agencies tocome up with a decision. Yet, here they are claiming that this Republican Congress knows best how our public lands and resourcesshould be managed.  Let's stop and look at the record. Last Tuesday, almost every single Republican Member of this House voted for a change inour House standing rules to calculate the value of all Federal lands as zero for accounting purposes. Yes, House Republicansagree that all Federal lands are essentially worthless.  Then, on Thursday of this week, 229 House Republicans voted against an amendment I offered to another bill to declare thatclimate change is real. Yes, 95 percent of House Republicans voted to deny a settled scientific fact.  Yet, here we are today with the same House Republicans who deny science; the same House Republicans who think public landsare worthless, claiming they know how to manage these public lands.  Science deniers and those who think our public lands have no value have no credibility when they bring legislation to thisfloor claiming that they want to improve public land management. As with health care, as with so many things, they don't want toimprove it; they want to destroy it.  Congressional Republicans have proved themselves completely incapable of building or preserving anything. They are onlyinterested in tearing things down, starting with health, safety, and environmental protections for our people and ourcommunities.  This bill would needlessly tip the scales in favor of corporate polluters who want to be in power to ruin our public lands,taking the resources and the profits for themselves, leaving the American people with the mess and the consequences.  My amendment strikes the section of this bill intended to turn our public land management process into nothing more than aboard meeting of the American Petroleum  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH323-2.txt,1708,"DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE GENERAL",2017.0,11.0,January
5177,topic-id,207,"Mr.Chairman, I appreciate the comments of my esteemed colleague. We have to get past the point where we arejust talking about repeal. As the President so eloquently said last night, if there is something that is going to improve thehealth and well-being of the American people relative to the Affordable Care Act, then bring it forward. We all have beenwaiting patiently for the Republican majority to bring something forward that not only repeals but replaces. We are stillwaiting.  In terms of this amendment, the resource management plans are the backbone for every action and approved use on BLM land. Itis about scoping. It is about public input, collaborative with State, local, tribal, and user groups across the spectrum, andthat is the process that is in place now, a process that deserves to be continued, ratified, and protected.  As far as the issue of climate change, the President eloquently said last night that we should go forward on the issue ofclimate change, putting science and reason as a priority on how we have that discussion. Once the majority is prepared to dealwith science and reason, I think our side of the aisle is willing to do so as well.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

4927,topic-id,2753,"Mr.President, 2 weeks ago, President Trump nominated Tenth Circuit judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado to fill the vacancy left by the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Judge Gorsuch, in my opinion, is the ideal choice to fill this seat. He has impeccable credentials and a decade-long record on the bench demonstrating a keen understanding of the proper role of a judge.  Given the increasingly contentious nature of the confirmation process, it is not surprising that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and their special interest group allies are stretching to find anything objectionable about Judge Gorsuch, no matter how ridiculous.  Today, I wish to address one of their latest, most outlandish claims: that Judge Gorsuch would not serve as an independent check on the executive branch. For example, last week in Politico, Senator Schumer, the distinguished Senator from New York, declared in an opinion piece: ``The most important factor in assessing a Supreme Court nominee . . . is whether or not the potential justice will be an independent check on an executive who may act outside our nation's laws and the Constitution.'' Senator Schumer doubled down on these comments in the New York There, he argued that it was impossible for him to discern Judge Gorsuch's judicial independence when they met in person. Why? Because Judge Gorsuch refused to say how he would rule on specific issues or how he would review particular government actions. These misleading narratives are an irrelevant, wasteful distraction from our consideration of Judge Gorsuch's sterling record and the merits of confirming him to the Supreme  Last month, I warned that the left would use these diversion tactics in an attempt to discredit the President's nominee. Shortly before Judge Gorsuch's nomination was announced, I predicted in an opinion piece in the Washington Post that advocates and interest groups would want to know how the nominee would decide particular cases before those cases ever reached the Court to make sure the nominee is on the right team. I was right.  Our Nation's Founders would have been embarrassed by such questions. Instead, the questions we ask should focus on whether the nominee will interpret and apply the law faithfully and neutrally no matter what the issue is. After all, that is what our Constitution demands.  Our Founders are not the only ones who would be embarrassed. I have been in the Senate for the last dozen Supreme Court confirmations. Every nominee we have considered has rightly refused to answer such questions. Consider, for example, Justice Ginsburg's response at her confirmation hearing. She said:       A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts,      no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the      specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain      for the entire judicial process.  Just last month in a speech in Arizona, Justice Sotomayor had an even stronger warning against asking and answering such questions. She said:       What you want is for us to tell you how as a judicial      nominee we're going to rule on the important issues you find      vexing. . . . Any self-respecting judge who comes in with an      agenda that would permit that judge to tell you how they will      vote is the kind of person you don't want as a judge.  So let's stop with this nonsense of trying to get Judge Gorsuch to prejudge issues that could come before the I hope my colleagues appreciate the irony in asking a judge to say how they would rule on particular issues in order to prove that the judge is judicially independent. I agree with Justice Sotomayor: A nominee who will tell you how she would vote is the kind of person you do not want as a judge.  But if judicial independence really is the most important factor, as Senator Schumer suggests, then this confirmation process should be the easiest one in the Senate's history. Over 11 years on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has consistently demonstrated in his judicial opinions and other writings that he deeply values the constitutional separation of powers between the three branches of the Federal Judge Gorsuch understands that the Constitution gives each branch distinct roles: Congress makes the laws, the President enforces those laws, and the courts interpret those laws and the The branches may act only according to the powers the Constitution grants them, with the remaining powers and rights reserved to the States and ultimately to the people.  With respect to the power of the executive branch, Judge Gorsuch has a strong record of reining in actions which violate the Constitution and the[[Page S1191]]law. Perhaps the best example is his opinion in the immigration case Gutierrez-Brizuela v. There, the Attorney General attempted to apply a new agency rule retroactively prohibiting a noncitizen from receiving relief under Federal immigration law. Writing for the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch ruled that such action exceeded the executive's power to enforce the law.  In a separate opinion, he noted that there is an elephant in the room: the so-called Chevron deference doctrine, which requires courts to defer to Federal agency interpretations of the law we pass. He expressed constitutional concerns about Chevron deference. Judge Gorsuch wrote:       [T]he fact is Chevron . . . permit[s] executive      bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and      legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that      seems more than a little difficult to square with the      Constitution of the framers' design. Maybe the time has come      to face the behemoth.  Judge Gorsch then proceeded to provide a textbook explanation of the proper separation of powers under our As he stated, the Founders included a strong separation of powers in the Constitution because ``[a] government of diffused powers, they knew, is a government less capable of invading the liberties of the people.''  As my colleagues know, I am no fan of Chevron deference. Last Congress, I introduced the Separation of Powers Restoration Act to get rid of it. As I noted when I introduced the legislation, regulators have taken advantage of the courts' deference under Chevron to shoehorn the law for their own political agenda, expanding their authority well beyond congressional intent. But the Constitution's separation of powers makes clear that it is the responsibility of the courts, not the bureaucracy, to interpret the law. So I am pleased Judge Gorsuch understands that the Constitution requires Federal judges to serve as an independent check on how Federal agencies interpret the laws we enact.  Separation of powers is not just about ensuring that the executive branch performs its proper role of executing the law; separation of powers is also about making sure Federal judges understand their proper role under the As Chief Justice Marshall famously explained in Marbury v. Madison, judges have a constitutional duty to say what the law is. Simply put, judges must be faithful interpreters of our laws and the  Under our constitutional separation of powers, it is not the role of Federal judges to make or change laws by imposing their own policy preferences. It is not their role to look beyond the law to consider their personal views and feelings. And it is not their role to choose winners and losers based on subjective beliefs that favor one group over another.  In my 40 years in the Senate, I have reviewed the record of hundreds of nominees for the Federal bench. I don't think I have ever reviewed the record of a nominee who better understands his proper role under the Constitution than Judge Consider, for example, Judge Gorsuch's touching tribute to Justice Scalia that was published last year in the Case Western Reserve Law In that speech, Judge Gorsuch eloquently explained how judges should not be in the business of ruling in ways that reflect their own political views or policy preferences. Judges, after all, are not elected legislators. Instead, judges should interpret the law as written. They must start with the text of the statute and then utilize the traditional tools of statutory interpretations to discern the meaning of any particular law.  Judge Gorsuch understands, to borrow from Alexander Hamilton, that the judiciary should be the least dangerous branch. These aren't just words; Judge Gorsuch's judicial record confirms that he lives this judicial philosophy of restraint and humility.  In an essay I published last week on SCOTUSblog, I reviewed a number of judicial opinions by Judge Gorsuch that demonstrate his commitment to the separation of powers and the proper role of a judge in our Federal system. I will not go through all of those cases here, but I ask unanimous consent that the essay be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           [From SCOTUSblog]   Worried About the Separation of Powers? Then Confirm Judge Gorsuch                        (By Senator Orrin Hatch)       Last week, President Donald Trump nominated Judge Neil      Gorsuch to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.Supreme      Judge Gorsuch is an ideal choice to fill this seat: He      has impeccable credentials and a decade-long record on the      bench demonstrating a keen understanding of the proper role      of a judge. Given the increasingly contentious nature of the      confirmation process, it is no surprise that many Democrats      are stretching to find anything objectionable about Judge      Gorsuch, no matter how ridiculous. In the current political      environment, they have focused much of their criticism on one      particularly strained argument: their claim that Justice      Gorsuch would not serve as an independent check on the      executive branch.       Fortunately, we do not have to speculate about how Justice      Gorsuch would decide these kinds of cases. Judge Gorsuch has      consistently demonstrated in his judicial opinions and other      writings that he deeply values the constitutional separation      of powers between the three branches of the federal      government. Judge Gorsuch understands that the Constitution      gives each branch distinct roles: Congress makes the laws,      the President enforces those laws, and the courts interpret      those laws and the The branches may act only      according to the powers the Constitution grants them, with      the remaining powers and rights reserved to the states and,      ultimately, to the people.       With respect to the power of the executive branch, Judge      Gorsuch has a strong record of reining in unlawful overreach.      For instance, in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, the Attorney      General had attempted to apply a new agency rule      retroactively to prohibit a noncitizen from receiving relief      under federal immigration law. Writing for the U.Court of      Appeals for the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch concluded that      such action exceeded the executive's power to enforce the      law. In a separate opinion, he went one step further and      expressed concerns about how judge-made doctrines that      require judicial deference to federal agency actions--namely,      Chevron deference and its progeny--''permit executive      bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and      legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that      seems more than a little difficult to square with the      Constitution of the framers' design.'' Judge Gorsuch then      proceeded to provide a textbook explanation of the proper      separation of powers between the three branches, concluding      that ``[i]t was to avoid dangers like these, dangers the      founders had studied and seen realized in their own time,      that they pursued the separation of powers. A government of      diffused powers, they knew, is a government less capable of      invading the liberties of the people.''       Nor is Judge Gorsuch a supporter of federal judges who go      beyond their constitutional role in interpreting the law. As      Judge Gorsuch has eloquently explained, ``judges should be in      the business of declaring what the law is using the      traditional tools of interpretation, rather than pronouncing      the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own      political views, always with an eye on the outcome, and      engaged perhaps in some Benthamite calculation of pleasures      and pains along the way.'' It is not judges' role to make or      change laws by imposing their own policy preferences instead      of what Congress actually passed. It is not their role to      look beyond the text of the law to consider their personal      views and feelings. And it is not their role to choose      winners and losers based on subjective beliefs that favor one      group over another. Judge Gorsuch's opinions reinforce his      judicial philosophy of restraint and humility and his proper      understanding--to borrow from Alexander Hamilton--that the      judiciary should be the ``least dangerous'' branch.       Consider, for example, United States v. Games-There,      the 10th Circuit upheld a conviction for possession of a      firearm by a felon. The criminal defendant argued that he was      unaware that he was a convicted felon, but the court rejected      this argument as foreclosed by the court's prior precedent.      Judge Gorsuch penned a separate opinion. He agreed that the      court was bound by its own precedent, but he wrote separately      to urge the court to reconsider its precedent in light of the      plain text of the statute that requires the government to      prove the defendant knew he was a convicted felon. As Judge      Gorsuch explained, ``we might be better off applying the law      Congress wrote than the one [the court] hypothesized. It is a      perfectly clear law as it is written, plain in its terms,      straightforward in its application.'' He continued: ``Of      course, if Congress wishes to revise the plain terms of [the      statute], it is free to do so anytime. But there is simply no      right or reason for this court to be in that business.''       Sometimes a judge is asked to consider the proper      separation of powers between all three branches. For      instance, in Hobby Lobby Stores, v. Sebelius, the 10th      Circuit considered whether certain regulations issued by the      U.Department of Health and Human Services under the      Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act violated the      plaintiffs' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration      In particular, the plaintiffs argued that the      regulations' health[[Page S1192]]     insurance mandate for employers violated RFRA's statutory      protections on religious freedom by forcing employers to      provide health insurance coverage for abortion-     inducing drugs and devices. Judge Gorsuch's opinion explained      why the owners of one of the plaintiff companies were      entitled to relief under As an initial matter, he noted      that the owners' ``religious convictions are contestable''      and that ``[s]ome may even find [their] beliefs offensive,''      but that RFRA ``does perhaps its most important work in      protecting unpopular religious beliefs.''       Judge Gorsuch then turned to the statutory interpretation      question at issue and noted that the case was a ``tale of two      statutes.'' Wrote Judge Gorsuch: ``The ACA compels the      [plaintiffs] to act. RFRA says they need not. We are asked to      decide which legislative direction controls.'' To decide      which statute controlled, he did not defer to the executive      branch's position on the matter. Nor did he seek to impose      his own policy preferences. To the contrary, he noted that      ``[t]he tiebreaker is found not in our own opinions about      good policy but in the laws Congress enacted.'' Because      ``Congress structured RFRA to override other legal mandates,      including its own statutes, if and when they encroach on      religious liberty,'' and ``because the government identifies      no explicit exclusion in the ACA to its dictates,'' Judge      Gorsuch concluded, RFRA's directive prevailed.       Even a casual review of Judge Gorsuch's opinions should      eliminate any concerns my Senate colleagues may have      concerning his commitment to the Constitution's separation of      powers. In his opinions, Judge Gorsuch has resisted executive      branch efforts to make laws as opposed to merely enforcing      those laws as written. Indeed, his opinions and other      writings cogently make the case for this approach to      separation of powers in a way that finds few rivals on the      federal bench and reminds me much of the case Justice Scalia      made during his time on the Judge Gorsuch, moreover,      has been a model of respect for the proper judicial role, a      judicial philosophy under which ``judges seek to interpret      texts as reasonable affected parties might have done rather      than rewrite texts to suit their own policy preferences.''       To be sure, that Justice Gorsuch would be a fierce defender      of the separation of powers and the rule of law does not mean      his rulings will match his policy preferences, much less      mine. In fact, in his tribute speech to Justice Scalia last      year, Judge Gorsuch embraced Justice Scalia's philosophy of      judicial restraint: ``If you're going to be a good and      faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that      you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach.''      That is precisely why Judge Gorsuch is the right choice for      the Supreme  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1175-2.txt,1351,REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACTOF 2017,2017.0,15.0,January
4928,topic-id,2614,"To be sure, that Justice Gorsuch would be a fierce defender of the separation of powers does not mean his rulings will match his policy preferences. As Justice Scalia wisely remarked, good and faithful judges will not always like the conclusions they reach in interpreting the law. And it certainly does not mean that his rulings will match my policy preferences or those of my colleagues. As I have repeatedly stated on this floor over decades, that is not the proper inquiry when we assess the qualifications of a nominee to the Federal bench. Federal judges must be judges, not super-legislators.  The bottom line is, even a casual review of Judge Gorsuch's opinions should eliminate any concerns my colleagues may have concerning Judge Gorsuch's commitment to the Constitution's separation of powers. Any review would lead to that conclusion. In his opinions, Judge Gorsuch has resisted executive branch efforts to make laws as opposed to merely enforcing those laws. Judge Gorsuch's opinions and other writings make the compelling case for separation of powers in a way that finds few rivals on the current Federal bench.  If my colleagues are truly concerned about the proper separation of powers between the three branches of government, there is a simple solution: Confirm Judge Gorsuch as an Associate Justice on the United States Supreme                   Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare  Mr.President, I want to once again discuss the ongoing effort to repeal and replace the so-called Affordable Care This is one of our most vexing issues of the day. Of course, this isn't the first time I have come to the floor to discuss ObamaCare, and I am fairly certain it won't be the last.  I was here just last week, in fact, talking about the general unanimity among Republicans on these issues, despite the seemingly eternal focus on the supposed divisions among our ranks. While some are still advancing that narrative, Republicans are, overall, still united in our desire to repeal and replace As I said last week, I don't know if there is a single Republican in Congress who supports keeping the healthcare status quo in place. All of us want to right what went wrong with the poorly named Affordable Care Act and provide patients and consumers with more healthcare choices that address healthcare costs.  Most differences of opinion that do exist on these matters are more about timing than anything else. As I have said before, I support moving quickly to repeal ObamaCare and include as many replacement policies as possible under the rules of the reconciliation process. More specifically, I support repealing ObamaCare's harmful taxes, and I will explain why.  Put simply, the tax provisions in ObamaCare were poorly conceived and recklessly enacted, and they are harmful to our economy. Those taxes came in a number of forms, including the employer mandate and the individual mandate, both of which are enforced through the Tax  In addition, there is the health insurance tax, the Cadillac tax, along with new taxes on healthcare savings and pharmaceuticals. ObamaCare also included a payroll tax hike for some high-income earners as well as additional taxes on investing. And, of course, we cannot forget the medical device tax, which, in just the first 3 years that ObamaCare was implemented, resulted in more than 30,000 lost jobs in that important industry.  All told, the tax provisions of the Affordable Care Act represented a trillion-dollar hit on the U.economy in the first 10 years, and the burdens of the vast majority of these taxes are ultimately borne by patients and consumers in the form of higher costs, larger tax bills, and reduced value in existing health plans and savings accounts.  I know some of my colleagues like to plead ignorance on the notion that taxes on a particular industry tend to be passed along to that industry's consumers, but it is a fact that can't be ignored. Taxes on health insurance plans increase premiums for patients. Taxes on drug companies make drugs more expensive. Taxes on medical device sales increase the costs of those devices.  It is not a complicated concept; it is the natural byproduct of tax provisions negotiated with stakeholders behind closed doors under threat of increased government intrusion and market regulation. These taxes weren't drafted solely to pay the cost of ObamaCare; they were also part of a strategy to get the law through Congress, dividing the business community and pitting industries against one another to prevent widespread opposition. As I said, at the end of the day, it is patients and consumers--individuals and families--who pay most of the freight on these types of tax policies.  Don't take my word for it. Let's look at one major example. Congress's nonpartisan scorekeeper, the Joint Committee on Taxation, indicated that, by and large, the tax on health insurance premiums would be passed along to health insurance policyholders.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the JCT to Senator Grassley, dated October 28, 2009.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Congress of the United States,                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,                                 Washington, DC, October 28, 2009.     Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.Senate,          Washington,       Dear Ranking Member Grassley: You requested that we provide      you with an analysis of the incidence of the insurance      industry fee provision of 1796, the ``America's Healthy      Future Act,'' our estimate of the effect on the after-tax      price of purchased health insurance, and a distributional      analysis of the provision.                         insurance industry fee       6010 of 1796 would impose an annual fee on any      covered entity engaged in the business of providing health      insurance with respect to United States health risks. Under      the provision, employers who self-insure their employees'      health risks and governmental entities are not covered      entities.       The fee applies for calendar years beginning after 2009.      The aggregate annual fee for all covered entities is $6.7      billion. Under the provision, the aggregate fee is      apportioned among the covered entities based on a ratio      designed to reflect theft relative market share of U.     health business.       For each covered entity, the fee for a calendar year is an      amount that bears the same[[Page S1193]]     ratio to $6.7 billion as (1) the covered entity's net      premiums written during the preceding calendar year with      respect to health insurance for any United States health      risk, bears to (2) the aggregate net premiums written of all      covered entities during such preceding calendar year with      respect to such health insurance.                  incidence of insurance excise taxes       The proposed fee is similar to an excise tax based on the      sales price of health insurance contracts. The effective      excise tax rate varies from year to year depending upon the      aggregate value of health insurance sold. The economic      incidence of an excise tax imposed on sale of health      insurance contracts (that is, who actually bears the cost of      the tax) may differ from the statutory incidence of the tax      (that is, the person on whom the tax is levied). Taxes may be      borne by any of the following: consumers in the form of      higher prices; owners of firms in the form of lower profits;      employees in the form of lower wages; or other suppliers to      firms in the form of lower payments. This makes      generalizations about the incidence of taxes difficult to      make. Nonetheless, two principles have general validity.      First, economic incidence does not depend on whom the tax is      levied. Whether the statutory incidence of the tax is on the      consumer, the employer, or the insurer, the economic      incidence is the same regardless of who writes the check to      the government. Second, taxes are shifted from those who are      more sensitive to price changes (economists describe these      individuals and entities as having more ``elastic'' supply      and demand) to those who are less sensitive to price changes      (those with more ``inelastic'' supply and demand).       In the case of competitive markets, an excise tax generally      is borne entirely by consumers in the form of higher prices      in the long term. An excise tax increases the cost of      producing an additional unit, or incremental cost, of the      taxed good by the amount of the tax. In a competitive market,      market forces cause the after-tax price of a good to equal      the additional cost of producing and selling another unit of      the good. Competition drives the price down to equal the      incremental cost of the provision of the good or service,      including the return to incremental invested capital. If      supply is perfectly responsive to price changes, any price      above incremental cost would induce new firms to enter and      increase production until prices were bid back down to      incremental cost. Similarly, any price below incremental cost      would induce firms to exit or reduce production (because they      would now be losing money selling the taxed good). The      reduction in supply allows prices to increase back up to      incremental cost.       This response may be observed even if some of the      participants in the competitive market do not seek to      maximize profits as their primary objective. Tax-exempt and      nonprofit producers may also pass on the tax as they also      face the increased incremental cost, which they will need to      recover. If they cannot, for example, raise additional funds      from donors, effectively passing the tax on to them, their      alternative is to pass on the tax to consumers in the form of      higher prices.       While consumers are thought to bear the burden of excise      taxes in competitive markets, some may question the degree of      competition in health insurance markets. Recent surveys have      noted that many markets are characterized by the presence of      only a few firms. Additionally, there may exist barriers to      entry in the health insurance market, including multiple      State regulatory requirements, the cost of establishing      health provider networks, health provider network effects      (i.e., the value of a health provider network to consumers      rises with the size of the network), and efficiencies in      risk shifting and risk distribution for large firms.       However, the absence of many competitors does not by itself      imply that there is no competitive pressure on prices. The      threat of potential entrants may provide competitive price      pressure on the existing firms. Furthermore, the option to      self-insure may provide a source of potential competition for      full, purchased insurance, at least for larger firms.       If the insurance industry is not perfectly competitive in a      particular market, the question remains as to what extent an      insurance excise tax would be borne by consumers or producers      in that market. Theoretical analysis has shown that,      depending upon market conditions, the price could increase      by: (1) more than the amount of the tax; (2) exactly the      amount of the tax; or (3) less than the amount of the tax.      Various empirical studies have examined the effect of excise      taxes on prices in less than perfectly competitive markets.      Studies of the tobacco industry suggest that manufacturers      pass on more than the full amount of the tax, while studies      of less than perfectly competitive retail gasoline markets in      rural areas suggest that producers pass on nearly all of the      tax. Even in the rural retail gasoline markets in which gas      stations may be the sole provider of gasoline for many miles      and firms exhibit some pricing power, nearly 95 percent of      the excise tax is still passed on to consumers.       While uncertainty exists, we assume that a very large      portion of the excise tax on purchased insurance will be      borne by consumers in most markets, including in some markets      with a high level of concentration among market participants      covered by the proposed excise tax. In the context of general      health care reform legislation, this assumption is further      supported by the presence of an excise tax on individuals      without minimum essential benefits coverage, which is likely      to make demand for insurance somewhat less sensitive to      changes in price, as consumers will have to buy insurance or      face a penalty. While consumers (or employers) may respond by      changing their insurance coverage from more expensive      coverage to less expensive plans to offset any potential      price increase, this behavior too is properly characterized      as the consumers bearing the burden of the excise tax by      accepting lower quality (for example, a more restricted      physician network) for the same price rather than paying a      higher price for the quality of insurance that they would      prefer if there were no tax. To the extent that firms can      avoid the tax by switching from full insurance to self-     insurance, this may suggest that insurers are unable to pass      on the full cost of the excise tax on purchased insurance.      Increased self-insurance from firms avoiding the excise tax      may increase the cost of this health benefit to employees as      firms that previously chose full insurance, presumably      because it cost less in the absence of the excise tax than      self-insurance, switch to higher cost self-insurance.      Additionally, to the extent that insurers maintain some      pricing power in the administrative services that they      provide self-insurers, the self-insurance market may bear      some of the burden of the excise tax as well.      effect of the fee on the cost of purchased health insurance       The aggregate value of the proposed fee is the same for      each year. The current law baseline for health insurance      premiums projects rising health insurance premiums annually      through the budget period. Consequently the magnitude of the      proposed fee declines annually relative to the sale of health      insurance. Given the incidence analysis discussed above,      while there is imcertainty, we expect a very large portion of      proposed insurance industry fee to be borne by purchasers of      insurance in the form of higher premiums. Our estimate is      that the premiums for purchased health insurance policies,      including the tax liability, would be between 1.0 and 1.5      percent greater than they otherwise would be as a consequence      of the industry fee for calendar years 2010, 2011, and 2012.         distributional analysis of the insurance industry fee       Regardless of the determination of the economic incidence      of the proposed insurance industry fee of 1796, at the      present time the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation is      not able to distribute the effects across individuals on our      individual tax model. The proposed insurance industry fee      would apply only to the revenues from underwritten policies      sold to third parties. It would not apply to the value of      health benefits received by individuals through their      employers who self-insure the health risks of their      employees. Our individual tax model is based upon a sample of      approximately 180,000 actual tax returns. To distribute      proposed tax changes related to economic activity that is not      already reflected on the individual tax return we impute      values or statistically match supplemental information such      as data gathered by the Census Bureau, to the individual tax      returns of our model. For our quantitative analysis of      employer-provided health benefits we have made such      imputations of data relating to employees' employer-provided      health care benefits to the individual model. These      imputations are based on the data collected as part the      Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (``MEPS''), a survey      undertaken by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality      of the Department of Health and Human Services, However, the      imputations we have made to the individual tax model at this      time relate only to the value of employer expenditures for      the health care of their employees. These imputations do not      generally distinguish between the employers' purchased      insurance coverage and benefits for which the employer self-     insures. Consequently, we are unable to distribute either the      economic incidence or the revenues generated from the      proposed fee of 1796, which applies only to purchased      health insurance,       I hope this information is helpful to you.

4929,topic-id,491,"While we are setting the record straight on ObamaCare, my colleagues on the other side have repeated a particular false claim that needs correction. My Democrat friends are fond of characterizing the repeal of ObamaCare as a tax cut for high-income earners and a tax increase for low- and middle-income taxpayers. That claim is simply false.  According to JCT, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Affordable Care Act imposed significant and widespread tax increases on taxpayers earning less than $200,000 a year, despite President Obama's repeated promises that the law would not do so. In fact, in 2017, a single provision--the reduction in the deductibility of catastrophic losses--is projected to raise taxes on 13.8 million taxpaying families and individuals, mostly from the middle class. That is more than the number of taxpayers who receive exchange credits and other premium subsidies under[[Page S1194]]current law. That is just one example. There are others.  Fortunately, we have been able to forestall the impact of a number of the ObamaCare tax provisions. We have fought and negotiated long and hard to do so, but virtually all of those taxes are still looming on the ObamaCare horizon.  Most of us on the Republican side have been fighting these taxes more or less since the day ObamaCare was signed into law. We have highlighted their harmful impact on the economy and decried the crony capitalism that was behind the effort to draft and enact them.  Given this long history, at least in my view, it is essential that we repeal all of these taxes, along with the rest of It is difficult to imagine how Republicans, who are now in the majority in large part due to the promises we made to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, can now sift through ObamaCare's taxes and decide which ones are the least objectionable so that we can use them to pay for our own healthcare reforms.  ObamaCare isn't problematic simply because healthcare costs are not going up; it was fundamentally flawed at the outset. The way the law was drafted was, and still is, a problem. The way the law was negotiated--with stakeholders being played against each other--was, and still is, a problem. Of course, the way the law was paid for was, and still is, a problem. The ObamaCare taxes are a big part of this equation. In my view--and, I think, the view of the vast majority of my Republican colleagues--they have to go.  As I said, there really are not widespread disagreements among Republicans on these issues. Overall, we broadly agree on the fundamental issues surrounding ObamaCare, and, as I noted last week, it is not all that problematic to have some differences of opinion on the initial stage, so long as we can overcome those differences in the end.

4948,topic-id,1235,"Mr.President, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, is probably the most powerful Federal job that most Americans have never heard of. If you were to ask five out of five regular people whether they have even heard of the Office of Management and Budget, or its importance, I would say that probably five of them would say: I have never heard of it; what do they do?  The Director of OMB has broad discretion to develop Federal regulations and to set spending priorities across the government--spending priorities across the government. I think we should make sure that this person actually cares about service to the people of  For example, if the Defense Department needs more resources for our troops, OMB has to sign off. If the Environmental Protection Agency wants to protect our communities from air and water pollution, OMB has to sign off. If the President wants to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid under the guise of ``saving money,'' the OMB Director is responsible for implementing the policy.  Given the tremendous power invested in this position, the next OMB Director should, at a minimum, believe in the[[Page S1214]]central government functions he or she will be tasked to carry out. That is why I strongly oppose the nomination of Congressman Mike Mulvaney to serve as the next Director of the Office of Management and  Congressman Mulvaney came to Washington at the very right fringe of the tea party wave in 2010. Since then, he has consistently pursued policies that would be disastrous for our economy, for the most vulnerable members of our society, and for America's seniors--our kupuna.  Congressman Mulvaney has been one of the strongest proponents for privatizing and voucherizing Medicare and dismantling Medicaid during his time in In 2011, while explaining his support for the draconian, really terrible Republican budget that would have destroyed the social safety net and gutted funding for nearly every domestic program--nearly every domestic program and you can imagine the thousands and thousands of domestic programs people across the country are relying upon--Congressman Mulvaney said:       Two nights ago, there was a group of Republicans in the      House of Representatives who voted to dramatically overhaul      Medicare and Medicaid and lightning did not strike us. If      that is not a sign that maybe things can be different around      here, I don't know what is. So I'm hoping that--I hope we      have that exact debate over the course of the next year.  Let me be clear. Congressman Mulvaney was gloating over a bill that would be devastating to millions of seniors and Americans on Medicaid and If confirmed, Congressman Mulvaney would not just be one extremist in the House of Representatives; he would be the person--the one person--responsible for developing, rolling out, and implementing the President's budget and his priorities.  With this power, he would be in a position to fulfill his heart's desire--all of the things he worked on as a member of the tea party and a Member of the House of He could destroy programs like Medicare and Social Security, which more than 200,000 seniors in Hawaii and tens of millions across the United States depend on every single day. There are things we can do to fight back.  Last month, I fought alongside my friend and colleague from Indiana, Senator Joe Donnelly, to prevent Congressman Mulvaney and the Trump administration from using budget gimmicks to privatize Medicare and cut funding from While our amendment was defeated in a very close vote, I was encouraged that two of our Republican colleagues--Senator Dean Heller of Nevada and Senator Susan Collins of Maine--voted in favor of my amendment.  This vote demonstrated that there is bipartisan opposition to balancing the budget on the backs of our seniors. This is exactly what Congressman Mulvaney wants to do. He has called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. Ponzi schemes are illegal, but he calls Social Security--a program that millions and millions of people throughout our country rely upon--a Ponzi scheme and supports raising the eligibility for it to 70 years old.  When he was in the South Carolina legislature, he even supported a bill that said that Social Security was unconstitutional. I would say even the most conservative person would not deem Social Security to be unconstitutional, but that is the kind of position that Congressman Mulvaney takes. His positions on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security are enough to disqualify him from serving as OMB  We do not need an ideological flamethrower like Congressman Mulvaney at the helm of Sadly, there is more. Congressman Mulvaney is a debt limit denier. To demonstrate the point, I wish to read his response to a question he received from the Budget Committee:       I do believe that defaulting on America's debts would have      grave worldwide economic consequences. I do not believe that      breaching the debt ceiling will automatically or inevitably      lead to that result.  Not only is this statement wrong, but it contradicts itself. I was in the House in 2011 when Congressman Mulvaney and his colleagues played political games with the debt limit. I can tell you that the stock market did not agree with his assessment that there wouldn't be an immediate negative impact.  Here is what happened over the course of a week. The stock market lost $1 trillion in value--$1 trillion in value. Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.credit for the first time in our country's history.  The Government Accountability Office later found that the standoff increased our borrowing costs by $1.3 billion, which Congressman Mulvaney and his Republican allies were all too happy to pass along to the American taxpayers to pay.  Congressman Mulvaney's record clearly demonstrates why he is unfit to serve as the Director of the Office of Management and He wants to balance the budget on the backs of seniors and other vulnerable communities. He believes in governing from fiscal crisis to fiscal crisis. It isn't even clear if he supports the mission of the department he has been nominated to lead.  Congressman Mulvaney joins a list of nominees--many of them confirmed at this point, sadly--ranging from an Education Secretary who does not believe in public education to a Secretary of Health and Human Services who wants to basically dismantle Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security not far behind.  I ask my colleagues, when does this long list of nominees come to a stop? I say, at the very least, someone with the power of the Director of OMB is where we should be drawing the line, unless we want one who thinks that defaulting on our national debt is not a problem, unless we think that hurting millions and millions of seniors on Social Security and Medicare is not a problem.  I feel as though Congressman Mulvaney perhaps has not encountered enough people in his time in public service who have come to him to share their stories of the devastation that would come into their lives if these safety net programs were not there for them. I feel as though maybe if they have come to talk to him, he hasn't listened very well.  I encourage my colleagues to hold the line at this point and to oppose this nomination.

4933,topic-id,1931,"Mr.President, I rise today to support the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney and ask my colleagues to vote to confirm him as the next Director of the Office of Management and  It may not surprise folks that I have a markedly different viewpoint than the Senator from New Congressman Mulvaney wants to save Social Security and Congressman Mulvaney wants to prevent, stop the mortgaging of our children's future, the bankrupting of  One thing on which I do agree with the good Senator from New Hampshire is that we need to concentrate on economic growth. It is the primary component of the solution. But this Nation faces many, many challenges. From the standpoint of foreign policy, take a look at what is happening around the world, the turmoil in so much of the world. We are in a generational struggle against Islamic terror, against ISIS, al-Iran--that nuclear agreement was horrible. It modified the behavior for the worse. We have just witnessed North Korea test-fire another missile. Combined with their nuclear capability at some point in time--probably not in the too distant future--they will threaten China has been emboldened. Russia has become more aggressive. Why? Because in so many instances, these nations perceive America as weaker than we once were, lacking the strength and resolve to provide the leadership, project our values around the world.  With all these threats that America faces, at the same time our military is being hollowed out. We won't have the resources militarily to fight back if they strike first.  Domestically, we also face many perils, many challenges. ObamaCare didn't work. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act did not protect the patients. It is not affordable. In my State, Wisconsin, premiums on the individual market have doubled and tripled. A young mother working a part-time job so she could stay home with her children had to quit that job to take full-time work to pay her $8,000 per year increase in premiums. Wages have stagnated for years. Our infrastructure is old and in many cases, crumbling. Our borders are porous. We are not winning the War on Drugs because of porous borders in many respects. Unfortunately, the War on Poverty has also not been won. In many cases, it has created perverse incentives that have trapped generations in a cycle of poverty and dependency and despair. It has resulted in the national debt rapidly approaching $20 trillion. Again, that is that mortgaging our children's future that Congressman Mulvaney wants to prevent.  As the chart nearby shows, we are on a completely unsustainable path that Congressman Mulvaney also understands must be stopped. If you take a look at this chart, according to the Congressional Budget Office, over the next 30 years, our projected deficit will total $103 trillion. That would be put on top of that $20 trillion in debt. It will be $10 trillion over the next 10 years, $28 trillion in the second decade, $66 trillion in the third decade. That is completely unsustainable.  By the way, the components of that $103 trillion deficit--$14 trillion in Social In other words, Social Security will pay out $14 trillion more in benefits than it takes in from the payroll tax over the next 30 years; Medicare, $34 trillion. The remainder of that $103 trillion is interest on the debt. If we want to avoid paying creditors more than $50 trillion in interest on our debt over the next 30 years, we need to address Social Security and Congressman Mulvaney wants to do that. He wants to save Social Security and Medicare--not demagogue it; save it.  As the Senator from New Hampshire was pointing out, we need economic growth. That is the 1 component of the solution. I don't care what problem I just mentioned above, economic growth is the primary component of the solution.  What is hampering our economy from growing? The fact is, since the Great Depression, our economy has averaged 3.2 percent annual real growth. Since the great recession, we have only been growing about 2 percent. I would argue that there are a number factors causing that tepid growth: overregulation, an uncompetitive tax system. We are not fully utilizing our energy resources. The Presiding Officer certainly understands that from his We are not utilizing our abundant energy resources. And of course there is this: our unsustained fiscal path, our $20 trillion in debt.  I oftentimes make the analogy between our national debt and a family in debt over their head. It is just a nation-state; it is just many, many, many[[Page S1200]]orders of magnitude larger. But the fact is, if you are a family in debt over your head, how can you grow your personal economy? All your disposable income is spent on the basics and servicing the debt. The same thing is true of a nation-state. Again, our enemies perceive that weakness caused by our indebtedness.  So when you take a look at the role of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, what we need to do to grow our economy comes under his jurisdiction basically. He has to address this deficit. He has to put forward a budget that is sustainable. Mick Mulvaney is dedicated to doing that.  Then, of course, the other thing the Office of Management and Budget is really designed to combat is overregulation. They are all about taking a look at cost-benefit and making sure the regulations that are implemented by this Federal Government are reasonable from a cost-benefit relationship. That has not been the case recently.  Just a couple of examples of how economic growth really is going to help solve this problem. If you go from 2 to 3 percent annual growth, that is $14 trillion in added economic benefit in just over a decade. If you go from 2 to 4 percent, that is $29 trillion. And even with the meager economic growth we have had since 2009, revenue to the Federal Government has increased by more than $1.1 trillion per year with meager economic growth. Just think of what would happen if we could reduce the regulatory burden, have a competitive tax system, and put our Federal Government on a sustainable fiscal path. Revenue would be flowing to the Federal Government, we could stop hollowing out our military, and we could start addressing these threats.  As to the regulatory burden, when we held hearings on this in my committee, the numbers showed that regulatory burden at $2 trillion per year. Just put that into perspective because I know we are getting immune to these massive numbers: $2 trillion is larger than all but 10 economies in the entire world. That is a self-imposed, self-inflicted wound on our economy. If you take that $2 trillion and divide it by the number of households in America, it is $14,800 per household. No American writes a check to the Federal Government to pay their share of the regulatory burden; instead, they realize that burden in reduced opportunities.  Why are wages stagnated? That is a good part of it--increased prices, and of course, again, those lower wages. It is a massive problem. One Wisconsin paper manufacturer I was talking to--and by the way, I can't tell you who because he fears retaliation by the government, which is a different subject--did a cost calculation of just four recently issued regulations and came up with a total cost of $12,000 per year per employee. There you go. That is money that could have been available for increasing wages or for investing in business to create better opportunities and better paying jobs. The regulatory burden is massive.  I had the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison come into my office during the last 2 years with the primary complaint--the primary ask--being to reduce that regulatory burden. Last year, she came in armed with a study commissioned by research universities that said that 42 percent of researcher time on Federal grants was spent complying with Federal regulations. Think of the opportunity cost of that overregulation. Those Federal grants are meant to pay for studies and doing research on curing diseases, not filling out Federal paperwork. So again, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget will take a look at those regulations, particularly now under this President, who has issued an Executive order to make sure that for every one regulation issued by a new agency, they have to remove two. That is a very good start. I would have gone with one-in, ten-out, but I will settle for one-in, two-out. I will certainly be supportive of an Office of Management and Budget that understands the incredible burden of overregulation on our economy.  During our committee markup--I heard earlier the Senator from Arkansas, who knows Congressman Mulvaney, served with him in the House, and understands how dedicated and serious Congressman Mulvaney is to stopping this mortgage of our children's future. Senator Lankford also had the opportunity to serve 4 years in the House with Representative This is what Senator Lankford had to say about his friend and colleague at the nomination hearing:       You were a serious student. You looked hard at difficult      issues. You understood that there were difficult decisions      that needed to be made and made proposals to do that.  In testimony before our committee, Congressman Mulvaney told my committee:       When President-elect Trump announced my nomination, he      noted that our nation was nearly $20 trillion in debt and      stated that I have the skills and convictions to responsibly      manage our nation's finances. I believe that is why he      nominated me for this position.  He went on to state:       For the first time in America's history, the next      generation could be less prosperous than the generation that      preceded it.  That is a very sad possibility. We need to prevent that.  He went on to say:       To me and to the people in this room, that is simply      unacceptable. We CAN turn this economy, and this country      around . . . but it will take tough decisions today in order      to avoid impossible ones tomorrow.  Congressman Mulvaney went on:       I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a      problem that must be addressed sooner, rather than later. I      also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way      Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy      economy.  Again, he fully understands the connection between our unsustainable fiscal path, our deficit, our debt, and economic growth. He said we ``must include changing our government's long-term fiscal path--which is unsustainable.''  Finally, he said:       I recognize that good public service--whether in a state      legislature, Congress, or OMB--takes both courage and wisdom.      The courage to lead, and the wisdom to listen. I have learned      that I do not have a monopoly on good ideas. Facts--and the      cogent arguments of others--matter. I will be loyal to the      facts and to the American people whom I serve.       My commitment to you today is to take a fact-based approach      to get our financial house in order.  This is exactly the type of person--Congressman Mick Mulvaney--somebody who is dedicated to solving these problems, who has the courage and the wisdom to stop mortgaging our children's future, to put America's budget on a sustainable fiscal path, to grow our economy, to make sure that future generations inherit a stronger, more prosperous  I am proud to support and I urge all my colleagues to support and vote for the confirmation of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the next Director of the Office of Management and  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

Over the last 8 years, we have seen the administration authorize hundreds of executive orders directing Federal agencies toissue, finalize, and implement an unprecedented number of regulations. Most of these impose one-size-fits-all standards on smallbusinesses with little to no consideration for their impact on small businesses.  As a member of the Small Business Committee, it is kind of my job to go out and find out what small businesses have tooffer, what is impeding their ability to create and make more jobs for our industry and for our economy. What we have found isthat overregulation is stifling them. This is the problem.  This is not something that we have made up. That is the problem in this economy. That is why I am proud to support H.5,and particularly title III, which addresses one vital area that protects small businesses--the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or The RFA requires agencies to assess the economic impacts of new regulations on small businesses. However, Federal agenciesregularly exploit loopholes in the RFA requirements that allow them to produce inadequate or inaccurate analysis of impact.

5039,topic-id,588,"Mr.President, last week I spoke about the importance of the rule of law in Guatemala and praised the work of Attorney General Thelma Aldana and the commissioner of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, Ivan These two individuals have helped to create hope among the Guatemalan people in the possibility of justice in a country where the justice system has too often been used to perpetuate corruption, impunity, and inequality.  The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, has been strongly supported by the United I commended President Morales when, shortly after taking office last January, he extended CICIG's mandate. He has affirmed that he supports CICIG's mandate through September 2019, for which, again, I commend him.  Last week, I expressed a concern that had been conveyed to me by several individuals that President Morales might recommend against renewal of Mr.Velasquez as commissioner beyond September 2017, when Mr.Velasquez's current term expires. In response, according to press reports, President Morales denied this and said he supports Mr.Velasquez for as long as Mr.Velasquez does the job he is supposed to do.  Ivan Velasquez is a respected former judge from Colombia who has carried out his responsibilities as the commissioner of CICIG with professionalism. He and Attorney General Aldana have collaborated on sensitive, complex cases, which until recently would never have been prosecuted in Guatemala, given its history of impunity. It is important that their collaboration continue for as long as possible.  I welcome President Morales's public statement of support for CICIG and for Mr.Velasquez, particularly at a time when the U.Congress is again being asked to provide hundreds of millions of dollars to support the Alliance for Prosperity That plan, which is in its early stages, has the potential to make progress in combating the poverty, lack of opportunity, inequality, violence, and impunity that are among the key contributors to migration from Central America to the United These are deeply rooted problems that the Central American countries and the United States have a strong interest in working together to address.  For the Alliance for Prosperity Plan to succeed, each of the Central American governments needs to take steps that their predecessors were unwilling or unable to take. Those steps include ensuring that senior government officials and their advisers are people of integrity; redefining the antagonistic relationship between government and civil society, to one of mutual respect for each other's legitimate role; fully supporting efforts to combat corruption by CICIG and by the Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras--El Salvador should also recognize the important role these entities are playing and support the establishment of a similar commission to combat corruption and impunity in that country--increasing the budget of the Office of the Attorney General, so they have the necessary personnel, training, equipment, and protection to carry out their responsibilities throughout the country, especially in areas where they have never had the resources to operate; supporting the independence of the judiciary, including the selection of judges based on their qualifications and the principle of equal access to justice; and building transparent and accountable institutions of democracy that can withstand attempts to subvert the rights of the people, including demilitarizing law enforcement and building professional, civilian police forces.  It is the responsibility of the Central American governments to take these steps and, by doing so, create the conditions for building more prosperous, equitable, and just societies. If they do that and they meet the other conditions in U.law, the United States should support them.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-30-pt1-PgS2148.txt,1383,REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACTOF 2017,2017.0,30.0,March
5101,topic-id,270,"Mr.Chairman, today I rise in strong support of the bill on the floor before us, the RegulatoryAccountability Act of 2017.  Over the last 8 years, it has been clear that our country has been on the wrong path. Through overregulation and governmentbureaucracy, the chance at the American Dream has seemed to be slipping away and unreachable for far too many InNovember, the American people spoke and made it clear: it is time to change course and reform the rulemaking process to energizerobust growth in the American economy.  To do so, we not only need to address the number of Federal regulations, but also their convoluted and complex nature. Ourconstituents should not need a law degree or an army of consultants and accountants to understand the rules they are required tofollow. Nevertheless, given their technical language, it can be extremely difficult to fully understand proposals unless one isan expert in that field.  Title VI of H.5 includes language from a bill that I introduced earlier in this My bill, the ProvidingAccountability Through Transparency Act, would require each Federal agency, when providing notice of a proposed rulemaking, toproduce a 100-word, plain-language summary of the proposal and make it publicly available online. This commonsense reform wouldgive the American people straightforward and uncomplicated access to the rules proposed by the executive branch.  The American people deserve to be informed about the rules and regulations being proposed by their government, and I amhonored to have my legislation included in this regulation-curbing package.  I thank Chairman Goodlatte for his leadership on H.5, as well as my colleagues who joined me in contributinglanguage to this critical legislation.

5087,topic-id,519,"I thank the chairman.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.5, the Regulatory Accountability  This bill represents a monumental opportunity for the American people. After 8 years of one new crushing regulatory burdenafter another, the time has come to finally free the American people and create a new future for our economy.  In 2017, regulatory burdens are at record levels. One recent analysis by the American Action Forum puts the cumulativepaperwork burden on the American people at 11.5 billion hours.  How could any small business person or entrepreneur survive in the face of this monstrous web of regulation?  The short answer is that they cannot.  It is a fact seen across my district as I have talked to workers covering every industry or occupation imaginable. When Iask businessowners about their concerns, first and foremost, the greatest hardship they face is the burden of Federal regulationand red tape. Funds, which otherwise could be invested in new employees, training, or equipment, must be dedicated to thedemands of faceless bureaucrats in D.This applies to plumbers as well as to farmers, manufacturers to home builders. The listof those affected is long and varied.  The simple truth is that the Obama administration's one-size-fits-all regulatory agenda has been a disaster for the AmericanDream, and we have seen over the past several months how disconnected it was from the wants and needs of Americans across thecountry.  In Congress, however, we have heard their pleas and have taken action in the early days of the 115th H.5 is thethird regulatory reform bill we have considered in 2 weeks. It represents our brightest opportunity to unleash innovation andinvestment so that American businesses, big and small, can create new futures.  I am also grateful that H.5 includes my bill, the REVIEW The REVIEW Act was featured as part of Speaker Ryan'sA Better Way agenda and passed the House on a bipartisan basis last fall. It represents a simple premise: regulations should benarrowly tailored, and massive regulations deserve full and thorough scrutiny.  The REVIEW Act would mandate a stay of any high-impact, billion-dollar regulation while judicial review is underway.Historically, billion-dollar rules have been few and far between. In fact, only 26 have been put in place since 2006; but, inrecent years, their frequency has grown along with the unprecedented reach of the regulatory state. In the past 8 years, anaverage of three per year have been put in place.  Their significance, however, lies in their impact on our country. These regulations are massive and have the potential tofundamentally and irreversibly change entire industries. If, later, judicial review finds the agency's reasoning to be legallyunsound or contrary to the intent of Congress, the[[Page H330]]compliance costs incurred--often meaning jobs that were lost--cannot beundone. The REVIEW Act provides an important check on regulatory largesse and is an important piece of this bill.  The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. It is time for us all to take our country and the economy inthe right direction. The Regulatory Accountability Act provides the reforms that are necessary to get us there.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH323-2.txt,2053,REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACTOF 2017,2017.0,11.0,February

4924,topic-id,3519,"Mr.President, I thank my friend from Missouri, and the Senate, for giving me this opportunity to speak. I rise to speak in opposition to the nomination of Representative Mick Mulvaney to be Director of the Office of Management and  Congressman Mulvaney represents the latest of President Trump's broken promises to the American people. In this case, it is President Trump's campaign promise to protect Social Security, and Congressman Mulvaney is the man who will lead the charge. The Office of Management and Budget, OMB, as it is called, is like that group of scientists in the movie ``Apollo 13'' who have to figure out how to bring the spacecraft home with only a few items found in a couple of boxes. In the movie, they describe it as fitting a square peg in a round hole. In government, we call it the Federal budget.  The crucial role of OMB and the development of the Federal budget means that the Director often has the final word on the priorities of our Federal agencies. The Director must be someone who will approach the enormity of the Federal Government in a thoughtful and deliberative manner. They must be able to consider how the budget will impact the everyday lives of all Representative Mulvaney's support for reckless, across-the-board cuts demonstrates that he is not up to this challenge.  Donald Trump campaigned on the promise that he would make no cuts to the Social Security safety net. That means no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Congressman Mulvaney's nomination shows that, despite what candidate Trump may have said, President Trump intends to do just the opposite. This is not what millions of people voted for. Mick Mulvaney's nomination has Americans across the country fearful for their futures, and they have every right to be scared.  Congressman Mulvaney represents an immediate threat to Social He represents a threat to the 1.2 million seniors in Massachusetts who currently rely on Social He represents a threat to the millions more who expect the program to be[[Page S1185]]there when they retire in coming years.  Mick Mulvaney has attempted to declare Social Security unconstitutional and has referred to the program as a Ponzi scheme. Well, Social Security is not a Ponzi scheme. Social Security is not a handout. Social Security is a promise we make to America's seniors after decades of hard work. It is the commitment we made to those who built this Nation, fought in wars, and provided for their families. Seniors pay into the system throughout their working lives, and they expect it to be there for them when they retire. We need to keep that promise.  Social Security is not just a line in the budget. It is a lifeline for millions of  In Massachusetts, the program keeps 295,000 people above the poverty line. Across the country, more than 15 million elderly Americans are able to live out their lives and not be driven into poverty because they have a Social Security check. That is what it does for 15 million Seniors will have nowhere to turn if President Trump and Representative Mulvaney have their way and Social Security ceases to exist. Congressman Mulvaney has repeatedly suggested raising the Social Security retirement age to 70 years old. Let me repeat that. Mick Mulvaney wants grandma and grandpa to wait until they are 70 years old--that is 4 years older than the current retirement age--before they can call upon the benefits they deserve.  Not only does Mick Mulvaney want to make it so Americans have to work longer, he wants them to receive less when they finally do retire. At his Budget Committee hearing, Mick Mulvaney said that he himself was willing to be subject to these new rules, since they might require him to work a couple of extra months before retirement and require his children to work until they are 70.  Nothing could be more out of touch with working-class, blue-collar workers across our country. I have no doubt that Mick Mulvaney would be able to work a few extra years in his current role as a Congressman or Director of OMB or a great job that he would get after those responsibilities, but what about millions of construction workers, carpenters, waitresses, gardeners, busdrivers, and others with physically demanding jobs? My father, a milkman--how many years can you work being a milkman? You have to go until you are 70 to receive a Social Security benefit in this country in the future? That is the challenge we have. We ask milkmen, we ask 69-year-old construction workers to lay cement in blistering summer heat because Social Security is no longer there when it is promised. Do we expect a 68-year-old window washer to climb the scaffolding every day when they cannot afford to retire without their Social Security benefits? We should not balance the budget on their backs. That is just plain wrong.  Raising the Social Security retirement age is just one of many of President Trump's broken promises. He also wants to cut Medicare and the health care of millions of Congressman Mulvaney looks ready to do the President's bidding as well.  Congressman Mulvaney has said we need to end Medicare as we know it and supported House Speaker Paul Ryan's destructive ideas to turn Medicare into a voucher program. Congressman Mulvaney went even further saying that those efforts did not go far enough. Those kinds of cuts to Medicare would be nothing short of a disaster for the 55 million Americans enrolled in the program, including the more than 1 million individuals in Massachusetts who rely on Medicare for their health care needs.  Seniors deserve an OMB Director who will protect their health care, not put it on the chopping block. We know Congressman Mulvaney is deeply committed to these misguided ideas because we have seen how far he is willing to go to support them. He was one of the few key cheerleaders of the Republican government shutdown in 2013. He was willing to put millions of American families, businesses, and services at risk in order to defund the Affordable Care  That shutdown cost the United States more than $24 billion. At that time, Congressman Mulvaney said it was good policy. He said it was all worth it in order to prove a point. That simply is irresponsible. That kind of recklessness has no place in the Office of Management and Congressman Mulvaney also does not believe in raising the debt limit.  Back in 2011, he put the economy at risk when Republicans held our debt limit hostage. He put the full faith and credit of the United States in danger by his willingness to allow the Treasury to default. That would have wreaked havoc on the financial markets and could have destabilized our entire economy, but Congressman Mulvaney dismissed these concerns and called the potential breach of the debt limit a fabricated crisis. Nothing could be more fiscally irresponsible and further from the truth.  Congressman Mulvaney is not the type of leadership Americans expect in their government, and he is not the type of leadership needed to direct the Office of Management and Strong leadership is especially crucial at the Office of Management and Budget, where responsible oversight of the regulatory process is a requirement of the Director's job. The individual in charge must be willing to make fair determinations based on facts and evidence.  Congressman Mulvaney's record gives me no confidence that he will meet this standard. Congressman Mulvaney also dismisses accepted science and rejects established facts. He has stated global warming is based on questionable science and has outright dismissed the threat that climate change imposes on the planet. OMB oversees agencies' use of the social cost of carbon, the Federal metric that assigns a dollar value for future damages to each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere. We need an OMB Director who accepts the consequences of climate change because it will be the most vulnerable in our society who will pay the highest price if we ignore climate science and the danger it poses, not only to our own country but to the rest of the planet.  Our country faces serious challenges that require the careful and nonpartisan allocation of resources. We need a Director of the Office of Management and Budget who will hear the concerns of all Americans, not promote dangerous fiscal ideologies. Congressman Mulvaney has indicated that he will approach our budget with an ax, and it will be our seniors who will be first on the chopping block. I do not believe he is qualified to lead the Office of Management and  I do so remembering 1981 and 1982. Ronald Reagan arrived, and Ronald Reagan had a very simple plan for He was going to do three things fundamentally; 1, massive tax cuts for the wealthiest and biggest corporations in America; 2, simultaneously increasing defense spending massively; 3, to simultaneously pledge that he was going to balance the budget while unleashing massive economic growth in our country.  What he did then was to put together a team that had a remarkable ability to harness voluminous amounts of information to defend that knowingly erroneous premise. You cannot say you are heading toward balancing the budget if you are simultaneously saying: I am going to give massive tax breaks to those who need them the least and massive defense increases, which are going to further lead to Federal expenditures, because then you have to turn and you have to cut programs. You have to cut You have to cut Social You have to cut the You have to cut Head You have to cut food stamps. You have to cut programs for the poorest. You have to cut all of those investments in science in the future. You have to cut and cut and cut.  That really was not the goal because ultimately Ronald Reagan just retreated from the cuts because the pressure came from across America, but he had accomplished his principal goal, which was the massive defense increases and the tax cuts for the wealthy because that was the real agenda all along.  So there is a great book, ``The Triumph of Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution Failed,'' by David He was the head of OMB for Ronald Reagan back in the early 1980s. He wrote a book in 1986 about his experiences with this failed economic philosophy. It is a blistering, scalding indictment of what they tried to do in 1981[[Page S1186]]and 1982. He wrote this as a warning to the future, about why we should not try to repeat what Reagan tried to do in 1981 and 1982.  What he talks about in the book is this. The same kind of made-up numbers to put a Panglossian--rose-colored glasses--the most optimistic projection on what would happen to our economy if we had these massive tax cuts and increases in defense spending, while pretending that we were going to do all of these other things, which actually never did occur.  So he said, because the numbers did not add up, they had to engage in a lot of fiscal chicanery. What he did was he constructed two little separate categories. 1, he called it the magic asterisk. The magic asterisk was this attempt to avoid ever specifically having to itemize all of the budget cuts that would cause a revolution in America because they knew they could not put that list out.  So they called it a magic asterisk--cuts to be named later, programs to be cut later. We all know the names of those programs--Medicare, Medicaid, education, Environmental Protection Agency, Head Start, all the way down the line--but we will just hide the ball on that.  Secondly, he constructed another idea, he said, which was also fraudulent, which was called ``rosy scenario.'' What they would do is, they would put together a group of economists who would then, using completely bogus projections for the future, project massive economic growth. That is what Donald Trump talks about now: Oh, we will see growth that you have never seen before in the history of mankind--rosy scenario.  There is no economic data to back it up, but that is just how much Trump is trying to model himself after this attempt in 1981 and 1982 to sell the exact same bill of goods, which collapsed, by the way. They collapsed like a house of cards economically because it did not add up. You cannot have a magic asterisk for all of these cuts that are never going to happen because ultimately the Democrats are going to back down the  We are going to back them down on cutting We are going to back them down on cutting education. We are going to back them down on cutting the budget for all of these great programs. We are going to have this battle. They already know it, but it is not going to stop them in terms of the first two programs, the tax cuts and the defense increases. They are going to still try to ram them through. That just creates bigger and bigger and bigger deficits.  The only way they can get away with it is if they can project massive economic growth in our country, which is the ``rosy scenario.'' Then you have a bunch of economists who are kind of supply-siders who kind of look back at the 1980s and ask: Can't we go back to the Reagan era again and repeat that?  You don't want to repeat it. The guy who put the program together said: Please don't do that again. Please don't do that again. He said here: Ronald Reagan chose not to be a leader but a politician, and in doing so, showed why passion and imperfection, not reason and doctrine, rule the world. ``His obstinacy,'' said David Stockman, ``was destined to keep America's economy hostage to the errors of his advisers for a long, long time.''  Mark Twain used to say that ``history doesn't repeat itself, but it does tend to rhyme.'' So, yes, this isn't exactly like Ronald Reagan in 1981 and 1982, but it rhymes with 1981 and 1982. It rhymes with it. They are trying to argue economics like lawyers, right? Politicians, PR people. Sell the bill of goods. Donald Trump calls it ``truthful hyperbole,'' like when he is selling a piece of property. Well, the United States is not a piece of property. The American economy is not a piece of property. It is the central organizing principle for all of the hopes and all of the dreams of every person who lives in our country.  You cannot allow for knowingly false premises to be advanced, and that is what Congressman Mulvaney will represent in this entire process if he is confirmed as the new head of the Office of Management and He represents someone who is going to reach back into time to this era which has already been shown to have completely failed and repeat the exact same experiment again. The American people just can't run the risk because ultimately the economic catastrophe--the impact on ordinary families--would be so great that ultimately we would look back and say that this Senate failed, that we did not discharge our responsibilities to those families.  So from my perspective, I stand out here knowing that once again we are faced with this prospect of repeating David Stockman's book ``The Triumph of Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution Failed'' and knowing that when Donald Trump said: Oh, don't worry, I am going to take care of you, ordinary Americans; you are going to get the biggest tax breaks--they are not. That is not his plan.  Oh, don't worry. I am going to give you better healthcare. I am going to give you more coverage for your families.  That is not going to happen. That is not his plan.  I am going to give you cleaner air and cleaner water. It is going to be the best. It is going to be the greatest.  That is not going to happen.  It is the triumph of politics. It is the triumph of the special interests, of the oil and gas industry, of the defense establishment that wants bigger and more contracts, of the wealthiest who want big tax breaks. It is the triumph of politics--the politics of the most powerful, of the wealthiest, of the most entrenched. That is what this Trump administration is already about, and they are going to continue to say: Don't worry. Your healthcare will be better. Your air will be cleaner. Your children will be safer. Social Security will be protected.  But then who gets named to run the Office of Management and Budget? Somebody who wants to raise the retirement age to 70; someone who wants to fundamentally change Medicare as we know it; somebody who has an agenda that looks a lot like 1981 and 1982 in the Reagan years, very much like it.  So is there anything new here? Is this just a sales job, a con job? Because when you pull back the covers and you look at what is about to unfold, it is something that is going to be very destructive of our economy. It is going to further income inequality across our country. It is going to reduce opportunity for every child in our country. Rather than democratizing access to opportunity through healthcare and education, they are going to work systematically to undermine those opportunities, to reduce the chances that they can maximize their God-given abilities.  That is why this nomination is so important, because the OMB controls the Federal budget. That is all the hopes and all the dreams. That is where the money goes. Who gets it? What are the incentives?  Right now, once again, Donald Trump is embracing Ronald Reagan's trickle-down economics: the more money you give to the people who are already rich, the more it will trickle down to ordinary folks.  We don't hear him saying: Oh, don't worry, the overwhelming majority of these tax breaks are going to go to the blue-collar people in our country. You are not going to hear him say that. And when you look at all the proposals they have made, it always goes to the corporations, it always goes to the upper 1 or 2 percentile.  Those promises he made are just the same as David Stockman's and Ronald Reagan's back in 1981 and 1982--identical almost down to the final detail--and are just as guaranteed to fail.  We have Congressman Mulvaney who has been nominated. And give him credit--he is actually honest about what he believes. He is actually very clear in his explanation of what the goals are going to be for our country if he is confirmed and can partner with Donald Trump to implement this agenda. We give him credit for his honesty, but it is only honesty in saying that he is going to defend a set of economic assumptions that are completely and totally fallacious and have already been disproved in the marketplace--the political marketplace.  So all I can say here is that it would be reckless of the Senate to deliver over to the American people once again someone whose intent is to try to take this formula which gathers voluminous amounts of information to defend knowingly erroneous premises.[[Page S1187]]  You cannot have massive tax cuts and massive increases in defense spending and balance the budget without killing all of these programs that almost every American family relies on, beginning with Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, education programs, all the way down. We can't do it.  So that is why we are fighting out here. We are fighting to make sure we don't repeat the same history we have already lived through.  By the time Reagan reached near the end of his career, guess what he did. He changed and began to acclimate himself to reality. He began to accept, through a group of new advisers, the actual impact his initial policies were having. And that is all we are trying to do right now. We are trying to start out where we are going to be forced to wind up anyway. Why not do that since we have already learned the lesson? Why not have those lessons of the past be implemented? But no. They are committed to a repetition syndrome, a reenactment of what has already occurred, rather than a reconciliation with history, learning from it and then trying to move forward in a way which is wise, protective of every  I stand here to oppose Congressman Mulvaney's nomination for the Office of Management and I do not believe it would be a good thing for our country, for our economy. This is just too dangerous a roll of the dice with our entire So I say to the Senate, please vote to reject this nomination, and ask the President to nominate someone who does reflect the best economic values that our country has.  With that, I yield to the Senator from Washington State, ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1175-2.txt,735,REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACTOF 2017,2017.0,15.0,January

This effort, this advice and consent responsibility held by the Senate, is one that was anticipated by our Founders to be used rarely because the very existence of this power, they felt, would ensure that a President would nominate people who are appropriately suited to the post they would hold.

On the third anniversary of the Social Security Act, in 1938, Franklin Roosevelt pointed out: ``Men and women too old and infirm to work either depended on those who had but little to share, or spent their remaining years within the walls of a poorhouse.''  That is not the vision we have today. Thanks to Social Security, our seniors have a basic income to see them through their golden years. They can live out their lives in relative comfort and security, rather than, as Franklin Roosevelt put it, ``within the walls of a poorhouse.''  In 2016, roughly 61 million Americans received over $900 billion in Social Security benefits. That is a huge injection into our economy, and it is spent almost immediately on fundamental goods. Nearly 9 out of 10 Americans older than 65 receive Social Security benefits, and for one-quarter of our Social Security beneficiaries, including both those who are single and those who are married, Social Security accounts for virtually their entire income. That would be many millions--more than 15 million Americans who would definitely be struggling in the most difficult fashion financially if Social Security didn't exist.  Retired workers and their dependents account for about 71 percent of the benefits paid. Funds also go to disabled workers. Disabled workers and their dependents account for about 16 percent of the benefits. Survivors of deceased workers account for another 13 percent or roughly one-eighth of the benefits paid.  Simply put, Social Security assists our retired workers, our disabled workers, and the survivors of our deceased workers. It is one of the best ideas America has ever put forward, but Congressman Mulvaney doesn't agree. He sees Social Security as a Ponzi scheme. Let me explain what a Ponzi scheme is. A Ponzi scheme is something where the incoming amount raised immediately pays for the benefits of somebody who paid in money previously.  We actually have a Social Security trust fund, which is the difference between Mick Mulvaney's description of Social Security and what we actually have. If we made no changes, no changes at all to increase the lifetime of the trust fund, it would continue to be able to pay 100 percent of the benefits through 2034 and roughly three-[[Page S1209]]quarters of all benefits currently promised ever after. That is if we make no changes.  If we make small changes, our Social Security trust fund is solvent for decades and decades into the future. Certainly, I think we should aspire to that vision of a trust fund that has a 75-year horizon, a full solvency.  The issue that Congressman Mulvaney raises, the idea he raises for changing how we adjust Social Security, however, isn't one of increasing the amount of wages that are subject to Social Security tax; it is not one of putting premiums on the income earned through nonwages, which is primarily income raised by wealthier Instead, it is to say to folks: Just retire later.  When you are a white-collar worker and you work in an office that is nicely air-conditioned and you have had full healthcare benefits throughout your entire life, maybe when you get into your sixties, you say, ``Well, maybe I could keep working a little longer,'' but the reality for a huge percentage of Americans who work difficult jobs, who work jobs where their bodies wear out, they don't have the choice of simply saying: I will retire in another 5 years, because they literally have developed so many issues and challenges that it is impossible to do the same kind of work they did in their twenties and their thirties in their sixties.  So that strategy of moving the goalpost on American workers, many of whom are decades already into the work they are doing, doesn't fulfill the promise and the vision of the Social Security  While Social Security is a great idea, moving the retirement age to age 70--which Mick Mulvaney advocates for, from his view as someone who comes from a job that perhaps isn't as arduous as many jobs in America--is a bad idea.  This vision continues on into Like Social Security, Medicare is also a generational promise, a lifeline for countless Americans since President Johnson signed it into law now more than five decades ago. Over 55 million Americans rely on Medicare for their health and their financial security. Roughly, 46 million are older Americans, 9 million are younger Americans with disabilities or certain illnesses.  While this program has worked incredibly well, our nominee wants to ``end Medicare as we know it.'' Those are ominous words for the 55 million Americans relying on He also believes we have to raise the retirement age.  He told Bloomberg News in 2011: ``You have to raise the retirement age, lower a payout, change the reimbursement system.''  The problem with raising the retirement age is the same problem we have with Social For American workers working hard in many types of jobs, their bodies are worn out. I used to have folks come to my townhalls and say: Senator, I am just trying to stay alive until I get to age 65, and they would tell me how they had multiple diseases and they were choosing between which disease to treat or how they had a single significant problem, but they were deciding to skip their pills every other day or cut their pills in half or perhaps go a week without their pills at all or how they were choosing not to go to the doctor when they developed a difficulty because they were afraid they wouldn't be able to afford the payment. That is not a healthcare system, but Mick Mulvaney wants to say to those folks: Oh, you reached age 65, too bad. I am providing this healthcare program another 5 years into the future. That is simply wrong, but more than wrong, it is also in direct contradiction to the promises made by President Trump during his campaign.  The contrast is incredibly stark between the President's promise to Americans that unlike so many of the folks in his party, he would not be the one to promote tearing down Medicare and Social He would not be the one to promote advancing the retirement age so people who are struggling have to struggle for another 5 years. So it is a poor fit between this individual and the office and the promises made to the American people.  Another concern I have is in regard to Congressman Mulvaney's advocacy for shutting down the economy. He seems very comfortable playing Russian roulette with our economy. He and a group of other House Members brought our government to a screeching halt in 2013 because they wanted to defund the Affordable Care What is the Affordable Care Act? The Affordable Care Act has enabled 20 million Americans to gain access to healthcare that they didn't have previously.  In my home State of Oregon, the Affordable Care Act has enabled about one-half million people to gain access to healthcare, both through expansion of Medicaid, known as the Oregon Health Plan, and also through the healthcare exchange and marketplace where you can compare one policy to another, shop for the policy that best fits your family, and those of modest means get credit to help pay for those policies so they can actually afford them. It is an affordable care plan that provides for a healthcare set of benefits--benefits such as the ability to keep your children on your policy through age 26, benefits such as not having an annual limit or a lifetime limit on your policy so that when you do get seriously ill, you don't run out of healthcare partway into treating your disease. It is the Affordable Care Act that ends gender discrimination in the insurance marketplaces. It is the Affordable Care Act that says if you have a preexisting condition, you can still get insurance.  I was at a fundraising walk for a woman who had a family member with multiple sclerosis. It was a fundraiser for multiple sclerosis. She said: Senator, this year is so different from last year. That was the year before the Affordable Care Act was implemented. I asked: How so? She said: A year ago, if your loved one was diagnosed with MS and they had insurance, you knew there was a good chance that your insurance was going to run out at the end of the year or they would hit a lifetime limit, and they wouldn't be able to pay for the care they needed. She said: If you didn't have insurance, you now have a preexisting condition that would prevent you from ever getting insurance.  She went on to say that the difference between last year and this year, because of the Affordable Care Act, is that now members in the MS community--those who had the disease and their family members who were supporting them all out at this fundraising walk--now knew their loved one would have the peace of mind that they would get the care they needed. This is what a healthcare system is all about, peace of mind, but Mick Mulvaney wanted to tear away that peace of mind. He proceeded to support a 16-day government shutdown that cost our country $24 billion--and to what purpose? To rip peace of mind away from 20 million  Back in 2015, he threatened to do it all again. The damage he had done--the $24 billion he had stolen from the American Treasury in the context of damaging the government with that shutdown--he was ready to do it all again in order to make sure Planned Parenthood never gets a dime from the government. To be clear, not a single dime from the government goes to Planned Parenthood for abortions. In fact, the organization that has done more to decrease abortions than any other in our country is Planned The government funds go for different purposes. They go to Planned Parenthood to do cancer screenings, breast cancer screenings, prostate cancer screenings, and a whole host of fundamental basic healthcare. They are the healthcare provider for 2.5 million American women. Just as he was ready to recklessly shut down the government to rip healthcare away from 20 million Americans in 2013, he was ready to defund these essential healthcare clinics serving 2.5 million Americans in 2015. That is a sign of someone who has lost their policy foundations and is acting in an irresponsible and unacceptable manner.  Let's talk a little bit about the Consumer Financial Protection The CFPB was in response to a big problem in America, which was that we had no one looking out to shut down predatory financial practices. It was the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, but the Federal Reserve had their conversation on monetary policy up in the penthouse--the top level, if you will. That is what the Chairman of the Federal Reserve paid attention to.[[Page S1210]]They took the responsibility for consumer protection and put them down in the basement, and they locked the door and threw away the key.  Folks kept coming to the Federal Reserve saying: Hey, there is a major concern here. We have these predatory mortgages that have these teaser rates, and they are going to destroy the families who get those mortgages. They are going to destroy their dream of homeownership and turn it into a nightmare. People went to the Federal Reserve and said: By the way, we now have these wire loans, where there is no documentation of income and people are being sold these loans that they have no hope of repaying. In addition, we have another predatory practice called steering payments, which are kickbacks to originators. So they are getting kickbacks to steer people into subprime loans with high interest rates rather than prime loans that they qualify for. What happened? The Federal Reserve ignored all of that. That is the foundation for the collapse of our economy in 2008.  So along comes Elizabeth Elizabeth Warren, as an advocate, not yet a Senator, comes to this body and said: We need an agency whose mission is to look out and stop predatory financial practices, a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and we got it done.  What does Mick Mulvaney say about this effort to stop predatory financial practices? He says it is a ``sick, sad joke.'' So I asked him about this in committee. I said: Really? This is an agency that finally is watching out for working families so they are not prey to predatory, fraudulent practices. And he said: Yes, ``a sick, sad joke.''  I said: You know, they have returned funds to 27 million What other agency has fought for Americans in that fashion--returned funds to them from folks who were operating in a predatory fashion, to 27 million I didn't change his view by raising that.  I said: You know, this agency, to those 27 million people, has returned $12 billion. There was $12 billion returned to people who were cheated; isn't that a good thing? But I didn't persuade him.  He said: You know, I don't like the way this agency is set up. I want it to be a commission rather than an individual who heads it, and I want the funds to be appropriated annually by  I can tell you exactly why he wants those provisions, because that is the way Congress, at the behest of Wall Street, can step on the airhose that supplies the oxygen to They can stop the CFPB from functioning as a guardian, as a watchdog for consumers in America by simply defunding it.  We have a President who ran on the principle of taking on Wall Street, but Mick Mulvaney doesn't want to take on Wall He wants to do their bidding, to be able to shut down this agency that is finally fighting for financial fairness for working families. We have a President who said he is going to fight for working families. Mick Mulvaney should be backing the He should be expanding the He should be championing the CFPB, but, no, he wants to tear it down. That is deeply disturbing.  I see my colleague, the Senator from Hawaii, who is prepared to make remarks. I am going to wrap up my remarks.  There are more concerns that I have about the policy perspectives and how out of sync this nominee is with the promises the President made to fight for working Americans, the promises he made to take on Wall Street, the promises he made to protect Social Security, the promises he made to strengthen Medicare, not to tear it down. So for all these reasons, I find Mick Mulvaney is not the right person to fill this post, and I encourage my colleagues to vote against confirming him in this capacity.

4892,topic-id,348,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.37. I am proud to join Chairwoman Foxx and Chairmen Chaffetz and Chabot as an original cosponsor.  H.37 would void the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule, commonly known as the blacklisting rule. The blacklisting rule is an additional layer of Federal bureaucracy that crushes the ability of small and midsize companies to compete for Federal contracts and adversely impacts timing and efficient procurement while massively increasing costs.  The blacklisting rule requires Federal contractors to report violations, including alleged violations of 14 Federal labor laws and equivalent State laws, over the previous 3 years. Contractors have to collect that information from all of their subcontractors, and they are liable for that information, placing a huge administrative burden on those contractors. Also, not only when they bid for the contract, but every 6 months, they must renew that information.  Federal contract officers--by the way, there are over 37,000 of them, an amazing number--would then be required to consult with newly created labor compliance advisers. Yes, it creates more bureaucrats.  The final rule, itself, estimates costs for contractors and subcontractors of more than $458 million in the first year--a half a billion dollars--and more than $413 million in the second year. Amazing costs. This compliance cost is catastrophic for small and midsize businesses.  Those who deny workers basic protections are already protected by the suspension and debarment process. The blacklisting rule is simply another bureaucratic hoop. In 2015, nearly 1,000 suspensions and 2,000 debarments were undertaken. Put simply, the suspension and debarment system has worked to protect workers and government.[[Page H911]]  Moreover, the rule requires contractors and subcontractors to report on alleged labor law violations and violations that have not been fully adjudicated. A business could be deemed ineligible for a Federal contract, or blacklisted, because the contractor reported alleged labor law violations while still exercising their legal right to pursue adjudication. That is antithetical to our  H.37 will remove a regulation that raises serious due process concerns, duplicates existing enforcement mechanisms, increases the cost of Federal contracting, and expands the Federal bureaucracy.

4925,topic-id,906,"Mr.President, before I begin to speak about the nomination before us right now, I did want to comment on the breaking news regarding the nomination of Andrew  There is some good news today for workers and women and families in Back on the campaign trail, President Trump promised to put workers first, but from the start, it has been pretty clear that his nominee for Secretary of Labor, who has now withdrawn, was a clear signal that President Trump had no intention of keeping that promise, and instead he planned to rig his Cabinet with the staunchest allies for Wall Street--big corporations and special interests--that he could find.  So I am not surprised that when workers and families heard about the pride Mr.Puzder takes in objectifying women, that he called his own workers ``the best of the worst,'' and that his vision for our economy is one in which workers are squeezed so those at the top can boost their profits higher and higher, they said no. They spoke up loud and clear that they want a true champion for all workers in the Labor  I just want to thank all the workers who bravely shared their stories in the last few months. It is clear today that your words are powerful, and I am going to keep bringing your voices here to the Senate, and we will keep fighting.  With that, Mr.President, I wanted to be here today to speak about OMB Director Nominee I submitted comments on this nomination in the Budget Committee, and I want to bring them to the full Senate today.  I am here today to urge my colleagues to oppose Congressman Mr.President, we all know that a budget is more than just numbers on a page; a budget represents our values and our priorities, the kind of Nation we are now and the kind of Nation we want to be.  Congressman Mulvaney is not shy about where he stands on this. When I sat down with him a couple of weeks ago, he made it very clear that he would use our budget to radically reshape our country in a way that I believe would be devastating to families, to seniors, to veterans, to the middle class, and to many others.  Congressman Mulvaney has said he wants to make drastic, radical cuts to Federal investments, trillions of dollars across the board. His budget proposals would slash Federal funding for education, leaving students across the country with fewer opportunities to learn and to succeed. They would cut investments in jobs and training, leaving our workers scrambling to keep up with the changing economy. They would eliminate support for children and families who need a hand up to get back on their feet. They would eliminate basic medical research that creates jobs and leads to lifesaving cures. They would continue the work President Trump has done to destroy healthcare in America and create even more chaos and confusion. They would lead to dramatic cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, betraying the commitments we have made to our seniors and so much more. He wants to do that while giving away even more tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations and has proposed raising the Social Security retirement age to 70, causing millions of Americans to drop under the poverty line. In other words, Congressman Mulvaney's nomination is another perfect example of how President Trump is breaking the promises he made on the campaign trail to stand with workers and seniors and the middle class.  Just a few years ago, Congressman Mulvaney was at the fringes of the Republican He is one of the most extreme members of the tea party wing of the party who supported the government shutdown when others were working to end it; who failed to show the proper concern about a potentially catastrophic breach of the debt limit and remains cavalier even now, telling me he would advise the President against accepting a clean debt limit; who, by the way, isn't even willing to support the budget deal I reached with Speaker He is someone whom responsible members of his own Republican Party scorned just a few years ago and whose budget ideas they rejected as damaging, unworkable, and political suicide. But now he is the person whom Republicans are holding up as a budget leader.  As we see this nomination, as we see Republicans use the budget process to slam through a partisan plan to destroy our healthcare system, it is clearer than ever how far the Republican Party has moved, even from the days of our bipartisan budget deal.  Finally, I am extremely troubled by Congressman Mulvaney's failure to pay taxes and comply with the law. I know I am not the only one who has been here long enough to see Cabinet nominees withdraw over less egregious breaches than this. Congressman Mulvaney's motivations, explanations, and defenses have not been credible. It is hard to believe that every single one of my Republican colleagues feels comfortable with someone with such a serious lapse of judgment in charge of the budget of this administration.  I voted against Congressman Mulvaney in the Budget Committee for those reasons and more, and I am here today to oppose his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Certainly, we can do better than this.  Thank you, Mr.President, and I yield the floor.

Dear Representative: The AFL-CIO urges you to oppose the      Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval of the      regulations implementing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces      Executive       The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces regulations implement the      common-sense proposition that companies wanting to receive      lucrative taxpayer-funded government contracts should comply      with the law and respect workers' rights. The Executive Order      and implementing regulations establish a process for      reviewing the records of companies bidding for federal      business and ensuring that companies that receive this      business comply with the law and respect workers' rights. The      regulations improve the contracting process and establish      more fairness, so that companies that respect workers' rights      do not have a competitive disadvantage when competing against      companies that cheat by misclassifying their workers as      independent contractors, ignoring health and safety hazards,      or engaging in wage theft. Repealing these regulations will      remove an important incentive for companies to pay their      workers what they are due, protect their health and safety,      and comply with the law.       The regulations are needed because the current procurement      system does an inadequate job screening prospective      contractors and their compliance (or non-compliance) with the      law. According to the U.Government Accountability Office,      federal contracts have been awarded to companies with      significant records of violating wage and hour, health and      safety, and other worker protection laws. A report by the      Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions similarly      found that the government regularly awards federal contracts      to companies with significant violations of worker protection      laws.       Wiping out these regulations using the Congressional Review      Act is a draconian and unnecessary act. If Congress adopts      this resolution, agencies will be forever barred from      adopting similar regulations in the future. This is overkill.      If Congress has concerns about aspects of the regulations, it      can work with the Trump Administration to modify those      provisions through the regular rulemaking process. Congress      should not use the blunt instrument of the CRA to wipe out      the rules and prevent their adoption in the future.

Mr.Speaker, today, I rise to discuss our commitment to civility, a promise that I have made to my constituents at home and a promise that I have made to my colleagues here in Washington, D. Prior to my being sworn in, during my campaign of 2016, the number one question I heard and I received from the people in my district on the Central Coast of California was: Why would you want to go to Washington, D.C., right now?  I heard that over and over and over. I heard that people were dissatisfied with the dysfunction in I heard that they were disgusted with the partisanship of I heard that they were disheartened with our system of government. And I believe that it is that sentiment that lent to the denouement of November 8.  I admit I was disappointed by the Presidential election, and I believe that partisanship that was displayed during that election continued in Washington, D.It started when I got here for new Member orientation.  When we got here as freshmen, Republicans and Democrats, we were automatically split up. I did not get to know my fellow freshmen Republican colleagues here in D.It wasn't until we went on to Boston and Virginia that we actually took time to get to know each other, where they are from, and what they were about.  What I can tell you--the thing that I say that gives hope to so many people--is that my freshman class heard the exact same things during this past election: That it is time that we get things done and that we do it together.  Now, I believe that once we get past these turbulent times at this point, I do hope we can work together on issues that affect our country, be it immigration reform, investment in our infrastructure, and ensuring that our health care is not just accessible but affordable.                              {time}  1715  But I also realize, as many of you, that that is easier said than done.

4936,topic-id,2000,"Mr.President, I rise tonight to speak about the opportunity our country has to move this country forward.  I appreciate the comments by my good friend from I appreciate all the comments in this hallowed ground called the U.But I have to say that while I agree on some points, I disagree on others.  The one I am really troubled by tonight is the fact the other side is creating the ultimate shutdown in government right now. We had an election. Our democracy has worked. We have a new person in the White We have a new direction for our country. Yet this person in the White House cannot even get his team approved in the U. After some 27 days, I think President Obama had 26 of his Cabinet and other appointees already confirmed. At this point, President Trump has only 13 of his nominees. Quite frankly, had we not turned the Senate on 24/7 over the last few weeks, it would be until June or July of this year before we could get the full slate of just the 15 Cabinet officers confirmed. That is no way to run the Federal Government and, indeed, shows the hypocrisy of the other side. They complain about shut down this and shut down that. What is happening right now in the U.Senate is that the[[Page S1204]]other side is shutting down this administration from getting on with the people's business of what they elected him to do.  Today, after 8 years of failed fiscal policies that have produced the weakest recovery in 70 years, the lowest GDP growth on a per capita basis in our history, a devastating time that left 4 million women in poverty after the last 8 years and left many people struggling to get from payday to payday--after those 8 years, tonight I am actually very encouraged to finally be debating pro-growth tax ideas that can actually grow the economy and put people back to work. We now have an enormous moment of opportunity to change the direction of our country and unleash a new era of economic growth and prosperity for every  President Trump has repeatedly said that job one is growing the economy. Personally, having worked in most parts of the world in my career, I see this so differently from My perspective is that of someone who has a global business perspective, not unlike that of our I know the way forward is not complicated. We absolutely can grow this economy.  There are three things this administration is already talking about to grow the economy: One, they have said we need to deal with this archaic, outdated, and noncompetitive tax structure that we have; second, we need to push back on these arcane regulations that have sucked the very life out of our economy; third, we need to unleash the God-given energy potential that we have in our country today. The bottom line is we have to create a more level playing field generated by trade negotiations to allow us to compete on a level playing field with the rest of the world.  The first two pieces of these changes are the changes to the Tax Code and rolling back the regulatory regime. Several ideas from both President Trump and Congress have surfaced in recent days to improve our Tax Code: 1, lowering individual rates and cleaning up some of the deductions to simplify the individual code; 2, lowering the corporate tax rate to become more competitive with the rest of the world and cleaning up corporate welfare deductions that confuse the competition among players here at home and create winners and losers inadvertently; and, 3, dealing with the archaic repatriation tax. We are the last country in the world that has this tax, and it penalizes our companies for competing abroad.  These three components of changing the Tax Code will make us more competitive with the rest of the world, stimulate economic investment, and spawn a new era of economic innovation in These changes would help millions of Americans who have been crushed by this stagnant economy for much too long.  I am encouraged that today there are so many of my colleagues in Congress interested in generating new pro-growth ideas. It is a new day in  I have long been an advocate of simplifying the way we fund our Federal In my opinion, the best way to do that is ideally with a new system, like the fair tax, for example, which would move us to a totally new tax system and completely eliminate the personal, corporate, and payroll taxes we suffer through to date. I think all of these ideas need to be considered, and none should be taken off the table arbitrarily.  Having said that, one idea bears much scrutiny at this point in time, and that is the so-called border adjustment tax now being discussed in It would hammer consumers, shut down economic growth, and ultimately grow the size of government.  In the last 16 years, under both Republican and Democratic Presidents, the Federal Government has grown from $2.4 trillion in constant dollars to $3.8 trillion last year--some 60 percent growth in just two Presidencies, one Republican and one  Tax schemes similar to the border adjustment tax in Europe grew the size of those governments in Europe by more than 60 percent. That is the last thing we need to be talking about right now, after we just experienced a similar type of growth in our government over the last 16 years. Growing government with a new layer of complexity on top of our existing income tax system is the last thing we need to be doing at this point in time, when we should be talking about, How do we downsize the Federal Government, make our system more competitive with the rest of the world, create jobs, and create the atmosphere for capital formation and innovation again?  Historically, lawmakers have crammed numerous proposals into single, massive, overreaching bills. It is the Washington way. Those bills have often hurt the very people that they claim to champion. When bad ideas get mixed with good ideas, the bad ideas oftentimes become law. That is exactly what could happen here if changes to the individual code, the corporate rate, the repatriation tax, and this border adjustment tax are combined into one sweeping bill. This is exactly what Washington has historically done, and the results have been devastating.  Each of these proposals could be considered independently and evaluated on their own merits. There is no reason we can't do that. That is not possible today because many people here believe we are locked into the Washington scoring equation instead of looking at the real economic long term value of any of these ideas.  Many other countries, such as the United Kingdom, have faced these opportunities, made decisions, and acted accordingly without combining other extraneous ideas, and the results speak for themselves. Today, the United States is in the least competitive position it has been, I believe, in the last 100 years.  In the last 70 years, America has enjoyed the greatest economic miracle in the history of mankind. It was developed on the back of innovation, capital formation, and the rule of law, combined with the best workforce in the history of the world. Those are four things that America possesses uniquely, and which many other countries are working hard to emulate.  For too long, the strength of our economy has been held down by politicians in Washington and the unintended consequences that occur when they try to interfere with the free enterprise system. It is time to trust that free enterprise system to get this economy going again, and change the rules to create a more competitive environment here at home that will allow us to compete overseas on a level playing field. It is time to simplify our individual Tax Code, reduce our corporate tax rates, eliminate conflicting business tax deductions, and eliminate the repatriation tax so we can once again become competitive with the rest of the world.  In recent decades, many other countries have made these changes, and we are losing our competitive edge. Today, I am encouraged to see both Congress and the White House working together on policies that will potentially grow our economy and bring relief to businesses and families who have been crushed by improper fiscal policies that are driven by political attempts to manage our economy.  Now is exactly the time to get these changes right. We have an opportunity to change our Tax Code to a more competitive structure that doesn't pick winners and losers, that doesn't penalize people for successes, and that allows us to compete with the rest of the world on a level playing field.  I like our chances if we can accomplish that, but let's not confuse the issue with what may seem acceptable in Washington but is devastating back home to men and women who are trying to create jobs in their local economies.  We need to free up capital. We need to make sure the rule of law supports the Constitution for every The American people deserve Congress treating these issues individually and independently to generate a simplified approach to funding our government and growing our economy.  I hear the other side whine about not hearing any proposals coming out of the White Donald Trump has been talking about what he would do with the economy for the past 2 years. There is no mystery. He wants to grow the economy. Job one, he said, is growing the economy. That doesn't mean for the rich. That means for the working men and women of  I believe they have a plan. It includes adjusting our tax system, pushing back on unnecessary regulations that are sucking the very life out of our economy and, finally, once and for all,[[Page S1205]]unleashing this great energy potential that we have.  We already see moves today on some of the regulatory fronts, where we see the new Secretary of HHS issuing a new rule today. We see the new leaders that have been confirmed already taking action in this administration. I, for one, am anxious to move forward with this debate.  I applaud our compatriots in the House for bringing up these ideas. I look forward to an open and active conversation, but now is the time for the other side to begin confirming these nominees so that we can get this economy growing.  I know you also are aware that our military is in devastating shape now after 8 years of disinvestment and 15 years of war. There is enough blame to go around here. This is not about the blame game. This is about getting this economic situation right where we can fund our military so we can defend our country.  I am very concerned that the other side is putting politics in the way of solving some of these problems that we have that are so devastating to men and women who are disenfranchised in our economy and our men and women in uniform around the world who are put in danger every day because we are not funding our military the way we should.  The time for rhetoric has passed. We are already past the tipping point of the most serious, I believe, physical crisis in our history. This debt crisis is very real. We don't need to grow the economy just to grow the economy. We have to grow the economy because it is one of several steps that are absolutely mandatory to solving this debt crisis, and we will not and cannot solve our national security crisis unless and until we solve this debt crisis. I am optimistic tonight because we are beginning to talk about these very issues.  I yield my time.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

4935,topic-id,1400,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Representative Mulvaney to be the Director of the Office of Management and Budget because I have deep concerns about his record.  I believe his far-right views are out of the mainstream and wrong for our Nation and wrong for the people of  In part, my vote against his nomination is due to his long-held public belief that we should balance the Federal budget on the backs of seniors and retirees who have worked their entire lives. Representative Mulvaney's policies would mean raising the retirement age, making deep cuts in Medicare, and driving up costs for seniors who already struggle to afford the care they need. These are policy proposals that Mr.Mulvaney would bring to the highest levels of government, if confirmed, and I fundamentally disagree with his approach to budget policy.  While I disagreed with a number of Representative Mulvaney's positions when we served together in the U.House of Representatives, I entered his confirmation hearing with an open mind. I thought that in preparing for a role with broad jurisdiction over the Federal Government, he might have developed more nuanced views on some of these difficult issues. However, after speaking with Representative Mulvaney during our recent hearing and reviewing his responses to my colleagues, it is clear he will bring the same extreme views to the administration that he brought to the  On Social Security, which is absolutely critical to seniors and families across the State of Michigan, Representative Mulvaney has repeatedly called for congressional action to raise the retirement age and reduce benefits. He has publicly called Social Security[[Page S1203]]a ``Ponzi scheme.'' When I asked Representative Mulvaney about his views during this hearing, he confirmed to me that raising the retirement age is a central piece of what he calls Social Security reform.  I could not disagree more. Michigan workers have worked their entire lives and have contributed out of their paycheck to the Social Security trust fund. I simply cannot vote for someone who takes pride in telling these Michiganders--construction workers, nurses, autoworkers--that they need to spend another 5 years on their feet after a lifetime of hard work.  Social Security is not a Ponzi scheme, and labeling it as such shows callous indifference to Michigan families. Social Security is one of the most successful programs in our Nation's history. Confirming Congressman Mulvaney to lead the Office of Management and Budget is a direct threat to the financial security of millions of seniors and retirees.  If you believe Mr.Mulvaney's proposals on Social Security are wrongheaded, just wait until you hear his views on He has vowed to ``end Medicare as we know it.'' He has said the plans of House Speaker Paul Ryan, which called for drastic cuts to Medicare, didn't go far enough.  During the first term of President Reagan, a saying entered into the public discourse as the newly elected President was staffing up his administration: ``Personnel is policy.''  While President Trump said on the campaign trail that he opposes changes to Social Security and Medicare, personnel is policy. While the title of the job, ``Director of the Office of Management and Budget,'' might conjure up images of a bureaucratic backwater for many Americans, make no mistake, we are currently debating who will hold one of the most powerful positions in this new administration--and personnel is policy.  Let's be clear. Congressman Mulvaney's nomination presents a direct threat to Medicare and to Social While his positions on these critical programs are enough to warrant my ``no'' vote, let's examine how we might address other aspects of the Federal budget.  We don't need to work at the Office of Management and Budget or be an accountant to know that President Trump's budget priorities simply do not add up. The Federal debt and deficit are serious issues, but we haven't seen one serious proposal from this administration on how we reach fiscal sustainability. It is the job of the OMB Director to help bring some sense to these proposals.  What are the proposals? They include $10 trillion in tax cuts; $40 billion on a border wall--with some kind of IOU from Mexico; drastically increasing defense spending; $1 trillion on infrastructure; and a campaign promise to never, ever touch Social Security and  It simply doesn't add up. Either President Trump is planning to grow our debt and deficit to dangerous levels or he is going to ask his advisers which of his many campaign promises he should break. Given Representative Mulvaney's belief that deficits can be solved by cutting benefits for seniors and slashing investments in basic science and research, he is not the person I want in the position of OMB  This role is also not just about expenditures and revenue. As a senior member of the President's economic team, you need a steady hand to help lead the government of the world's largest economy. Given the disarray that we are now seeing in the White House, I am convinced now more than ever that Representative Mulvaney is not that steady hand to help lead fiscal policy in this  In 2013, Representative Mulvaney supported and helped lead the effort for a government shutdown. Let me repeat: He helped lead the effort to shut down the U.More specifically, he helped lead the effort to shut down the government because the Senate would not agree to defund Planned  In his confirmation hearing, he had a chance to explain this position. Our ranking member, Senator McCaskill, asked him flat out: Do you still believe that the 2013 government shutdown was good policy?  His response: Yes, ma'am. It was polite, but wrong. Polite isn't enough. We simply cannot have these views in the highest levels of government.  This spring, on April 28, funding for the Federal government expires. Critical programs, from childcare to scientific research, will halt unless there is an agreement in place. It is hard to have confidence that this administration will come to a reasonable agreement when their nominee for the highest budget position believes it is ``good policy'' to shut down the Federal  This will not be the first, or last, potential budgetary crisis the OMB Director could face. Sometime this summer, the U.Congress will need to address the debt ceiling in order to meet our previously agreed-to financial obligations. If we do not come to an agreement, the effects on the global economy will be devastating. We risk permanently downgrading our credit rating and setting off a worldwide financial crisis.  Representative Mulvaney on many occasions has doubted the need to raise the debt ceiling. He has doubted that the U.Government should meet our financial obligations. This makes me doubt his very basic qualifications to serve as the Director of  This is far beyond partisan politics. This is the fiscal health of our Nation that will be at stake--truly, the full faith and credit of the U.If Congressman Mulvaney, as the highest ranking budget official in the Nation, is not going to advocate on behalf of this commitment, who will?  I am also worried that Congressman Mulvaney simply lacks the ability to see how fiscal and financial decisions impact working people. He looks past them and doesn't give them a second thought. During his confirmation hearing, I offered Mr.Mulvaney the chance to explain why he did not pay payroll taxes for the nanny who took care of his children. To be frank, I was shocked by his response. To him, there was a ``differentiation,'' in his mind, between the employee who was spending 40 hours a week helping to raise his triplets and the employees who spent 40 hours a week in his law firm. To him, the white collar workers in his law firm were employees, and his nanny was not. I am shocked that Mr.Mulvaney did not realize that childcare is work, and it is some of the hardest, most important work there is. Whether a nanny, babysitter, or childcare provider, this employee mattered, and he looked past her and didn't give her a second thought--until he was nominated to be Director of the Office of Management and  I don't believe my colleagues should give him the opportunity to advance his extreme positions on Medicare and Social Security and look past hard-working I will oppose Representative Mulvaney's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to join me.

5181,topic-id,435,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment is about transparency and accountability. I rise to urge my colleagues to support it.  When an agency decides to write a rule or revise an old one, they are sometimes required to share technical or scientificinformation to support their proposal. For many years, scientific research has relied upon the peer review process to ensurequality, integrity, and objectivity of published work. Peer review is when scientists open their research to the scrutiny ofother experts in their field in order to receive feedback, criticism, and ensure their conclusions are sound.  Unfortunately, when peer reviews of information return unfavorable comments or raise unforeseen issues with the quality ofwork, some agencies have acted to silence or hide the critiques. This, of course, is bad science, and it results in bad publicpolicy.  A recent example of this abuse occurred during a highly technical rulemaking proceeding in which an agency relied heavilyupon a single study that many criticized as profoundly inadequate. The agency commissioned two peer reviews of the study, whichwere completed and returned 2 weeks into the comment period for the public. However, after both scholars submitted highlycritical reviews that echoed the concerns of the many commentators, sadly, the agency withheld the release of their work to thepublic. When the agency finally did release the information as required by law, it was on the Friday that marked the very lastday of the comment period as part of a massive document dump that buried the negative reviews.  The political cherry-picking of scientific information and manipulation of the public record harms both the quality ofFederal regulations as well as the overall integrity of the rulemaking proceeding. When Federal agencies distribute scientificresearch supporting a proposed rule, the public and those affected by it deserve to be certain that the science is of thehighest quality and have a due process right to comment meaningfully on the rules the science intends to support.  My amendment will help protect this basic principle of good government and ensure fairness in Federal rulemaking byrequiring that the public be provided with a clear timeline for disclosure of any influential scientific information. Theamendment will also require agencies to offer an explanation if they revise the anticipated public release date of peer reviews.Simply put, the Federal agency will no longer be able to shield from the public view the existence of information that iscentral to evaluating a proposed rule.  We cannot continue to allow the Federal agencies to march toward a predetermined outcome at the expense of sound science andpolicy. I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.

Re Republic Peer     Speaker Paul Ryan,     Washington,    Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority LeaderPelosi: As both of you      know first-hand, developing and implementing good public      policy is no easy task. The issues beforeregulatory agencies      are often complex and technical, and therefore resolution      benefits from input from the best minds both inand out of      government. Yet, simply because someone writes a lengthy      report on a particular topic does not automatically meanthat      their analysis is valid. No presumption of scientific      legitimacy can be afforded when making good public policy.      Instead,if policymakers are going to rely on a particular      study, then that study deserves to be critiqued first via      public peer reviewin a dispassionate manner to see if the      prescriptions and findings hold up. This public peer review      is exceedingly importantwhen deciding controversial matters,      particularly because reviewing courts are loath to second-     guess expert administrativeagency's policy decisions--     choosing instead to limit themselves only to questions of      law. (See, e.g., USTelecom v. FCC, 825 F.3d674, 697 (D.     2016) (we do not ``inquire whether `some or many      economists would disapprove of the [agency's]      approach'because `we do not sit as a panel of referees on a      professional economics journal, but as a panel of generalist      judges obligedto defer to a reasonable judgment by an agency      acting pursuant to congressionally delegated authority.''))      As such, the peerreview process allows the public to better      hold government to account and results in more      informedpolicymaking.       Unfortunately, while the Office of Management and Budget      mandates peer review, many administrative agencies donot take      the peer review process seriously. By way of example, I am      attaching an op-ed I wrote in The Hill last yeardemonstrating      how the Federal Communications Commission flagrantly violated      the public's due process rights by hiding until thevery last      moments the highly-critical results of the agency's peer      review of an outside economic study which the agency      intendedto be the foundational document to impose price      regulation for Business Data By any account, such      behavior is not anexample of ``good'' government. Legislation      to improve the public peer review process at federal agencies      is therefore bothwelcome and necessary.

In additionto the well-documented improprieties with      the White House during the Open Internet debate, Wheeler,      among other transgressions,has attempted to force nonprofits      to reveal their donors in strict violation of Supreme Court      precedent, hired advocates who hadfiled in significant FCC      dockets as an interested party to come into the commission to      supervise those very dockets, andattempted to hold a FCC      ``town hall'' in which he had invited an outside party to      participate and comment on a yet-to-be-released item during      the ``sunshine'' period.       Wheeler is now at it again, this time in the context of the      FCC's attempt toimpose stringent price regulation for      ``business data services'' (BDS). Let's look at this shameful      timeline. Sometime last latelast year, the FCC started      working on a new regulatory framework for At the heart      of the commission's new regulatoryframework was an economic      appendix prepared by an outside expert, Marc Rysman of Boston            On April 14, 2016,approximately two weeks before the FCC      was to vote on the formal ``Notice of Proposed Rulemaking''      containing its proposed BDSregulatory framework, the agency      requested outside peer review (as required by law) of the      Rysman Appendix from Andrew Sweetingof the University of      Maryland and Tommaso Valletti of Imperial College Business      School (U.K.). Sweeting responded on April 26,2016 (12 days      after the peer review request); and Valletti responded on      April 28, 2016 (14 days after the peer review      request).Neither peer review was particularly kind to      Rysman's analysis.       On April 28, 2016, the FCC voted on its ``Notice of      ProposedRulemaking'' to provide an aggressive new regulatory      paradigm for BDS (hereinafter ``BDS NPRM''). Due to editorial      privileges,however, the FCC did not formally release the BDS      NPRM until May 2, 2016. Although the commission had the      Sweetling and Valletticritiques in hand during the editorial      privilege window and could have incorporated them into the      final BDS NPRM, the In fact, the FCC made no      mention of either critique of the Rysman Appendix in its      final BDS NPRM, choosing instead tokeep the existence of the      Sweeting and Valletti reviews secret from the public.       On June 28, 2016--almost two months to the daysince the BDS      NPRM was first voted upon and the very date initial comments      were due the FCC finally made the existence of theSweeting      and Valletti peer reviews public. Adding to the commission's      subterfuge, the agency chose the same day also: (1) toperform      a massive data dump into the record; (2) to release an      updated version of the Rysman Appendix; and (3) to      introducethree new staff studies (the same staff which are      charged with writing the final BDS rules) purporting to      address, andultimately correct, the shortcomings of the      Rysman In so doing, the FCC made sure that no one      could address eitherthese data or studies in their initial      comments.       For those who care about the integrity of our government      institutions, theFCC's constant disregard for due process is      deeply troubling. As the D.Circuit recently wrote in      Association of AmericanRailroads v. Department of      Transportation (2016):       No clause in our nation's Constitution has as ancient a      pedigree as theguarantee that ``[n]o person . . . shall be      deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of      law.'' U.CONST.amend. Its lineage reaches back to 1215      A.D.'s Magna Carta, which ensured that ``[n]o freeman shall      be . . . disseised of his. . . liberties, or . . . otherwise      destroyed . . . but by lawful judgment of his peers, or by      the law of the land.'' MagnaCarta, ch. 29, in 1 Coke, The      Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 45      (1797). Since the Fifth Amendment'sratification, one theme      above all others has dominated the Supreme Court's      interpretation of the Due Process Clause: fairness.at 27.       Now to be clear, as Justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote in      Snyder v. Massachusetts (1934), while ``[d]ue process of      lawrequires that the proceedings shall be fair . . . fairness      is a relative, not an absolute, concept. It is fairness      withreference to particular conditions or particular      results.'' That said, as the D.Circuit again affirmed just      last month inU.Telecom Association v. FCC, it remains      black-letter law that ``[u]nder the [Administrative Procedure      Act], an NPRM must`provide sufficient factual detail and      rationale for the rule to permit interested parties to      comment meaningfully.' ''       Asthe FCC has by any reasonable account deprived parties      with the opportunity to comment meaningfully upon the      fundamentaleconomic analysis and data upon which it intends      to use to impose rate regulation for BDS, I think it is safe      to argue thatunder even the broadest light, the agency's      conduct in this case is a prima facie violation of procedural      due process.       Whatis the FCC so afraid of? Is it truly scared to have      substantive debate on the issues? Is the outcome so      predetermined that ithas to resort to kangaroo court tactics      that would make North Korean leader Kim Jong-un proud?      Indeed, it is a bit ironic (ifnot outright hypocritical) that      while the FCC is doing everything it can to prevent      meaningful comments about a highly complextopic, the Obama      administration is doing everything in its power to create a      culture which encourages robo-comments which offerup nothing      substantive to the debate other than to promote ideological      sophistry from both sides of the political spectrum. Andwe      wonder why (rhetorically) the FCC is now regarded as an      ``economics-free zone,'' as an AT&T executive noted?       Given theD.Circuit's recent proclivity to grant the FCC      great deference, no matter how many liberties it may take,      restoring the ruleof law at the FCC will ultimately fall into      the hands of Fortunately, the House Energy and      Commerce Committee hasscheduled yet another oversight hearing[[Page H364]]     next week with all five members of the Commission in      attendance, where perhapssome sunlight can be used as a      disinfectant. I therefore encourage the Commerce Committee      members and staff--from both sides ofthe aisle--to do their      homework, come to the hearing prepared, and call Chairman      Wheeler out on the carpet.

5094,topic-id,678,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. I thank ChairmanGoodlatte for the opportunity to again lead on this issue and for the inclusion of two of my bills--the Separation of PowersRestoration Act and the ALERT Act--in this incredibly important regulatory reform package.  Because you see, Mr.Chairman, the realities of President Obama's failed liberal progressive experiment are all too real forthe three-quarters of a million Texans that I represent, realities like higher prices for families in Sulphur Springs trying tomake ends meet, fewer jobs for those seeking work in Texarkana, and small businesses in Sherman and Rockwall forced to closetheir doors. Mr.Chairman, these are just a few of the countless devastating symptoms of overregulation that citizens across ourgreat country have been forced to endure under President  The President gives a good speech, and he did so again in his farewell address last night. But the President read us afictional tale last night. The inescapable truth is that for 8 long years, the constant stream of regulations being pumped outby the Obama administration has taken a terrible toll on families, on businesses, and on our economy. It has made our Nationless prosperous and leaves folks worse off than they were before.  The urgency to reverse this unsustainable regulatory quagmire couldn't have been made more clear than in November, when theAmerican people rose up and voted for a new President who vowed not to subject us to more of the same. That is where my[[Page H331]]bill and all of the bills in the Regulatory Accountability Act come into play.  When you look back at the last 8 years, many people wonder how the Obama administration was allowed to grow at such analarming rate. Now, while there are a lot of troubling factors that go into that equation, the result of an infamous 1984Supreme Court decision, the Chevron doctrine, is certainly recognized as one of the key culprits. For three decades now, thisdoctrine has required courts to defer to agency interpretations of congressional intent.  Said in more plain terms, Mr.Chairman, this means that when individuals challenge Federal regulators in court, the deck isstacked in favor of the regulators, the very same regulators who have written the regulations in the first place. Lettingregulators grade their own papers, if that doesn't reinforce the need to drain the swamp, then I don't know what does.  My legislation, the Separation of Powers Restoration Act, will fix this perversion of our Constitution by ensuring thatCongress, not executive branch agencies, write our laws and that courts, not agency bureaucrats, interpret our laws.  Mr.Chairman, title V of this bill is my ALERT Act legislation, and it provides another critical remedy to the currentregulatory process by fixing the lack of transparency that is both unfair and harmful to individuals and small businesses acrossthe country.  Right now, the current law requires the administration to release an update twice a year on the regulations that are beingdeveloped by Federal agencies--the problem is that the regulators are ignoring the law--as these updates have either been verylate or never issued at all under President Obama's watch.  Up to this point, there hasn't been a way to reinforce and enforce these requirements. So the ALERT Act tackles this problemby forcing the executive branch to make the American people aware of regulations that are coming down the track; and itprohibits any regulations from going into effect unless and until detailed information on the cost of the regulation, its impacton jobs, and the legal basis for the regulation have been available to the public on the Internet for at least 6 months.  Mr.Chairman, the way our government has been allowed to function under this administration isn't how our forefathersintended our government to work. Today's legislation takes a giant step forward in fixing how Washington works. I have alreadyspoken to President-elect Trump about partnering together to make this the law of the land and to give the American people backthe government that our Founders intended, a government that works for them, not the other way around.  Mr.Chairman, we owe them nothing less.  ",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgH323-2.txt,2268,REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACTOF 2017,2017.0,11.0,January

4915,topic-id,1626,"Mr.President, I rise in strong opposition to the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the Director of the Office of Management and Based on his appearance before the Senate Budget and Homeland Security Governmental Affairs Committees, he appears to be a smart and articulate individual, but after examining his record and his testimony, I believe he lacks the fundamental judgment to serve in this important role.  Mr.Mulvaney's tenure as a Member of Congress has been marked by symbolic stands and stunts that have been most successful in generating bipartisan opposition rather than support. Until now, it has mattered little whether his proposals have been motivated by firmly held principles or other motives. We have just been fortunate that few of Mr.Mulvaney's ideas have been made into law. However, with an appointment to a position of real authority at OMB, Mr.Mulvaney will have great power to put his ideas into practice. For that reason, it is worth reflecting on the positions he has taken.  At times of national fiscal and economic turmoil, Congressman Mulvaney could consistently be found among those stoking the flames of pandemonium in order to advance a partisan or ideological point. Indeed, he was among those Republican Members of Congress who cheered efforts to force the country to default on our financial obligations in 2011, dismissing the domestic and global alarm over Republican brinkmanship as ``fear mongering'' and as promoting a ``fabricated crisis.''  In 2013, he voted to support the Republican shutdown of the Federal Government, which ultimately cost American taxpayers $2 billion in back wages for Federal workers who were locked out of their jobs. In addition to this and other fiscal waste, the 16-day shutdown hurt the economy. Moody's estimated that it ``cut real GDP by $20 billion, shaving half a percentage point off growth in the fourth quarter [of 2013].''  In 2015, Mr.Mulvaney was part of another Republican shutdown effort. This time it was to shutter the Department of Homeland Security to protest President Obama's immigration policy. Thankfully, House Republicans relented before the shutdown took effect. Otherwise, the closure would have caused about 30,000 furloughs and about 200,000 other people, including Coast Guard personnel, TSA, ICE, Border Patrol and Customs officers, to report to work, most of them without the promise of a paycheck.  When Americans have suffered natural disasters, Mr.Mulvaney has shown himself among those who are the least sympathetic about providing Federal assistance, insisting, for example, that emergency aid for the victims of Hurricane Sandy should be offset. He has at least been consistent in this regard, since he voted against similar aid to his home State of South Of course, his opposition in that instance was mainly symbolic because it was a foregone conclusion that the bill would pass. But this should give every American pause. Mr.Mulvaney's record of supporting brinkmanship and his responses to written questions show that his first instinct will be to use any one-time emergency as an opportunity to force lasting budgetary cuts.  I am also concerned about Mr.Mulvaney's intentions with regard to the elimination of the sequester-level budget caps. In 2013, with sequester cuts on the horizon, Mr.Mulvaney ruled out revenue increases or scaling back the sequester. He said: ``We want to keep the sequester in place and take the cuts we can get.''  As the nominee to OMB director, Mr.Mulvaney now believes, like President Trump, that the sequester caps should be lifted for defense, but he has made no allowance for nondefense discretionary programs and agencies, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Mr.Mulvaney has thus far failed to grasp that there is simply no way to secure support for sequester relief without addressing both the defense and nondefense sides of the ledger. Moreover, he has not recognized that it is repugnant to many to suggest that one side of the budget can be cannibalized to fund the other side. The best way to fund sequester relief is through the proven combination of additional revenue and reasonable cuts. It has worked before, and we should look to that solution again.  We should also reject efforts to use Overseas Contingency Operations accounts, or OCO funding, to fill the gap when it comes to defense spending. It is not a legitimate tool to fix the sequester. Despite my many disagreements with Mr.Mulvaney, this is one point where we do appear to see roughly eye to eye in terms of using the OCO for those overseas contingencies they were designed to fund.  Where we disagree most vehemently is on the matter of core programs that help Americans lift themselves up so they can participate fully in our economy and society. Although he has recently changed his position, Mr.Mulvaney, as a State legislator, voted for legislation that questioned the constitutionality of Medicaid and Social Security, and today he still questions the constitutionality of Federal involvement in education. This is more than a philosophical stand. His position will color how the administration invests in schools and students over the next 4 years. I am especially disturbed that Mr.Mulvaney is not even willing to commit to protecting funding for the Pell Grant Program and to reducing college debt, a burden faced by students and their families all across this country.  I have also been disturbed by Mr.Mulvaney's cavalier position about benefit cuts to Social Security and Medicare, by such measures as increasing the retirement age. Let's be clear. When you force a person to wait 2 or 3 more years to begin collecting the full benefits they have earned, it is a cut. If poor health or lack of job prospects forces a person to begin collecting benefits before reaching the normal retirement age, he or she will see a significant reduction in monthly benefits.  These cuts fall heaviest on the most vulnerable--low-income workers and workers in the most physically demanding jobs, those who simply cannot continue to work for another few years. We can make changes to sustain these programs without the deep cuts to benefits that Mr.Mulvaney would promote.  In this one area, I would hope the President could prevail over his staff. Many times during the campaign, President Trump promised to protect Social Security and In fact, last March he said: ``It's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as it is.''  It remains to be seen how sincere the President is on this issue. Last month, he was effectively rebuffed by 49 Republicans who voted successfully to kill Senator Sanders' amendment to create a point of order that would prevent the Senate from breaking President Trump's promise that ``there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.''  Unfortunately, the President said nothing about this vote, which should lead all Americans to ask how committed he is to his promise. His choice of Mr.Mulvaney also leaves me concerned that he is not sincere about this[[Page S1177]]promise, since Mr.Mulvaney seems clearly intent on making cuts to these vital programs.  Mr.Mulvaney has also proven himself unsympathetic to the challenges facing working men and women in this country. He has sponsored legislation to bar the Federal Government from requiring project labor agreements. He has voted to repeal Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements, and he has cosponsored legislation to undermine the ability of workers to collectively bargain.  Moreover, Mr.Mulvaney failed to pay more than $15,000 in unemployment and FICA taxes for a household employee between 2000 and 2004, only making good on that obligation during his nomination process. Even if this could be characterized as an oversight, it is worth noting that Mr.Mulvaney has previously proposed legislation to bar tax delinquents from serving in elected office in South Carolina and to authorize supervisors of Federal employees to take punitive action against workers who have failed to pay taxes.  One wonders how Mr.Mulvaney would feel about the fitness of a Democratic nominee with a similar challenge.  Finally, let me say a few words about Mr.Mulvaney's laissez-faire approach to regulation, particular the oversight of Wall I believe strongly that the lack of effective regulation, the lack of oversight, and the lack of appropriations for the financial regulatory agencies contributed heavily to the great recession, which is why I worked so hard to support the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, including the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  Mr.Mulvaney, not surprisingly, takes a different view. As a member of the Financial Services Committee in the House, he said: ``I don't like that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau exists.'' The CFPB is a consumer-focused agency that has brought nearly $12 billion in refunds and restitution to consumers for Wall Street's abuses. This includes more than $120 million that have been returned to our military families through the efforts of the Bureau's Office of Servicemember Affairs, which I worked with Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts to establish.  Because of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, working Americans have an advocate in the consumer finance marketplace that is laser-focused on protecting them. Mr.Mulvaney would prefer to transform this agency into a paper tiger that is subject to partisan political pressure and influence from the various industries it is attempting to police. We should not allow him the chance to do that from a perch at  The country has been fortunate that House Republican leadership, with good reason, in my view, did not reward Mr.Mulvaney with a position of authority from which he could exercise real control. Unfortunately, the promotion that President Trump has offered would give him great power--power that will ultimately, I believe, be destructive in his hands. As a result, I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination.  I yield the floor.

Too often, regulators and agency heads are well aware of the negative impact a regulation will have on Americans' jobs andwages even before it is imposed, but they impose it anyway. Specifically, my provision defines when rules have a negative impacton jobs and wages and requires agency heads approving such a rule to submit a statement that they approve the rule knowing itsnegative impact.

4981,topic-id,1711,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to discuss the issue of human rights as part of my office's ongoing effort on what we call the Expression Not Oppression Campaign, where we highlight human rights abuses around the world and tell the stories of political prisoners and other brave leaders who are being repressed, jailed, beaten, or even worse, simply for criticizing the government of a nation in which they live.  This is an important week for human rights. Two nations with concerning records regarding human rights--Egypt and China--have sent their heads of state to meet with our And I will have, I hope, a chance later on this week to discuss the issues we confront in China, and they are many.  Today, I want to discuss the state of human rights and our general relationship with  Over the past 2 days, the President of Egypt, President Elsisi, has been visiting our Nation's He had the opportunity to meet with the President and other officials in the administration. Earlier today, I had the opportunity to visit with him as part of a meeting with members of the Senate Foreign Relations  Before entering my remarks, I want to make abundantly clear that we are incredibly impressed and grateful and supportive of the efforts that President Elsisi and Egypt are undertaking in battling radicalism and in particular They are undertaking this effort, for example, in the Sinai, and it is quite a challenge.  I also understand that the ongoing ability to defeat radicalism in the world depends on the stability of our partners internally. That is why the human rights situation in Egypt is concerning. I believe it is fair to say it is at its worst in decades, and that is saying something. It is important.  Some may ask ``Why does America care about that?'' beyond, obviously, our moral calling to defend the rights of all people. It is that it is counterproductive behavior. These abuses--the conditions that exist in Egypt and in other places around the world--are actually conducive to jihadi ideology, which is the ability to recruit people who feel vulnerable, who feel oppressed. They become more vulnerable to those campaigns when they feel they are being mistreated.  The current Government of Egypt, under the leadership of President Elsisi, has cracked down on civil society. On that, there can be no debate. They have jailed thousands of political prisoners, including, sadly, some Americans, and it has responded with brute force to those who oppose that government.  Again, I reiterate that a strong U.S.-Egypt relationship is important to America--to advancing our interests in the Middle I am here to speak on behalf of American interests and why this is so important in our relationship with Egypt and in the stability of the region, but I must do so by describing the situation on the ground.  In the national interest of our country, we cannot turn a blind eye to the ongoing repression of Egyptian citizens by their government. It weakens our moral standing in the world, and, as I have already said numerous times, it makes Egypt less secure. If Egypt is less secure, ultimately America will be less secure. Today, I said that to President  Over the last decades, the American people have provided Egypt with more than $77 billion in foreign aid. This includes what is currently $1.3 billion per year in military aid. But as the human rights situation in Egypt continues to deteriorate and the government refuses to take the serious and necessary steps of reform and respecting the rule of law, then this Congress, on behalf of the American people--who are giving $1.3 billion of their hard-earned taxpayer money--must continue to pursue the reform of our assistance to Egypt to make sure that not only is it allowing them to confront the challenges that are posed by radicalism today but that it also promotes progress in a way that does not leave Egypt unstable and ultimately vulnerable in the future.  It is in the interest of both our country and Egypt and the Egyptian people to implement reforms and to release all of its jailed political prisoners, including all jailed Nations cannot thrive and they cannot prosper if their citizens are oppressed or are unable to express themselves freely without fear of being jailed, tortured, or killed.  Inevitably, if these conditions continue, there will be a street uprising in Egypt once again, and it could very well be led by radical elements who seek to overthrow the government and create a space for terrorism.  Human rights abuses in Egypt take on many forms. An example is the lack of press freedom. In 2016, Egypt joined other nations in rising to the top of the rankings as the world's third highest jailer of journalists. According to the Reporters Without Borders' 2016 World Press Freedom Index, Egypt currently ranks 159th out of 180 countries in terms of press freedom. The media, including journalists, bloggers, and those active on social media, are regularly harassed and arrested. There are currently 24 journalists who are jailed on trumped-up and politically motivated charges. Their ``crimes'' have included publishing false information and inciting terrorism. Censorship has grown as they continue to interfere in the publication and circulation of news--although, by the way, a lot of Egyptian news coverage is very anti-These are just a few examples of the ongoing repression of press freedom in  There are also human rights abuses the Egyptian Government continues to commit with regard to freedom of association and of assembly. In November of 2016, the Egyptian Parliament passed a draconian law that, if signed by President Elsisi, would ban nongovernmental organizations from operating freely in The law would essentially eliminate all independent human rights groups. It would make it nearly impossible for charities to function by imposing strict regulations and registration processes. Individuals who violate this law could face jail time simply for speaking out and fighting to defend human rights. Passing laws like these has a chilling effect on dissent.  Here is the good news: President Elsisi has not signed it over 4 months later, and I truly hope it is because he is having second thoughts about it, because he recognizes the terrible impact it will have on his country's future, on their perception around the world, on their ability to make progress and reform, and ultimately because he also recognizes the impact it will have on free nations, like the United States, which desires to work with Egypt on many issues of common interest. I strongly encourage President Elsisi to reject that anti-NGO law.  There is the issue of political prisoners. According to the Project on Middle East Democracy, since 2013 at least 60,000 political prisoners have been arrested in Egypt and 1,800 people have received death sentences in what many[[Page S2222]]organizations have described as being politically motivated sentences.  In 2014, President Elsisi issued a decree that expanded the jurisdiction of military courts over civilians. According to Human Rights Watch, since the decree was issued, the military courts have tried over 7,400 Egyptian civilians.  Additionally, individuals who have been victims of enforced disappearances in Egypt have claimed that they were tortured and subjected to other forms of abuse when they were taken. There has been little accountability for this excessive use of force.  Egypt's repression is not limited to its own citizens. There are currently a number of Americans who are jailed in There is one American in particular whom I would like to raise: the case of American-Egyptian citizen Aya  Aya was arrested in May of 2014, along with her husband and other members of her organization, which is called the Belady Foundation, which works with abandoned and homeless youth and rescues these young children off the streets. Three years ago, she was arrested and charged with ridiculous allegations, including sexual abuse and paying the children to participate in demonstrations against the government. To date, no evidence has been provided to back these horrible allegations. Almost 3 years later, this American citizen remains in prison.  Throughout that time, I and others here in the Senate have been calling for her release, and it is time that the charges against her be dropped and her husband and the other workers be released immediately because her case and many others like it are an obstacle to better relations.  The Egyptian people deserve better than the brutal treatment they are receiving at the hands of their government. All human beings do. It is incumbent upon us, the elected representatives of the American people, to make clear to friends, allies, partners, and foes alike that no matter what issues we are working with you on, negotiating a resolution to, or dealing with you on in some other way, we are not going to look the other way when human rights are being abused. We are going to encourage you to reform because in the long run, that is in your interest and ours.  We have seen in recent history the consequences when governments do not respect their citizens. It creates instability in those countries. Instability is the breeding ground of terrorists and radical elements around the world. Ultimately, those terrorists train their sights on us.  As I told President Elsisi today, Egypt is a nation rich in culture and history and has made extraordinary contributions to the world. It has played a leading role in fostering peace with But it faces a dangerous future if it does not create the conditions within the country in which its people can live peacefully and securely without fear. Otherwise, Egypt remains vulnerable to the kind of instability we have seen in Syria, Libya, and other countries. That is why it should matter to the American people.  I am disappointed that this issue of human rights did not come up publicly when the President met with the President of I hope that will change in the weeks and days and months to come, for it is in our national interest to further these goals. Otherwise, sadly, we could very well have yet another and perhaps the most important country in the region destabilized and ultimately left vulnerable to becoming a breeding ground for terrorism that ultimately targets our people and our                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgS2221-3.txt,2084,REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY ACTOF 2017,2017.0,4.0,January

4939,topic-id,2344,"Mr.President, as the ranking member of the Budget Committee, I rise in strong opposition to the nomination of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the next Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or  Like many of President Trump's other nominees, my opposition to Congressman Mulvaney has less to do with his extreme rightwing economic views than it has to do with the hypocrisy and the dishonesty of President The simple truth is that Congressman Mulvaney's record, in many respects, is the exact opposite of the rhetoric that then-Candidate Trump used in order to get votes from senior citizens and working families. Now, if Candidate Trump had run his campaign by saying: I am going to cut your Social Security benefits if elected President, well, you know what, Congressman Mulvaney would have been the exact person that he should bring forth as OMB If President Trump had said: I am going to privatize your Medicare; vote for me because I am going to privatize your Medicare--if that is what he had campaigned on, then Congressman Mulvaney would have been exactly the right choice for OMB If Candidate Trump had said: I want to devastate Medicare, I want to make it harder for poor people to get the healthcare they need, and I want to threaten the nursing home care of millions of senior citizens--if that is what Candidate Trump had said, Mick Mulvaney would have been exactly the right and appropriate leader for the job.  But those are not the words, that is not the rhetoric, and those are not the ideas that Candidate Trump raised during his Presidential race. In fact, Candidate Trump said exactly the opposite on May 7, 2015. We are all familiar with Mr.Trump's tweets. Here is a tweet that he made on May 7, 2015:       I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state      there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare and      Huckabee copied me.  So you have Candidate Trump making it very clear that there would be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and  On August 10, 2015, Trump said:       [I will] save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security      without cuts. [We] have to do it. . . . People have been      paying in for years, and now many of these candidates want to      cut it.  On November 3, 2015, Mr.Trump said:       I will save Social I'll save medicare. . . .      People love . . . I'm not going to cut it.  On March 10, 2016, Mr.Trump said:       I will do everything within my power not to touch Social      Security, to leave it the way it is . . . it's my absolute      intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not      increase the age and to leave it as is.       It is my absolute intention to leave Social Security the      way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.  It can't be much clearer than that.  On May 21, 2015, Mr.Trump tweeted:       I am going to save Social Security without any cuts. I know      where to get the money from. Nobody else does.  On January 24, 2015, Mr.Trump said:       I'm not a cutter. I will probably be the only Republican      that doesn't want to cut Social  Those are pretty strong statements. What he just told you, in no uncertain terms, can't be clearer than that. He doesn't want to cut Social He doesn't want to cut Medicare and doesn't want to cut And you know what, millions of people actually believed what he said. They actually thought that Candidate Trump was telling the truth.  But now that the election is over, President Trump has nominated a budget director, Mr.Mulvaney, who would cut Social Security, would cut Medicare, would cut Medicaid, and would threaten the entire security of millions of  We just heard the exact quotes coming from candidate Donald Let's now hear the exact quotes coming from Congressman Mick Mulvaney about his views on these very same issues.  On May 15, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said on FOX Business News:       We have to end Medicare as we know it.  On April 28, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said:       Medicare as it exists today is finished.  On August 1, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said:       You have to raise the retirement age, lower a pay-out,      change the reimbursement system. You simply cannot leave      [Social Security] the way it is.  On May 17, 2011, Congressman Mulvaney said: ``I honestly don't think we went far enough with the Ryan plan'' because it did not cut Social Security and Medicare ``rapidly enough.''  Just 2 years ago, Congressman Mulvaney voted against the budget proposed by House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price and House Speaker Paul Ryan, opting instead to vote in favor of an even more extreme budget by the Republican Study The budget that Congressman Mulvaney supported would have cut Medicare by $69 billion more than the Price-Ryan budget. It would have cut Social Security by $184 billion more, and it would have cut Medicaid by $255 billion more than the budget proposed by Chairman Price and House Speaker  In fact, Congressman Mulvaney made it clear during his confirmation hearing in the Budget Committee that he would advise President Trump to break his promises not to cut Social Security, Medicare, and During that hearing, Senator Corker called President Trump's campaign promises ``totally unrealistic'' and said that they ``make no sense whatsoever.''  When Senator Corker asked Congressman Mulvaney if he would advise the President not to follow through on the campaign promises he made to seniors, this is what Congressman Mulvaney said:       I have to imagine that the President knew what he was      getting when he asked me to fill this role. . . . I'd like to      think it is why he hired me.  Whoa, what we have been discussing is precisely why so many people have contempt for what goes on here in Congress and what goes on in Washington, in general. What is going on here is that a candidate for President of the United States says one thing in order to get votes, but the day after he is elected, his tune dramatically changes, and he nominates a number of people to his Cabinet and to high-level positions within his administration who intend to do exactly the opposite of what he campaigned on. Once again, Congressman Mulvaney--and I believe he is exactly right--said:       I have to imagine that the President knew what he was      getting when he asked me to fill this role. . . . I'd like to      think it is why he hired me.  So the President hires somebody who has been one of the most vigorous proponents of cutting Social Security, cutting Medicare, and of cutting Medicaid after he ran his entire campaign telling the American people he would not cut Social Security, cut Medicare, and cut  Outside of Capitol Hill, where real people live, it turns out, not surprisingly, that the overwhelming majority of Americans--be they Democrats, Republicans, or Independents--are opposed to cutting Social In fact, according to an October 2016 survey by Public Policy Polling, 72 percent of the American people, including 51 percent of Republicans, ``support increasing, not cutting, Social Security benefits by asking millionaires and billionaires to pay more into the system.''[[Page S1207]]  As it happens, that is exactly the heart and soul of the legislation that I will soon be offering. Legislation that I will be offering will expand Social Security benefits, not cut them. It will do so by asking the top 2 percent to pay more in taxes, which, it turns out, is not only the right thing to do, but it is precisely what the American people want us to do. Various other polls have reached similar results. The people of our country--once you get outside the Congress and outside of the Republican caucus, in particular--the American people know that when millions of seniors, disabled veterans, and people with disabilities are trying to get by on $13, $14, $15,000 a year, you do not cut their benefits, while at the same time give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent. That is not what the American people want.  In my view, we don't need a budget director like Congressman Mulvaney, who believes that Social Security is a ``Ponzi scheme.'' We don't need a budget director who once voted to declare Social Security, Medicaid, and the U.Department of Education unconstitutional. He was in, I believe, the South Carolina State Legislature, State He actually voted on a vote--which got very few votes--in the South Carolina State He voted to declare Social Security, Medicaid, and the U.Department of Education unconstitutional. This is the person whom President Trump has nominated to become the head of  So if you believe Social Security is unconstitutional, if you believe it is a good idea to cut benefits for people who will be living on $13,000 or $14,000 a year, I guess Mr.Mulvaney is your choice. If that is whom my Republican colleagues want to vote for, that is their business, but my job and the job of everybody is to make it clear to the American people that the Republicans are far more interested in cutting Social Security and in giving huge tax breaks to billionaires than they are in taking care of the needs of the American people.  We need a budget director who understands that we have a retirement crisis in America today. Today, more than half of older Americans have no retirement savings. That is just an extraordinary reality. Over half of older workers in this country have zero in the bank. Think about what they are feeling when they hear people like Congressman Mulvaney saying: Hey, you got nothing now. You are going to try to get by on $12,000, $13,000 a year in Social Security, and we are going to cut those benefits.  Today, more than half of older Americans have no retirement savings. More than one-third of senior citizens depend on Social Security for all of their income. One out of five senior citizens is trying to make ends meet on income of less than $13,000 a year. I will tell you, I hope people are able to sleep well, people who think it is appropriate to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut benefits for people who are trying to get by on Social Security checks of $13,000 a year.  In my view, we don't need a budget director who believes that ``we have to end Medicare as we know it,'' nor do we need a budget director who has said that ``Medicare as it exists today is finished.'' Let's remember for a moment what things were like before Medicare was signed into law back in 1965. At that point, about half of all seniors were uninsured and millions more were underinsured. Today, thanks to Medicare, about 45 million seniors have health insurance, and the senior poverty rate has plummeted. Seniors are living healthier, longer lives. Thank you,  In my view, we do not need a budget director who supports cutting Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, threatening not only the healthcare of low-income people but also the nursing home care of millions of vulnerable senior citizens and persons with disabilities. There are millions of not just low-income families but middle-class families who today are getting help with the nursing home payments for their parents through If you make devastating cuts in Medicaid, you are not only going to take away health insurance from low-income Americans, you are going to put enormous economic stress on middle-class families who will now have to pay the full tab for the nursing home care of their parents.  Finally, there is another issue; that is, Mr.Mulvaney's taxes. After Congressman Mulvaney was nominated to become the next OMB Director, it was revealed that he failed to pay over $15,000 in taxes for a nanny he employed from the year 2000 through 2004. Here is what Congressman Mulvaney wrote in response to a question I asked him on January 11:       I have come to learn during the confirmation review process      that I failed to pay FICA and Federal and State unemployment      taxes on a household employee for the years 2000 through      2004. Upon discovery of that shortfall, I paid the Federal      taxes. The amount in question for Federal FICA and      unemployment was $15,583.60, exclusive of penalties and      interest which are not yet determined. The State amounts are      not yet determined.  This is a very serious issue. As you will recall, 8 years ago Senator Tom Daschle withdrew his nomination as Secretary of Health and Human Services after it was discovered that he failed to pay taxes for one of his domestic workers.  On this issue, I agree wholeheartedly with Minority Leader Schumer, who said:       When other previous Cabinet nominees failed to pay their      fair share in taxes, Senate Republicans forced those nominees      to withdraw from consideration. If failure to pay taxes was      disqualifying for Democratic nominees, then the same should      be true for Republican nominees.  Mr.President, here is the irony: Over and over again, Congressman Mulvaney has sponsored and cosponsored legislation designed to prohibit people from serving in the government if they fail to pay their taxes. In 2015, Congressman Mulvaney voted for a bill in the House that stated: ``Any individual who has a seriously delinquent tax debt should be ineligible to be appointed or to continue serving as an employee'' of the Federal Congressman Mulvaney cosponsored three bills when he was in the South Carolina State Senate that would have prohibited tax cheats from serving in the South Carolina State government. In other words, it looks like there is one set of rules for Congressman Mulvaney and another set of rules for everyone else.  In light of this information and in light of Congressman Mulvaney's extreme rightwing record of attacking the needs of the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor, I would urge all of my colleagues to vote no on this nomination.  With that, I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1175-2.txt,1010,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,15.0,January

4890,topic-id,297,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to congressional Republicans' attempt to repeal Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces protections for Federal contract workers.  We all know President Trump is no fan of transparency. He has steadfastly refused to disclose his own tax returns, so it is no surprise that he and the Republicans would oppose disclosure of labor, employment, civil rights, and nondiscrimination law violations by bidders for Federal contracts.  What I really don't understand is why Members of Congress would ask American taxpayers to subsidize companies that routinely violate our labor laws. Voting for this resolution actually rewards companies that discriminate, stiff their employees on pay, or cut corners on safety, and it puts responsible businesses that play by the rules at a disadvantage.  This resolution harms women. Women make up the majority of low-wage workers. Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces protections ensure that our tax dollars do not support sexual harassment and sex discrimination on the job, regular occurrences especially for low-wage working women.  This resolution harms veterans, including disabled veterans. Repeal means that we won't know whether a contract bidder routinely violates section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, which Paralyzed Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans, and Vets First say is ``necessary to prevent discrimination in the workplace and during the hiring process.''  This resolution also harms older workers. To quote AARP: `` . . . age discrimination in the workplace persists as a serious and pervasive problem. The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order is the first executive order since 1964 addressing the obligation of those who receive federal contracts not to discriminate on the basis of age.''  If you don't want your taxpayer dollars to be used to undermine Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces protections, then all Members should oppose this resolution.

4946,topic-id,4771,"Mr.President, the Senate is preparing to vote on Congressman Mick Mulvaney to lead the Office of Management and This nomination may seem like it doesn't deserve a lot of attention because we don't hear much outside of Washington about the OMB, the Office of Management and It is kind of a wonky, obscure office, with fewer than 500 staff members.  At a time when there are so many looming questions about this Republic, about this administration, it is easy to overlook the Congressman's nomination, but it actually matters very much, particularly at this moment, and that is because the person who controls the budget, the person who has the final say on fiscal and financial priorities for the administration has immense power. This position controls the President's budget, and that means that this person can give the green light to programs and policies across the Federal Government or stop them in their tracks. And because he has a long track record as a legislator, Congressman Mulvaney has already shown what kind of decisionmaker he will be if he is in charge of the Office of Management and Budget,  I will be blunt. His record and his ideas are worrisome. It should concern every Senator who is worried about some of the biggest issues facing Americans, from Social Security, to public health, to the basic, uninterrupted operations of the government itself. So this vote is a moment of truth. It will determine where we really stand on the issues that shape both individual lives and our country's future.  Let me highlight just four issues to show why this person is the wrong person to run  The first is Social More than 80 years ago, President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law. In doing so, he created a national plan to provide economic security for American workers. Since then, Social Security has proven to be the most successful anti-poverty program in our history. Each year, it lifts more than 20 million Americans, including 1 million children, out of poverty.  It is hard to imagine a world without Social Security, but I want everybody to understand that pre-Social Security, we had tens of millions of Americans--more than we do now--who would be in poverty upon retirement. So this program has actually reduced poverty among the elderly more than any other program could possibly have accomplished.  Nowhere is Social Security more important than in More than 200,000 people receive Social Security benefits. For more than one in four Hawaii seniors, Social Security is their only source of income. And the money just isn't enough; it is about $14,000 a year. Just to give folks an understanding of Hawaii, we are considered the second or third most expensive housing market in the United We are after New York and sometimes in second place or third place, depending on where San Francisco is, but we are one of the most expensive places to live in the United For one in four Social Security recipients, that is all they get--$1,200 a month. Usually that will cover your apartment. That will not cover your electricity, it won't cover your utilities, it won't cover your food or clothing, and it won't cover your healthcare.  Today, most working households have little or no retirement assets at all, and many rely entirely on Social This is partly because employer-provided pensions are becoming a thing of the past. So Social Security is more important than ever. It has become a pillar of our retirement system[[Page S1211]]that continues to work well. It is a universal guaranteed source of income that workers earn and depend on when they retire, but it is just not enough.  I will just add that it is only in Washington, DC, where entertaining the idea of cutting Social Security is considered moderate or mainstream or conservative, even, or adult. I mean, there is this sense that the way we ought to fix the challenges we have fiscally as a country is to take it out of the hides of people who get $1,200 a month to live.  Instead of strengthening the program, Mr.Mulvaney's ideas are very radical. He has said he wants to systematically alter Social Security by raising the retirement age to 70 years old. He wants to raise the retirement age to 70 years old. This is not an obscure person being appointed to an obscure post; this is a Member of Congress being appointed to be the head of the Office of Management and We are going to vote on him tomorrow, and everybody who says they are for Social Security is about to vote for a person who wants to raise the Social Security retirement age to 70 years old.  He has called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. When he worked in the South Carolina State Senate, he voted to declare Social Security unconstitutional. Again, he voted to declare Social Security unconstitutional, and I predict he will get all of the Republican votes. And all of these folks who say they wanted to protect your Social Security, after they put Tom Price at the head of HHS, they are about to put someone who is dedicated to undermining the most successful anti-poverty program in American history.  When asked in his confirmation hearing--because, look, you are a Member of Congress; you represent a certain constituency; you have certain views. Some people are able to sort of pivot from their role as a legislator, as a politician, and into a role as an appointee, a Secretary, a nominee. So when he was asked in this confirmation hearing if he would recommend that the President break a campaign promise to leave Social Security alone, the Congressman said that he would recommend that the President make cuts to the program. So this isn't something he has recanted; this is something he stands by--up until and including through his confirmation and his service at  But why make cuts to the most successful anti-poverty program in American history? Why would we make cuts to a program that is financed by its own revenue stream and by law does not add $1 to the deficit? Why would we cut benefits now just because we may have to cut them in 20 years? If we are going to change Social Security, let's do it in a way that expands benefits for generations to come. Let's lift the cap on taxable earnings. Let's remove the wage cap that unfairly shelters the highest earning Americans from paying into the Social Security trust fund that the majority of hard-working Americans do.  Here is how it works. The cap is roughly $120,000. So you pay Social Security--almost everybody pays Social Security tax, up to $120,000 in income. That is mostly everybody, right. But if you make $120,000, all of that is taxed up to $120,000. If you make $70,000, it is taxed up to $70,000. If you make $120 million in income, your first $120,000 is taxed for Social Security purposes; everything else is taxed at zero for Social Security purposes.  My view is that every dollar of income should be taxed for Social Security purposes, and that does two things: First, we are going to be in a position to increase benefits--not massively, but every little bit counts. Second, we will be able to increase the solvency of the Social Security trust fund to the year 2049.  Most every family has a Social Security story, whether it is a grandmother who relies on the program's benefits to pay for groceries, a father who suffered a debilitating injury after decades of hard work and receives much needed Social Security disability benefits, or a widowed mother who relies on Social Security survivors benefits to bring up her children.  In my own home, we have three generations living together--my wife Linda and me; our kids, Tyler and Mia; and Linda's parents, George and Ping George Kwok lived the American dream. He ran a chop suey house, a Chinese restaurant in Honolulu, Kwok's Chop Suey, and worked hard all his life to give opportunities to his kids, until his eyes gave out. Like 200,000 seniors across Hawaii, he now relies on Social Security--SSDI--Social Security disability.  I tell you about my family not because we are unique but because we are not, because we are like so many families in Hawaii and across the country. And with the number of retirees growing, we need to do everything we can to strengthen this program, not to weaken it.  After a lifetime of hard work, seniors deserve to retire with the dignity and the benefits they have earned. This is a promise from the Federal The current generation of Americans must keep our promises to seniors, but given his record, I am convinced that Congressman Mulvaney will try to do the opposite.  The second issue I am concerned about is the basic operations of government. Whether you are a member of the military, a visitor to a national park, or a worker looking to retire in the near future, we all need for the government to fulfill its basic obligations. But Congressman Mulvaney voted to default on the U.debt several times, and he did it in the face of warnings from the U.Treasury that this would be unprecedented and catastrophic for our economy and that it could drive the world deep into another recession just as we were finally recovering from the last one.  Think about how markets would react if the U.Government declared that it would not make good on its financial obligations. The stock markets would go crazy, and not in a good way. That would be terrible for the millions of people who invest their savings in the market for their retirement.  The Congressman has also voted several times to shut down the Federal Government, all in the name of getting his way. I cannot emphasize enough how dangerous his approach to government is. It is one thing as a Member of the House Freedom Caucus, as a Member of the U.House of Representatives--there are 435; you can take positions--but it doesn't have quite the direct impact that the Office of Management and Budget does. He has put party and partisan views over some of the most fundamental and basic principles of our government. To close the government, to stop paying our bills, to make people across the planet question the full faith and credit of the United States is beyond comprehension.  It should take a real crisis to pull Congress away from the negotiating table and all the challenges in front of us. But it actually wasn't a crisis that led the Congressman to vote to close our government; it was Planned Parenthood and the While we may disagree about the best approach on healthcare and even on reproductive choice and women's health, those disagreements should never get in the way of the U.Government going about its business. Yet Congressman Mulvaney's actions went against that basic principle.  With respect to our Democratic institutions, the procedural violence that was done to the U.Congress is hard to overstate in this case. The idea that a faction of a party would demand concessions--and I think we remember this--would demand concessions in exchange for satisfying their infliction of pain on the United States is unbelievable. And why? Because we are all Americans here. We all want to do right by our country. So the idea that one party would be willing to inflict terrible pain on the country, or else, was so beyond the pale that there is no rule against it, there is no law against it. And do you know why there is no rule and no law against it? It is because nobody contemplated that a major political party would behave in such a way. The assumption has always been that elected leaders would find a better way to stand up for their strongly held beliefs than by threatening to bring the American economy to its knees. Up until the shutdown led by the Congressman, that had been a safe assumption.  In 2011, Congress's delay in raising the debt limit forced the Department of Treasury to take what they call extraordinary measures to ensure that our government could pay its bills.[[Page S1212]]GAO estimates that this raised Treasury's borrowing costs by about $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011. That is $1.3 billion in added government costs just for coming close to defaulting. The Bipartisan Policy Center projects that the full cost of that crisis to the Federal Government alone--not to the private sector economy, just the Federal Government--was around $20 billion over the maturity of that debt.  There is nothing conservative about defaulting on what we owe. It cripples free markets. It is Russian roulette playing, with a bullet in every chamber. There is nothing conservative about that.  When the government closed in 2013, we paid Federal workers to stay home. I want everybody to understand what we ended up doing. Listen, it wasn't their fault. These government employees are not the ones who screwed up; it was the Congress that screwed up. We paid dedicated Federal workers who want to do their jobs, not to do their jobs. We forced them to stay home and paid them anyway. I defy you to find a conservative outside of the Halls of Congress who finds that to be a conservative proposition. It is one thing to shut down the government for a couple of weeks and accrue the savings. I think that is inhumane, I think that is bananas, but at least you would save the money. These folks ended up paying all the money out and just forcing government workers to not do their jobs. This is not the left or right; this is upside down. We prevented Federal workers from doing their important work, like assisting small businesses and combating terrorism.  Ultimately, the 2013 shutdown was a bad move for our economy and for our budget. It cost us money instead of saving us money. In just the first week, it cost the economy $1.6 billion in lost economic output, and it cost about $160 million a day on the private sector side.  Worst of all, the Congressman has not seen the error of this. There were a lot of Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who--in the heat of the battle, you sort of think the other side is going to back off and listen. We all learn lessons. We all make mistakes. There are a lot of Republicans who went through that shutdown and said: We never want to do that to the country again. But Congressman Mulvaney has not seen the error of his ways. He still believes the government shutdown was a good idea, and he said so at the confirmation hearing.  Senator McCaskill asked if he still thought the shutdown was the right way to go about things, and he answered yes. He answered yes. This kind of budget brinkmanship is not good for our government, to say the least, but it is certainly a bad fit for the person running the  The third issue I want to talk about is the Congressman's rejection of the role of public health and science. If we look at some of the biggest issues our country faces, it is clear that we need an OMB Director who understands the value of science, research, and public health. But the Congressman has said that climate change is based on ``questionable science'' and ``baseless claims.'' He has asked if we need government-funded research at all. These are not the views we should see from the person who directs the budget of the executive branch.  In September of last year, Congressman Mulvaney posted a statement about Zika on He said:       I have received all sorts of email and Facebook comments      this week on Some people want me to pass a ``clean''      bill (which I suppose means not paying for it with spending      reductions elsewhere.) Other folks want us to fund more      research if we can find a way to pay for it.       No one has written me yet, though, to ask what might be the      best question: Do we really need government research at all?      Do we really need government funded research at all?  In his statement, he goes on to ask questions that many have asked about what we are seeing in Brazil, as opposed to other countries affected by But that is exactly why you do the research. It is not for a Member of Congress to referee how much money should go to CDC and play amateur scientist. We have expert agencies. The CDC did an extraordinary job, not just on Zika but on They have done extraordinary work over the decades in keeping people safe. If he is saying there are some scientific mysteries remaining around Zika, that is absolutely true. That is why we need to give the CDC and the National Institutes of Health money to try to figure this out. Those questions are the very reasons we need government-funded research, not an excuse to get rid of it.  I want to be clear as to why this matters so much. I am not trying to catch him saying something that is a little off. There is a foundational, bipartisan consensus around public health research, and the person who has been nominated to run the Federal budget doesn't appear to believe in that research. This isn't just out of the political mainstream. People will die if he implements his point of view.  Look at some of the diseases where government-funded research has had a significant impact on saving lives: Ebola, HIV/AIDS, malaria, polio, to name a few. We have made the advances we see today because the government stepped in and invested in the research, and that has to continue.  Right around the time we debated funding for Zika, I visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, in Atlanta to learn more about their efforts to combat Zika, dengue, and other diseases. I left Atlanta feeling totally confident that the CDC will help our country with challenges like Millions of Americans are counting on the government to maintain that confidence. But that can happen only if CDC has the strongest funding possible so they can continue to do their good work.  Taking money away from the Prevention and Public Health Fund would strip the CDC and other important agencies of the funds they need to protect our country from within and from without. That is what happened in The legislative branch did not fully step up to the plate and do its job in addressing Because of that, we forced the Obama administration to pull money from the CDC to address Ebola or from States to address other public health risks. Doing so disrupted public health infrastructure planning across the world that we still need to make sure that Ebola never ravages communities again.  Regardless of your side of the aisle, we can all agree this is the one thing that government has to do; that is, to keep us physically safe. Investing in CDC and other agencies that protect our citizens from diseases shouldn't depend on your philosophy of government. Unless you believe in, literally, no government, this is money well spent. This is the kind of thing the government does. We cannot walk away from our country's legacy of funding good research that saves lives, but that is exactly what Congressman Mulvaney suggests we do.  He has also made deeply disturbing comments about the science behind climate change. There can be no doubt that climate change is real, that it is caused by humans, and that we have a responsibility to take action. We ignore the science that shows us this at our own risk, and it is a risk our country cannot take.  The fourth and final issue I want to touch upon is healthcare--specifically, Medicare and I am a little worried that people feel reassured because of the rhetoric they heard last year from the He did reassure his voters that he was going to save Medicare and Medicaid and protect it from cuts. He promised several times that he wouldn't make any cuts whatsoever to Medicare and But when a Senator reminded Congressman Mulvaney about this during his confirmation hearing, he did not say he would support the administration's promises to the American people. He said that he would advise the President to break that promise. He said that he would advise President Trump to break his campaign promise and change Medicare and Why are we voting for this person? He said that he would advise the President to break the promise and change Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  He wants to cut Medicaid--a program that millions of people rely upon. More than 50 years ago, when Medicaid was created, Congress made a really smart decision and designed the program so that if and when healthcare costs rise or the economy starts to struggle, Medicaid would be there for the American people, no matter what. Now the counselor to the President says that as part of the ACA replacement plan, Medicaid will be converted to block grants.[[Page S1213]]  I worry a little bit about the phrasing ``block grants'' because that doesn't sound that bad. I used to work in the not-for-profit sector. I like grants, and I used to pursue Community Development Block Grants, Community Services Block I like grants; I like I am not sure whether ``block'' means anything positively or negatively, but I want everybody to understand what block-granting Medicaid means: It means cutting That is exactly what it means. It is a euphemism. People in this administration and people nominated to be part of this administration share that view, and they have a long history to back it up.  The term ``block grants'' is a euphemism. It is not quite a lie, but it is a way to describe something so that you don't know what it is. They are calling it a block grant because they don't want to say they are cutting That is what they are doing; they are going to cut Medicaid, and these cuts will hurt millions of people. They will hurt working families.  Everybody understands Medicaid is there for the economically indigent, in the case of an emergency. But the thing that people also don't realize--and that is a really important aspect of that program--but it is also really important for nursing home care. That is not just an issue for people who are down on their luck financially or while they are young or while they are parents. When people get older, it is really difficult to afford nursing home care. For most people who are not extraordinarily wealthy, Medicaid is the way to handle nursing home care. It is reimbursable.  I know that nursing home care in Hawaii costs $8,000, $9,000 a month. I don't know anybody who can run through $8,000, $9,000 a month for very long. I know a couple of people, but most people I know can't do that without Certainly, Medicaid is an issue that affects the very poor, but it also affects the rest of us. It affects people who aren't just lying on a pile of cash to take care of their grandmother or their mother or their father or their spouse when they are in their golden years.  These cuts will hurt women who need Medicaid for maternal health services, as well as seniors and people with disabilities. These people have nowhere else to turn. Medicaid is their only option.  Some people point to expanded local control as a reason to move forward with block grants. That is just nonsense. They are basically going to flatten out or cut the amount a State gets, and then they can sit there and divide up an increasingly smaller pie. I am not sure if that is even a euphemism. That is just nonsense. That will not help any State to meet their needs. That is why Republican Governors--anybody with responsibility for actually governing, delivering services to their constituents--don't want to cut They don't want to reduce Medicaid expansion under ACA, and they certainly don't want a block grant because they know what that will mean. Even if you are a fiscal conservative, if you are in charge of a State, you understand exactly what is going to happen to your constituents if Medicaid is cut.  This is another instance of a party that promised not to touch But here we are, debating a nominee to lead the OMB who wants to make cuts to this program. This is a deal breaker for me and for many others, and it will be a disaster for millions of That is why today we have to stand up for seniors, for women, for children and fight any cuts to That starts with voting no on this nomination.  I have heard about Congressman Mulvaney from hundreds of people from the State of I want to share a few of the messages that I have received from people in  Here is what one man from Oahu wrote:       As a researching scientist, I recognize the very      significant damage these appointees will have on US health      and competitiveness in the world.       A break in research funding, or politically-directed and      censored research, impacts long term research. A brief hiatus      can result in many years set-back of programs and resulting      societal benefits.  A woman from Volcano Village on the Big Island sent me this message:       [This administration's] agenda lies in [the] nominees for      the department of Health and Human Services and the Office of      Management and Budget who have spent their congressional      careers trying to destroy [Social Security, Medicare, and      Medicaid].  Another woman wrote me with this:       [The] nominees for HHS and OMB are walking disasters for      the department they'd lead.       Both have spent their congressional careers trying to      destroy [Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid]. Oh, yes,      and the ACA/Obamacare, which has proven to be resoundingly      popular.  We are hearing from so many people on these issues because they understand how this works. They understand that personnel is policy. You don't get to say you are for protecting Social Security, and then vote for someone who wants to eliminate Social Security as we know it. You don't get to say you are for protecting Medicare and Medicaid, and then vote for someone who has dedicated their career to eliminating or at least seriously undermining this program.  If you want to increase the Social Security retirement age, then this is your nominee. If you aren't opposed to seeing our country go through a series of precipices with the shutdown of the Federal Government--from the huge drops in the market to the closing of our National Parks--then this is your nominee. If you think Federal investments in public health, disease control, and prevention should be eliminated, then this is your nominee. If you want to see cuts to Medicare and Medicaid by 25 percent or more, then vote yes.  But if, like me, you know that this is not the right approach to governing, that this is not how we should go about caring for our people and preparing for the future, then you need to vote no.  At the end of the day, the leader of the Office of Management and Budget will need to understand how to build a budget for our country and make sure U.Government agencies have the resources they need to pursue the mission. This person will need to understand why diplomacy matters, why Medicare and Medicaid matter, why job training and education programs matter, and why financial and fiscal stability matters. Ultimately, he needs to know that government matters and that it can make a difference in people's lives. It determines how bright tomorrow can be for our kids and grandkids and how safe of a world we can create for them.  Congressman Mulvaney does not have that record or a confirmation hearing record that can convince any of us that he understands the potential we all have--the obligation we have--to make the right investments that reflect who we are and the future that we want as a country. That is why I will be voting no on this confirmation, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

4984,topic-id,520,"Mr.President, finally, on the Affordable Care My Republican friends have repeated the mantra for 7 years, ``Repeal and replace, repeal and replace.'' It turns out, during those 7 years, they never came up with a coherent plan to replace the Affordable Care It was all slogans, no policy.  Now they are scrambling to come up with something. The problem is, every draft, every leaked detail or outline or list of principles we have seen is tied together by one common thread: It will raise costs on average Americans and cut back on their benefits. Average Americans, under the Republican plan, will pay more and get less.  No wonder they are hiding the plan somewhere in a basement room, even as they are scheduling markups on the bill for a week from now. They don't want the folks to see it until the very last minute; just rush it through. I don't blame them. It is going to be very hard for Republicans to be proud of this plan, which hurts average Americans, raising their costs and taking away benefits.  It is the absolute height of hypocrisy to be hiding this plan. My Republican colleagues complained bitterly, day after day, week after week, month after month, about not having enough time to read the Affordable Care Act when it was being debated. At the time, my friend, the distinguished majority leader, said:       Americans want us to slow down, and Congress is putting its      foot on the accelerator. Americans want to know what this      bill would mean for them, and Congress won't let them read it      before a vote . . .

By keeping their replacement bill under lock and key, only a week before potentially voting on it, the Republicans are engaging in enormous hypocrisy--exactly what the majority leader complained about only a few years ago. Their mantra in past years was always ``read the bill.'' Now they will not even let us glance at it. Why are they hiding it? I think I know why. They are not very proud of it. They know it is not going to work.  They are being pushed blindly forward by their ideologues and their incessant campaign promises. The American people ought to know how Republicans plan to drastically reshape this Nation's health care policy. I suspect Americans will not like it much. I suspect it will raise costs and cut benefits. I suspect far fewer Americans will get coverage. I suspect their plan will put the insurance companies back in charge.  Whatever it does or doesn't do, the American people and their representatives in Congress, after 7 long years of slogans, ought to know the true face of ``replace.''  I yield the floor.

4932,topic-id,1679,"Mr.President, unfortunately I don't share the enthusiasm of my colleague from Arkansas for Mick Mulvaney to serve as the Director of the Office of Management and In fact, I have great concerns about this nominee's views on a whole range of issues.  Because those views are far outside the mainstream of this country, I intend to vote against his confirmation. First and foremost, I am concerned about Mick Mulvaney's repeated votes against raising the debt ceiling and his reckless willingness to shut down the government in order to advance his extreme views.  It is Representative Mulvaney's longstanding position that failure to raise the debt ceiling would not precipitate a crisis. He said: ``I have yet to meet someone who can articulate the negative consequences.'' Well, let me articulate the consequences in very simple terms. If we refuse to raise the debt ceiling, we would default on the national debt, destroy the credit worthiness of the U.Government, and trigger a global financial crisis.  As the Governor of New Hampshire, I worked very hard with our State treasurer and with the legislature, through some very challenging fiscal times, to maintain New Hampshire's State bond rating. We did that because we knew that lowering the State's bond rating would mean an increase in costs for businesses trying to borrow money, for the government trying to borrow money, for taxpayers because they would have to pay those increased costs, and it would have a ripple effect across the economy that would have a real impact on the people of New  Representative Mulvaney does not seem to appreciate what would happen if the Federal Government defaulted on our debt. He has argued that the Treasury Secretary could avoid such a crisis by prioritizing interest payments; in other words, paying foreign holders of U.debt but not Social Security beneficiaries or the men and women of our Armed Forces, but there is no legal authority to do this. It is impractical, and recent Treasury Secretaries have denounced the idea. We got a foretaste of the consequences of default in 2011, when Representative Mulvaney and others blocked legislation to raise the debt ceiling, a crisis that took nearly 3 months to resolve.  That manufactured crisis shook financial markets, caused a spike in interest rates on U.securities, and it lead Standard and Poor's to take away America's AAA credit rating, and it cost $18.9 billion. Who does Mick Mulvaney think paid those $18.9 billion? It was the people of this country. Representative Mulvaney has repeatedly threatened to shut down the Federal  He helped lead the charge in shutting down the government in October of 2013 in a failed and misguided attempt to repeal the Affordable Care In 2015, he threatened to shut down the government again in order to defund Planned Both of those programs are critically important to the people of New Nearly 1 out of 10 Granite Staters have health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Planned Parenthood provides accessible, affordable healthcare to women all across the State of New Hampshire, women who, in most cases, could not get their healthcare any other way.  As Senator Durbin pointed out earlier, 97 percent of the services provided by Planned Parenthood are services that have nothing to do with abortion; they have to do with access to mammograms, to cancer screenings, to STD testing, the whole range of healthcare services that women need.  Unfortunately, the 16-day shutdown in 2013 created havoc across the economy, leading to the loss of an estimated 120,000 jobs. Millions of small businesses faced significant disruptions, many employees were laid off, and some businesses could not make payroll. But Representative Mulvaney is unrepentant. He insists that the shutdown was worth it. Well, tell that to some of the businesses in New Hampshire that took a huge hit. His brand of government by temper tantrum is reckless, it is irresponsible, and it should not be rewarded with a nomination to be the chief budget officer for the country.  Representative Mulvaney's disdain for true fiscal conservatism and his unbalanced budget priorities should also give us pause. He supports budgets that would provide massive tax cuts for corporations, for those at the top, and he would pair those with deep budget cuts for the middle class and the most vulnerable people in our society, including seniors and people with disabilities.  Representative Mulvaney advocates for radical cuts to Social Security and to Medicare and He has promised to end Medicare as we know it, privatizing it and converting it to a voucher program that shifts costs to seniors.  He advocates raising the retirement age to 70 for Social Security and 67 for Imagine telling construction workers and others who perform heavy labor that they have to work until age 70 before they can retire with the security of a Social Security check.  He also advocates shifting costs to States by block-granting Essentially what block grants do is give the money to States and allow them to administer those dollars. As a former Governor, I think States can administer those dollars, but when you want to cut as much as $1 trillion from healthcare services, which is what Mick Mulvaney wants to do, then you can administer them as well as possible, but you are still not going to be able to make up to the seniors and to disabled Americans and others in nursing homes for the cuts that are going to come when you block-grant those dollars to  Unfortunately, that is not the end of his extreme budget ideas. He advocates taking a meat-ax to the whole range of programs that bolster the middle class, everything from cancer research, to Pell grants, to healthcare.  Representative Mulvaney has even questioned the appropriateness of Federal funding for scientific research. In a Facebook post questioning the scientific consensus linking the Zika virus to microcephaly, he wrote: ``What might be the best question: Do we really need government funded research at all?'' Think about that.  Senator Durbin was very eloquent in talking about the difference that research has made in ending polio and addressing so many other diseases, such as HIV, that have affected Americans and people across the world. Well, the President's choice--Mick Mulvaney--to draft his annual budget, to be the head of his budget office, openly doubts that the government should be involved in addressing public[[Page S1199]]health threats, such as So how deeply does he plan to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control, for the National Institutes of Health, for our National Laboratories, and for federally funded extramural research? We don't know the answer to that, but we can assume from his statements that it is going to be significant.  Federally funded R&D is critical not only to addressing threats to public health but also to developing new technologies that enhance our national security and protect the environment. These technologies are essential to growing our economy and maintaining America's global leadership in technology and biomedical sciences.  In New Hampshire, the most dynamic sector of our economy is high-tech manufacturing and innovation. For our economy to grow, we need to stay ahead of global competition. But that doesn't happen on its own; it requires sustained investment in basic research--often research that the private sector considers too risky to do on its own.  As ranking member of the Senate Small Business Committee, I have seen this vividly demonstrated by the very successful Small Business Innovation Research Program, or SBIR works by harnessing the creativity and ingenuity of America's small businesses to meet the R&D missions of our Federal agencies, while also supporting the growth of small, high-tech companies that create good jobs in local communities across this country.  One recent study found that every dollar awarded by the Air Force to SBIR firms generated $12 in economic growth. That growth happens because small businesses develop technologies and then commercialize those technologies, creating good jobs in each of our  Many of these technologies are developed for our Armed Forces to better protect the homeland. A great example of that, which I have seen firsthand, is a company based in Hanover, NH, called Creare is working with the Navy to develop an innovative clothes dryer that dramatically reduces the risk of fires on submarines, and that is just one example of why the SBIR Program is the envy of the world.  I want to quote Charles Wessner, who led the National Academy of Sciences study of the SBIR In describing that program, he said: ``The rest of the world thinks this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.''  Well, make no mistake, this successful program is in serious jeopardy if Representative Mulvaney puts Federal R&D investments on the chopping block.  It is truly shocking that the President has nominated a budget director who questions the value of Federal funding for R&We need to invest in science. We need to invest in our small businesses, which create two out of every three jobs in this economy.  The OMB Director is one of the most senior economic advisers to the President of the United States, with enormous influence on policy matters.  Representative Mulvaney has been a zealous advocate for radical cuts to Social Security, to Medicaid, to the whole range of programs that support the middle class in this country. In addition, his willful failure to pay required Federal taxes has raised serious concerns about his integrity, which we all know is essential for every Cabinet officer.  After careful study of his record, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together to reject this nominee. Putting Mick Mulvaney in charge of OMB is not just letting the fox guard the hen house; it is giving him a gun to kill the chickens, a pot to boil those chickens in, and a knife to eviscerate them when they are done.

5061,topic-id,461,"Mr.Speaker, it is an honor to represent the people of Pennsylvania's 16th Congressional District and to serve the community in which I grew up.  I was very pleased a few months ago to come to Washington and join the new Member orientation. It was a great opportunity for all of us to meet our new colleagues on both sides of the aisle; and I must say, as has already been mentioned, I was impressed.  As we got to know one another and talk about our vision for this upcoming Congress, we all agreed we wanted to work together as much as possible. We decided we wanted to work to find common ground.  Today, across Pennsylvania and across America, finding common ground between Republicans and Democrats looks and sounds nearly impossible. We here in Congress may disagree on the issues, we may disagree on the solutions, but that is good. That is good because the purpose of this Chamber is to be a deliberative body. It is good because, collectively, we represent a wide range of issues across the political spectrum--we are supposed to--and, in fact, we are even expected to disagree, but we must always do so in a civil and respectful manner.  We must understand that, while we may disagree on the issues and solutions, we share, all of us, the common goal of serving our constituents and of improving their lives. We must understand that just because we may disagree with one another, that doesn't mean the other side is un-American or out to get us.  Arthur Brooks, President of the American Enterprise Institute, calls this ``political motive asymmetry.'' Brooks says: ``A majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate.''  Now, I know I might disagree with some of my colleagues, but I can tell you, they are not motivated by hate. If we are to be successful in this Chamber and in discussions in our communities across the country, we must rid our discourse of this political motive asymmetry. Then we will be able, together, to find solutions more easily to the problems that we face.

It is a great place to live. There is a mystique surrounding my great State--a well-earned mystique. People travel to Alaska from all over the world to discover a part of themselves that craves high peaks, beautiful mountains, streams, and swaths of wilderness.  The real wonders of Alaska are our people--kind and generous people, many of whom have etched warm homes and welcoming communities out of wilderness. One of those people who has helped make my State truly extraordinary is Mona Painter, our Alaskan of the  Mona, who will be 80 years old soon, first visited Alaska when she was just 11 in 1949.

It has some of the best fishing and rafting anywhere in the world--an astonishingly beautiful place.  It has people like Mona, a devoted wife, grandmother, great-grandmother, and someone, who according to one fellow resident, is ``the glue that binds the community of Cooper Landing together.''  She has done so much for this community--volunteering countless hours over the decades to ensure community cohesion in the schools, churches, and various clubs, including the Cooper Landing Community Hall, which serves as the community's unofficial city council.  Since living in Cooper Landing, Mona received an art degree, has taken anthropology classes, and even took a taxidermy class--once practicing her skills on a moose left on the side of the highway.  One of Mona's passions throughout the years has been to keep history alive in Cooper To that end, she started the Cooper Landing Historical Society and Museum, with which she is still very involved. For years she has devoted her time and energy to collecting bits of history about Cooper Landing and sharing that history with her neighbors, with residents, and with all She is also the founding member of the Kenai Communities Association and helped to spearhead the effort to create a national heritage area in that part of our  One of her friends said about her: ``The whole essence of her life has been to make this community a better place to live and to restore the history of the community.''

Thank you, DeLynn, for your years of service to You will always, always have a home with us.  Mr.President, I rise in support of Congressman Mulvaney's confirmation to be OMB Director for many of the reasons that a number of my colleagues have come to the floor and mentioned. The Presiding Officer just talked about some of those reasons. My colleague and friend from Wisconsin did a few minutes ago, also. Those are two issues that don't get talked about enough here and, certainly, weren't talked about enough in the last 8 years; that is, economic growth and the overregulation of our economy.  Again, it wasn't talked about a lot, but we had a lost decade of economic growth. The end of the Bush years and the entire Obama years never hit 3 percent GDP growth in 1 year--never. That is the first President in the history of the country not to do that.  For thousands, millions of Americans the American dream was starting to disappear because nobody focused on the issue of growth. I think in November the American people voted and said: We are not going to give up on the American dream. We want growth. We want opportunity. Why did we have that lost decade of growth where the economy grew at an anemic 1.5-percent GDP growth each quarter?  I think this chart shows a lot of the reasons right here--the explosion of Federal regulations that have literally choked opportunity and economic growth in our country. Year after year--Democrat or Republican--this is[[Page S1206]]what we see. This regulatory overreach impacts all kinds of Americans, mostly small businesses. This is a big reason why this economy has been stuck in first gear.  When I had my discussions with Congressman Mulvaney, we focused on this issue of growth, and we focused on this issue of overregulation. We haven't had an OMB Director in years who is focused like a laser on growth, like a laser on making sure we don't overburden our economy the way the Federal Government has done for decades. That is exactly what we need right now. We need growth. We need opportunity for We need the Federal Government to be a partner in opportunity, not an obstacle, as it is in so many  For these reasons and because I believe the next OMB Director is going to be focused on these issues--opportunity for Americans and growth for our economy, which sorely needs it--I plan on voting for the confirmation of Congressman Mulvaney, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.

Hate speech and hate crimes are spiking. Fake news is increasing. Terrorism threatens the world, and 60 million refugees are displaced across the globe.  The public is convinced that elected officials don't seem to get much done regarding the shrinking middle class, immigration reform, climate change, gun violence, and a whole bunch more. What should we do?  Love thy neighbor: That may seem like a simplistic public policy prescription, but love thy neighbor is a concept that can be found across many traditions.  If we are going to get Republicans and Democrats to actually come together as people of goodwill in search of the common good, it is going to require us to rely on some shared principles.  Faith and religious beliefs are the most effective, existing sources of commonality that may be relied upon. If people of different political philosophies actually believed that their opponents were similarly motivated by a common set of values to love thy neighbor, I believe we would get a lot more talking and problem-solving and, yes, less yelling and screaming.  Even nonreligious Americans have a fundamental belief in the religion-based concept of love thy neighbor. Discussing issues civilly and rooted in shared faith and values will result in more good work being accomplished.  The good news is that, during the first 6 weeks, I found that many of my colleagues seemed genuinely inspired by their faith and their values. Maybe if we all agree to be civil and recognize that many of us here are motivated by the same command to love thy neighbor, we might be a little more effective.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to overturning the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule under the Congressional Review Undoing this rule would once again allow unethical Federal contractors to collect billions of dollars from taxpayers while stealing from, endangering, and discriminating against their employees.  Right outside this building, on January 20, President Trump promised to give power back to the people and empower everyday I do not understand how allowing Federal contractors to hide records of wage theft, safety violations, and discrimination keeps that promise.  I am particularly concerned with what repealing this rule will mean for our Nation's veterans. Because Federal contractors are encouraged to employ the men and women who have served, they will be greatly affected if we let companies off the hook for repeatedly violating workplace laws.  In addition, President Obama's executive order helps to guarantee that Federal contractors comply with longstanding law that protects veterans and people with disabilities from discrimination in the workplace. It also encourages contractors to recruit, hire, promote, and retain these individuals.  This is why the Paralyzed Veterans of America wrote a letter to the Speaker and minority leader asking that they oppose this resolution to ensure fair and safe working conditions for our veterans.

They don't care about your religious beliefs; they don't care about your political opinions. They don't care if you sit on the left or the right, liberal or conservative, pacifist or a warrior. They don't care how much you believe in diversity, equality, or freedom of speech.  ``I'm sorry that you have never smelled the breath of a man who wants to kill you. I am sorry that you have never felt the alarm bells ringing in your body, the combination of fear and adrenalin, as you move towards the fight, instead of running from it. I am sorry you have never heard someone cry out for help, or cried out for help yourself, relying on the courage of others to bring you home. I am sorry that you have never tasted the salt from your own tears, as you stand at flag draped coffins, burying men you were humbled to call your friends. I don't wish those experiences on you, but I wish you had them. It would change the way you act, it would change the way you value, it would change the way you appreciate. You become quick to open your eyes, and slow to open your mouth.  ``Most will never understand the sacrifice required to keep men from that compound away from our doorstep, but it would not hurt you to try.

It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos.'' President George Bush spoke these words at his first inaugural address in 2001. It was a time for new beginnings then, and it is a time for new beginnings now.

Malicious discourse is a disservice to those who risked their lives to fight for our freedoms and everything that our great Nation stands for.

5169,topic-id,760,"Mr.Chair, last May, Democrats and Republicans came together to pass the first major environmental law indecades, the Frank Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Before this reform, it had been widely acknowledgedthat the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, was broken. The law was hampered by litigation since shortly after it was passedin 1976, and was rendered almost completely ineffective.  It has only been 7 months since over 400 Members voted for this reform, which requires a number of new rulemakings by the A primary motivation to reform TSCA was to remove procedural hurdles that were preventing the EPA from regulating dangerouschemicals. But the bill before us today would impose new, unnecessary obstacles in the rulemaking process, which will impedeagencies that already are struggling with shrinking budgets and time constraints.  Even some of the Members that had concerns with TSCA reform, myself included, would agree that it is imperative that theserulemakings go forward efficiently in order to protect public health and to give the private sector the certainty that it asksfor when it supported the reform effort.  Unlike 233 of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I did not vote for this bill; but I do firmly believe that therulemakings required by this law must be done effectively and quickly. Unfortunately, the bill before us today would underminethat process. For the record, I do not believe any amendments will fix the underlying bill, and I hope my colleagues will opposethis bill later today.  While Congress has moved on to other priorities, the EPA has been hard at work implementing the law as Congress intended.Since being signed into law in June, the EPA has already put into place new processes to review new chemicals, which is exactlywhat this House instructed them to do.  A number of rulemakings will soon get underway focused on how the EPA prioritizes chemicals for evaluation and how it willconduct risk evaluations. Other rules regarding the EPA's chemical inventory and the process for collecting fees will also beneeded.  The Members that worked on TSCA reform deferred many of these procedural decisions to the EPA because we lacked theexpertise necessary to determine every detail of the most effective, streamlined regulatory process.  We are not toxicologists or chemists, so we empowered the scientists that do this work to receive public feedback and createregulations, based on congressional intent, within a reasonable amount of time.  It is clear that an overwhelming number of Members of the House believe that the EPA needed these tools when we passed theLautenberg bill to fix the EPA's chemical program. Let's not tie the agency's hands as it seeks effective implementation. Wehave seen what happens with a broken chemical safety law. Let's not go back to that.  I would also caution against the bill's requirement to choose the least costly regulatory option. People familiar with TSCAwill know the term ``least burdensome,'' which required the EPA to select the restriction that was demonstrated to be the leastburdensome to address identified risks.  In practice, this requirement was so onerous that the EPA was not even able to restrict known carcinogens like asbestos. TheLautenberg bill ended this requirement. Let's not reinstate this problem for our agencies.  Personally, I do not believe my amendment goes far enough. We should exempt every major environmental law responsible forprotecting Americans' air, water, and land from this bill.  We have seen in many cases that these rules do not hurt the economy. They protect public health and provide much greaterbenefits to society than costs.  Many of our bedrock environmental statutes require agencies to review and update their rules periodically. Members ofCongress should not prevent an agency from simply doing the job that is required of it under the law.  But in terms of this amendment and TSCA reform, Congress knew exactly what would be asked of the EPA in order to carry outthe Frank Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act when we passed it by a vote of 403-12 just a few months ago.We cannot tell the EPA to do something and then tie its hands and expect it to get it done.  This amendment is simple. Do Members of this body want to give our regulatory agencies the tools they need to implement thelaws that Congress has passed? And, in my view, it should not matter if these laws were passed 6 months ago or 60 years ago. Orshould we make it more difficult to implement effective rulemakings, even when there is legislative consensus about the need forthem?  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

5183,topic-id,226,"Mr.Chairman, I oppose this amendment which requires that an agency publish a list of scientific informationrelating to a rule or expected to relate to the rule for each rule that an agency expects to propose for the following year. Iam concerned that this amendment would create unintended consequences and operate as a one-way ratchet to slow down and stop therulemaking process by requiring burdensome disclosures and creating options for procedural gridlock.  Agencies are already required to publish relevant data in support of a rule during these rulemaking processes. Rules that donot appear to be based on a reasoned analysis of relevant data may be vacated by reviewing courts as arbitrary or capricious.Moreover, data acquired through federally funded research is already accessible to researchers who have a legitimate purpose.  I am also concerned that because this amendment does not define scientific information or clarify the scope of thispublication requirement, peer reviewed materials may be taken out of context or otherwise misused for political purposes. In sodoing, this requirement may chill feedback in the scientific community, undermine agencies' ability to adopt the best rulespossible, or otherwise manufacture delays in the rulemaking process.  Any additional requirements in this area should strengthen, rather than weaken, the process of science-based[[Page H363]]rulemaking. Given these concerns, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

4940,topic-id,839,"Mr.President, I wish to oppose the confirmation of Congressman Mick Mulvaney as Director of the Office of Management and I respect Mr.Mulvaney's public service representing the people of South Carolina, who elected him to serve in the State legislature and in However, the question before us today is whether the Senate should confirm him to one of the most important economic positions in our government--a position that has major ramifications for global financial markets, the United States and New Mexico economies, and the jobs, health care, and retirement security of every  Unfortunately, Representative Mulvaney's record shows a shocking willingness to put at risk the security of the public debt of the Nation and endanger essential Federal programs that New Mexicans depend upon. I want to underscore a few of Representative Mulvaney's previous statements made as a Member of  First, he has supported playing chicken with the debt ceiling over partisan political issues, an action that would jeopardize the U.Government's ability to repay the public debt. If the debt ceiling is not raised, Federal officials have said that the revenue coming into the government would not be enough to cover its obligations--potentially disrupting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits, military payments, student loan payments, and many other government services.  Despite these clear dangers, Representative Mulvaney voted no on raising the debt ceiling every time it came up for a vote in 2011, 2012, and 2013. He claimed that risking disruption to Social Security and veterans benefits was ``a fabricated crisis.'' He went so far as to question the majority leader, claiming that, if the Senate chose to raise the debt ceiling, the majority leader ``should just quit and go home.'' I, for one, will be here to defend the full faith and credit of the United[[Page S1208]]States' public debt and protect essential government services that our sick, our elderly, and our veterans depend upon.  Putting someone with such strongly held and reckless views into power at the OMB is an endorsement of policies that could cause another global financial crisis--devastating millions of American families. I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for this reason alone.  Second, Representative Mulvaney is a founding member of the group of extreme House Republicans who forced the government to shut down in October 2013 over their blind opposition to the Affordable Care In New Mexico, the impacts of the shutdown were felt immediately as our civilian employees were sent home from military installations, national parks and forests were closed to tourists, and countless other services were halted. The shutdown lasted over two weeks, and Representative Mulvaney and other members of his extreme wing of the House could have ended the shutdown at any time.  Representative Mulvaney claims that he opposes wasteful government spending, but an analysis by Standard and Poor's found that the October 2013 government shutdown cost $24 billion--$24 billion with nothing to show for it. Even Representative Mulvaney admitted that his shutdown hurt people. On October 16, 2013, he told CNN, ``Were people hurt by this? Sure.'' He admitted that, if you were one of the millions of people who relied on the shuttered services, his shutdown hurt you, but Representative Mulvaney showed little remorse. I stand by what I said at the time. Insisting on blind cuts or a government shutdown to prove a point isn't leadership.  Third and finally, Representative Mulvaney is on record advocating enormous cuts to Medicare, and he is a proponent of Speaker Ryan's preferred voucher concept for He also has long been hostile to Social Security and voted in the South Carolina State Senate to declare Social Security, along with Medicaid and the Department of Education, unconstitutional.  Workers earn their Social Security benefits through a lifetime of paying into the Social Security system. And it is unfair to delay or cut the benefits they have paid into. Raising the retirement age to 70, as Representative Mulvaney has advocated, would cut benefits by nearly 20 percent for all beneficiaries. Raising the retirement age would be hardest for those New Mexicans who work in jobs that require heavy manual labor, which becomes harder to do as we age. With all the challenges people have saving for retirement, especially as New Mexico continues to struggle to recover, the last thing we should do is raise the Social Security retirement age.  In conclusion, Representative Mulvaney has demonstrated that he has no reservations about using a government shutdown or the public debt as bargaining chips. He has stated that he will push to eliminate Social Security for people under 70. He will slash Federal consumer protections and cut support for small businesses, labor rights, financial oversight, community health, and environmental protection. I have heard from many people and groups--a broad coalition of consumer, small business, labor, good government, financial protection, community, health, environmental, civil rights, and public interest organizations--who oppose the nomination. I stand with them. I strongly oppose Representative Mulvaney's nomination to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget and urge my colleagues to do so as well.

5129,topic-id,483,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act has reduced regulatory costs by $130 billion since 1998. However, it could do better. Theamendment I am offering will improve this process.  However, unlike the underlying bill, my amendment is actually aligned with the original statute, which was created toprotect the unique needs of small businesses in the regulatory process, not to stop regulations. My amendment is also much morecost effective to the taxpayers, as the underlying bill creates a massive and unnecessary government bureaucracy. It should benoted that my amendment is based on bipartisan legislation from a previous Congress, which the committee reported by a recordedvote of 26-0.  The amendment makes improvements to the most significant deficiencies facing the Regulatory Flexibility Act without theoverly broad changes contained in the underlying bill. This includes making sure that agencies live up to their obligations toretrospectively review the burdens of existing rules on small businesses. The GAO has reported on numerous occasions that agencycompliance with this requirement was poor. My amendment holds the agencies more accountable by requiring them to report theresults of their reviews to Congress annually.  My amendment also takes steps to make analyses more detailed so that agencies cannot ignore the RFA and simply certify thata rule has no significant economic impact on small businesses. Addressing this matter will ensure that agencies are required toprovide a more factual basis for such certifications rather than just a sentence which dismisses the concerns of small firms.  The most important aspect of my amendment is what it does not do. Unlike H.5, my amendment does not create a newgovernmentwide bureaucracy or foist a truckload of new responsibilities on the Office of Advocacy, which only has a $9 millionbudget.  For instance, H.5 requires the Office of Advocacy to approve size standards, a function already handled by the Thisis like creating a Rayburn cafeteria next to the Rayburn cafeteria. It is ridiculous. This is a complete waste of taxpayerresources and will, ironically, take the Office of Advocacy away from its core mission of monitoring regulations.  Also, another aspect that is very important, what this legislation does is it is setting the Office of Advocacy to fail.They do not have the expertise. They do not have the resources. In addition, H.5 imposes the panel process across the entiregovernment. I will say that again. Across the entire government, including all independent agencies. So much for fiscalresponsibility. There is another complete waste of taxpayer resources, and it will further limit the Office of Advocacy'sability to weigh in on the most important matters affecting small businesses.  Instead, my amendment makes the targeted changes to the RFA that small businesses have called for over the last 5 years. Indoing so, it is cost effective and responsible to the taxpayers. I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on my amendment.

We all agree that bad actors who deny workers basic protections and violate the Fair Labor Standards Act should not be rewarded with government contracts funded by taxpayer dollars. However, the Department of Labor's rule effectively blacklists Federal contractors for alleged violations and would require contractors to defend themselves against these allegations without being entitled to a formal hearing.  The Federal District Court has already ruled that the Department of Labor rule violates contractors' due process rights. Additionally, this rule is unnecessary because the Department of Labor already has significant oversight and investigation capabilities to assess contractor compliance with Federal labor laws.  This rule supersedes agencies' existing authority to hold contractors accountable under the current suspension and disbarment system. My question is why don't they use it?  Misguided regulatory policies, like the blacklisting rule, don't stop bad actors, but they do end up adding new layers of redundant bureaucratic red tape, harming employers and older workers, disabled workers, female workers, minority workers, and workers, in general, alike.  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution of disapproval and roll back this duplicative and unnecessary rule.

4922,topic-id,5430,"Mr.President, on December 8, Donald Trump nominated Andrew Puzder to serve as Secretary of He was scheduled to come before the HELP Committee tomorrow for his confirmation hearing. There is some reporting suggesting that he is having some second thoughts, and I sincerely hope that is true. The reasons Mr.Puzder is a terrible choice for this job are literally too numerous to cover fully, but I will at least give it a start.  If you work for a living, the Labor Secretary is very important to you. This person is responsible for protecting the interests of 150 million American workers. He will be the person responsible for enforcing the law that ensures that employers actually pay workers for every hour they work and setting the standards to prevent workplace injuries and even deaths.  Unfortunately, Mr.Puzder is not the kind of person the American people can trust to stand up for workers. Since 2000, Mr.Puzder has served as the CEO of the billion-dollar company CKE Restaurant You may know it better as the parent company of Carl's and Hardee's. These two fast-food chains are known for paying very low wages to workers. Mr.Puzder has a long record of cheating workers out of overtime. He has paid out millions of dollars to settle claims when he was caught cheating. We are not talking about isolated incidents. They reflect the kind of business Mr.Puzder built. Mr.Puzder is a frequent political pundit and commentator who has vocally opposed higher minimum wages. He has also strongly opposed new overtime protections that would give 4 million workers an estimated $1.5 billion raise in a single year.  Mr.Puzder also delights in expressing personal disdain for his workers. He bragged in his very first memo as He wrote that he wanted ``no more people behind the counter unless they have their teeth.'' Ha, ha. He said he would like to replace his workers with robots because ``they are always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, there's never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex or discrimination case.''  The Senate has an obligation to hear from those who are best qualified to[[Page S1180]]tell America about Mr.Puzder's suitability to be Labor Secretary and to stand up for American workers--his own workers. That is why many of us asked the chairman of the HELP Committee to include Mr.Puzder's workers in his confirmation hearing. When the chairman refused to do so, we just went ahead and convened our own forum to allow those workers a chance to speak.  Seventeen Senators attended. Those 17 Senators heard from Laura McDonald, who worked as a general manager at Carl's in Tucson, AZ, for 20 years. For years, she was forced to work extra hours without pay. Employees like Laura are the subject of a major lawsuit against Mr.Puzder's company, CKE, regarding unpaid overtime.  Those 17 Senators heard from Lupe Guzman, who is a single mother who has devoted the last 7 years of her life to Carl's in Las Vegas, She has worked the graveyard shift for rock bottom wages. Seven years of loyalty, and Lupe is still paid so little that she is on food stamps to feed her kids. Lupe sat in front of the U.Senate and wept openly about her terrible treatment at the hands of Mr.Puzder's company.  The Senators also heard from Roberto Ramirez, who has worked in the fast food industry for over 20 years, mostly at Carl's in Los Angeles, He worked regularly off the clock at Carl's Jr., meaning they didn't pay him. Roberto even had a full paycheck stolen by his manager.  For every Laura, Lupe, and Roberto, we found dozens of workers who were afraid to speak out about the terrible conditions at We compiled some stories from folks brave enough to speak up into a 20-page report detailing firsthand accounts of the men and women who work for Mr.Those stories are horrifying, and I will read some of them later today.  Mr.Puzder's company has a truly atrocious record of treating his own workers terribly. Indeed, he has dripping disdain for people who work for a living. This alone disqualifies him to be Secretary of  But there is more. In recent weeks, it has come out that Mr.Puzder employed an undocumented immigrant in his household for years, and he didn't pay taxes on that employee. Yep, you heard that correctly. The Trump administration, which bellows about building a wall and pounds its chest about ripping millions of families apart with a deportation force, threatens millions of DREAM Act kids with deportation, has no problem putting a guy in charge of the Labor Department who cheats on his taxes and employs undocumented workers. The hypocrisy of that is pretty stunning, even for the Trump administration.  And then there is the controversy over alleged spousal abuse. Over 25 years ago, Mr.Puzder's first wife appeared on an episode of Oprah Winfrey in a show about spousal abuse. I have watched the episode in which she appeared, as I believe every Senator should. I found it extraordinarily troubling.  Alongside his company's poor record of treatment of female employees, his highly explicit and sexualized ads, and his snide comments about sex discrimination, there is ample evidence that Mr.Puzder is a terrible choice to head the agency charged with ensuring that women and men are treated fairly in the workplace.  I understand that no matter who President Trump picks to run the Labor Department, I am probably going to have a lot of issues with that person, but this is different. Andrew Puzder should not be the Labor And if you ask the Senators in this body--Republicans and Democrats--if you ask them behind closed doors with the cameras turned off, you will have a hard time finding people who think this divisive nomination is good for the country.  It has been suggested that Mr.Puzder is ``tired of the abuse'' that he has received during this confirmation process. Well, I think the workers at his companies are pretty tired of the abuse they have received while being at the mercy of an employer who doesn't care about them at all and who goes out of his way to squeeze them out of every last dime. That is literally the opposite of what we need in a Labor  I was prepared to question him on these issues tomorrow, but I hope it is true that he will withdraw his nomination before then.  Mr.President, I also rise today to express many concerns over the appointment of Congressman Mulvaney as Director of the Office of Management and Budget and to urge my colleagues to seriously consider these issues before voting to confirm him.  One of the best ways to understand what a nation stands for is to look at its budget. It is all right there. The budget tells who counts, it tells who gets a chance, and it tells who gets cast aside.  The OMB Director prepares the President's budget. He safeguards the President's promises by turning them into real commitments backed by your tax dollars.  During the campaign, President Trump promised over and over again that he would protect Medicare and He didn't imply it; he didn't drop hints about it. No, he made the clearest, plainest possible promise. He said: ``I am not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.''  But since the election, he has done a complete 180. He put up a transition team website that just dripped with code words for cuts, saying that he would modernize and maximize flexibility for these programs. Gone were the unambiguous promises to protect Medicare and  Then he started nominating people who have made it their life's work to gut Medicare and His Secretary of Health and Human Services has proposed cutting more than $1 trillion from these programs, and now his nominee for OMB Director is someone who wants to cut Medicare and Medicaid to the bone.  Congressman Mulvaney has voted to increase the retirement age for Hey, you have paid into that program with decades of hard work? Too bad, just keep waiting.  He also wants to privatize Medicare, and he wants to slash and burn his way through Medicaid--a program that is a lifeline for millions of people--for parents of people in nursing homes, for people with disabilities, for premature babies.  In his confirmation hearing, Congressman Mulvaney was asked whether he would set aside his rightwing ideology to fulfill the President's campaign promises to protect Medicare and The Congressman could not have been clearer in his response: Forget all of that. Nope, not interested. Mulvaney is still a true believer in Medicare and Medicaid cuts, and whenever he has the President's ear, he will continue to advance his own radical ideas for burning down these indispensable programs.  President Trump also promised that he would not cut Social He guaranteed it. Here is his quote--many times: ``We're going to save your Social Security without making any cuts,'' he said.  Here was his closer on that: ``Mark my words.''  Nice words. But he could have picked someone--anyone--to run his budget, and instead he picked Congressman Mulvaney--one of Congress's most partisan crusaders against the Social Security program. He wants to raise the retirement age to 70. Heck, this is a person who calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme, and, boy, he is not messing around, either.  During his confirmation hearings, Congressman Mulvaney doubled down on his promise to rob American workers and retirees by gutting Social When pressed by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham about whether he would urge President Trump to reconsider his promise not to cut Social Security, hey, Mulvaney said that he absolutely would.  Is this just a mistake? Did President Trump just pick Congressman Mulvaney by accident? The Congressman certainly doesn't seem to think so.  At his hearing he said: ``I have to imagine that the President knew what he was getting when he asked me to fill that role.''  Yes, Mulvaney himself believes he is being brought in to push for cuts in Medicare and  Trump reverses his promise, a second person determined to cut Medicare and Medicaid makes it into a key government role, and who will pay the price? America's seniors, that is who.  Apparently, Congressman Mulvaney isn't satisfied with cutting benefits for[[Page S1181]]Americans who have worked and paid into the program for their entire lives. When it comes to abandoning American workers and families, for him, that is just the beginning.  He has also called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ``a sick, sad joke.'' Maybe he should spend a little more time talking to his constituents and a little less time talking to bank lobbyists.  The CFPB has helped thousands of people in every State--including dozens of people in Congressman Mulvaney's own district--recover unauthorized fees on their credit cards and checking accounts. It has helped them to correct errors on their credit reports. These are students, seniors, servicemembers, and veterans, who may have spent months haggling with their bank or student loan servicer over a wrong charge, only to get quick and complete relief after they went to the Consumer Financial Protection  In total--the agency has only been up for about 5\1/2\ years now--it has forced the largest banks across this country, many of those who have been out there cheating consumers, to return nearly $12 billion directly to the people they cheated. That is $12 billion that was stolen by big banks, by payday lenders, by debt collectors, and is now back in the pockets of the people who rightfully earned it.  The only sick, sad joke is that Congressman Mulvaney thinks we should turn the big banks loose to prey on American families once again.  Under Congressman Mulvaney's budget, Americans who have been cheated and scammed by huge financial institutions will just be cast aside. Families who work hard for every dollar, only to have some ruthless corporation steal their savings right out from underneath them, will be cast aside. And the millions of Americans who have worked for decades planning to collect Social Security or Medicare when they retire will be told to just wait four more years. They will be thrown straight to the curb. None of that--none of that--is what America stands for.  That is just the stuff that directly contradicts the President's campaign promises. The stuff that is totally in line with the President's campaign promises is genuinely scary too.  On the campaign trail, Donald Trump stated that he ``may cut the Department of Education.'' Will Congressman Mulvaney stand up for students?  Congressman Mulvaney's record shows that he is fine building a Federal budget that crushes students who are trying to get a college education. Students already pay too much for student loans, and Congressman Mulvaney's solution is to force students to pay more. He supports forcing more college students to borrow more money from private banks that charge sky-high interest rates without any of the basic protections Federal student loans have. He clearly wants to let private banks and Wall Street squeeze as much cash out of hard-working students as humanly possible to build their profits. In fact, Congressman Mulvaney wants to help these giant banks out even more by taking a sledgehammer to the Federal student loan program and making Federal loan terms lousy for students. That is why he repeatedly voted to eliminate subsidized student loans for low-income students and why he helped block legislation to allow borrowers to lower their monthly payments by refinancing their student loans to lower interest rates. Not only has he voted to increase the interest rates the government charges students, he has also voted to cut Pell grants to poor college students. If Congressman Mulvaney had his way, millions more hard-working students would be shoved even deeper into debt at the start of their working lives just because they couldn't afford the high cost of college. Under his budget, students will just be cast aside.  In his confirmation hearing, Congressman Mulvaney also said he is ``in lockstep'' with Donald Trump's plans to grow military spending, but he said he would pay for that increase in funding with deep cuts to domestic programs that working men and women around the country depend on--programs that could easily include Head Start, which provides opportunities for low-income children; the disaster aid, which supports families in crisis after a hurricane or tornado; or resiliency programs to protect America as worldwide climate changes.  Listen to that again. The children who attend Head Start can stay home so Donald Trump can divert more money to military spending. The people who get buried in a 100-year snowstorm can stay buried so Donald Trump can divert more money to military spending. The people who live near coasts and rivers and streams can be washed away by rising oceans and other waterways so Donald Trump can divert money to military spending--and this nominee, Congressman Mulvaney, is in lockstep to make it happen.  Under President Trump's new one-in, two-out Executive order, it is Mr.Mulvaney who would have discretion to give each agency a regulatory budget and to approve any proposed regulations that increase that budget. The order is supposedly designed to make life easier and to make government work better, but Congressman Mulvaney isn't interested in making government work better, and he is certainly not interested in making life easier. In fact, he has spent his entire political career working to cripple the agencies that protect American families--American workers, American consumers, and American small businesses. Nowhere is this clearer than in his attacks on the Federal agencies that protect consumers, that preserve our environment, and that help keep our country safe. He has worked to starve agencies of the resources they need to do their jobs, voting to cut funding to law enforcement, voting to gut the Social Security Program, and voting to completely defund the organization that provides critical legal services to low-income American children, families, seniors, and veterans.  But it is not enough for him to starve agencies to the breaking point. He has also supported radical bills to stop agencies from issuing regulations that keep our air clean, our food safe, and our economy from suffering another devastating financial crisis. Congressman Mulvaney wants to require agencies to adopt a bill that imposes the least costs on big businesses, even when those costs are about making sure companies don't cut corners by cheating, poisoning, and killing people. Look, if it is cheaper for a corporation to kill you than it is for the corporation to redesign the product or clean up their mess, Congressman Mulvaney stands with the corporation. I am sure he would be willing to say something nice at your funeral about how your contribution helped give the corporation record profits.  If all that wasn't bad enough, Congressman Mulvaney is ready to rock and roll on secret money in politics. Washington is already awash in dark money, but that is not enough for Congressman He has worked to open the doors even wider to secret spending in politics. Over and over, he has voted to shield the identity of political donors, keep them secret. For example, he opposed a rule that required corporations applying for government contracts to disclose their political contributions. Again, just think about that one for a minute. He doesn't want corporations that bid for government contracts to be forced to tell when they give money to help targeted government officials. We already have a problem with money in politics. Mulvaney just wants to make it worse.  Congressman Mulvaney's record shows one thing. He will make sure our Federal Government works well for giant corporations and billionaires who don't like to play by the rules, and he will cast aside the rest of the public to do that. That is definitely not what our Nation stands for.  I understand Democrats and Republicans have different priorities when it comes to the Federal budget. I get that, but when one person wants to slash Social Security for American retirees, to cut Medicare for senior citizens, to gut health benefits for low-income families, to drive up the cost of paying for college, and to gut programs that help families in crisis and low-income children, all in the name of making life even easier for giant corporations and billionaires--well, I think it is clear that his priorities do not include the safety and security of millions of That is a priority that should be at the top of all of our[[Page S1182]]lists in the Senate, Republican and  I will stand with the Americans whom Congressman Mulvaney will cast aside as Budget Director, and I will vote no on his nomination.  Mick Mulvaney wants to slash benefits under Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and countless other programs. These are just numbers to him, but behind those numbers are real people. Real lives are at risk with every decision he will make as the Budget So what I want to do is take the time I have remaining and share the stories of just a few of the people who would be affected.  Lea from Plymouth wrote to me, worried that Congressman Mulvaney would cut Social Security for her and for others in Lea had an interesting suggestion. Here is what she wrote:       I have just sent off an email message to Representative      Mulvaney regarding his spearheading of the cutting of Social      Security benefits.       I challenged him and many of his colleagues to do this:      Live on an income like mine--of $1,219.80--for one month.       Having received my first increase of $2.50 in several      years, it was offset by a Medicare cost increase of $11.50.      Do the math.       I hope you and the other Democratic members of both houses      fight like hell to raise our benefits.       We are definitely in for a bumpy ride for the next 4 years.      As the saying goes . . . ``it ain't going to be pretty!''       Thank you for listening.  Thank you, Thank you for writing.  I also heard from Janneke from Williamstown, who is worried about several nominees working to cut Social Here is what Janneke had to say:       It is terrifying to consider either of these nominees,      Price or Mulvaney, being confirmed for the position to which      they have been nominated. They will work to undo, not to      strengthen, social security. This is a profoundly disturbing      possibility.       I urge you to do everything you can to oppose their      confirmation!  Thank you, I will. I will keep fighting for your hard-earned benefits.  Janet from Florence also reached out to me. She shared the inspiring stories of her and her husband, and then she told me how worried she is that cuts to Social Security and Medicare could be coming under Congressman Mulvaney's watch. Here is what she wrote:       I am 60 years old and have always been employed--in higher      education jobs where I worked hard and long for modest wages,      frequently the case in women-dominated professions.       My husband is a childcare worker who works with infants and      toddlers. The work we do is meaningful and makes a societal      contribution.       At 60 and 64, we have always lived like graduate students.      We shop at the Goodwill, cook from scratch, bring our lunch,      and drive old cars--and bike and walk. We will each be      working until age 70, or longer, if our health permits. This      is fine. We are fortunate to live as we do. But with market-     based retirement funds and with family members needing our      support, we need Social Security, which is NOT BROKEN, to      remain, and be strengthened. And we need access to health      care, for ourselves, children, and grandchildren.       This is a plea from the fading middle class to oppose the      Price and Mulvaney nominations. We--and people far less      fortunate than we are--need your stout support.  Thank you, Thank you and your husband for all you do for your community. I promise I will do my best to protect your benefits.  I have received hundreds of these types of letters--letters from constituents who are scared that cuts to Medicaid and Medicare could endanger their basic ability to survive, letters from constituents who have seen how important these services are to thousands across the State and millions across the country, constituents who aren't sure where to turn and whom to blame. They just know they cannot afford to lose these benefits, like a woman from Somerville, who wrote to me about the work she does as an intensive care coordinator. Here is what she had to say:       I am an Intensive Care Coordinator through Riverside      Community Care, a statewide human service agency that      delivers crucial mental health services to at-risk youth. In      my program, the Guidance Center Community Service Agency, we      specifically provide Child Behavioral Health Initiatives      (CBHI) services to youth in Cambridge, Somerville, Medford,      Malden, Waltham, Woburn, Wilmington, and other northern      towns.       I am extremely nervous that the new presidential      administration will attack Medicaid and put our programs in      jeopardy.       If you're not familiar with the CBHI wraparound model, I      can briefly explain why these services are so important. One:      we serve youth in poverty. Two: our services are community      based, so we go to the homes of the families we're serving,      so they don't need to rely on transportation. Three: we are a      form of outpatient care that prevents youth who are suicidal/     homicidal from needing hospitalization. Or, if they are      hospitalized, helping the family develop a plan for when      they're discharged. Four: Although the child with mental      health diagnosis is our identified client, the services      benefit the whole family. We understand that taking care of      children with special needs is taxing, so we identify      resources and services for parents as well. Five: we work      with state departments like Department of Children and      Families, Department of Health, and Department of      Developmental Six: our model works. I myself      rarely close a case without having had at least one goal      (identified by the family) met and there are growing      statistics about the benefit of having us in place.       I hope you can bring this argument where it needs to go to      ensure that we have a future here in  I want to say on this one: Thank you. Thank you for writing, and thank you for the work you do.  I am doing my best to bring this story. This is a story everybody in the Senate should listen to. It is a story about how we reach out to those who most need us and provide the kind of care they need.  Thank you. Thank you for your work, and thank you for writing.  I also received a letter from an occupational therapist from She told me all about the important work she has been doing and how Medicaid has been crucial to that work. Here is what she had to say:       As a constituent and occupational therapy practitioner, I      am writing to you to express my concerns about a major      restructuring of the Medicaid program.       Medicaid is an essential safety net program for the most      vulnerable in our society. In 2015, 39% of children received      health insurance either through the Childrens Health      Insurance Program or through More than 60 percent      of nursing home residents are supported primarily through      Additionally, Medicaid provides health care      services and long-term services and supports to more than 10      million people living with disabilities, and 1 in 5 Medicaid      recipients receive behavioral health services.       Restructuring of the Medicaid program through per capita      caps or block granting and significant cuts to the Medicaid      program would jeopardize the long-term health and      independence of current Medicaid beneficiaries. Thus I urge      extreme care and caution when considering a major      restructuring of the program or other significant changes,      waiver of mandatory services, or dramatic cuts.  Thank you for all the work you do, and thank you for writing and making this important point about who uses Medicaid and how critical it is to the basic support services that we provide.  Another constituent wrote to me about the amazing work that she does in the Boston area for those with severe mental illness and how Medicaid and Medicare help these people. Here is what she had to say:       I work with people with severe Mental Illness in the      greater Boston area. A majority of my patients receive their      therapy and medication through Medicaid and Even      the thought of losing coverage heightens their anxiety. If      coverage is reduced or co-pays raised, they stand to lose not      only therapy and group interventions but also the medication      which is essential to avoiding higher levels of care. Given      the high rate of co-occurring physical and mental health      issues, the general health of my patients will be severely      compromised with any reduction in access to care.       Nearly 1 out of 3 people covered by Medicaid expansion live      with a mental health or substance use condition and people      with marketplace insurance plans have fair and equal mental      health coverage. With this coverage, people have access to      mental health services that support recovery.       As a constituent, I would like you to keep in mind that      Medicaid or insurance marketplace plans are helping all of      those who struggle with mental illness who, with accessible      supports, can lead healthier lives.  Again, thank you for the work you do, and thank you for writing. It is a powerfully important point.  Congressman Mulvaney wants to slash these programs. That is why I will be voting against his nomination.  I also received more personal stories from people like Michael from Acton, who told me about his son. Here is what he wrote:       My particular concern is the attack on the ACA and Medicaid      and       My biggest worry is my 27 year old son, Adam, who was born      with microcephaly. He[[Page S1183]]     is a very loving person with a great smile, but functions      roughly at the level of a 12 month old. He currently lives in      a group residence and goes to a day habilitation program      during the week. Both of these programs are funded in part by      If Medicaid funds are cut, I worry that the day-hab      program will not be able to continue or, at the least, will      operate at a much reduced level. This would seriously degrade      the quality of Adam's life. I worry what will happen at his      already understaffed residence.       As it is, the staff at Adam's residence and day-     habilitation programs are paid very little wages to do very      tough jobs. Because of this, there is already a constant      problem of finding enough people to staff these. . . . jobs      if they are paid less or have to do even more work because of      lower staffing levels[.]       The prospect of what is coming scares me. What will my      son's life be like?  Thank you for writing, I appreciate it. I will be out there fighting for I hope we can get a lot of people in the Senate to do that as well. Thank you.  We also heard from Daniel Mumbauer, who is president of the High Point Treatment Center in Daniel has experienced firsthand how Medicaid funds can change the lives of thousands of people in Massachusetts alone. This is what Daniel wrote:       On behalf of High Point Treatment Center, I am writing to      urge and request your support in protecting the Affordable      Care Act and preserving Medicaid expansion in the 115th            High Point served over 30,000 individuals last year. We      provide substance use disorder and mental health services to      adolescents and adults.       Recent health insurance data show that Americans with      mental health and substance use disorders are the single      largest beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid      expansion. Nearly one in three who receives health insurance      coverage through Medicaid expansion either has a mental      illness, a substance abuse disorder, or both. By repealing      the Medicaid expansion, this population of vulnerable      Americans would be left without access to lifesaving      treatment, driving up costs in emergency department visits      and hospital stays.       I am also writing to urge your support for the protection      of the Medicaid program from proposals to restructure      Medicaid as a block grant or capped program. These proposals      would reduce federal investment in Medicaid and leave      millions of Americans without access to needed mental health      and addictions treatment in our communities. Please work with      your colleagues to protect our nation's most vulnerable      patient population and preserve their access to treatment.  Thank you, Thank you very much for writing, and thank you for the work you do.  Congressman Mulvaney wants to eviscerate health programs that would help Michael's son and the thousands who are treated at the High Point Treatment That is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing.  I have also heard from many constituents worried about losing their Social Security benefits under the new administration, like Kensington from Hatfield, who is terrified that his mother, who depends on Social Security, will lose her benefits. Here is what he wrote:       Last night scared me for the first time. My mother is 69      and depends on Social Security for her income and has severe      COPD and relies on medicare and medicaid for prescriptions      and medical supplies to help her breath[e]. She was crying      and is afraid of losing everything and that she will die. I      know it's extreme thinking, but without her medicine and      income it is unfortunately the truth. I didn't know what to      say to comfort her and that scared me! What can I say to ease      her mind and let her know that she will be Will she be      OK?  Thank you, Kensington, for your note. Your mother is right to be worried, and that is why I am fighting this nomination.  I have so many more stories--many, many stories--that I could read, but I am running out of time here.  I want to say that Mick Mulvaney is dangerous to the American people, and he is dangerous to the Federal He will slash programs right and left without worrying about the living, breathing people whom he is hurting in the process. That is why I will be voting against his nomination as Director of the Office of Management and Budget and why I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Let's make sure that Mick Mulvaney never ends up as the head of the Office of Management and Budget, never is in a position to put together a budget to cut Medicare and cut Let's make sure that we keep our government, our Medicare, our Medicaid, and our Affordable Care Act working for the American people. That is what I will keep fighting for.  Mr.President, I yield.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Toomey).

4950,topic-id,1953,"Mr.President, we are considering the nomination of Congressman Mulvaney to become the Director of the Office of Management and In the context of the review of this nomination, there has been a lot of talk about Congressman Mulvaney being a ``straight shooter.'' I do appreciate his courtesy meeting with me and his participation in our Budget Committee confirmation hearing last month, but I have to say that his 6-year record in the House of Representatives makes it completely impossible for me to vote for him as our Nation's chief budget officer.  He may be a straight shooter, but he shoots straight at the wrong targets. One of them is the credit of the United States of In the House of Representatives, Congressman Mulvaney repeatedly put our economy in jeopardy by voting to let the Federal Government default on its obligations. He had an opportunity after his nomination, when he came before the Budget Committee, to pivot to a more mainstream and responsible position, but he refused. In an answer to a prehearing question he said:       I do believe that defaulting on America's debts would have      great worldwide consequences. I do not believe that breaching      the debt ceiling will automatically or inevitably lead to      that result.  Well, if you breach the debt ceiling, and if you honor the debt ceiling law, that means that our government would not have the money to pay all of its bills. Something has to be defaulted on or the debt ceiling is a complete chimera.  Mr.Mulvaney's completely unsupported faith that a default on some of our Nation's obligations might not have grave consequences ignores basic economics, and it ignores the guidance[[Page S1215]]of liberal and conservative economists and experts alike, including Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Benjamin Bernanke, Hank Paulson, Janet Yellen, Jack Lew, and many, many others.  In fact, many of my Republican colleagues in this room were gravely concerned about what happened if we blew through the debt ceiling, and that we perhaps had made a bet we would be unable to pay. To put it simply, lenders tend to charge more for riskier loans, and a borrower that won't pay all of its bills on time is riskier than one that does.  Tom Donahue of the U.Chamber of Commerce is not someone that I ordinarily cite favorably here in the He is an inveterate enemy on doing anything on climate change. He and I disagree on a great number of issues, but even Tom Donahue noted that a small increase in treasury rates, which would happen as the result of a default, ``would translate into hundreds of thousands of jobs lost every year.''  A member of the self-styled ``shutdown caucus,'' Mr.Mulvaney chooses to ignore the fact that his fiscal brinkmanship has already cost the American people. Playing around with the debt ceiling and shutting down the government are not free exercises. According to the Wall Street firm Standard and Poor's, the 16-day government shutdown that the Congressman helped orchestrate in 2013 cost the American economy $24 billion. That is shooting straight at our economy just to prove a political point. That is not the kind of straight shooter that we need. Of course, that doesn't even mention the unnecessary stress that the shutdown caused for millions of government contractors who weren't sure they would be paid. There is pain and there is damage from the reckless decisions that Congressman Mulvaney seems to make so easily.  Congressman Mulvaney's blind faith is not limited to economics. He disregards science too. In response to questions I asked him at the hearing, he said he is not convinced by the evidence presented that climate change is at least partly driven by human activity. Well, he ought to take a little look at what is going on at his home State university, the University of South Carolina, which has the School of the Earth, Ocean, and It actually teaches climate change. The University of South Carolina doesn't just believe climate change; it teaches it. It has a faculty who are involved in teaching the students about what is happening in our atmosphere and in our oceans as a result of climate change.  This is not all that complicated stuff. We have known since President Lincoln was riding around Washington in his top hat that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would catch heat in the atmosphere and would warm the That was a scientist named This is not news; this is 150 years old. It is simple, elemental chemistry, what happens when you ramp up the level of CO2 in the atmosphere and how that works in the oceans. The CO2 gets absorbed by the oceans. The oceans, as a result of absorbing CO2, become more acidic. What we are seeing now is the acidification of the ocean in the experience of humankind--indeed, in probably like 100 times the experience of humankind. You have to go back 50 years to find a similar rate of acidification of the ocean.  Well, Mr.Mulvaney represents South South Carolina is a coastal It is an ocean The University of South Carolina studies its oceans. They know ocean acidification is happening. When the Congressman says that he is not convinced by the evidence presented, something other than being a straight shooter is going on.  According to NASA, for instance, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--which, by the way, right now is driving a rover around on the surface of the planet So can we perhaps stipulate that the scientists at NASA know what they are talking about? No other country in the world, no other society in human history has had the capacity to launch from Earth a rover, fly it through space to Mars, land it safely on that other planet, and drive it around. We can do that. NASA scientists did that. So when NASA scientists say that ``multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activity''--so essentially all the experts agree.  His home State university, the University of South Carolina, teaches this. They don't just listen to it, they teach it. They understand what is going on. But Mulvaney says he is not convinced. What is it going to take to convince him? How can you be a straight shooter when you ignore this kind of certainty in science, particularly when around this building you see the circling menace of the fossil fuel industry always with its guns out, always trying to shoot down anybody who will disagree with them, always trying to pretend that climate change isn't real, always trying to defend a $700 billion-a-year subsidy that they get at the expense of the rest of America? And because, thanks to Citizens United, they have the capacity to spend enormous, unlimited amounts of money in politics, they can spend a great deal to protect that $700 billion in subsidies, and they do.  So we do nothing about climate change here. You can't get a Republican to talk seriously about climate change here. The oceans are changing off of their States, and they won't talk about climate change here. Their universities are saying that climate change is real. Their universities are teaching that climate change is real. And they won't say one thing about climate change here. And this so-called straight shooter is going to go along with that racket rather than listen to his home State universities and to the scientists at NASA, who have put the rover on Mars? Give me a break.  While this man claims to be a deficit hawk, I asked him if he was ready to take on the hundreds of billions of dollars that go out the back door of our economy in tax breaks, in wasteful tax loopholes, in tax benefits for special interests, and he wouldn't give me a straight answer to the question.  From his record in the House, it appears pretty clear that Mr.Mulvaney would rather balance the budget by going after seniors, by going after Social Security, by going after Medicare, by going after the families who have children on Medicaid because their children have lifetime disabilities that require Medicaid support. Those are the targets. That is who this so-called straight shooter wants to shoot at. But as for, say, the tax benefit that lets billionaires depreciate their private jets faster than the airline can, oh, no, can't touch that. As for the tax loophole that lets carried interest Wall Street billionaires pay lower tax rates than their doormen, than their janitors, oh, no, can't possibly touch that. As for the subsidies we give through the Tax Code to the fossil fuel industry every year when they are the most lucrative corporations in the history of the planet, oh, no, we can't possibly do that. Let's go after the old folks. That is not being a straight shooter; that is shooting at the wrong people.  Someone who is a straight shooter when it happens to agree with the politics that they like but is a flatout denier when it doesn't, that is not my idea of a straight shooter.  Congressman Mulvaney is possessed by conservative ideology that I strongly believe is going to prevent him ever from working across party lines on the budget, on health care, or on other major issues that he will have to face at His counsel is likely to pull President Trump further out to the extremes, which already divide this country.  And by the way, to all of those voters who voted for President Trump because he said that he was different from all the other Republican candidates; that he was different from the other 15 candidates because he wasn't going to hurt Social Security and he wasn't going to hurt Medicare; that he was different from all the others because he was going to protect Social Security and he was going to protect Medicare--folks, I think you were sold a bill of goods because when you look at Congressman Price and when you look at Congressman Mulvaney and when you look at their records, you see the records of people who have targeted Social Security and targeted Medicare for years. They may be straight shooters, but they have Social Security and Medicare in the crosshairs. Those are not the right targets for us to be shooting[[Page S1216]]at in a tax system that is riddled with special interest loopholes and in a country that is so divided and where the poor and the elderly are struggling compared to the people who are at the very top, who have basically gathered all of the economic benefit of our growth since the great recession.  So, for all of those reasons, I will be completely unable to support this person's confirmation. I am sorry because I would like to have seen the President make the slightest gesture in the direction of bipartisanship, the slightest gesture in the direction of compromise, the slightest gesture in the direction of reasonableness, but out of this White House, on the civilian Cabinet, we have seen nothing like that.  It is a Cabinet that is completely controlled by rightwing ideology and appalling special interests. Usually, the special interests are the most dangerous and worst special interests that the agency has to regulate.

4926,topic-id,1633,"Mr.President, I think Senator Murray has said it very well, and I want to pick up on what I think is really at stake with this nomination. In effect, if confirmed, Congressman Mulvaney would be the numbers guy for the Trump team, the architect for the President's fiscal plan for the Nation's future.  I want to start by way of saying that, when you look at the President's promises that he made on the campaign trail to protect Medicare and Social Security from draconian cuts, Congressman Mulvaney's nomination and his record would be one of the biggest bait-and-switch schemes inflicted on America's seniors that I can imagine.  I am going to start by taking a minute to read some of what the President said on the campaign trail. He said:       Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social      They want to do it on Medicare . . . and we can't      do that. It's not fair to the people.  The President said: ``It's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is, not increase the age, but to leave it as-is.''  The President said:       You can't get rid of Medicare's a program that      works . . . people love Medicare and it's unfair to them. I'm      going to fix it and make it better, but I'm not going to cut      it.[[Page S1188]]  So those are just some of the promises that President Trump made with respect to Social Security and There are quotes like that from rallies and campaign events and debates over a period of some months. I think it would be fair to say that, for a lot of seniors, when they heard that--when they heard these promises that these vital programs would be protected--that was a political litmus test for many American older people. So I describe this contrast between the promises of President Trump and Candidate Trump and Congressman Mulvaney as a bait and switch, but I think the Senate needs to know a little bit more detail with respect to specifics.  In 2011 Congressman Mulvaney said: ``We have to end Medicare as we know it.'' He added in another interview: ``Medicare as it exists today is finished.'' He proposed raising the Social Security age to 70. He called the program a Ponzi scheme. While he was a State lawmaker, he even voted to declare Social Security unconstitutional.  My sense is it will be a while before seniors get over the whiplash from the 180-degree turn the administration has pulled on Medicare and Social Security cuts.  Now, with respect to the days ahead, for me, a lot of this debate starts in my days when I was codirector of the Oregon Gray The seniors that I worked with knew what those programs meant. It was their grandparents who faced old age without Social Those seniors with whom I worked during those Gray Panther days remember what happened before we had the safety net. Before there was Social Security and Medicare, you would have needy older people shunted off to poor farms and almshouses. Even if you had meager savings, you were on your own for income or you had to rely on family, and lots of family members were not exactly well off. If you came down with a serious illness, it really meant that you would be living in poverty and squalor. Social Security and Medicare changed those unacceptable terms of the social contract between this country and older people--and changed it for all time. Those programs were about saying that in America--for the older people who fought our wars, strengthened our communities day in and day out, made America a better place because they were always pitching in to help and be constructive--Medicare and Social Security meant that older people and seniors would not face a life of destitution.  That is why I believe every Member of this body--and I heard Senator Murray talk about this--ought to find what Congressman Mulvaney has said against Medicare--his anti-Medicare and anti-Social Security agenda--so troubling. I want to be very specific about the days ahead. Medicare, at its core, has always been a promise. It has been a promise of guaranteed benefits. It is not a voucher. It is not a slip of paper. It is a promise of guaranteed benefits. We made the judgment--I just went briefly through some of the history--because no one would ever know how healthy they would be when they reached age 65. We talked about it in the Budget Committee and in a number of meetings here in the I am definitely for updating the Medicare promise, updating the Medicare guarantee, and improving it, for example, to include chronic care services, cancer services, diabetes, services dealing with a whole host of chronic illnesses. That is going to consume much of the Medicare budget. We can have more home care and we can use telemedicine, and we can use nonphysician providers.  Senator Murray knows that in our part of the country we really have found a way to get people good quality care in an affordable way, but we are keeping the promise. We are keeping the promise of the Medicare guarantee.  Congressman Mulvaney would break the promise of If confirmed, he would join his former House colleague who just became Health and Human Services Secretary, Tom Price, who said in really very blunt terms over the years that he wanted to privatize the program. He wanted to privatize and cut the program. He basically indicated with his legislation that he didn't really believe in Medicare, and he didn't believe in the guarantee of services that Medicare provided. If you look at Congressman Mulvaney's record, it certainly indicates he shares the views of our former House colleague who just became Health and Human Services Secretary, Tom  With respect to Social Security, this year nearly 62 million Americans and their families count on receiving retirement, survivors, and disability benefits to stay afloat. This is a program that keeps tens of millions of seniors out of poverty. It is unquestionably one of the most popular programs in American history. It has changed the fabric of the country for the better.  Again, I think about the days when I worked with older people. We had millions of older people who month in and month out would just walk an economic tightrope. They would try to balance their food costs against their fuel costs and their fuel costs against their medical costs. Social Security and Medicare came along to make sure those older people wouldn't be pushed off that economic tightrope. So Social Security has changed the fabric of the country for the better without doubt, and yet Congressman Mulvaney proposes to raise the Social Security age to 70, which would be a 20 percent cut to benefits.  Let's picture what this means, particularly for the millions of older people who might not have had a job where they could work on their laptop, and they had a physical job. They worked hours and hours on their feet day in and day out. Ask the single mom who spent decades working multiple jobs that way to put food on the table and send her kids to school what it is going to mean to cut their benefits that way--or the loggers or the dock workers, the miners, and all of those people who have worked hard and have been on their feet with physically grueling work. Ask them about raising the Social Security age this way. I think you are going to get a pretty good sense of how strongly Americans oppose this kind of Mulvaney approach.  So by way of summing up, I think it would be hard to find a more significant task for the Congress at this time than protecting Social Security and Medicare, advocating for the two as great achievements in the history of American policymaking. They are right at the center of our safety net.  Now you have to give Congressman Mulvaney credit for one thing. He has been blunt, he has been explicit, and he is not shy about essentially his vision of hollowing these programs out and dismantling them. When asked about whether he was going to stick to his proposal to cut the programs, he said:       I have to imagine that the President knew what he was      getting when he asked me to fill this role. I would like to      think it is why he hired me.  That is why I say--and Senator Murray touched on this--what kind of a bait-and-switch game are we talking about here? You have the President--Candidate Trump--saying: Nothing doing; nobody is going to mess with Social Security and Medicare--off limits. I want older people in America to know they are going to be safe if they elect me.  It was almost like a litmus test for America's older people. Then Congressman Mulvaney comes along and he basically calls the bluff on the whole thing. He describes the bait and switch in very blunt terms, where he says: ``I have to imagine the President knew what he was getting when he asked me to fill this role''--that the President knew what the Mulvaney record was all about, which was about ending Medicare as we know it.  So I will just close by way of saying that I see that a big part of my job, and what Oregonians sent me here to do, is to defend Medicare and Social Security for generations of Americans to come. That is why I am a no on the Mulvaney nomination. I urge my colleagues to oppose the nomination.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1175-2.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,15.0,February
4992,topic-id,5749,"Mr.President, as the Senate begins to consider the Price nomination, I wanted to see if I could put a little perspective on the upcoming debate.  Focusing on bipartisanship has always been important to me. I know many of my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee, on the Democratic side, share that view, and in 2009, the nominations of Democrats Tom Daschle, Tim Geithner, and Ron Kirk were all handled in a bipartisan way.  Issues came up in the vetting process in each of these cases, and both sides of the committee took the investigation seriously. Unfortunately, that has not been the case in 2017.  While Congressman Price served on the powerful Ways and Means Committee, he traded in health care stocks, pushed policies that helped his portfolio, and got special access to a promising stock deal.  I asked the congressman directly in his Finance Committee hearing whether he got a special deal. He said that he did not.  I don't think you could be much clearer than the following passage from a recent report by a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter at the Wall Street He wrote: ``Tom Price got a privileged offer to buy a biomedical stock at a discount, the company's officials said, contrary to his congressional testimony this month.''  I want to repeat that because I think it goes right to the heart of why Finance Committee Democrats feel that the effort to do the vetting necessary with respect to Congressman Price is not completed.  A Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter at the Wall Street Journal--I will just read it again--wrote: ``Tom Price got a privileged offer to buy a biomedical stock at a discount, the company's officials said, contrary to his congressional testimony this month.''  So, as I indicated, my Democratic colleagues and I on the committee said it was important to take more time to look into this issue. But the majority, when we said we needed to take more time to look at it, decided to look the other way. That is the first reason for concern on my side.  The second is how Congressman Price would manage Health and Human Services, a Department that is really all about people: services for seniors, services for the poor, for the disabled, for children, and for families. These are the powerful threads of our safety net. If the safety net is not there for those who have nowhere else to turn, those poor will suffer greatly.  Now, the debate on Congressman Price's nomination, in my view, is a referendum on the future of health care in In short, it is a debate about whether it makes sense for our country to go back to the dark days when health care worked only for the healthy and the wealthy.  Based on the public record, Medicare is a program Congressman Price doesn't believe in, and it guarantees services he doesn't believe seniors should have.[[Page S970]]  On the Affordable Care Act, he is the architect of repeal and run. He wrote the bill himself. He proposed weakening protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. He would slash Medicaid, shredding the health care safety net for the least fortunate in our country. He would take away health care choices for women across the country.  Look for the common thread, Mr.President and colleagues, among the Price proposals. They take away coverage for our people and make health care more expensive for individuals or both. That is where Congressman Price stands when it comes to American health care.  Every Senator who casts a vote for Congressman Price has to stand by that agenda. Beyond what this means for the future of American health care, there is the lingering specter of serious legal and ethical issues.  Tonight and in the hours ahead, this debate is going to tackle each of those issues and more. As it gets underway, I am going to begin with  In my view, Medicare has been a historic achievement in the way policy is made in our country. In any debate like this one, I recall my days when I was the codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers, when I worked with seniors who couldn't imagine life without But I will tell you, they told me stories about what it was like for their grandparents when there wasn't There were poor farms--literally, poor farms--where older people who had served our country in the Armed Forces very often spent their last days in what amounted to squalor at these poor farms. Then Medicare came along. For millions of older people, it was a godsend.  So I want to start my discussion with respect to Medicare with a comment that Congressman Price made about Medicare in 2009. It is a quote that speaks volumes about the Price perspective on the Medicare program that is so treasured by millions of older people.  Congressman Price wrote in 2009: ``Nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government's intrusion into medicine through Medicare.''  I would just say to my friend, the Presiding Officer of the Senate knows how seniors in Oregon see this. Seniors in Oregon consider Medicare to be a Godsend, not an intrusion into medicine, as you see from the Price perspective.  Here is the bottom line, colleagues, as we begin here today: Medicare is a promise. Medicare is built on a promise of guaranteed benefits--guaranteed benefits that will be there for you. It is not a voucher. It is not a slip of paper. It is guaranteed benefits that you can count on, and it is a promise that Congressman Price has indicated--and it is a matter of public record--it is a promise that Congressman Price is more than willing to break.  It is a promise that when you turn 65, you will be guaranteed health care benefits regardless of your economic station in life or the status of your health. And the reason Medicare was built with this special guarantee is straightforward: No American knows how healthy they will be when they reach age 65. Perhaps you are a marathoner at age 50 and you develop arthritis or Alzheimer's or cancer a decade and a half later. Furthermore, no one knows what the economy is going to look like years ahead or decades ahead into the future. For the less fortunate, high inflation or a stock market crash could all but wipe out what they set aside over a lifetime of work. Seniors could find their benefits exposed to new danger every time there is a financial downturn.  During the recent campaign, the American people heard a standard Trump pledge: No cuts to But when you look at the Price record and the promise of President Trump, there is a big gap between the two. When you look at Congressman Price's plan, it is clear that the Trump pledge was on the ropes the minute he was nominated. In fact, Congressman Price said that he wants to voucherize Medicare within the first 6 to 8 months of the administration. Let me repeat that again.  Mr.President, some of these statements that the Congressman has made are so far-fetched that once in a while I am going to have to repeat them so that people really get a sense of why we are so concerned.  Congressman Price said he wants to voucherize Medicare within the first 6 to 8 months of the administration. So what that would mean is that right out of the chute, the Medicare promise, the promise of guaranteed benefits--Congressman Price wants to break the promise. In his budget, the Congressman called for privatizing Medicare and cutting it by nearly $500 billion.  He also championed legislation to allow a practice called balanced billing in That means seniors could be forced to cover extra charges above what the program pays for the services they receive in the doctor's office. Older Americans on fixed incomes would be forced to pay more for their care.  Colleagues, I believe the Congress has no greater duty than to uphold the promise of In my view, there is no need to mince words: Privatizing Medicare as Congressman Price has thought to do means an end--an end to the program-guaranteed health benefit. It would break the Medicare promise, the promise of guaranteed benefits and services, and end Medicare as our country knows it.  Now let me turn to the Affordable Care When it comes to the Affordable Care Act, for years now, there has been a steady drumbeat coming from my colleagues on the other side: Repeal and replace. Repeal and replace. I think it has gotten to the point where children sing it almost as a jingle. Repeal and replace. It has been said so many times. A government shutdown all built around that slogan--repeal and replace.  At one point, the President-elect said repeal and replace would happen, in his words, ``simultaneously.'' Shortly before inauguration, he said they would come within the same hour, and he said Congressman Price was writing the replacement plan and it was nearly ready to be unveiled.  But the public heard a different story during Congressman Price's Finance Committee hearing. At that hearing, our colleague Senator Brown of Ohio asked: The President said he is working with you on a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act, which is nearly finished, and it will be revealed after your confirmation; is that true?  That was the question posed by Senator Brown to Congressman  The Congressman said: It is true that he said that, yeah--that he said that, yeah. A moment later he added, ``I have had conversations with the President about health care, yes.''  So if anybody is waiting for the curtain to rise on the Price replacement plan, it sounds like you are going to have to wait a while longer. In fact, the President said this weekend, just this weekend, Americans might have to wait until next year to see the replacement, but the uncertainty about what comes next sure hasn't slowed down the charge of many toward repeal. In fact, the President issued a day one Executive order instructing the executive branch to roll back the Affordable Care Act in any way possible.  So I thought given these developments, the fact that Congressman Price is the architect of a repeal-and-run bill; that the President immediately on day one tried to set in motion a strategy to gut some of the key protections in the Affordable Care Act, I thought I ought to follow this up with Congressman Price during his nomination hearing in the Finance So I asked Congressman Price during his finance nomination hearing whether the Congressman would state that nobody would be worse off under the President's Executive order--not real complicated.  There had been all this talk through the campaign about how now President Trump could do a better job, less money. That was the constant refrain. I decided, given these ominous developments that I just described since the beginning of this year, I thought I would just ask Congressman Price whether anybody would be worse off under the Executive order. He ducked the question.  I remember asking him about whether people would be worse off with respect to coverage, and I remembered he said something about how people would have access to health care. Well, I will tell you, hearing the word ``access'' rather than ``coverage'' means that[[Page S971]]somebody is walking back a commitment to people really getting care. Everybody pretty much can have access. Sure, if I had the money, I could get it. It is about coverage. So we asked Congressman Price whether people would be worse off and he ducked the question.  So then I asked if he would commit that no one would lose coverage, and he ducked once more.  Then I asked if he would commit to holding off on implementing the Executive order until a replacement plan was enacted. He ducked.  So the Congressman was given an opportunity to, in effect, say that he would honor what the American people were told by President Trump in the campaign; that the two would be hand in hand, the replacement and repeal would go hand in hand, but he had the chance to say that at the nomination hearing and he ducked and ducked and he ducked some more.  Americans are still being told that the Affordable Care Act is the problem and it has to be repealed. It looks to me that what Republicans have on offer now isn't repeal and replace at all. It is what I have been calling it since last year, repeal and run, and the architect of repeal and run is Congressman In fact, he wrote the bill. He wrote the bill that would have gutted the ACA the last time around.  Under the Price plan, 18 million Americans would lose their health insurance in less than 2 years. By 2026, it would be 32 million who would lose coverage. Today 26 million Americans are uninsured. In a decade it would be 59 million. Working Americans would make up four out of every five people who lose their coverage. These are folks struggling to climb the economic ladder. No-cost contraceptive coverage for millions of women would be gone. We would have hundreds of thousands of women losing access to care almost immediately just by the defunding of Planned Hundreds of thousands more would lose their choice to see the doctors they trust. Just think about that. Legislation that is going to take away from American women the chance to see the doctor of their choosing, the doctor they trust. I don't know anybody in the last election who thought they were voting to see women lose the choice of the doctor they trust.  Under the Price plan, premiums jumped by hundreds of dollars a year as the individual market for health insurance collapses. Health care costs skyrocket. It is a gut punt to all, even those who get their health insurance at work because what it would do is, in effect, it would shrink--it would shrink the health care market in a way that there would be many more people who are seriously ill and had great expenses, and when you try to pass those on, that would mean people in the marketplace and those who had health insurance from their employer would see increases.  Another issue in the Price plan that ought to set off any alarm bells, in my view, is what Congressman Price has proposed for those with preexisting health care conditions. This is especially important in my view. When I proposed my own health plan, eight Democrats, eight Republicans, I was especially pleased that Senators on both sides of the aisle understood that making sure that insurance companies could not knock the stuffing out of people with a preexisting condition any longer was central to reform. Because when you allow discrimination against those with a preexisting condition, what you are essentially saying is health care in America is going to be for the healthy and wealthy. If you are healthy, no problem with a preexisting condition. If you are wealthy, again, no problem.  So right at the heart of the Affordable Care Act is a guarantee that insurance companies cannot discriminate against Americans with preexisting conditions. Frankly, I was very pleased to see that because as I indicated, 16 Senators--8 Democrats and 8 Republicans--on our bill said that was right at the heart of what they wanted in health care reform. So the ACA--the Affordable Care Act--said, No denying coverage to pregnant women, no denying coverage to cancer patients, no denying coverage to kids with autism. Under the Affordable Care Act, that is the law of the land. It protects every single No American under the Affordable Care Act should have to feel, when they go to bed at night, that they are going to get hammered as in the old days because they have a preexisting condition.  Now, Congressman Price, once again turning to the public record--it is all in the public record here. Congressman Price doesn't believe the American people should have the protection of that kind of real ban against discrimination for a preexisting condition. In fact, he was quoted in 2012 saying that it was, in his words, ``a terrible idea.'' So he, like the law, changed, and his way to change a law that guarantees universal protection is to get rid of the guarantee that you aren't going to get discriminated against if you have a preexisting condition.  Our colleague, Senator Nelson of Florida, asked Congressman Price about the issue of making sure those with preexisting conditions don't get discriminated against when the Finance Committee held their nomination hearing. Once again, Congressman Price ducked, bobbed, and weaved. Senator Nelson asked if the Congressman thought that the proposal to continue the ban on discriminating against people with a preexisting condition is a terrible idea. Here is what Congressman Price said: ``What I have always said about preexisting conditions is that nobody, in a system that pays attention to patients, nobody ought to be priced out of the market for having a bad diagnosis. Nobody.''  Now, that probably is a pretty good sound bite. It is a good sound bite if you are trying to duck a question, but it is not a real answer to what Congressman Price was asked by Senator And if you examine Congressman Price's own proposal, when it comes to actually protecting people with a preexisting condition from discrimination, you can see why Congressman Price isn't very interested in giving a straight answer.  I am going to turn now to one of the Congressman's bills. It is ironically called ``Empowering Patients First.'' Instead of a ban on discrimination against those with preexisting conditions, the Price bill opened up loopholes to benefit insurance companies. The Price plan hinged on something called continuous coverage, and Americans are going to probably hear a fair amount about that in the months ahead.  The Price plan said that insurance companies had the right to inspect your recent past when you applied for coverage to the private market. If they found gaps when you went without insurance, they could deny coverage for your preexisting condition for up to a year and a half, or they could hike your premiums by 50 percent. In short, under the Price plan, insurance companies could take your money and skip out on covering the health care that you actually need.  Short summary of the Price health provision there: Worse health care, higher costs.  Now let's think about what this would mean for a cancer patient who suffers a job loss: Up to 18 months without coverage for cancer treatment they need that could be the difference between life and death. Congressman Price's bill didn't allow any special exceptions for certain gaps in coverage. No matter why you lost your insurance--maybe a layoff, maybe your spouse passed, quitting your job to start a business or go back to school--insurance companies with the Price plan again would be allowed to discriminate. And Congressman Price's bill didn't create any safeguards for particular patients with life-threatening illnesses. No matter what kind of preexisting condition you have, you would be at risk of losing access to care. And going by the practices those companies followed before the Affordable Care Act, more than 130 million Americans under age 65 may have a preexisting condition.  Now, it is correct that Republicans may not decide to go ahead with Congressman Price's bill as the final measure on replacement. But make no mistake about it: If confirmed, Congressman Price will be the captain of the Trump administration's health team. His proposals matter. And his approach is one that is followed by just about every other Republican who has put forward a plan of their own.  Colleagues, I think it would be an enormous mistake for this Senate--for[[Page S972]]our country--to turn back the clock and go back to the days when health care was for the healthy and wealthy. I don't think there ought to be a debate about the need for real, truly strong protection for our people against discrimination for those with a preexisting condition.  The Affordable Care Act locked it in to black letter law. It set a new standard: Nobody in America is going to be denied insurance due to a preexisting condition. In my view, it would be unconscionable to look to yesteryear, turn back the clock, and undermine those strong protections for the millions and millions of Americans who suffer from those preexisting health conditions. That, as a matter of public record, is what Congressman Price's proposal would do.  I want to turn now to his ideas with respect to This, in my view, is an especially important program, and a part of it that is usually missed is the nursing home benefit for seniors. Back when I was the director of the Oregon Gray Panthers and I ran the legal aid office for the elderly, I saw in particular what Medicaid meant for seniors who needed nursing home care.  Medicaid now covers costs for two-thirds of the seniors in nursing homes. And I think we ought to think about who these people are because these are people in Colorado, in Oregon, and across the country, who worked hard. They always played by the rules. They put their kids through school. They were part of their communities. They saved, they scrimped, they didn't go on an extra vacation; maybe they were thinking about buying a boat, but they didn't do any of that. They didn't do any of that because they wanted to save and make sure their spouse could have a dignified retirement, that they could put their kids through school, and they did everything right. So they saved and they saved and they saved.  But the fact is, it costs a lot to be a senior in America today. So perhaps they spent down all those savings, and their kids--the kids they love so much--aren't doing that well economically, so it is hard for the kids to help out with long-term care.  Without Medicaid--and particularly the nursing home benefit--seniors, 65 percent of whom depend on the program for nursing homes, wouldn't be able to have a dignified retirement.  So that nursing home benefit that is paid for by Medicaid is also one that Congressman Price has proposed slashing. He does that by cutting $2 trillion out of Medicaid over the course of two stages. First, Congressman Price repeals the expansion of Medicaid created under the Affordable Care This means that more than 11 million Americans lose their coverage. And it is a plan that even Republican Governors are speaking out against. John Kasich of Ohio--I think he would probably tell you he is not anybody's idea of a bleeding heart liberal--said recently: ``So if all of a sudden that goes away, what do we tell those 700,000 people? We are closed? Can't do that.''  But that is exactly what Congressman Price's plan is going to end up doing. It is going to end up telling those 700,000 Ohioans, along with millions of people across the country in Oregon, and across the land--and that is because he is pushing to take away their coverage and hasn't offered any real alternative that would preserve their access to care.  So for all of those seniors--the ones who worked hard and saved and did everything right--we all know them; perhaps they are the widower down at the end of the block--there is not going to be a way to pay for their health care, and they are not going to be able to have a dignified retirement, in spite of the fact they did everything all their life to plan and save.  Congressman Price's second Medicaid cut turns the program into a block grant and introduces a cap approach. That slashes another 30 percent of its funding and sets it up to be squeezed even more down the road.  Now, Medicaid goes a lot further in terms of taking on some of the biggest health care challenges in I cited the nursing home benefit because that is one that I dealt with again and again when I was director of the Gray But the fact is that the program is helping communities across the country take on a whole host of health care challenges. The opioid epidemic is one example.  Now, we know that opioid addiction has hit American communities like a wrecking ball. More than a million people struggle with substance abuse, and they would lose access to care if the Price plan to repeal Medicaid expansion goes through. And further cuts to Medicaid would make the problem even worse, and it wouldn't just be for adults.  Tens of thousands of babies are born with a dependency to drugs each year. It is largely a product of the opioid crisis. My view is that number can only rise under Congressman Price's plan to cut Medicaid, a key source of primary care, prenatal care, and substance abuse treatment for pregnant women.  Medicaid is also the biggest source of funding for community and home-based care for those vulnerable Americans with serious disabilities. It is a huge source of AIDS treatment in America, particularly with the Affordable Care Act expansion.  All in all, 74 million Americans rely on Medicaid, and they are certainly not among the most fortunate. Half of them are kids, including millions with special needs. The program covers nearly half of all births and millions of Americans with disabilities.  I want to come back again to the faces of these people because I am not sure, when people hear the word ``Medicaid,'' what they see. I mention that it is so many seniors who, after planning, saving, and scrimping, need the program for nursing home care. It covers people who toil through hard work, even multiple jobs, bringing home just enough to keep them out of poverty. For many, signing up for the Medicaid Program brought an end to the years when they had to choose between visiting the doctor and putting food on the table. Medicaid is their health care safety net. Make no mistake about it; Congressman Price's proposals leave that safety net in tatters. There isn't any other backstop for those vulnerable From small, tiny children to seniors who depend on it for nursing home care, there is no other backstop if their access to health care through Medicaid goes away.  One of the arguments made by advocates of block grants and caps is that States would have flexibility, and they point to a section of the Affordable Care Act I wrote to support their case. I believe they are talking about what is called section 1332. There is a big difference between what I wrote in the Affordable Care Act and what block grants would do. We had a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle who were interested in this issue. What I wrote is this: With that flexibility, the Affordable Care Act lets States do better by their people. The Price plan to block grant and cap Medicaid costs lets States do worse.  Slashing Medicaid also hits State budgets extraordinarily hard. That is a big reason why Governors across the country have been skeptical--even Republican Governors, like John Kasich and Rick Snyder of Today, Medicaid comes with an open-ended kind of feature. Federal funding for the program doesn't tick down to zero. Nobody gets cut off. If you are working in America and are eligible for Medicaid, you don't have to worry about being locked out of the doctor's office if the program goes into the red. Block granting and capping the program changes that. States get a chunk of money each year. There is a big risk that money runs out, especially during times of economic downturn. That is when Medicaid is needed most, at times when working Americans have the most trouble walking the economic tightrope.  This is in addition to the undeniable, routine demands on the program: an aging baby-boomer population that will be in increasing need of nursing home and home-based care, public health emergencies like the Zika virus that can come without warning, natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina or the Flint water crisis that devastate communities, new high-priced drugs that can be cures but come with a steep price.  The reality is if a State's block grant runs out, that raises questions that ought to be alarming to all who care about vulnerable Americans having access to the care they need.  What happens if seniors lose their nursing home benefits in the middle of the year? Where would they go? Would patients in substance abuse treatment[[Page S973]]lose access to care? If a State's Medicaid funding dries up midway through the fiscal year, who would pay for a birth? Would the parents of a newborn child have to bear the entire cost when they are on a modest income, working hard, and a hospital bill could reach tens of thousands of dollars?  When it comes time to pitch this very extreme health care agenda to the American people, Congressman Price is very articulate and sticks closely to well-rehearsed language. That is because the Price agenda would strip tens of millions of Americans of their insurance coverage and force people to pay much higher costs for much lesser care. It isn't going to go over very well when people really understand what is at stake.  One of the priorities Congressman Price talks about most frequently is access--always saying that his vision is Americans are going to have access to care. That is one very hollow theory. Access to health care doesn't mean a lot if you can't afford the cost. So when Americans hear the Price plan that people will have access, rather than coverage, pay attention. Pay attention, because if you have coverage today, and he is going to promise you access in the future, chances are you are going into the hole and you had better figure out how you are going to pay for it.  The Congressman talks about flexibility for patients. But under Congressman Price's plans that wipe out consumer protections and minimum standards for coverage, it is insurance companies that get the most flexibility.  The Congressman likes to talk about using metrics to measure health care. It is very hard to follow what this metrics approach is all about. When his proposals are challenged using facts and figures, including those that come from our nonpartisan scorekeepers at the Congressional Budget Office, he disagrees or he dodges. During his hearing, he just disagreed with the Congressional Budget Office when I asked him about some of his funding cuts that would deprive women of access to preventive care. He objects to even the simplest of measures--how much funding his proposals cut from our health care programs--as calculated by the nonpartisan experts. In my view, you can't run from the metrics when they don't tell you what you want to hear.  Finally, the Congressman and many others say patients should be at the center of care. Now, I want it understood, I don't see how anybody could dispute that idea. Of course patients should be at the center of care. But when I look at the Price proposals, I don't see the patient at the center of health care. I see money and I see special interests at the center of health care.  The Price plan tells vulnerable Americans that their health care will only go as far as their bank accounts are going to take them. The well-to-do may be able to manage just fine under the Price proposals and the costs they push onto patients, but I am absolutely certain that millions of working Americans won't be able to do it.  I am going to wrap up talking about several glaring ethical issues with respect to Congressman I will begin with the Congressman's significant investments in an Australian biomedical company. A lot of information about those investments has come into view over the course of months of investigation and reporting. What the facts show is that in 2016, the Congressman was part of an exclusive deal to buy stock at a discounted price--a deal called a ``private placement.'' On multiple occasions he was given opportunities to come clean and explain his participation in the special stock sale. He never has. Now, the majority on the Finance Committee has cut off the vetting process before getting all the facts or having the Congressman correct the record. So I am going to take a moment tonight to lay out the facts.  It is well known that Congressman Price learned about the company from a House colleague, Congressman Chris But Chris Collins isn't exactly a casual observer of the Australian business pages. He is Innate's--the company's--largest shareholder and a member of its board. Many of the company's other major shareholders are people in Congressman Collins' orbit, family members and chief of staff and others that he is close to. After learning about the company from his colleague, Congressman Price made his first purchase of the company's stock in 2015. He bought 61,000 shares.  Now let's fast forward to August 2016. The Congressman bought another 400,000 shares of Innate as part of a private stock sale for U.investors. When the private sale took place, Innate's shares were trading on the Australian stock exchange for the equivalent of 31 American cents, but participants in this private sale got the shares at a steep discount. That discount meant that Congressman Price paid tens of thousands of dollars less than a typical investor would have paid on the open market.  With respect to that purchase, the record remains unclear. It does come down to two issues: how he came to participate in the private placement, and whether he got special access that other investors didn't have. On those issues, Congressman Price tells one story; company officials, Congressman Collins, and public documents tell another.  First I am going to examine how Congressman Price came to participate in this private deal. As he tells it, he decided to make that purchase based on his own research into the company. But the Wall Street Journal and a little common sense say otherwise. I will read from a January 30 report.       Mr.Price got in on the discounted sale after Mr.Collins      filled him in on the company's drug trial, according to ",CREC-2017-02-06-pt3-PgS969-5.txt,1247,NOMINATION OF TOM PRICE,2017.0,6.0,February
