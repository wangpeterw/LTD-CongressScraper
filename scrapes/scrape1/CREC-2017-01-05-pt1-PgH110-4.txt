                     SAVING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. McCOLLUM asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the Affordable 
Care Act, a law that has made a real difference in the lives of 
Minnesotans and Americans.
  After 7 years of attacking the ACA, Republicans still have not come 
up with a plan to replace this law. Instead, they plan to work with 
President-elect Donald Trump to repeal the law and destroy the progress 
we have made.
  Repealing the ACA would leave tens of millions of Americans 
uninsured. Repealing the ACA would let insurance companies deny 
coverage to more than 2 million Minnesotans with preexisting 
conditions. Repealing the ACA would eliminate free, high-quality 
preventive health care for hundreds of thousands of families in my 
district. Make no mistake, Republicans' ACA repeal plans would turn 
back the clock, leaving millions of Americans just one illness away 
from bankruptcy.
  For the sake of Minnesotans and all Americans who have benefited from 
this law, join me in fighting to save the Affordable Care Act.
