24750,2084,Marco,RUBIO,SENATOR,R,FL,,R000595,115,24750,topic-id,1635,"Mr.President, I know that we are in the middle of an important debate about a topic of education in our schools. One of the topics I hope young Americans will learn more about is the state of affairs across the world when it comes to human rights.  We are a vibrant society engaged in a heated debate, as we often have been throughout our history, about items of political matters. If you look here today, there are people standing up to speak on different sides of an issue. You see that the Republican Party today controls the White House, the Senate, and the House, and yet you have people with the freedom in this country to be able to stand up and oppose that. We have seen that across the country with demonstrations and speeches and all sorts of other protected speech. We are very fortunate[[Page S718]]and blessed to live in a nation with those freedoms. That is not the case all over the world.  I wanted to take this opportunity in the midst of all of this debate and discussion about an important topic, the nomination before the Senate, to remind people that despite our differences on these issues, we are truly blessed to be able to live in a country where opposing the party in power does not mean you go to jail.  As I have been doing for some time now, I wanted to come this evening and highlight yet another example of human rights abuses that is taking place in a very important part of the world. For the past couple of years, my office and I have been highlighting human rights cases through our social media campaign. We call it hashtag ``Expression NOT Oppression.''  The goals of this are to raise awareness about these cases and the individuals who are suffering at the hands of these repressive governments. We know that through history some of the oppressed people--we may not think these floor speeches matter; we may not think that mentioning it here in this forum matters, but it does to them because one of the first things oppressors tell them is that the world has forgotten about them, and they don't matter anymore. That is one of the first reasons we come: to raise awareness and let them know we know their names, we know their story, and we will continue to speak out on their behalf.  The second reason is to show their families and their loved ones that elected officials--like me here in the United States--have not forgotten them because we know that tyrants, as I said, like to tell political prisoners that they are alone in their struggle.  The third reason is to call for action, whether it is for the administration to make their causes a priority, too, or to call on these governments to release these individuals.  There is one more reason I think that this effort, hashtag ``Expression NOT Oppression,'' is important. As well as all the good work being done here on both sides of the aisle in defense of human rights, promotion of democracy and the defense of God-given freedoms like religious freedom and freedom of the press and free speech, which we celebrate here even in this debate, have to continue to be pillars of our foreign policy. I hope that these cases we highlight bring those guiding principles to light.  Today, I want to discuss the cases of two Chinese political prisoners whose courageous wives I had the opportunity to meet last week when they visited in Washington, These women personally requested that I intervene on behalf of their husbands, pressing on the Chinese Government to unconditionally release them and, in the case of one, to account for his whereabouts. Perhaps just as importantly, they urged me that I press our own State Department to prioritize these cases diplomatically in the hope that these families can be reunited in the not-too-distant future.  I come here today to urge our now new Secretary of State, Mr.Tillerson, to prioritize the release of these men in his diplomatic engagement with In the coming weeks, I also expect that we will have a chance to hear from the President's nominee to be U.Ambassador to China, Governor Branstad of When he comes before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing, I will bring up these cases and others and urge him to make their freedom a priority of his work if confirmed.  Jiang Tianyong is a 45-year-old lawyer. He was disbarred by the Chinese Government because of his vigorous human rights advocacy, including his representation of blind legal advocate Chen Guangcheng, fellow rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, Falun Gong practitioners, and other human rights cases. Despite the risks of this work, he has been steadfast in his support of the families and of their right to lawyers and legal advocates caught up in China's sweeping nationwide crackdown on the legal community in July of 2015, which ensnared roughly 250 lawyers and advocates.  Consistent with a spate of recent media stories, Jiang's wife indicated that his family and friends lost contact with him in late November of last year. That is when a Chinese state-controlled newspaper reported he had been detained for a series of trumped-up charges.  His wife has received no formal confirmation of his precise whereabouts, and, to date, he has been denied access to a lawyer of his choosing. Even more troubling is that this is entirely legal under China's laws, even though it violates all international norms of justice. Under China's own laws, authorities may hold him, or anyone, for up to 6 months without informing his family where he is held and without allowing him to access a lawyer, conditions that the United Nations Committee Against Torture has found place ``detainees at a high-risk of torture.'' Indeed, reports over the past months about four other human rights lawyers provide detailed information about the Chinese authorities' use of torture to extract ``confessions'' and impose unbearable psychological pressure.  All of these realities underscore that China remains a country of rule by law. Congressmen Chris Smith of New Jersey and I cochair the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which found in our 2016 annual report that ``the Chinese Communist Party has continued to reject the notion that the rule of law should supercede the Party's role in guiding the functions of the State.'' As such, lawyers, advocates, dissidents and others often find themselves in the party's crosshairs, persecuted under the law, rather than protected by it, and they have no recourse of justice.  A second Chinese individual I want to highlight today is lawyer Tang Jingling, who has also been disbarred for his rights advocacy. He first gained prominence as a lawyer working on cases related to village compensation, corruption, and by representing activists. In January of last year, he was convicted of ``inciting subversion of state power.'' That is the charge, and he was sentenced to 5 years in prison. He was first detained in May 2014 on suspicion of ``picking quarrels and provoking troubles.'' Just imagine that. Picking quarrels and provoking troubles is a crime in This happened, by the way, during the lead up to the 21st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, when the Chinese Government worked desperately to wipe out any discussion or memory of this historically brutal crackdown. In reality, all Tang and other activists did was participate in a nonviolent disobedience movement seeking legal and social reform in  Following his conviction, Tang eloquently wrote:       Inside the grand edifice of the court, we can see stately      and ornate furnishings and decorations, and we can see the      government employees in dignified attire. But we cannot see      the law and we can definitely not see justice.  He continues, movingly, speaking of the faith that has sustained him in the midst of injustice:       The Holy Bible has a passage that reads: ``Blessed are      those that are persecuted for righteousness' sake.'' Today,      we have been pronounced guilty, thrown in prison, separated      from our families, and have endured humiliation and      difficulties--and I am far from being able to convince and      prove to others how these tribulations could have become my      blessings. But God's will is inevitably difficult to      understand. I often pray and ask him to give me more      strength, so that I may persevere until the moment of      revelation. I dare say, in 2011, while in a secret jail, and      now in detention, almost every day I have passed has been      calm and fulfilling. I have never lost my direction.  The courage and conviction of these men should be an inspiration to us all--an inspiration that should propel us to act. I would add a reminder again of how blessed and fortunate we are to live by the grace of God in a nation where we have the freedom to speak, to object, to state our views without fear of the circumstances and the consequences that these brave men now face. The Chinese people who yearn for the protection of their most basic human rights and bravely stand with their fellow marginalized countrymen are China's greatest asset--not its biggest threat, as the government of the Communist Party wrongly believes. Any government which views its own people with such fear and hostility will, as has often been said, find itself on the wrong side of history.  So I hope more of my colleagues in this body, in the House, and especially in the administration will join their voices in support of these political prisoners and all who languish in jails, prisons, and gulags simply because[[Page S719]]they want a better life, because they want a say in their future and have bravely made these aspirations clear.  With that, I yield the floor.

24754,2084,Marco,RUBIO,SENATOR,R,FL,,R000595,115,24754,topic-id,401,"Mr.President, while not perfect, this bill includes important provisions that will benefit Florida, strengthen our national security, increase resources for our national defense and the fight against ISIS, and give our military men and women the largest pay raise in 6 years.  Given the threats our Nation faces from the likes of North Korea and radical Islamic terrorists, a government shutdown would send exactly the wrong message to the world at a time when it is counting on America to lead.  I am pleased to see this bill funds the Department of Defense to levels authorized by Congress and includes increases for ship building, operations and maintenance, and military readiness. It also incorporates the fiscal year 2017 Intelligence Authorization Act, IAA, that provides essential guidance and authorities for our intelligence community. This year's IAA requires the President to establish an interagency committee to counter Russia's active measures against the U.S., maintains resources for our intelligence community's counterterrorism capabilities, and requires the Director of National Intelligence to complete declassification reviews of terrorist activities of each individual who has been transferred or released from the U.detention facility in Guantanamo Bay,  This bill will ensure Florida can continue combatting the Zika virus and the opioid epidemic that is devastating so many families in our communities.

These provisions make the bill worthy of my support, but as I have said before, we cannot continue to run our country in this way, with one temporary bill after another.

24755,2084,Marco,RUBIO,SENATOR,R,FL,,R000595,115,24755,topic-id,723,"Mr.President, I hope that in tax reform, we will try to do what we should do in all of our policies; that is, come up with ideas that are both pro-growth and pro-worker.  There are a lot of good things in this tax bill, but we need to make it better. We can make it more pro-growth and more pro-worker. Senator Lee from Utah and I have a plan that helps us move in that direction. I will describe it briefly, and I want him to have the opportunity to weigh in on this as well.[[Page S7388]]  On the pro-growth side, it is about becoming more globally competitive, and we do so by lowering the current corporate tax rate. The current corporate tax rate in the United States is 35 percent; we would reduce that to 22 percent. Now, the current bill has it at 20, but 22 percent is just as competitive as 20. Here is why. Just like the current bill, it would be lower than the global average rate of 23 percent. Just like the current bill, it would move us from last place to third place among the G7 countries. So it is just as pro-growth. It makes us just as competitive, but it allows us to do the pro-worker reform that we desperately need.  Here is what it allows us to do. It allows us to change the child tax credit in the current bill to help working families even more. 1, it would make it fully refundable up to the amount you pay in payroll tax. 2, it would eliminate the marriage penalty, meaning you pay more in taxes if you are a married couple than you do if you are an individual. 3, it would index the tax credit to chained CPI, which basically means that as inflation grows and the cost of living goes up, the credit doesn't lose its value because it doesn't go up.  The one thing I want to emphasize is, Who does this help? I have had some people in the past and even today ask: Why are you doing this? This is like welfare.  I find that offensive. I find it offensive not because I am offended by people who need the help and are in the safety net program because they have come upon difficult times but because the people we are trying to help are not on government assistance. They are workers. You have to work to get this credit. In essence, the credit applies against their tax liability, be it payroll tax or income tax. A lot of people who are working don't make enough money to be paying a lot of income tax, but they pay up to 15.3 percent of what they make in payroll tax. It is their primary tax liability, and if you don't allow the credit to apply toward that, you are not helping them.  Who are they? Who are the kinds of people we are talking about? In essence, who are these workers? Well, this chart tells you who they are. They are the waitresses making about $20,000 a year. They are not fully benefiting from this credit right now. If we do it the way Senator Lee and I are talking about doing it, they would. They are the home health aides. They are the office clerks. They are the welders making $35,000 a year. They are the truckdrivers. They are the nurses. They are the firefighters making $48,000 a year. These are working people, the backbone of our country, the ones who have been left behind for over three decades because no one fights for them. They have been ignored and disrespected in our public policy, and they are not accounted for in this bill. They are raising families, our future taxpayers. It costs money to raise a family. The more children you have, the more expensive it is. Our Tax Code should recognize that, and we make a reasonable proposal in that regard.  Now I would like to turn to Senator Lee and ask him to expound on the importance of this for America's workers and why, if we are truly going to have a pro-worker reform, the expansion of the child tax credit and applying it toward the payroll tax the way we have described is essential.

24757,2084,Marco,RUBIO,SENATOR,R,FL,,R000595,115,24757,topic-id,1996,"Mr.President, I know we are scheduled for a vote in a few minutes. We will have plenty of time to talk about this in the days to come.  I think one of the core things that I hope tax reform will be about is empowering the American worker. By ``the American worker,'' I mean the people whom they don't make Netflix series about and we don't see movies about too often anymore. There was a time when the American worker was a hero in our country. People looked up to the American worker and idealized them. Today, obviously, entertainment focuses on other professions. There is nothing wrong with that, but we have forgotten about their hard work and the millions and millions of Americans across this country who truly remain the backbone of our economy and our  There are hard-working men and women who are struggling to get by, not because they are not working hard but because everything costs more--something you quickly find out as your family begins to grow. That is why I have spent so much time talking about the child tax credit. A lot of people confuse that with the childcare credit, which is important as well.  The child tax credit takes into account the reality that raising children is an expense. It is a blessing, but it costs money. At the end of the day, it doesn't always matter only how much you make; it also matters how much you spend. And when you are raising children and raising a family, the costs are often out of your control, and they increase substantially every single year. So perhaps the best way to illustrate to my colleagues the impact that tax reform has on working families is to talk about real people and their real lives--how much money they make and what tax reform would mean for them.  I want to start with a real family, a particular family my staff has been communicating with; that is, the Starling family, Richard and Emily, a very young family from Jacksonville, They have a 2-year-old daughter, and they are expecting their second child in Richard is a pastor, and he works part time at He makes about $25,000 a year. His wife Emily stays home and cares for their daughter while he is at work.  Because of their income, the Senate tax bill's nonrefundable child tax credit increase would actually be worth very little to them. A lot of people have said to me: Well, we have increased it to $2,000. Isn't that great? It is. But what it means that people don't understand is, if the majority--if all the taxes you pay are payroll taxes, it doesn't help a lot.  I, frankly, get offended when I hear people say: These are Americans who don't pay taxes. They do pay taxes--not income tax, but they pay payroll taxes. They take it out of your check every month. Trust me, it is a tax. It is less money than what was supposed to be there after the tax.  So the tax credit, while we increased it to $2,000--and that is great for a lot of people--it does nothing for them. The total effect is only about $115 for the family. That is how much they will be saving in their taxes from the current year--$115.  But here is where it gets worse. The Senate bill--which I am largely supportive of, but I just want to tell my colleagues what the numbers are so we can see where the changes need to be--the Senate bill would actually increase taxes in March when they have a child. You say: How can that be? Well, for some families in their income range, the nonrefundable increase for the child tax credit is less valuable than the current lost personal exemption. So we take away the personal exemption and we put in this additional child tax credit, but it is nonrefundable. They can't get to that tax credit because they are not paying income taxes, and the result is that if they make $26,000 instead of $25,000, the Senate bill would actually take away $15 from their per-child tax cut.  So these families work hard and pay their taxes, they raise children, they are contributing an extraordinary amount to our country, and they need our help more than ever before.  There are a couple other examples, and I will go to the first chart. Let's take for example a tire changer and a preschool teacher with two children in Gainesville, FL--the home of the university in Florida, the finest learning institution in the Southeast--an editorial thing, but it is a matter of fact. But I digress. Let me get back to chart 1 and talk about this family.  The husband, as I said, works at a local auto shop as a tire changer. His wife is a preschool teacher. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with these two jobs, their combined income would be $28,300. Because the increase to the child tax credit is nonrefundable--the extra money we put in--this family wouldn't nearly have enough income tax liability to take advantage of the full credit. So the bill as it is currently written gives them a tax cut of $200--about $50 per person.  But what if we did what Senator Lee and I are proposing, which is to make the child tax credit fully refundable, even against payroll tax. Well, then their tax cut would not be $200, it would be $1,570. Trust me when I tell you that for a family making $28,000 a year, a $1,500 pay increase in real cash matters. It matters. It doesn't solve all of their problems, but it helps.  Here is another one. Take this example. The husband is a private in the Army National Guard, and his wife is a waitress at a local restaurant. They have three children. He is on Active Duty at Camp Blanding in Starke, She works full time. They have a combined income of $33,832, according to the National Guard base pay.  Because the increase, again, is nonrefundable in the child tax credit, they don't have enough income to take full advantage of the tax credit. The bill as currently written cuts their taxes by $388. The proposal that Senator Lee and I have outlined would cut their taxes by $2,100. So a $2,100 pay increase for this working family in cash will matter. It will matter. It doesn't solve all of their problems but, trust me, $2,100 for this family, more than what they have today, will help them a lot, and it rewards the work they are doing.  What about a single mother. Let's say she is a childcare worker. She has one child and is living in Miami, FL, where I live. She works full time. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage for that job is $14,800 a year. She gets a tax cut under the current bill of about $100. If we do what Senator Lee and I are talking about doing, she will get a $1,000 tax cut. I am not telling you that $1,000 solves all of her problems, but a $1,000 pay increase for a single mother making $14,800 a year will matter.  How about a loading dock worker and a cashier in Northwest Florida after having two kids. Here is what we point to: a glaring blind spot in the way this is structured. Again, for many working families, because the child tax credit is nonrefundable, it will actually be less valuable to parents than the dependent exemption and the existing child credits are under current law today. I think[[Page S7351]]this is the opposite of pro-family policy.  Let's look at this example. He works as a freight mover at a lumber warehouse, and she works as a cashier. They both work and live full time in Live Oak, Their average combined income is about $28,650. Under the current Tax Code, the way the law is today, if they have two kids, their tax cut would be $2,776. That is what they would save. Under the current bill, their tax cut would be $2,656. So, in essence, under the way the bill is structured now, they would be getting $120 less--or keeping $120 less--than what they would under the law today, for a family making $28,000 a year.  We can fix it, because under the proposal Senator Lee and I will have, they are going to see a tax cut of $4,000 for having that additional child. That is $1,200 greater than the current law. That is a raise of $1,300 more than would happen under the bill as it is currently structured.  I don't think this is an intended consequence. But this is a working family. They work. They pay payroll tax. They make $28,000, $29,000 a year. Trust me when I tell you this money will matter. It won't solve all of their problems, but it will help. It is a pay raise.  Last but not least, I live in West Miami, I have lived there since 1985. It is a working-class neighborhood. According to the census, the average family income in West Miami, where I live, is $38,000--let's say $39,000. That doesn't mean that West Miami is poor. I know the people there. They work hard. They pay their taxes. They raise their children well. They go to work 5 days a week for 8 or 9 hours a day, sometimes on the weekends. But because it is a working-class town, the nonrefundable increase we put in for the child tax credit doesn't do much.  As an example, based on the census data for West Miami, for that ZIP Code that I live in, more than 2,500 children in this ZIP Code--meaning more than half of the total number of children living in that area--would be receiving less than the full credit than they would otherwise be eligible for. Why? Because for their parents, their primary tax liability is the payroll tax. And you cannot help working families with a tax cut if you do not allow the cut to apply to the payroll tax. It is as simple as that.  We have to do that. If we want to help people in this country, if we really want to help them have a little bit more in their pocket, then let's implement the proposal that Senator Lee and I have put forward.  By the way, I hear these economists and other people say: Well, it won't do anything for growth.  You really don't understand how working Americans live. Someone who makes $38,000 a year or $35,000 a year basically spends every penny they make. They have to. If you make $38,000 a year, with two kids, you are spending every penny you make and then probably having to put the extra on your credit card, unfortunately. This proposal will drive consumer spending. It will allow them to pay for some things they can't buy now. These kids outgrow their shoes so fast. The bookbags don't make it through a year. There are so many things we could be helping families with, and our tax reforms should do that.  Everybody in this town has a trade association, has a lobbyist, has newspapers that write about them. Who writes about them? Who writes about these working Americans--working Americans, not people asking for anything from the government. They go to work. They work hard. They work every day. Who fights for them? Who talks about them? Who represents them? That is supposed to be us.  If we are serious about representing them, then let's prove it. Let's amend this bill and change it so we can give working Americans the raise they deserve, and that they need, to strengthen our country and strengthen our families.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Katsas nomination?

24758,2084,Marco,RUBIO,SENATOR,R,FL,,R000595,115,24758,topic-id,4586,"Mr.President, as I try to do every year, if time permits--this will be my seventh year in the U.Senate; sometimes our work here finishes in a different fashion, but if possible, I try to come on the last day of the legislative year and give a speech to kind of recap the year behind us and outline the challenges of the year ahead.  For me, it was, obviously, an eventful year, a productive one, and I believe it has been one for this Chamber, as well, in what is a unique political environment in which politics today is practiced and covered in ways we have never seen before--almost like entertainment. Nevertheless, it was a year that we got a lot of good things done, and I wanted to highlight some of them in the hope that this gives us momentum into the new year.  This has been my first experience with a new President--obviously, not just a new President but a new administration that brought with it a set of individuals in different positions, so I think for all of us it was a transition in that regard. It also was the beginning of a second term, which, at one time, I didn't know I was even going to pursue.  In arriving here earlier this year and getting to work, we slowly but surely got going on a number of key priorities that we had been working on for a very long time. The first one that happened[[Page S8225]]was the VA accountability bill. This was a bill that I had been working on for a number of years. It basically gave the Secretary of the VA the power to fire people at the VA who are not doing a good job. It is that simple. It is not anything more complicated than that. It made it easier to fire people who were not doing a good job. They still have due process to defend themselves.  For the better part of 3 years, there were a lot of objections to that proposal from the previous administration and some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Then everything lined up this year. Senator Tester and Senator Isakson, who are the ranking member and chairman of that committee, came onboard and really helped to push this and to move it forward. It passed in both Chambers and was signed into law by the This was a substantial achievement.  What is interesting about it is that because it was bipartisan, because there was cooperation, and because no one was fighting with anyone on it, it didn't get a lot of press coverage. But it happened, and people need to know about it.  Does it make the VA perfect? Are there still challenges that need to be confronted? This is something that has to do with accountability and the ability to get rid of people who were not doing a good job. It is something that, for years, could not get done because someone always objected and found a way to stop it. Then it came together with people working across the aisle to make it happen. Today, it is the law. Today, there are people who were not doing a good job who are no longer employed at the VA, thanks to this. That is an important thing that people need to know.  I always remind everyone that the overwhelming majority of people who work at the VA are doing a good job. The ones who are not are the ones we need to replace.  The year went on, and I had an opportunity to interface and interact with the National Security Council and with the White House on two foreign policy issues that didn't really require legislation but that I am grateful and excited about having the opportunity to help craft.  The first was the new direction on U.policy toward The previous administration had basically changed our policies toward Cuba--opened it up to much fanfare and, quite frankly, a lot of editorial board excitement.  It was the enlightened position, apparently, to argue that doing more trade with Cuba was going to somehow help Cuba transition to a democracy. But after 2\1/2\ years, it has become apparent that this change has done nothing other than flow more dollars into the hands of that regime and help them in their efforts to normalize.  When President Trump was elected, one of the things he wanted to talk about was what we needed to do to change that relationship back to something that favored the Cuban people and not the Cuban regime. Those changes came about. They were announced earlier this year at an event in South  To cut to the chase, what it does is this: It says that people can still travel to Americans can still go to Cuba as part of a group or as an individual going to support the Cuban people. But if you go to Cuba, whether off a cruise ship, an airplane, or if you are there in support of the Cuban people, you have to spend your money at places that are owned by Cubans--by everyday Cuban people--not by the Cuban military, which is trying to create a monopoly.  For the first time in the history of that tyranny, there is a U.policy that places individuals in Cuba--private individuals in Cuba--in a favored position in comparison to the military and the Castro government. I believe this law will slowly but surely pay dividends as it becomes abundantly clear to the small, independent, private sector in Cuba that the reason they are aren't growing--the reason they aren't attracting more customers--has nothing to do with U.policy. It is because their own government does not want to allow them to be able to grow their businesses.  The Cuban Government feels threatened by private business, 1, because they are Communists and, 2, because they don't want people in Cuba to be able to support themselves. They want people to be dependent upon them; that is how they control politically.  We will see what decision the Cuban Government makes in the months and years to come, but here it is abundantly clear that there are people--Americans--who, under our law, can travel to Cuba, can spend money in Cuba, and they will have to stay at an Airbnb or in a private home or even, if the Cuban Government allows it, a hotel that is owned by a private entity. Where they cannot stay is in places controlled by the Cuban military or companies controlled by the Cuban military.  The second foreign policy issue that we were able to get involved in is another tragedy in our hemisphere; that is, what is happening in To cut to the chase, we have a tyrant who is afraid that he won't get reelected. He lost control of the National Assembly, which is their legislative body. His name is Nicolas So what does he do? He basically figures out a way to create an alternative Congress called the Constituent Assembly, basically modeled after the fraudulent Cuban constituent assembly-like model. What it basically does is it guarantees that certain sectors in society have seats of representation. Instead of seats in Congress by a district or state, they are represented by different sectors, like labor, electricians, you name it.  But here is the funny part about it: The only people who can run for it are the people they allow to run for it, and they also get to count the votes. As you can imagine, that fraudulent Constituent Assembly basically votes 100 percent in favor of whatever he wants, literally with very little dissent. It is not democratically elected. Meanwhile, the legitimate, democratically elected Congress, to use terms that we use here, has basically been intimidated and stripped of their power. Maduro doesn't allow them to be paid anymore; they don't staff anymore; all sorts of things of that nature.  We encourage the President of the United States to pursue first individual sanctions. We encourage the President to grow the list of individuals in Venezuela who are sanctioned and no longer able to benefit from ill-found gains here in the United States and ultimately to prevent them from continuing to do something they have been doing for far too long.  For far too long, they have been stealing the oil from They are selling it in global markets at a discount. Then they use those--to use rough numbers, they take $1 million worth of oil and sell it for half a million dollars. Then they will take some of that half a million dollars and use it to pay the interest on the debt they already owe. Then the rest of that cash, they use for themselves, and they sprinkle a little bit of it to some of the elites around them just to keep them loyal to the regime. Those are the midlevel or high-level military officials who decide, well, things aren't great in Venezuela, but at least my family is better off than everybody else because we are loyal to the regime.  The President moved to stop that. Today, U.entities can no longer trade in these fraudulent, illegal bonds that are stolen from the people of This is a tragic situation. This is not an embargo. This is not economic warfare, which is what Maduro calls it. This, basically, is preventing them from continuing to steal.  I would add one more point to this. I encourage every one of you, if you can, to read an article in the New York Times that appeared last weekend, a pretty extensive series on starvation. Children are literally starving to death in Venezuela is the richest country in the hemisphere, the richest country in South America, in terms of being one of the most oil-rich countries in the world. Venezuela is a nation with a long history of stable economics and even the longest democratic tradition in South There are children starving. We see images that we normally associate with other continents at other times in our history--children starving to death in Meanwhile, he looks as though he weighs more than he ever has before, and all the people who surround him in his government are heavier, fatter than they have ever been before. People are starving because of that. It is not because of U.policy. It is not because of sanctions. There is no one in[[Page S8226]]the world, other than his handful of cronies, who would argue that it has anything to do with sanctions. It is because of them, because in addition to being incompetent, they are criminals.  The Venezuelan Government, from the top down and everywhere in between, is filled with narcotraffickers, with people who allow narcotraffickers from Mexico and from Colombia to fly into and use airports in Venezuela to traffic drugs. Just imagine for a moment, in this country, if our elected officials said to certain drug dealers: If you pay us, not only will the DEA not stop you from trafficking in drugs, but they will help you move it. That is what happens in Imagine for a moment if the Department of Defense went to drug dealers and said: If you pay us, not only will we allow your planes to fly, we will tell you what time to take off and we will escort you in our airspace. That is Venezuela--state-sponsored narcotrafficking at every level.  By the way, they offer another service. If you don't pay them, they will tell you: Don't worry, we will arrest the rival drug dealer, but we will protect the ones who pay us.  There are some very wealthy people in that government. In addition to corruption and stealing from the people of Venezuela, they are narcotraffickers. The Vice President of Venezuela is a narcotrafficker, sanctioned by the United States as a drug kingpin, and it goes on from there. The Vice President of the party, who controls their intelligence services--a thug by the name of Diosdado Cabello--is a drug trafficker. The nephews of the President of Venezuela, the nephews of his wife, the First Lady, were just convicted and sentenced last week, in a court in New York, for drug trafficking. By the way, in their testimony, it is all filled with evidence.  I hope in the new year that we can find a way to continue to support the brave people of Venezuela and a better way forward. We would hope, by the way, that even in the Venezuelan Government, even in that fraudulent Constituent Assembly, we would hope that there are people there, like Hugo Chavez, who believed in the stuff he believed in--but they would have to see that this is a disaster, that this incompetent man is destroying their country and starving their children, and that there is no future in the direction they are headed. We hope this situation improves in the years to come.  Senator Cardin was on the floor yesterday discussing this, and I want to reiterate that I hope that early next year, we can move on a bill that we introduced together called the Venezuelan Humanitarian Assistance and Defense of Democratic Governance Act of 2017. This helps address this problem. It puts in place a plan to help with this humanitarian crisis. We need a government that allows us to do it. But knowing that the United States, working with Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Spain, and the European Union--knowing that these countries are ready to step in and help might be an incentive for decent people still left in that government to step forward and begin a process of transition.  It was an interesting year, and one more legislative initiative that we took on was the RACE for It is a pediatric cancer initiative. There are not enough innovations in pediatric cancer when you compare it to adult cancer. This law requires pharmaceuticals to begin testing adult drugs on pediatric populations so that hopefully we can develop more pediatric medicines. I worked on that with Senator Bennet of We got it passed and signed into law. Again, it is not something that got a lot of attention because it was bipartisan and not controversial, but it is important. We are proud of the good work we accomplished this year in that regard.  We had hurricanes that impacted Florida not once but twice, first Hurricane Irma and then Hurricane Maria, which struck Puerto Rico and had an impact on Florida as well. Approximately 200,000 U.citizens from Puerto Rico have moved to Florida because there is no electricity, because the island had already been hit previously, and because it is facing a financial disaster, and now it got hit by the storm. We were very involved in helping there. In particular, we worked with Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez, who is a true and dedicated public servant to the people of Puerto Rico, 1, in getting the right response. It took a little too long for the response to get going, but it finally started moving. But there is still so much to be done. The estimates are that it will be another 8 months before power is restored.  A disaster like that is never good news, but for the first time at least in 7 years, I feel as though my colleagues know more about Puerto Rico than ever before. They understand the challenges it faces because of its unique status. They understand the preexisting challenges it faced before the storm, and they understand what lies ahead.  I don't mean this disrespectfully, but there was a time when people sometimes would talk to me about Puerto Rico as though it were a foreign country. We have to remind them that these are U.citizens. On a per capita basis, they volunteer to serve in the Armed Forces as much as or more than anyone else in the United  I hope that in the year to come we will redouble our efforts, particularly in disaster relief, to ensure that Puerto Rico doesn't just recover but is rebuilt stronger than ever so that we don't have to continue to revisit this in the future when the inevitable happens, because they will face a storm again.  Of course, just a few days ago, we passed tax reform. Not everybody likes it, but I think more people will as they start to see its true implications. By March of this year, the overwhelming majority of Americans are going to notice that their paychecks are bigger than they were a year ago, and if they didn't get a raise, it will be solely based on tax reform. If I were king for a day, the law would look a little different. But we don't have kings in America; we have a constitutional republic in which making things better is our goal. Sometimes if you get 70 or 80 percent of what you want, that is certainly a victory. Sometimes if you get 50 percent of what you want, that is a victory. Most change in America happens incrementally through our constitutional republic. Every now and then, we can take major steps forward.  Here is the bottom line: America's Tax Code today is better than it was before this bill passed. Do I think we went a little too far in the direction of multinational corporations? Perhaps--not that it is going to hurt the economy. But I thought some of that could have been geared toward working families through a further expansion of the child tax credit. But over all, I do believe it will help grow our economy, and more importantly, I do believe it will leave more money in the hands of Americans to be able to spend it on their families. It is their money. It is not ours.  The best way to look at it is, if I came here and said that I wanted to spend $2 trillion over the next 10 years--borrowed money--to give it to the government so the government could stimulate the economy, there would be a lot of support from the other side of the aisle and from the press. They would call it genius and enlightened for a Republican to think that way. But if we say we want to leave $1.5 to $2 trillion in the hands of the American people and the private sector so they can stimulate the economy instead, it is a disaster and it is irresponsible. It is just a philosophical difference of opinion.  There is a role for government. We must fund it. We have to rebuild our military. We talked about disaster relief. There are important things for government to do. But by and large, a dollar spent by the private sector or by an individual family is going to generate more growth than a dollar spent by the government. We fund government not to grow the economy but to help sustain it and protect it and keep us safe and the food that we eat and the airplanes we travel on and certainly from threats foreign and domestic. Economic growth is a function of the private sector and of individuals, and tax reform helps to achieve it. That alone won't be enough.  One of the singular challenges in America today that we must confront in the new year, hopefully, is the skills gap. It is not just a throwaway phrase; it is the fact that the best paying jobs, the ones that actually pay enough to raise a family and save for retirement--those jobs require skills that[[Page S8227]]our schools aren't teaching. Those jobs require skills that millions of Americans do not have. We have to change that. We have to make it easier not just to graduate people at 18 years of age ready to work, we have to make it easier for people at 45 to be able to go back to some sort of school and acquire the skills they need for a better paying job. That will lead to economic growth. That will help fill the 2 million to 3 million unfilled jobs that we cannot find people in this country with the right skills to fill. That is how people get a raise as a part of economic growth, and I hope the new year provides an opportunity for that.  I would add that, in addition to that, the new year will provide us an opportunity to focus on infrastructure, which is critical. My State of Florida is particularly impacted by not just storms but sea level rise in coastal areas, and there are things we can do to mitigate against it. We need to restore the Everglades, and, of course, we need roads and bridges and to improve our infrastructure and airports. Hopefully, we can confront that as we work on infrastructure.  Mr.President, 2018 will be a year that we will deal with the farm bill. I hope action will be taken to reform crop insurance, to ensure that my State's farmers are never in the position they were put in after Hurricane Irma, with neither a reliable safety net, nor a reliable commitment from the Federal Government to step in when Federal programs fail to meet disaster needs.  Next year could be a water resources year, a water year. Again, it is an opportunity for us to do critical things for our infrastructure. In Florida, beach renourishment and intercoastal navigation projects are important not just to our way of life but to our tourism industry. There are harbor dredging projects with the expansion of the Panama It is important that these things get done next year. They won't get as much controversy or fanfare, but these are critical things that we can do.  Another opportunity next year that we have heard some talk about is the ability to reform the social safety net. On that front, I would say that is an issue that I have pushed for for a very long time. But sometimes when you talk about reform, people think you are coming at it because you want to cut. For me, it is not so much about cutting; it is about improving the way we deliver the same services. How can we use the money we are already spending in the safety net but in a better way?  I believe in the safety net. I actually don't believe free enterprise works unless we have one. People are not going to take risks, people are not going to strive if they think that if they fall, the consequences will be economic devastation. You have to have a safety net to take care of those who cannot take care of themselves--the permanently disabled, the elderly and the like--but you also have to have a safety net for people who have come upon tough times until they can get back on their feet and try again.  But I fear--in fact, I realized long ago--that our safety net programs treat the symptoms of poverty, but they do not cure it. That is why I hope that if and when we tackle the social safety net--and I hope we will in 2018--it will not be so much about cutting as it will be about reorganizing and improving. Yes, we will take care of people in their emergent and immediate needs. But we will also make it easier for you to go back to school and get a degree or a technical certification so that you can find a job and never again rely on the government. If we do that for enough people, it will save us money because fewer people will be on the social safety net. But that should not be the reason we tackle it--not as a cost-saving exercise, but as a way to lift up more  We are in a global competition, and our chief geopolitical competitor in the economic space in the 21st century will be China has over three times as many people as we do, and we have to compete against them. They have 1 billion, and we have 380 million or 400 million people. We are competing against an economy with three times as many people. We need everyone. We are not a nation that can afford economically to leave anyone behind, and we are a nation in which leaving anyone behind would be a betrayal of our founding principles. That is why I hope we will tackle it next year--if we tackle the social safety net--with job training programs.  In a few moments, the Senate will hopefully take up and vote on the continuing resolution. I know everyone is anxious to return to their States and homes for the holiday. I will say that I am disappointed we are leaving here at the end of this year not having taken on a disaster relief bill that I know the people in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and--with the wildfires--out West need. I believe we will confront it in the early part of next year, along with a permanent extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program and other matters.  Next year will bring an opportunity, as well, to deal with things like immigration security, the opportunity to deal with young people brought to this country, through no fault of their own, by their parents who now find themselves here, illegally, in the country. I believe there is a real chance next year to provide them certainty and the ability to stay in this country for the future.  All these things are there, and they will happen in the early part of the year. But, at least when it comes to disaster relief, it is disappointing that we won't be able to do that--largely for legislative strategic reasons, not for policy ones. But I am confident we will deal with it in the early part of next year.  I actually think that in 2018, despite it being an election year, if we allow the momentum that closed out this year to carry over to the new one, we will have a chance to do good things for our country.  In the end, given our differences that exist in this country today, it is hard to imagine we will ever always agree that every idea is a good one, but I hope we can all agree that our job here is to make things better. Sometimes making things better means 1 step forward, and sometimes it means 50 steps forward. But as long as we are moving forward in a pattern of perpetual improvement, I think we should be proud of the work we are doing.  I think, by and large, in 2017, despite the fits and starts, despite the controversies, despite the headlines every morning about the outrage of the day or questions in the afternoon that usually begin with ``How did you feel about the tweet on this or on that?''--despite all those distractions, I think 2017 will go down as a year of consequential improvement, where things happened in this Chamber and in this city that made America better, not worse. On that, I hope we can continue to work.  I wish all the people of Florida, all my colleagues, all the people of this great country and around the world a happy Hanukkah, a merry Christmas, and a happy New I look forward to working together and making things better in the year to come.  I yield the floor.

24760,2084,Marco,RUBIO,SENATOR,R,FL,,R000595,115,24760,topic-id,1256,"Mr.President, I have come to the floor today as part of my office's Expression NOT Oppression initiative, which highlights human rights abuses around the world and the plight of individuals imprisoned or oppressed for simply exercising their God-given rights.  Earlier this month, we observed World Press Freedom Day, which serves as a reminder that freedom of expression is a fundamental, universal human right and that a free press is vital to a free society.  We should never take for granted the freedom of the press we enjoy here in the United These rights are an integral part of the bedrock of any healthy democracy, and in too many parts of the world, they are nonexistent or under assault.  According to Reporters Without Borders' 2017 World Press Freedom Index, press freedom is threatened now more than ever. Governments around the world continue to crack down on their citizens' access to information. Out of 180 countries, Burundi dropped from 156 to 160. Most problematic for press freedom, Egypt dropped from 159 to 161, and Bahrain dropped from 162 to 164.  Additionally, Reporters Without Borders has reported that at least nine journalists have been killed already in 2017. Several were killed in Mexico, here in our own hemisphere. It is hard to believe that people are being thrown in jail or worse simply because government officials don't like what they write or publish, but that is what is happening, especially in countries like China, Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, just to name a few.  The case I come to the floor today to highlight is that of Huang Qi, who has long been targeted by the Chinese Government because of his advocacy for the rights of ordinary citizens and his coverage of the Chinese Government's violation of those rights. In November of last year, the police reportedly burst into his residence and ransacked his home and took him to detention. In December of last year, Chinese prosecutors authorized Huang's arrest for allegedly ``illegally providing state secrets overseas,'' a charge that can result in a sentence of life imprisonment. The Committee to Protect Journalists described his detention as part of ``an intensified crackdown on online journalists and bloggers who report on protests and human rights abuses.''  Huang founded the 64 Tianwang human rights website in 1998. The Chinese Government has blocked access to 64 Tianwang since 2003, according to Radio Free Asia, because the site covers issues deemed politically sensitive by authorities, such as protests and government corruption.  Authorities previously sentenced Huang to 3 years in prison in November 2009 for ``illegal possession of state secrets''--this in connection with his work assisting parents who lost children during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. In addition, Chinese authorities sentenced Huang to 5 years in prison in 2000 for ``subversion'' for his advocacy on behalf of the families of the 1989 Tiananmen protest victims--a solemn anniversary we will mark next month.  In short, Huang, a veteran activist, is no stranger to the Chinese Government's silencing of dissent. His life's work is a testament to fearless reporting regardless of what consequences may follow. While his own government views him as a threat, outside of China, his work is widely praised and recognized. Reporters Without Borders awarded the 2016 Press Freedom Award to his website. His case has been championed by Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, and others, including the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which I am proud to chair. His case is featured in the Commission's Political Prisoner Database, which presently contains more than 1,400 active prisoner records--a staggering but far from exhaustive number.  Huang is committed to reporting the facts--facts that describe the daily struggles of Chinese citizens. For this, he has suffered greatly, including reported torture and mistreatment in detention, unjust imprisonment, and deprivation of his most basic rights.  The Chinese Government should immediately and unconditionally release him. The United States should make this case and the cases of many others like him languishing unjustly behind bars in China or tortured into ``confessing'' to ``crimes'' they did not commit, priorities--we should make these priorities in our bilateral engagement with  It is the second point--the torture and mistreatment of rights defenders--that brings to mind another troubling case, that of prominent rights lawyer Xie His wife, who recently arrived in the United States with her two young children, will testify before the House Foreign Affairs Committee later this week. Xie has bravely taken on sensitive cases, including land grab victims and advocates for democratic reform. Chinese security agents detained him as part of the 709 Crackdown--a sweeping, nationwide campaign against Chinese rights lawyers and advocates that started on July 9, 2015.  The plight of 45-year-old Mr.Xie burst onto the international scene in January 2017 when his attorneys released transcripts of their meetings with him. The transcripts recount the threats of his inquisitors. They said: ``We'll torture you to death just like an ant.'' Another warned: ``I'm going to torment you until you go insane.'' He told his lawyers: ``I wanted to end their interrogation of me as quickly as I could, even if it meant death. . . . Later, I wrote down whatever they wanted.'' As if foreshadowing the fate that awaited him, he had earlier written a letter in detention in which he cautioned, ``If one day in the future I admit guilt . . . that will not be a true expression of my thoughts.''  Fast-forward to last week. He was charged with ``inciting subversion of state power and disrupting court order'' and pled guilty in a recorded video released by the court and widely reported in major media outlets. He said: ``I want to take this opportunity to express to other rights lawyers my view now that we should give up using contact with foreign media and independent media to hype sensitive news events, attack judicial institutions and smear the image of the nation's party organs while handling cases. . . . `'  He continued in that same coerced statement: ``Everyone should take me as a warning to certainly stay within the framework of the law and avoid being exploited by Western anti-China forces.''  Yet, despite these warnings and the Chinese Government's unyielding assault on human rights, there are still men and women committed to reporting on the government's abuses and steadfast in defending the powerless and the marginalized. Their courage is an inspiration, and it must summon our solidarity.
