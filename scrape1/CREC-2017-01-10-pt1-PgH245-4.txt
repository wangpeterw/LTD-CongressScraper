                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  As the early days of the 115th Congress play out, we are mindful and 
grateful that our Nation has once again experienced something so often 
lacking in our world's experience: the peaceful transition of 
government.
  Though major change of party control did not take place in this 
Chamber, it is still the American experience that our streets are 
peaceful and winners and losers of elections move on with their lives 
in dignity.
  We thank You again for the inspiration of our Nation's Founders and 
the legacy they left us with. May the Members of this assembly, and all 
Americans, be worthy of that legacy.
  And may all that is done in the people's House be for Your greater 
honor and glory.
  Amen.
