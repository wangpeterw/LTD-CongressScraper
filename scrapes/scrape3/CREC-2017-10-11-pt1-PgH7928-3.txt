                          HONORING DAVE DAVIS

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dear friend of mine, 
Dave Davis, who passed away recently. Dave was a giant Purdue fan, but 
we first met at a UCLA basketball game over 20 years ago.
  We immediately struck up a friendship, and in 2000, when I announced 
I was running for Congress, Dave was all in and, despite the long odds, 
took vacation time to drive me all around Madison County. We didn't win 
that one, but that is the kind of guy Dave Davis was. He put others 
first, sharing in your successes and your struggles as if they were his 
own.
  Dave had a great smile and a rare quality: he saw everyone for who 
they could be, not just what they were.
  Dave spent his career in public service for our State and our Nation, 
but his most important priority was his family. He never passed up an 
opportunity to talk about his wife, Robyn; or his kids, Alex, Amy, and 
Eric.
  Dave Davis was a good man and my friend. Congratulations on a life 
well lived. Godspeed.
