                 INVESTING IN AMERICA'S INFRASTRUCTURE

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate for a national 
infrastructure plan.
  I represent the central coast of California, and this winter we got 
rain. We got a lot of rain. So much so that it caused millions in 
damage to the area, including the closure of the famous Highway 1 in 
Big Sur, with major mudslides in the south and the loss of the 315-foot 
Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge in Big Sur.
  That damage has left 450 people isolated: kids can't get to school; 
families are separated; and employers and employees are suffering, 
including the loss of $8 million in 1 month in the off-season.
  But the effects of that damage extend beyond Big Sur to the 
surrounding towns, counties, and, actually, the entire State of 
California. People from all over the world come to Big Sur. They drive 
down from San Francisco. They drive up from Los Angeles. They patronize 
towns all along their way to Big Sur.
  We understand why. It is the most beautiful place in the world. It is 
my home. And we want it to be open to all of you.

  It is time that the Congress and our President help Americans by 
investing in our American infrastructure.
