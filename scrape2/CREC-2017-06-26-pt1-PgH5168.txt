CELEBRATING GROWING BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN INDIA AND UNITED STATES

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, Prime Minister Modi's visit this 
week serves as an occasion to celebrate the growing bonds of friendship 
between India and the United States.
  India is a key partner for the United States and Asia. Both our 
economic and strategic posture in the region are strengthened by 
investing in the bilateral relationship between the world's two largest 
democracies.
  India and the United States have pledged to collaborate on energy 
security, combating climate change, and growing the green economy--
opportunities that will create jobs in both countries.
  This visit is an opportunity to celebrate the work our countries have 
accomplished and all that we can do together in the future. I am happy 
that we are continuing to build on this nearly 70-year-old partnership 
and are laying the groundwork for an even stronger relationship in the 
decades to come.
