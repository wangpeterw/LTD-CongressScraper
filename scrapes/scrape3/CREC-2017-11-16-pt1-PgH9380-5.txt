                    NATIONAL PARKS ARE FOR EVERYONE

  (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the administration's proposed 
national parks entrance fee hike from $25 to $70 per vehicle, which 
will prohibit many American families from enjoying these beautiful 
sites.
  Joshua Tree National Park in my district welcomes as many as 2.5 
million visitors each year, contributing $128 million to our local 
economy. It is a haven for so many: local veterans find solace and 
healing in the quiet of nature; children experience the beauty of their 
first hike; visitors come to love the grandeur and the mystique of our 
desert when they come to stay in Joshua Tree; families bond over the 
lasting memories they make in the park.
  Everyone, not just the rich, should have access to these incredible 
places. Working families are deserving of access to our national parks. 
Nearly tripling the price of entry means that many families will be 
priced out of visiting these parks, including many people in my 
district who live right next to Joshua Tree National Park.
  Our national parks are not just only for the economically privileged. 
They are for we, the people, to enjoy.
