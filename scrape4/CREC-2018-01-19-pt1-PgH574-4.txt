                            PROTECTING LIFE

  (Mr. MEADOWS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, today is a day where tens of thousands of 
people come to Washington, D.C., to march for the sanctity of life for 
the real purpose of speaking up for those who can't speak for 
themselves.
  Each year, we see an unbelievable number of people coming to not only 
proclaim what a pro-life position is, but to come out in unison to make 
sure that we once again return to our roots of protecting life and 
knowing that every life is precious.
  Sadly, much of the Main Street media will not be covering this today; 
but in this House, on this day, let us know that, indeed, we are still 
one nation under God and willing to protect life.
