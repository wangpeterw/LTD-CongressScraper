                   HONORING THE LIFE OF LONNY KAPLAN

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, New Jersey's 12th 
Congressional District lost a man of great strength and valor. We lost 
a husband, a father, an activist. For many others, we lost a great 
friend.
  Lonny Kaplan and I met in the 1970s and long maintained a friendship 
of love and mutual respect. He is not only a statesman, but a hero. His 
commitment to political activism, especially towards pro-Israel causes, 
made him instrumental in strengthening the relationship between the 
United States and Israel.
  Lonny was a respected leader in the Jewish community both here in the 
state and nationally, and will long be revered by those who had the 
honor to know him. The loss we feel as a congressional district and as 
a nation is deep, but I know that Lonny will never be forgotten by the 
countless lives that he touched.
