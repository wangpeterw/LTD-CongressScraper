                            THE GOP TAX PLAN

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues have gone too 
far. Their tax scheme gives $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to millionaires 
and billionaires as well as wealthy corporations. It raises taxes on 36 
million middle class families; makes deep cuts to Medicaid and 
Medicare, education, and infrastructure investments; and creates more 
incentives to ship American jobs overseas.
  Now they are planning to sneak in a provision that targets the heart 
of the Affordable Care Act and strips more than 13 million Americans of 
their access to healthcare. This is not a tax reform plan. It is a tax 
scam.
  Democrats and Republicans should be working together to fix an 
economy and a Tax Code that is rigged against working people. The 
American people need real tax reform that invests in middle class 
families, stops corporations from shipping jobs overseas, and protects 
Medicare and Medicaid and other vital investments in healthcare, 
education, and infrastructure.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill does just the opposite. It deserves to be 
defeated, and the American people deserve a better deal.
