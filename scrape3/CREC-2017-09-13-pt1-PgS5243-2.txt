                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, You continue to reveal Your truth to those who will 
listen. Increase the devotion of our Senators to You as they strive to 
faithfully follow Your precepts. May love provide the motivation for 
their service to You and country.
  Lord, inspire them to patiently wait for the unfolding of Your wise, 
loving, and powerful providence, refusing to become weary in doing what 
is right. Let Your peace be within their hearts as You calm their 
fears. Soothe their minds with the knowledge of Your providential care. 
May they encourage one another and build each other up.
  We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
