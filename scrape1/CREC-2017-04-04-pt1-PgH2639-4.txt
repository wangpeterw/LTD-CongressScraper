                             EQUAL PAY DAY

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, it is Equal Pay Day. I rise to support not 
only women but the American family and the economy.
  Women drive our economy. We buy more goods. We own more small 
businesses, and we earn more degrees. Despite this, we still earn less 
than men. This should embarrass every lawmaker in this Chamber and 
every person listening.
  In 2017, Mr. Speaker, how can we justify underpaying women across 
this Nation? Women still earn 20 percent less than their male 
counterparts, and it is even worse for Black and Hispanic women.
  Shortchanging women shortchanges our children and our economy. When 
women succeed, we all succeed. Women and our families demand paycheck 
fairness. We stand boldly united today embracing the words of Florynce 
Kennedy who said: We won't agonize. We will organize. We will show up 
and cut up until Molly earns the same pay as Billy.
  As Susan B. Anthony said: ``Men, their rights and nothing more. 
Women, their rights and nothing less.''
  I urge you to call your Representatives, demand that we support you 
by supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act.
