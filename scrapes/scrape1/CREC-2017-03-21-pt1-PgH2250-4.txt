                  RECOGNIZING NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY

  (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize and celebrate 
National Agriculture Day.
  I proudly represent the largest agriculture-producing district in the 
country, the big First District of Kansas. In my home State, it is 
Kansas Agriculture Month, a month to celebrate our State's largest 
economy.
  Today is an opportunity to remind my colleagues of the hardworking 
Americans who produce the bounty of American harvest and livestock. The 
food that sustains them doesn't originate in a grocery store.
  Let us remember as we move forward with regulations and with trade 
policy that there are families with generations of history on their 
farm or ranch who face the consequences of every decision. They feed 
America and our economy.
  This day and every day, we are grateful that God made a farmer.
