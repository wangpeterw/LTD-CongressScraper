               TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT HENRY J. NYKAMP

  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Staff Sergeant 
Henry J. Nykamp of Milford, New Jersey. This July, Sergeant Nykamp will 
be awarded the French Legion of Honour, normally reserved for French 
nationals. However, other nationals who have aided France or promoted 
its ideals can receive the recognition as well.
  Due to Sergeant Nykamp's tremendous dedication to the allied cause in 
World War II, from June of 1943 to October of 1945, there is no one 
more deserving of the honor.
  During World War II, Sergeant Nykamp was stationed in Hardwick, 
England, where he flew 35 missions as a B-25 nose gunner. Some of 
Sergeant Nykamp's most important operations involved low-level flying 
in support of ground forces during the Battle of the Bulge. He was 
awarded four Bronze Stars and five Air Medals.
  Sergeant Nykamp's is a story of great sacrifice and courage. Mission 
after mission, flight after flight, he answered the call of duty. He 
entered World War II at one of the world's darkest hours and did not 
rest until the struggle was over and the forces of right had prevailed.
  I am pleased that France is recognizing Sergeant Nykamp for his role 
in its liberation, and I also thank him for his tremendous service not 
only to the United States but to the allied cause.
