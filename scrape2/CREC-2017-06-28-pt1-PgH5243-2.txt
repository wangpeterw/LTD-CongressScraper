      PROVIDENCE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH CELEBRATES 250TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Charlotte's 
Providence Presbyterian Church and in celebration of their 250th 
anniversary.
  Founded by Ulster Scots in 1767, the church was named ``Providence'' 
to express the founders' firm trust in the faithfulness of God to work 
all things for His purpose.
  Members of Providence Presbyterian were part of the combative North 
Carolina militia, the Hornet's Nest, which courageously opposed Lord 
Cornwallis during the Revolutionary War.
  For over 140 years, the church sponsored all schools in the community 
and, in the late 1850s, established Providence Female Academy, which 
was one of the few schools for women in the South.
  The church remains committed to service today. Part of the 250th 
anniversary celebration included making 250 dresses for young girls in 
Africa. Their motto is ``Rooted in Christ, growing in the Spirit.''
  To Pastor Walt McCanless and the entire congregation, 
congratulations, and God bless this wonderful community of believers.
