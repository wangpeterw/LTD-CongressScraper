   TAX PLAN RAISING TAXES ON MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND EXPLODING THE 
                                DEFICIT

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, this Chamber passed a 
tax plan that would raise taxes on millions of Americans and explode 
the deficit. Now the Senate is having its turn. Their proposal would 
devastate working families through tax hikes and undermine Americans' 
healthcare through the stealth repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
  Just as the House Republican plan included a huge middle class tax 
increase, so does the Senate's. By 2027, 82 million middle class 
households would see a tax increase.
  But the damage of the Senate plan goes beyond that. It would cut 
Medicare by $25 billion next year alone and add $1.4 trillion to the 
deficit, and it would destabilize healthcare for millions of Americans.
  The Senate plan would leave 13 million more Americans without 
healthcare, while those keeping theirs would see premiums jump up by 10 
percent per year for the next decade.
  Republican Senators have already spoken out against this bill. The 
truth is we all should.
