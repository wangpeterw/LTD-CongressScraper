       INHUMANE TREATMENT OF THE UNDOCUMENTED CANNOT BE REWARDED

  (Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed light on the appalling 
state of our Nation's immigration detention centers.
  Devoid of health services and basic medical standards, these ICE 
facilities are cruel and inhumane. Suicide rates are high, children and 
families are traumatized, and LGBT detainees are subject to alarming 
rates of abuse.
  These centers are also very expensive. Daily operations cost $165 per 
detainee, and $2 billion, annually, despite detention alternatives that 
can cost as little as $9 a day.
  Yet even with this track record, ICE funding has nearly doubled from 
the Bush administration to today, and transparency has fallen by the 
wayside under the current administration, all while conditions continue 
to deteriorate.
  Inhumane treatment of the undocumented cannot be rewarded with 
repeated budget increases. It goes against our country's most 
fundamental values and cannot continue. We must cut ICE's budget until 
these concerns are addressed.
