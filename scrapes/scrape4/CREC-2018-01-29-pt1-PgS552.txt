          SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 25, 2018

                              S. Res. 383

       Whereas women constitute 50.4 percent of people in the 
     United States;
       Whereas women of different race, ethnicity, socioeconomic 
     status, and age experience many diseases and disorders 
     differently than men experience diseases and disorders;
       Whereas those different experiences are reflected in the 
     incidence, prevalence, symptomology, and severity of the 
     disease or disorder;
       Whereas the risks and benefits of medical therapies vary 
     based on the race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and age 
     of a woman;
       Whereas women and men have fundamental biological 
     differences;
       Whereas, for many years, women of different race, 
     ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and age were 
     underrepresented in biomedical and clinical research;
       Whereas the improvement of the health of women relies on 
     sex- and gender-based biomedical and clinical research;
       Whereas the promise of individualized medicine cannot be 
     realized without sex- and gender-based parity in research;
       Whereas on January 25, 2016, the National Institutes of 
     Health implemented a policy requiring federally funded 
     investigators to consider sex as a biological variable in 
     preclinical research; and
       Whereas that policy ushered in a new era of inclusivity and 
     parity in research relating to the health of women: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, that the Senate--
       (1) expresses support for the designation of a ``Women's 
     Health Research Day''; and
       (2) supports efforts to--
       (A) recognize the importance of biomedical and clinical 
     research to the health and well-being of women;
       (B) increase awareness of the value of sex- and gender-
     based biomedical research; and
       (C) encourage individuals, including researchers and 
     patients, to advocate on behalf of sex- and gender-inclusive 
     research for women of different race, ethnicity, 
     socioeconomic status, and age.
