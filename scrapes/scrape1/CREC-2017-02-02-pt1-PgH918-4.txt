    SUPPORTING JUDGE NEIL GORSUCH'S NOMINATION TO U.S. SUPREME COURT

  (Mr. GARRETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support of the 
President's selection of Neil Gorsuch as nominee to the United States 
Supreme Court. Mr. Speaker, it is my sincerest hope that the Members of 
this body and our body down at the other end of the building will 
recognize just what a wonderful selection Mr. Trump has made.
  In fact, candidly, Mr. Speaker, were it my selection, I probably 
would not pick someone who had clerked for liberal jurist Byron 
``Whizzer'' White or the split vote on the Court, Anthony Kennedy. In 
fact, I wonder if the habits of the individuals in the Senate--who 
might have the opportunity to confirm--to resist every single thing 
that comes across their desks these days might not, in fact, lead to a 
more conservative nominee should Judge Gorsuch not be nominated.
  I would again commend Mr. Trump for this middle-of-the-road 
selection. I think he will maintain the balance on the Court that Mr. 
Kennedy has here today.
  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are wise enough 
to understand just what a benevolent and middle-of-the-road selection 
Mr. Gorsuch is.
