                    THE INVESTIGATION MUST CONTINUE

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump, Jr., has documented 
that he, Jared Kushner, and former Trump campaign chairman Paul 
Manafort met with a Russian lawyer with the understanding that she was 
a Russian Government agent and would provide damaging information on 
Hillary Clinton as part of Moscow's effort to help President Trump's 
campaign.
  The attempt by these top advisers to solicit the support of a hostile 
foreign power to win the American Presidency is unprecedented in our 
history.
  When an American political campaign is approached by a foreign source 
promising information on an opponent, they should contact the FBI. 
Unfortunately, the Trump campaign, instead, scheduled a meeting.
  All those who participated in the Trump Tower meeting must testify 
under oath before Congress. Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort, Mr. Kushner, Mr. 
Goldstone, and Ms. Veselnitskaya must disclose to Congress the nature 
and details of their conversations, including any sources in the 
Kremlin.
  Special Counsel Mueller's investigation must continue, and so must 
ours.
