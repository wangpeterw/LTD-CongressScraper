                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Thank You, God, for giving us another day.
  As the difficult work of governing now resumes, bless the Members of 
this assembly with wisdom, patience, and goodwill as they tackle the 
ongoing issues challenging our Nation.
  We thank You again for the inspiration of our Nation's Founders and 
the legacy they left us with. May the Members of this assembly, and all 
Americans, be worthy of that legacy.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
