                       REMEMBERING GARY SMILEDGE

   Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, it is with great sadness today 
that I recognize the life and passing of Gary Wayne Smiledge, 72, of 
Gonic, NH.
  Mr. Smiledge served bravely in the U.S. Army during the Korean war. 
As a member of the 2nd Infantry Division, stationed at Camp Casey south 
of the DMZ, Mr. Smiledge protected orphanages after serving on the 
frontlines.
  When Mr. Smiledge returned to New Hampshire, his service to his 
fellow veterans continued. In addition to being a member of the 
American Legion Post No. 7 of Rochester, he was also heavily involved 
with the New Hampshire Amputee Group, where he worked with other 
veterans who lost limbs during the course of their service.
  Mr. Smiledge was a beloved member of his community, and he will be 
missed dearly. I join all Granite Staters in expressing our profound 
gratitude to veterans like Gary who have fought for the cause of 
freedom, putting their country and devotion to duty first.
