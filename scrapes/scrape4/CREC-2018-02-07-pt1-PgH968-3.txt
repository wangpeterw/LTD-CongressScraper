  (Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the extraordinary achievement of Elon Musk and SpaceX for the 
spectacular and historic launch of its giant Falcon Heavy rocket, now 
the world's most powerful operational rocket, from Cape Canaveral on 
Tuesday, February 6, 2018.
  Besides the launch itself, which carried Mr. Musk's personal Tesla 
Roadster into space, SpaceX also achieved a second amazing feat by 
guiding two of the Falcon Heavy's rocket boosters back to Earth for an 
upright landing. This rocket launch has paved the way for faster, 
cheaper launches of satellites and cargo into space.
  So, as the representative of California's 43rd Congressional 
District, this milestone is especially meaningful to me. SpaceX is 
headquartered in my district in the city of Hawthorne, California, and 
employs thousands of talented men and women in our community.
  I congratulate Elon Musk and SpaceX for continuing the great 
tradition of achievement by aerospace companies in the South Bay.
