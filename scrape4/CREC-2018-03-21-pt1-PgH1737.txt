                       ONE FAMILY ONE RESTAURANT

  (Mr. KNIGHT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the work of One Family 
One Restaurant, a nonprofit organization in my district that tackles 
significant homelessness and hunger problems in southern California.
  I am proud to recognize its work in giving families who struggle with 
food insecurity the opportunity to eat at a restaurant. One Family One 
Restaurant provides a unique and invaluable dining experience to 
families who otherwise rely on food stamps and too often wait in long 
lines at food banks to access food. The experience also helps heal 
hearts and restore a family's dignity and hope.
  One Family One Restaurant does not act alone. It relies on 
restaurants and community members to sponsor meals and local pantries 
and food banks to help coordinate families in need. It takes the 
repeated generosity of the entire community to alleviate family hunger 
in their region.
  This year, they will be launching their nationwide America Break 
Bread campaign. I encourage all of those who seek to help the hungry to 
join in this effort and follow the footsteps of this stellar 
organization. It is an honor to bring their work to the attention of 
the House and the Nation today.
