    SENATE RESOLUTION 164--RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SENIOR 
  VOLUNTEERS AND DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MAY 15 THROUGH 19, 2017, AS 
                     ``NATIONAL SENIOR CORPS WEEK''

  Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, 
Ms. Baldwin, Ms. Collins, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Warren, Ms. Hassan, Mr. 
Blunt, Mr. King, Mr. Coons, and Mrs. Shaheen) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 164

       Whereas volunteers in the United States who are 55 years of 
     age and older (referred to in this preamble as ``senior 
     volunteers'') provide much-needed services to their 
     communities, neighbors, and friends;
       Whereas Senior Corps, through the RSVP, Foster Grandparent, 
     and Senior Companions programs administered by the 
     Corporation for National and Community Service, provides 
     meaningful opportunities to 250,000 senior volunteers and 
     recruits thousands of additional community volunteers;
       Whereas, for more than 5 decades, RSVP volunteers, Foster 
     Grandparents, and Senior Companions have played an important 
     role in strengthening communities by contributing their 
     experience, knowledge, and accomplishments in order to--
       (1) help their neighbors recover from natural and manmade 
     disasters;
       (2) provide nutrition services;
       (3) mentor and tutor schoolchildren;
       (4) support veterans and military families; and
       (5) provide respite care to caregivers;
       Whereas, in 2016, Senior Corps volunteers provided 
     75,000,000 hours of direct service through more than 28,000 
     nonprofit, educational, and faith-based community groups 
     nationwide;
       Whereas structured volunteering by senior volunteers--
       (1) keeps those senior volunteers active, healthy, and 
     engaged;
       (2) helps the United States by saving taxpayer dollars and 
     reducing health care costs; and
       (3) supports the ability of seniors to live independent and 
     productive lives;
       Whereas the RSVP, Foster Grandparent, and Senior Companion 
     programs have proven to be cost-effective ways to engage 
     senior volunteers in service that meets pressing community 
     needs;
       Whereas the United States should expand senior volunteer 
     service opportunities to take advantage of the talents and 
     experiences of the 10,000 baby boomers who will retire each 
     day for the next 20 years; and
       Whereas, at a time of mounting social need and growing 
     interest in service by older individuals in the United 
     States, the United States has an unprecedented opportunity to 
     harness the talents of senior volunteers to address community 
     challenges: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates the week of May 15 through 19, 2017, as 
     ``National Senior Corps Week''; and
       (2) encourages the people of the United States to recognize 
     the contributions of senior volunteers and join in the 
     celebration of National Senior Corps Week.
