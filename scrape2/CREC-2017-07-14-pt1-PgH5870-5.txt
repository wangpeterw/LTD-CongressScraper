    SENATE REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL SHOULD BE TOSSED IN THE TRASH

  (Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, the new version of the Senate Republican 
healthcare bill should be tossed in the trash. No amendment will fix 
the massive damage it will cause to California and the entire country.
  Women, seniors, and low-income families across the country are being 
threatened. TrumpCare threatens to shut down hospitals in my district, 
which would leave many of my constituents without access to critical 
healthcare services.
  People like Doreen from Los Angeles County, will be forced to fight 
for their lives. Doreen was in remission from ovarian cancer in 2010, 
when she successfully signed up to receive coverage through the 
Affordable Care Act, even though she had a preexisting condition. Now 
she is scared for her life as TrumpCare threatens to take away the 
healthcare she needs to stay cancer free.
  I stand up for ``fighters,'' ``luchadoras'' like Doreen--a woman, 
senior, and cancer survivor--who will be left helpless by TrumpCare.
  Again, the Senate Republican healthcare bill should be tossed in the 
trash.
