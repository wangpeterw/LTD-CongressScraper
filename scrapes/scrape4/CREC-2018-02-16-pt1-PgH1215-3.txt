                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. You have 
blessed us with all good gifts, and with thankful hearts we express our 
gratitude. You have created us with opportunities to serve other people 
in their need, to share together in respect and affection, and to be 
faithful in the responsibilities we have been given.
  In this moment of prayer, please grant to the Members of this 
people's House, as they meet with their respective constituents, the 
gifts of wisdom and discernment, that in their words and actions they 
will do justice, love with mercy, and walk humbly with You.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
