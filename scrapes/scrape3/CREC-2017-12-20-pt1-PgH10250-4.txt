                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Lord of Heaven and Earth, we give You thanks for giving us another 
day.
  Darkness descends upon us as the days grow shorter, and the cold 
chastens us to withdraw inside. Be for us the light we long for. The 
very promise of change creates expectation.
  By the first hints of Your dawn, banish all fear and hesitation. May 
those who live on the margins of America's rich blessings have peace 
and prosperity too.
  Because You are always faithful, strengthen us with Your mighty arm, 
that this Congress may be unified in lifting Your people to renewed 
hope.
  May all that is done in the people's House be for Your greater honor 
and glory.
  Amen.
