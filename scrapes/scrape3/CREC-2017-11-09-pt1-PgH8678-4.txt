  Mr. DIAZ-BALART changed his vote from ``nay'' to ``yea.''
  So the bill was passed.
  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
  Stated for:
  Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on the bill this morning 
due to travel to Sutherland Springs, Texas, to meet with the victims, 
their families, and the first responders of the attack that took place 
on November 5th, 2017. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' 
on rollcall No. 622.
  Stated against:
  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I was absent for rollcall No. 622 (on the 
passage of H.R. 2201). Had I been present, I would have voted ``no'' on 
this vote.


                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, due to a prior family 
obligation, I was unable to vote on the following four rollcall votes.
