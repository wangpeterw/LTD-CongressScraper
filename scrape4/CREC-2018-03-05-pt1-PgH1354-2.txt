         PINECREST, PALMETTO BAY, AND CUTLER BAY RELAY FOR LIFE

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
upcoming 2018 Pinecrest, Palmetto Bay, and Cutler Bay Relay for Life.
  On March 17, friends, families, neighbors, and community leaders from 
my congressional district will gather together to remember lost loved 
ones, to honor survivors, and to raise money for a cause that has 
affected too many in our community and around the Nation.

  Sadly, in 2018 alone, over 1.7 million Americans will be diagnosed 
with cancer and more than 600,000 individuals will lose the battle 
against this dreadful disease.
  That is why, Mr. Speaker, Relay for Life is such an important event 
to raise awareness and funds to help cancer patients and their families 
in my area of south Florida.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the countless volunteers and local 
sponsors who are going to make this wonderful day possible, a day 
filled with activities, games, and fun.
  Let us all join together to make a difference in the fight against 
cancer and make this year's Relay for Life the best one yet.
