                                 PRAYER

  Archbishop Hovnan Derderian, Western Diocese, Armenian Church of 
North America, Burbank, California, offered the following prayer:
  Almighty God, it is with a grateful and humble heart that I gaze upon 
You with supplications for lasting peace, prosperity, and commonweal 
for the great country of the United States, which so many people of 
diverse backgrounds proudly call home.
  As the spiritual leader of the Armenians on the West Coast, I bring 
the intercession of my flock, and I ask You O Lord to grant wisdom, 
compassion, and righteousness to all Congressmen and Congresswomen so 
that they may lead this country through the paths of justice, liberty, 
and equality.
  Compassionate God, forgive the sins of all Your servants and make 
them vessels of Your divine will so that in all their endeavors they 
may remember Your commandments and act according to the United States' 
national interests in defense of the country's sovereignty.
  This I ask in Your holy Name.
  Amen.
