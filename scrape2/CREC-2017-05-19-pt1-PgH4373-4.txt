                              {time}  1147

  So the bill was passed.
  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
  Stated against:
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, during rollcall Vote No. 268 on H.R. 1039, 
I mistakenly recorded my vote as ``yea'' when I should have voted 
``No.''
  Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, my vote did not register when I used my 
voting card. I have reported the malfunctioning card to the Clerk's 
office. Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 
268.


                          personal explanation

  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, circumstances have arisen, which caused me to 
return home to Oklahoma early; however, had I been present, I would 
have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 267 and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 268.


                          personal explanation

  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, I was unable to be 
present for votes on May 19, 2017. Had I been present, I would have 
voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 267 and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 268.


                          personal explanation

  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I missed votes on account of a 
family obligation in the district. Had I been present, I would have 
voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 267 and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 268.


                          personal explanation

  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to attend the vote series on May 
19, 2017. Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall 
No. 267 and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 268.


                          personal explanation

  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, May 19th 2017, I 
was not present for rollcall votes 267 and 268. If I had been present 
for these votes, I would have voted: ``Yea'' on rollcall vote 267 and 
``yea'' on rollcall vote 268.
