           SUPPORTING DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, 6 months ago, the White House shamefully 
rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program without 
having legislation in place to protect Dreamers. That is just wrong.
  The overwhelming majority of Americans support a pathway to 
citizenship for Dreamers, yet Republican leadership refuses to let 
Congress vote on a clean Dream Act.
  A few months ago, after ending DACA, the President began rolling back 
immigration from Black and Latino countries he thinks are s---holes. 
After that, he went on a Twitter rant to attack the Diversity Immigrant 
Visa program, which helps people from Africa immigrate lawfully to the 
United States.
  Eliminating DACA without a plan for Dreamers is just another 
antiminority move. Removing the Diversity Immigrant Visa program is 
more of the same. The administration has shown itself to be hostile to 
people of color. Mr. Speaker, racism is not a good policy.
