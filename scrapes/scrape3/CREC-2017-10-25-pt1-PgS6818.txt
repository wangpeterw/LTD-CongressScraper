                                 ______
                                 

   SENATE RESOLUTION 303--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF 
         OCTOBER 2017 AS ``NATIONAL AUDIOLOGY AWARENESS MONTH''

  Ms. WARREN (for herself, Mr. Grassley, and Ms. Hassan) submitted the 
following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions:

                              S. Res. 303

       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
     Prevention, hearing loss is the third most common chronic 
     physical condition in the United States;
       Whereas the National Institute on Deafness and Other 
     Communication Disorders and the Centers for Disease Control 
     and Prevention have found that 24 percent of adults in the 
     United States, or 40,000,000 individuals, may have noise-
     induced hearing loss in 1 or both ears;
       Whereas, although the prevalence of hearing loss increases 
     with age, approximately 40 percent of individuals with 
     hearing loss are under the age of 60;
       Whereas people with hearing difficulty frequently delay 
     seeking assessment and treatment for their hearing loss;
       Whereas audiologists, whose academic and clinical training 
     provides the foundation for patient management from birth 
     through adulthood, are dedicated health care professionals 
     who diagnose, treat, and manage hearing loss and balance 
     disorders;
       Whereas audiologists treat patients in many different 
     settings, including private practice, hospitals, schools, 
     Veterans Health Administration hospitals, and otolaryngology 
     offices;
       Whereas October 2017 would be an appropriate month to 
     designate as ``National Audiology Awareness Month''; and
       Whereas there is a need for greater awareness on the part 
     of the public regarding issues related to the hearing and 
     balance care provided by audiologists, including--
       (1) the diagnosis and treatment options available to the 
     public;
       (2) the research needs of audiologists; and
       (3) the public policy implications of changes in the field 
     of audiology: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the designation of October 2017 as ``National 
     Audiology Awareness Month''; and
       (2) applauds the actions of audiologists, including 
     clinicians, researchers, and others who strive to raise 
     public awareness of hearing and balance care by advancing the 
     profession of audiology.
