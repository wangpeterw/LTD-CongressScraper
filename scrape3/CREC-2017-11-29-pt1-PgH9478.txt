                              GUN VIOLENCE

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, 
as Americans across this country were enjoying Thanksgiving with their 
families, over 438 Americans were victims of gun violence.
  So what is the response of the House Republican leadership?
  Advancing the misguided Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act that would 
eviscerate State laws meant to keep people safe from gun violence.
  This bill being marked up today in the Judiciary Committee would put 
lives at risk by forcing all States to recognize weapon permits from 
other States, regardless of how lax State permitting laws may be.
  House Republicans have no right to curtail the safety reforms that 
New York and other States have put in place to protect their citizens. 
That is why law enforcement organizations from across the country 
strongly oppose this legislation. It should never come to the floor.
  Americans deserve a better deal and more protection from gun 
violence, not less.
