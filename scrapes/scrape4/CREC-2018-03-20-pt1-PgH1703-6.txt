                   HONORING THE LIFE OF LEW VANDERZYL

  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Lew 
Vanderzyl, a dedicated educator; a veteran; and a devoted father, 
grandfather, and great-grandfather, who passed away last month.
  Lew's lifetime of service included a deployment with the 40th 
Infantry Division during the Korean war, followed

by a half century as a teacher and administrator, and 17 years as a 
Riverside school board member.
  As school board president, Lew demonstrated his moral courage by 
insisting that a local high school be named after Martin Luther King, 
despite a wave of protests and intense opposition. He will be 
remembered by the Riverside community as someone who cared deeply for 
his students.
  Lew Vanderzyl, an avid reader, crossword puzzler, and traveler, and a 
constant source of wisdom and kindness, will be dearly missed by our 
community. May his memory be a blessing to the friends and family he 
leaves behind.
