                             APPROPRIATIONS

  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would like to review for the Senate the 
status of appropriations for fiscal year 2018.
  The Appropriations Committee has marked up 8 of the 12 regular 
appropriations bills for this fiscal year. The committee has also 
processed two supplemental appropriations bills and one continuing 
resolution.
  We have little time to finalize the regular appropriations bills and 
to consider additional supplemental appropriations requests for defense 
and for natural disaster recovery.
  We need a new budget deal to finish our work. Congress and the 
administration must reach agreement on acceptable top-line funding 
levels for defense and nondefense programs.
  At the funding cap currently in law, the Appropriations Committee 
would be hard-pressed to write a 2018 Defense bill that fully meets our 
national security needs or reflects the priorities of the Senate.
  The current continuing resolution expires on December 8. We cannot 
afford to extend that CR into next year.
  A budget agreement is necessary for the Senate to approve responsible 
appropriations legislation. I urge all parties to those negotiations to 
redouble their efforts to reach agreement.
