                            THE GOP TAX PLAN

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, the GOP tax plan is more than a bad deal 
for most working class and middle class Americans. It is a tax scam.
  Many families that will be hit the hardest by this tax plan are New 
Yorkers. It will cost New Yorkers a total of $17 billion, and they are 
my constituents. Repealing the State and local tax deduction, also 
known as SALT, is an assault on my constituents.
  My district will have the highest tax increases in the Nation without 
SALT. Mr. Speaker, repealing SALT means that 760,000 New Yorkers 
residing across the State will have their taxes increased.
  This is a bad deal for them and all Americans. This will mean an 
average of almost $5,000 for middle class families. Investing in 
education, firefighters, police services, and many other essential 
services keep our cities running. They are not an option. City services 
are not a luxury, and we should not be punishing taxpayers who pay for 
them.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this tax scam and 
negotiate a better deal.
