                           FIRST, DO NO HARM

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, those who support 
the GOP medical bill have forgotten one of the main and first 
principles of medical care: Do no harm.
  They said repeatedly that they would protect preexisting conditions. 
They said that they would protect accessible and affordable healthcare 
and premiums. But they must have been crossing their fingers when they 
said it because nothing is further from the truth.
  Under their latest bill, premiums will soar, particularly for the 
elderly. Women would have to, once again, worry about preexisting 
conditions, such as pregnancy.
  The defunding of Planned Parenthood would hurt many women, 
particularly low-income women.
  And the cuts to Medicare in the bill would be devastating to millions 
of women, seniors, children, and the disabled.
  In addition, the diminished subsidies could mean that more people 
than the 22 million in the last bill who were removed from healthcare 
under the bill will lose their healthcare.
  Vote ``no'' on this disastrous bill.
