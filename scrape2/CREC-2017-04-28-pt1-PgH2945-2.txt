                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Lead us 
this day in Your ways, that our Nation might be guided along the roads 
of peace, justice, and goodwill.
  Grant strength and wisdom to our Speaker, leaders, and Members of 
both the people's House and the Senate, to our President, his Cabinet, 
and to our Supreme Court.
  Bless as well the moral and military leaders of our country, and may 
those who are the captains of business, industry, and unions learn to 
work together toward the mutual benefit of all, walking in the ways of 
righteousness and working for the highest good of our beloved land.
  Bless us this day and every day, and may all that is done within the 
people's House be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
