                      BRING BACK ALL CHIBOK GIRLS

  (Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on May 6, Nigerian Government 
officials announced the release of 82 Chibok schoolgirls who have been 
held captive by Boko Haram since April 20, 2014. I couldn't believe it.
  It is truly, truly a reason for celebration, and I thank each and 
every Member of this House who has shown support for this extremely 
endless cause.
  Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled for the families whose daughters were 
among the 82 released, but we cannot forget that there are still 113 
waiting to be freed. Nigerian President Buhari has vowed to bring them 
all home.
  When we began this fight, the lives of more than 200 girls were at 
stake. Slowly but surely, we are making progress. The release of the 82 
underscores why we cannot give up. We have to keep pushing and 
pressing, doing everything we can to ensure that this fight doesn't end 
until the last girl has returned home.
  Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is Wear Something Red Wednesday, and I hope 
that this news will compel every Member of Congress to wear something 
red and show his or her support for the #bringbackourgirls movement.
  Women of Congress, wear your red scarf, a gift for Valentine's Day 
from Congresswoman Dingell. Men of Congress, wear a red tie, 
Republicans and Democrats, and tweet, tweet, tweet.
