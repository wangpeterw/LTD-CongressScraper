                      TRIBUTE TO MARY ANNE SCIUTO

  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize Mary Anne 
Sciuto for more than 38 years of service to the Federal Government. As 
Boston's first full-time congressional liaison, Mary Anne will retire 
at the end of March from her post as district congressional lead at 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' Boston district office.
  Mary Anne's expertise, combined with her eagerness to assist the 
people of Massachusetts, has been an invaluable resource to me and my 
staff. Throughout her venerated career, she has assisted countless 
immigrants and refugees and has made the difference for individuals and 
families who dream of making the United States their home. Though 
navigating our Nation's immigration system can be a long and 
complicated process, Mary Anne is widely known for her patience and 
compassion. She has continually provided my office with important 
advice and training to ensure that we best meet the needs of our 
constituents. While she will be sorely missed, her legacy of helping 
and mentoring so many during her long career will live on.
  My staff and I would like to extend our sincere gratitude to Mary 
Anne for her years of dedicated service and wish her well as she 
embarks on this next chapter in her life.
  Congratulations, Mary Anne, and thank you for the enormous 
contributions you have made to the community, the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, and the United States of America.
