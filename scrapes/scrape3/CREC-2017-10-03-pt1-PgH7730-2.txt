             HONORING THE VICTIMS OF THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTING

  (Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of one of my 
constituents, Michelle Vo, who lost her life in Sunday's mass shooting 
in Las Vegas.
  Michelle was described by her friends and family as an ambitious, 
hard worker, known for her charisma and fierce independence. She 
embodied the American Dream in every single way. Her middle name, My, 
means ``America'' in Vietnamese.
  Her mother emigrated from Vietnam and raised Michelle and her sisters 
near San Jose. Michelle would go on to graduate from UC Davis before 
moving to Eagle Rock, in my district, to work as an insurance agent in 
nearby Pasadena.

  My heart goes out to Michelle Vo, her family and friends, and the 
other victims of the Las Vegas shooting.
  I am heartbroken and angry about the events in Las Vegas. These 
incidents are far too common in our country, and it is my sincere hope 
that Congress takes action to lessen these types of tragic events.
