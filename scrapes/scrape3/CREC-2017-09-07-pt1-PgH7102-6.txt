                             LET'S FIX DACA

  (Mr. CONNOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, President Trump shielded Sheriff Joe 
Arpaio from a prison sentence for criminal contempt, despite Sheriff 
Arpaio's record of illegal racial profiling and abuse directed at 
immigrant communities.
  The President's latest salvo in his war on immigrants is his tragic 
decision to end the DACA program, which has given nearly 800,000 
innocent DREAMers, who want to be Americans, the opportunity to work 
and attend school.
  In my native State of Virginia, we have more than 12,000 DREAMers, 
who contribute more than $711 million to our GDP every year--that is 
contribute.
  These young, hardworking DREAMers, who see themselves as Americans, 
as do I, are contributing to our communities, creating jobs, serving in 
our military, teaching our children, and caring for our family members. 
President Trump would learn that if he ever sat down with them, as I 
have, and so many of my colleagues have, and broken bread with them, 
and listened to their fascinating, challenging, wonderful stories.
  Ending DACA is self-defeating, hurts the American economy, and 
neglects all that makes America unique. Let's fix this.
