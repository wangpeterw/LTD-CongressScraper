                     CONDEMNING BUREAUCRATS AT CFPB

  (Mr. HARRIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the out-of-control, 
President Obama-appointed bureaucrats over at the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau. The CFPB has always been notorious for its 
questionably illegal agenda, but the agency and its leadership crossed 
the line last week when its Director, Richard Cordray, resigned.
  Before he left, he attempted to circumvent the President's authority 
by illegally appointing another bureaucrat to replace him. But instead, 
President Trump, under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, 
appointed Mr. Mick Mulvaney to temporarily head the CFPB.
  Instead of allowing Mr. Mulvaney to fill the vacancy and get the CFPB 
working again, that bureaucrat, Leandra English, with the support of 
Mr. Cordray, tried to stage a coup against the President and Mr. 
Mulvaney by taking the President to court.
  Mr. Speaker, partisan career bureaucrats will do anything they can to 
discredit the President and block his policy agenda. This behavior is 
exactly why President Trump ran for office in the first place. We need 
to drain the swamp, and let's start with the CFPB.
  I applaud our judicial system for upholding the rule of law and 
confirming Mr. Mulvaney's right to lead the CFPB. We cannot allow petty 
partisan politics over at CFPB to obstruct our government's ability to 
govern.
