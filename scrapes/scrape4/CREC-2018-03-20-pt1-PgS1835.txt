                      NATIONAL STOP THE BLEED DAY

  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like to speak today about 
National Stop the Bleed Day.
  Our country will recognize National Stop the Bleed Day on March 31, 
2018. Stop the Bleed is a program offered by the American College of 
Surgeons to help educate the general public on techniques to assist 
victims suffering from uncontrolled bleeding using direct pressure, 
gauze and bandages, and tourniquets.
  Each year, more than 180,000 people die from traumatic injuries 
sustained as a result of events including vehicle crashes, falls, 
industrial and farm accidents, shootings, and natural disasters. The 
most common preventable cause of these deaths is losing too much blood 
in the minutes before trained responders arrive. Just like CPR 
training, a civilian familiar with basic bleeding control techniques is 
better equipped to save a life. The effort to make this training 
available to the public is driven by the goal to reduce or eliminate 
preventable death from bleeding.
  I urge my colleagues to join me and rise in support of National Stop 
the Bleed Day and help to end the loss of life from uncontrolled 
bleeding by getting trained to ``Stop the Bleed.''
