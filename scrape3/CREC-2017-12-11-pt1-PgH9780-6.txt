                            CALLING AN ANGEL

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, the Bible says angels come down from Heaven 
to end our pain.
  On December 9, 2006, God called an angel home to end our pain. Her 
name was Chelsey Campbell. She died of cancer at age 16.
  Our Lord put Chelsey in the hearts of two dear friends, Trish and 
Kevin Kline. They started the Snowdrop Foundation to end cancer for all 
kids. Kevin is a DJ on the 93Q Morning Zoo. Loyal listeners call Kevin 
``Gumpman.'' He is joined by two partners, Erica ``La Reina Hermosa'' 
Rico and Tim ``Knucklehead'' Tuttle.
  Every Christmas, 93Q partners with Snowdrop and the Texas Children's 
Hospital for a radiothon. All December, stories are aired on 
iHeartRadio from parents and kids who are fighting cancer.

  Please tune in. If you listen closely, you will hear Chelsey's voice 
and feel her heart.
