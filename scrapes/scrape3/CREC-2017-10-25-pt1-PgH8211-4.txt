                       WE NEED TO BAN BUMP STOCKS

  (Mrs. TORRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, it has been almost 1 month since the mass 
shooting in Las Vegas occurred; 58 dead, more than 500 injured, many 
from California--the deadliest shooting in our history.
  And here we are, 1 month later, and I am ashamed to say that this 
Congress has not taken a single action to prevent the next shooting.
  After the shooting, 64 Republicans signed a letter to ATF, asking ATF 
to regulate bump stocks. ATF just notified us that it could not act. It 
could not act. The ball is back in our court.
  Will those Members act now? Representative Cicilline has introduced a 
commonsense bill to ban bump stocks. If you signed the letter, you 
should cosponsor the bill. It is that simple. What are you waiting for?
  Mr. Speaker, there are some problems that we cannot solve, but this 
one is not one of those.
