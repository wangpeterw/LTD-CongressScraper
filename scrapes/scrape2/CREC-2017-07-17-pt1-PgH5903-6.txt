              PUTTING AMERICA'S HARDWORKING FAMILIES FIRST

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, over the Fourth of July district 
work period, I met with my constituents across Chicago's west and 
northwest suburbs. Despite the range of our groups and communities I 
spoke with, there was one theme that was on everybody's mind: the 
urgent need for Congress to take action that puts hardworking families 
first.
  Across the country, working families are counting on us to invest in 
infrastructure, modernize our Tax Code, and help their children get the 
skills necessary for rewarding careers.
  Earlier this summer, the House unanimously passed the Thompson-
Krishnamoorthi Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 
21st Century Act. This bipartisan legislation will modernize and expand 
career and technical education programs across the country by 
increasing funding and local control while expanding the cooperation 
that exists between educators and employers.
  The House has done its part to advance this legislation and support 
working families. Now the Senate must act and send it to the President 
for his signature.
