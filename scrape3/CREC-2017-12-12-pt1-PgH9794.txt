                     CONGRATULATING ANDREA SANCHEZ

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Yoho) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ms. Andrea 
Sanchez--and I am excited about this--from Gainesville, Florida, for 
winning our district's 2017 Congressional App Challenge. Her app, 
IVolunteer, solves a problem she saw in her school and helps students 
log their volunteer hours, as well as incentivizing community service 
by letting students compete against their peers to see who can log the 
most hours.
  Other submissions we received included an app that teaches students 
how to code and one designed to give people realtime information in 
natural disasters.
  These apps came from young students who recognized a problem they 
were facing and employed various

skills and creativity in designing and building their apps.
  Because of STEM education, students are not only learning critical 
technological skills that will serve them in the future, but they are 
creating the next generation of apps, software programs, and more--
possibly, the next IT company.
  Supporting STEM education gives our students an opportunity to become 
leaders in the field that positively impacts America and the world 
alike.
