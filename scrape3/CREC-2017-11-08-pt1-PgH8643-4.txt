                              VETERANS DAY

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday is Veterans Day, a day to 
reflect on the bravery and the commitment of our servicemembers and to

thank them for their dedication to our Nation.
  From the Greatest Generation who served in World War II to the 
veterans who traversed the harsh jungles of Vietnam, to the young 
people who took up the banner and persisted in the fight against 
terrorism in Afghanistan and in Iraq, we owe our veterans an endless 
debt of gratitude.
  It is our responsibility to provide for our servicemembers when they 
heed the call to serve, as well as to care for them when they return 
home.
  Mr. Speaker, we must fulfill our promises to our veterans and deliver 
on the promises, the benefits that they have earned. We need to make 
sure that we end veterans' homelessness. Whether it be ensuring timely 
access to quality healthcare, enabling the pursuit of educational 
opportunities, or providing the tools to start their own business, let 
us reaffirm to our veterans that they will have the support and the 
services that they need following their service.
  To all our veterans, thank you for your service. May God bless you, 
and may God continue to bless the United States of America.
