                     CELEBRATING LGBT EQUALITY DAY

  (Ms. DelBENE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate LGBT Equality 
Day. Today, we mark the anniversary of landmark victories at the 
Supreme Court that moved our country toward one that is more fair, more 
equal, and more inclusive of all Americans, and we are a better, 
stronger Nation for it.
  Each year, on June 26, we commemorate the decriminalization of loving 
LGBT couples, in overturning of the discriminatory Defense of Marriage 
Act, and now marriage equality in all 50 States.
  But even as we celebrate this incredible progress, we must never 
forget the work that remains.
  The LGBT community continues to face staggering rates of harassment 
and discrimination for who they are and who they love. I invite all my 
colleagues to stand with me on the right side of history. America is 
ready to take the next step forward.
  So today, let's recommit to breaking down the barriers that remain in 
fulfilling the American promise of liberty and justice for all.
