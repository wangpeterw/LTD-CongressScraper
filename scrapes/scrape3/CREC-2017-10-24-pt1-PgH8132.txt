       RESOLUTION TO COMMEMORATE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF RURAL WOMEN

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, on October 15, the world celebrated 
International Day of Rural Women and the invaluable global contribution 
of women farmers and small holders.
  To do our part in expressing solidarity, I rise to introduce this 
resolution to commemorate this very important day. According to the 
United Nations, rural women make up over one-quarter of the globe's 
total population and represent 43 percent of the agricultural 
workforce. They play a critical role in agricultural production, food 
security, and economic stability.
  Women serve as the bedrock of society. They feed the world's 
families. They feed our neighbors and our countrymen and -women. They 
are admirable role models for younger generations, and unfortunately, 
despite this, they still face many societal and economic limitations 
both here and abroad.
  This resolution shines a light on women farmers and seeks to empower 
them to succeed as entrepreneurs. It calls on the people of the United 
States and the world to recognize their critical contributions and to 
recommit to reducing barriers and limitations that heretofore have 
stunted their full progress. Let us plant the seeds of hope. I urge my 
colleagues to support this resolution.
