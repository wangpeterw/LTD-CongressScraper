                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Our Father in Heaven, we sing of Your steadfast love and proclaim 
Your faithfulness to all generations. Make us one Nation, truly wise, 
with righteousness exalting us in due season.
  Today, inspire our lawmakers to walk in the light of Your 
countenance. Abide with them so that Your wisdom will influence each 
decision they make as You restrain them from speaking in haste. Keep 
them from evil so that they will not be brought to grief, enabling them 
to avoid the pitfalls that lead to ruin. May they put country before 
self, people before politics, and patriotism before partisanship. 
Empower them to glorify You in all they say and do.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
