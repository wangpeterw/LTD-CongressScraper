                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  We ask Your blessing upon this assembly and upon all who call upon 
Your name. Send Your spirit to fill their hearts with those divine 
gifts You have prepared for them.
  May Your grace find expression in their compassion for the weak and 
the poor among us, and may Your mercy encourage good will in all they 
do and accomplish this day.
  As the Members of the people's House face the demands of our time, 
grant them and us all Your peace and strength that we might act justly, 
love tenderly, and walk humbly with You.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
