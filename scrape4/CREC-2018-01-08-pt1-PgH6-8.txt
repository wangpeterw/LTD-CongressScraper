  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the order of 
the House of January 3, 2017, providing for morning-hour debate be 
extended for the remainder of the 115th Congress, except that House 
Resolution 679 shall supplant House Resolution 9.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from California?
  There was no objection.
