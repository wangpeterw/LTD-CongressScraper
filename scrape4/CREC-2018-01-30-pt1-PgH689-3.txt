       RECOGNIZING THE EXTRAORDINARY YOUTH OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS

  (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize some 
extraordinary youth from the Virgin Islands.
  I want to start off by congratulating two distinguished scholars from 
my district, Rose Kleeger from Country Day High School, and Mansi 
Totwani from Antilles High School.
  Of the nearly 3.6 million high school seniors graduating this year, 
Rose and Mansi are among the 4,500 students named as candidates for the 
2018 Presidential Scholars Program.
  In the world of athletics, Alabama State sophomore and St. Croix 
native, Nia Jack, was fifth in the women's 60-meter dash at the Fred 
Wilt Invitational this week. In the same meet, fellow Crucian and 
Purdue sophomore, Myia Dorsey, ran fourth overall in the women's 400 
meters and led the winning women's 1,600-meter relay team.
  At the Arkansas State University Invitational, St. Croix' Malique 
Smith won his men's 400-meter heat in a season's best.
  Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate these scholars and athletes 
coming from the Virgin Islands. Despite the profound devastation of 
hurricanes this year which demolished our territory and the delay in 
funding to rebuild our islands, they are examples of the strength and 
resilience of Virgin Islanders to excel no matter what.
  I thank them for their excellence.
