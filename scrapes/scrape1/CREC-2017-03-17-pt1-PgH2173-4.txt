                        RECOGNIZING TODD ZOBRIST

  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Todd Zobrist, a 
paramedic with Highland EMS in Highland, Illinois.
  Yesterday afternoon, Todd was the first to arrive on the scene after 
receiving a call of a vehicle in Silver Lake with a person possibly 
inside. When he saw the vehicle partially submerged, he swam out in the 
cold water to search for anyone inside. He found an unresponsive baby 
boy, rescued him from the vehicle, and immediately began CPR on the 
roof of the vehicle. Todd was able to revive the 3-month-old at the 
scene and the baby was transported to a St. Louis hospital where he is 
expected to make a full recovery.
  I would like to commend Todd for his heroic and lifesaving actions. 
It is a great tribute to a southern Illinoisan.
