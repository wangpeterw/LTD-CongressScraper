                      WE ARE HERE TO FIX OBAMACARE

  (Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the ACA, ObamaCare, or 
whatever you want to characterize it as, is broken, and weare here to 
fix it. We want to empower patients. We want to bring health care back 
to the American people.
  Let me talk about access to insurance coverage. People have less 
access today to insurance coverage than at actually anytime in the 
past. Instead of competition to bring down and drive down insurance 
costs, one-third of the counties in the UnitedStates have only one 
choice of an insurance carrier, which is no choice at all. No 
competition. Insurance carriers are pullingout of the exchanges en 
masse, citing unsustainable costs because of ObamaCare.
  The American people are demanding change. Enough is enough. They want 
relief. They want competition. They want lower costs.They want better 
quality.
  We are here to fix ObamaCare and honor the promise to the American 
people to empower the patients of America to give themthe choice, the 
quality, and the cost control they so desperately need and that 
ObamaCare robbed them of.
