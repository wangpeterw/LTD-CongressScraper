            CONGRATULATIONS TO READING RED KNIGHTS' VICTORY

  (Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Reading 
High School men's basketball team on their first State championship in 
school history. The Red Knights finished their historic season with a 
30-3 record, and beat Pine-Richland 64-60 in the Class 6A Boys Final to 
bring a championship to the city of Reading.
  This is a group of outstanding young men led by senior guard and 
McDonald's All-American Lonnie Walker. This team is a staple in the 
Berks County community.
  Lonnie may have said it best himself after the championship victory: 
``What we did wasn't even about Reading High basketball. It was about 
the city of Reading. It was about the community, all the schools, the 
young kids we inspired. This is for them.''
  I couldn't be more proud today to represent these young men. I look 
forward to the continued success of this team, and I look forward to 
watching Lonnie continue his basketball career at the University of 
Miami.
  Congratulations to the Reading Red Knights team, the coaches, their 
families, the faculty, staff, and students that made this championship 
possible.
