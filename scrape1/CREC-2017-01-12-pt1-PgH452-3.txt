     INSUPPORT OF NOMINATION OF SECRETARY OF EDUCATION BETSY DeVOS

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, for too long, Washington has spent 
education dollars by building bureaucracy instead of byadvancing 
opportunities for our children.
  As a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I 
believe we must change the status quo and restore localcontrol in 
education. We need someone to lead the Department of Education and to 
work with Congress and leave decisionmaking inthe hands of parents and 
local communities, not in Washington. Betsy DeVos is that person.
  She has dedicated her life to fighting for children in Michigan. She 
has been a tireless advocate for giving familieschoices and for 
ensuring our kids have access to quality education, including in public 
schools, regardless of their Zip Codes.She has a heart for children and 
will be a champion for every student in America.
  I encourage the Senate to confirm her quickly so that, together, we 
can get to work on ensuring a high-quality education iswithin reach for 
every child.
