  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, as we continue work on NDAA, 
Democrats are committed to working with our Republican colleagues in a 
constructive and productive way to finish the legislation.
  The Senator from Arizona, the chairman of the committee, and the 
ranking member, the Senator from Rhode Island, have an outstanding 
working relationship that serves the body and the country well.
