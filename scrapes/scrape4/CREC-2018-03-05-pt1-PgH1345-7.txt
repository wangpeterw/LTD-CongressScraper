                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Brian Chrzastek, O.P., Dominican House of Studies, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  All powerful and ever-living God, thankful for the peace and security 
of our Nation, won by the many sacrifices of those who have gone before 
us, we continue to seek Your aid, those who serve our country in this 
Congress and all who assist them.
  We humbly ask that You strengthen them by Your grace. May they 
continue selflessly in the fulfillment of their duties. May they 
vigorously tend to the constituencies that they represent. May they be 
fair and attentive in their deliberations with their fellow 
representatives. And while mindful of particular interests, may they 
also seek to benefit all of this Nation and all of humanity itself.

[[Page H1346]]

  May all of us ever strive to realize the good whose possibility You 
call on us to trust, in what we see before us today and what awaits us 
tomorrow.
  Amen.
