RECOGNIZING MACKENZIE GORE AS 2016-17 GATORADE NORTH CAROLINA BASEBALL 
                           PLAYER OF THE YEAR

  (Mr. ROUZER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that North Carolina is 
home to many great student athletes that serve as community role 
models.
  One prime example is MacKenzie Gore, who graduated from Whiteville 
High School this month and has been named the 2017 Gatorade North 
Carolina Baseball Player of the Year. Not only that, he was just 
recently selected third overall in the Major League Baseball draft by 
the San Diego Padres.
  MacKenzie not only demonstrates athletic excellence, but also 
exemplary character and work ethic--the two primary traits necessary 
for great success. Very few have achieved as much as early in life. It 
is a culmination of years of hard work and commitment.
  As with all who are in success, MacKenzie is blessed to have a big 
decision to make: go pro and play for the Padres or head to East 
Carolina University to play for the Pirates. Whatever MacKenzie 
decides, we are all proud of him and wish him the very best.
