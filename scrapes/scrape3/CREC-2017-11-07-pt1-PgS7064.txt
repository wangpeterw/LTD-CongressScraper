  SENATE RESOLUTION 322--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF AMERICAN 
                             DIABETES MONTH

  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Brown, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. 
Coons, Mr. Donnelly, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. King, Ms. Klobuchar, 
Mr. Menendez, Mr. Peters, Mr. Rounds, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Warner) 
submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:

                              S. Res. 322

       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
     Prevention (referred to in this preamble as the ``CDC'')--
       (1) 30,300,000 individuals in the United States have 
     diabetes; and
       (2) an estimated 84,100,000 individuals in the United 
     States who are 20 years of age or older have prediabetes;
       Whereas diabetes is a serious chronic condition that 
     affects individuals of every age, race, ethnicity, and income 
     level;
       Whereas the CDC reports that--
       (1) Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, 
     and Native Americans are disproportionately affected by 
     diabetes and suffer from the disease at rates that are much 
     higher than those rates with respect to the general 
     population of the United States; and
       (2) 23.8 percent of individuals with diabetes in the United 
     States have not been diagnosed with the disease;
       Whereas, according to the CDC--
       (1) an individual who is 20 years of age or older is 
     diagnosed with diabetes every 21 seconds;
       (2) the prevalence of diabetes in the United States 
     increased more than threefold between 1990 and 2015; and
       (3) in the United States in 2015, diabetes was the seventh 
     leading cause of death and contributed to the deaths of more 
     than 252,806 individuals during that year;
       Whereas approximately 4,110 adults in the United States are 
     diagnosed with diabetes each day;
       Whereas the CDC estimates that approximately 1,500,000 
     adults in the United States were newly diagnosed with 
     diabetes in 2015;
       Whereas a joint study carried out by the National 
     Institutes of Health and the CDC found that, in the United 
     States during 2011 and 2012, an estimated 17,900 youths were 
     newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and 5,300 youths were 
     newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes;
       Whereas, in the United States, more than 12 percent of 
     adults and 25.2 percent of individuals who are 65 years of 
     age or older in the United States have diabetes;
       Whereas the risk of developing diabetes at some point in 
     life is 40 percent for adults in the United States;
       Whereas, after accounting for the difference of the average 
     age of each population, data surveying adults in the United 
     States between 2013 and 2015 indicates that--
       (1) 7.4 percent of non-Hispanic Whites, 12.7 percent of 
     non-Hispanic Blacks, 12.1 percent of Hispanics, and 8 percent 
     of Asian Americans suffer from diagnosed diabetes; and
       (2) with respect to Hispanic adults, 8.5 percent of 
     individuals of Central and South American descent, 9 percent 
     of individuals of Cuban descent, 13.8 percent of individuals 
     of Mexican descent, and 12 percent of individuals of Puerto 
     Rican descent suffer from diagnosed diabetes;
       Whereas, according to the American Diabetes Association, 
     the United States spent an estimated $245,000,000,000 on 
     cases of diagnosed diabetes in 2012;
       Whereas the American Diabetes Association reports that 20 
     percent of the money that the United States spent on health 
     care in 2012 went toward caring for individuals with 
     diabetes;
       Whereas a Mathematica Policy Research study found that 
     total expenditures for individuals with diabetes receiving 
     benefits under the Medicare program under title XVIII of the 
     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) in fiscal year 
     2005 comprised 32.7 percent of the budget for the Medicare 
     program in that fiscal year;
       Whereas a cure for diabetes does not exist, as of November 
     2017;
       Whereas there are successful means to reduce the incidence, 
     and delay the onset, of type 2 diabetes;
       Whereas, with proper management and treatment, individuals 
     with diabetes live healthy and productive lives; and
       Whereas individuals in the United States celebrate American 
     Diabetes Month in November: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the goals and ideals of American Diabetes 
     Month, including--
       (A) encouraging individuals in the United States to fight 
     diabetes through public awareness of prevention and treatment 
     options; and
       (B) enhancing diabetes education;
       (2) recognizes the importance of early detection, awareness 
     of the symptoms, and understanding the risk factors of 
     diabetes, including--

     and gestational diabetes in the United States through 
     increased research, treatment, and prevention.
