                        WELCOMING BRANDON MARTZ

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome Brandon Martz and 
his family from Jackson County to our Nation's Capitol.
  They are here with the help of the Dream Foundation, which fulfills 
dreams for terminally ill young people and adults. Brandon is 18 years 
old and has been battling Duchenne muscular dystrophy since he was a 
toddler.
  One of the things we talked about today in my office was the 21st 
Century Cures Act and the need to expedite the development of new cures 
by prioritizing medical research and streamlining the FDA approval 
process.
  Signed into law in December of last year, this landmark initiative 
will bring hope for patients and families suffering from some of the 
worst diseases and hopefully fulfill many dreams.
  Mr. Speaker, it was an honor to spend time with Brandon, his brother, 
and his parents today and play a part in helping Brandon's dream become 
a reality.
  I hope their time in Washington offers an opportunity to create many 
lasting memories together as a family and fulfill many dreams.
