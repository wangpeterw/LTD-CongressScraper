                        CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS

  (Mr. DENHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, this week, we will see on the floor the 
Championing Healthy Kids Act. It will include a number of different 
reforms, which will include the Children's Health Insurance Program, 
the CHAMPION Act, and my bill, the CARE Act.
  We must increase access throughout our communities across the 
country. By expanding our residency program, we will see new doctors, 
especially in these underserved areas. Expanding our residency program 
will allow our medical schools to have people in our communities 
practicing medicine, and, ultimately, filling this doctor shortage that 
we have today.
  I look forward to the passing of the Championing Healthy Kids Act, 
which will, again, help our children with their health insurance 
coverage and expand our residency program at a much-needed time.
