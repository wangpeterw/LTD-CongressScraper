                             A BETTER DEAL

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, Democrats unveiled A 
Better Deal for the American people. This is an economic agenda that 
will create 10 million good-paying, full-time jobs; raise pay; lower 
costs; and give workers the tools that they need to get ahead.
  A job is much more than just a paycheck. It is about knowing that 
your hard work is valued and honored. It is about being treated with 
the dignity and respect that every human being deserves. We don't have 
enough of that in this country today.
  People in my State and all across America feel like the system is 
completely stacked against them. And do you know what? They are right.
  Our Tax Code rewards companies that ship jobs overseas. Millionaires 
and billionaires don't pay their fair share. Corporate special 
interests spend secretly in our elections. It doesn't have to be this 
way; and with A Better Deal, it won't be this way.
  We are going to invest in our infrastructure, we are going to build a 
new manufacturing economy, double investments in apprenticeships, and 
we are going to make sure that working families are valued again.
  The American people have had enough broken promises to last them a 
lifetime, but Democrats are going to deliver real results to them with 
A Better Deal, better jobs, better wages, for a better future.
