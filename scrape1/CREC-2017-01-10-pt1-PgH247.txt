                     HONORING DR. PRISCILLA THOMAS

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. 
Priscilla Thomas, a commissioner in Chatham County, Georgia, a champion 
of our area's local youth and a Savannah native.
  In 1990, Dr. Thomas was first elected to serve as a commissioner in 
Chatham County. During her tenure, she became chairman pro tem and 
later the first minority and female vice chairman. However, long before 
she entered government, Dr. Thomas was already dedicated to creating 
more opportunities and better lives for young people.
  She worked as a principal at Haven Elementary School in Savannah 
after earning her Ph.D. in educational administration from the 
University of North America. When she was elected to serve as 
commissioner in 1990, she continued to use her passion for young people 
to provide entertaining and enlightening activities for them, including 
the Chatham County Youth Commission and the Summer Bonanza Partnership.
  On December 16, 2016, Dr. Thomas attended her final county commission 
meeting and retired from her 26 years as a Chatham County commissioner. 
She will always be remembered for being one of the toughest, fairest, 
and most well-informed members of our local government and for her 60 
years serving young people. She certainly will be missed.
