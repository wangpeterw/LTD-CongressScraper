                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Gary Studniewski, St. Peter's Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Heavenly Father, we praise You, we thank You--You, who not only 
govern human affairs, but who extend infinite compassion to the human 
family. We remember the mercy You have often granted to the sons and 
daughters of the United States of America, and we acknowledge how 
dependent we are on that mercy. We ask for Your mercy once again as You 
look upon so many who suffer in our land, devastated by storms of life, 
some natural and others of human origin.
  Lord, may Your saving hand be extended through people of goodwill 
across America, and may that goodwill begin here in the Chambers of 
this House, that our elected officials be filled with wisdom and 
compassion and work together to provide care and governance for all 
Your sons and daughters.
  Bless all who work and assemble in this House, and bless this session 
with Your Spirit, that it may result in much good fruit and lasting 
peace.
  Amen.
