                               OBAMACARE

  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today tobecause we made a promise 
to the American people, and we are going to keep it.
  ObamaCare is an unpopular and failed lawcollapsing under its own 
weight. Polls have shown it; rising premiums have proven it; and, in 
November, the voters said it loudand clear. It is time to repeal 
ObamaCare and replace it with more choices, lower costs, and real 
protections for patients.Already, we are working to end this damaging 
law and take control away from Federal bureaucrats and give it back to 
the peopleof this country.
  One year ago, we sent an ObamaCare repeal bill to the President's 
desk; but, not surprisingly, he vetoedit. In a few weeks, this Congress 
will again send a repeal bill to the President's desk. This time, we 
will have a President whowill sign it.
  Mr. Speaker, healthcare decisions should be made by patients and 
their doctors. American families should haveaccess to health insurance 
they can actually afford. That is why we will repeal ObamaCare and 
replace it with real reforms.
