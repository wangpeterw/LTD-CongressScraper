  SENATE RESOLUTION 182--DESIGNATING MAY 2017 AS ``MELANOMA AWARENESS 
                                MONTH''

  Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the 
following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 182

       Whereas, as of May 2017, there are nearly 1,000,000 people 
     living with melanoma in the United States;
       Whereas over 160,000 people of the United States will be 
     diagnosed with melanoma in 2017;
       Whereas melanoma is the second-most commonly diagnosed 
     cancer in young adults;
       Whereas approximately 90 percent of cases of melanoma can 
     be traced to exposure to ultraviolet rays;
       Whereas Congress enacted the Sunscreen Innovation Act 
     (Public Law 113-195) to help bring new, safe sunscreens to 
     the market;
       Whereas increasing intermittent sun exposure in childhood 
     and throughout the lifetime of a person is associated with an 
     increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell 
     carcinoma, and melanoma;
       Whereas 1 blistering sunburn during childhood or 
     adolescence can nearly double the chance that a person 
     develops melanoma later in life, while 5 or more blistering 
     sunburns in late adolescence increases the risk of--
       (1) melanoma by 80 percent; and
       (2) nonmelanoma by 68 percent; and

       Whereas research shows that wearing sunscreen and taking 
     other preventive measures can prevent sunburn and reduce the 
     risk of skin cancer and premature aging: Now, therefore, be 
     it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates May 2017 as ``Melanoma Awareness Month'';
       (2) supports the goals and ideals of Melanoma Awareness 
     Month;
       (3) continues to support research for the prevention, 
     detection, and treatment of, and a cure for, melanoma; and
       (4) supports efforts to promote awareness of, and education 
     on, sunsafe behaviors, including the use of sunscreen and 
     sun-protective clothing.
