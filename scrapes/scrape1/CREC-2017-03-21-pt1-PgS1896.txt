SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 10--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT 
    THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY SHOULD NAME THE NEXT NUCLEAR POWERED 
       SUBMARINE OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY THE ``USS LOS ALAMOS''

  Mr. HEINRICH (for himself and Mr. Udall) submitted the following 
concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed 
Services:

                            S. Con. Res. 10

       Whereas the people of Los Alamos and the Navy have a 74-
     year relationship that continues from the Manhattan Project 
     through the creation of a nuclear Navy and into the current 
     ocean-borne leg of the strategic nuclear triad of the United 
     States;
       Whereas the contributions of the people of Los Alamos and 
     surrounding communities allowed the Navy to keep its 
     offensive edge from World War II, through the Cold War, 
     continuing to the emerging conflicts as of the date of 
     adoption of this resolution;
       Whereas Captain ``Deke'' Parsons was one of the first 
     residents of Los Alamos and, along with Laureate Ramsey, 
     oversaw the safe delivery, assembly and loading of the 
     nuclear bomb that led to the surrender of Japan in World War 
     II;
       Whereas the people of Los Alamos and surrounding 
     communities played a critical role in designing the nuclear 
     portion of the first nuclear weapon to enter the arsenal of 
     the Navy, known as the Regulus, along with atomic depth 
     bombs, torpedoes, rockets, and even next generation weapon 
     systems like the B61-12 precision-guided nuclear bomb;
       Whereas the people of Los Alamos designed the warheads that 
     armed the first generation Trident submarine-launched 
     ballistic missiles of the Navy and the follow-on Trident II 
     missile warheads used by the Navy;
       Whereas the research into nuclear energy conducted by Los 
     Alamos during World War II advanced the technical basis for 
     the development of the nuclear propulsion systems of the Navy 
     used aboard Los Angeles, Seawolf, Ohio, and Virginia Class 
     submarines along with multiple naval aircraft carriers today;
       Whereas the people of Los Alamos and Los Alamos National 
     Laboratory host United States Naval Academy midshipmen every 
     year to provide hands-on scientific and engineering 
     experience working to solve real world challenges in national 
     security, thereby directly contributing to the development of 
     future Navy leadership;
       Whereas the people of Los Alamos carry the solemn 
     responsibility to assess the sea-based nuclear deterrent 
     carried aboard Navy fleet ballistic missile submarines;
       Whereas naming a submarine Los Alamos will recognize and 
     continue to forge the longstanding relationship between the 
     Navy and Los Alamos;
       Whereas the year 2018 will mark the 75th anniversary of Los 
     Alamos National Laboratory; and
       Whereas the distinctive service and contributions from the 
     people of Los Alamos to the Navy merits naming a vessel that 
     embodies the heritage, service, fidelity, and achievements of 
     the residents of Los Alamos and surrounding communities in 
     partnership with the United States Navy; Now, therefore, be 
     it
       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives 
     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the 
     Secretary of the Navy should name the next nuclear powered 
     submarine of the United States Navy as the ``USS Los 
     Alamos''.
